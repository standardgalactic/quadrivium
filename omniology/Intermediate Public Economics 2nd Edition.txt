Preface to Second Edition
We have been very pleased with the reception given to the ﬁrst edition of Intermediate
Public Economics. We wish to thank all our colleagues in universities across the world
who have adopted the book to support their teaching. Their helpful comments and
encouragement have provided the motivation to undertake this substantive revision.
The second edition of Intermediate Public Economic reﬂects recent developments in
the academic literature and in policy debate. New chapters are included on behavioral
economics, cost–beneﬁt analysis, economics of climate policy, and international taxa-
tion. A chapter has also been added on the limits to redistribution that complements the
existing chapters on commodity taxation and income taxation. The advice of numer-
ous users of the ﬁrst edition has resulted in many other parts of the book having been
improved by the expansion of some arguments and the clariﬁcation of others.
The book is written with the intention that it should be accessible to anyone with
a background of intermediate microeconomics and macroeconomics. The level and
quantity of mathematics is kept as low as possible without sacriﬁcing intellectual rigor,
but the book remains analytical rather than discursive. Some fairly abstract arguments
are included—particularly in the new chapter on redistribution—where it has been
judged that these make sufﬁciently important points that the extra burden imposed on
the reader will be amply rewarded.
Additional exercises have been added at the end of each chapter. Correspondingly, a
new Solutions Manual is available to accompany the book. Powerpoint slides for each
of the chapters are also available.
The list of people to whom we are indebted for directly or indirectly assisting with
the preparation of this book continues to grow. For assistance with the second edition
we wish to thank Nizar Allouch, Douglas Bernheim, Thierry Bréchet, James David-
son, Pascale Duran-Vigneron, Alessandro Ferrera, Christian Gollier, Roger Guesnerie,
Andreea Halunga, Nigar Hashimzade, Tatiana Kirsanova, Christos Kotsogiannis, Eti-
enne Lehmann, Cuong Le Van, Miguel-Angel Lopez-Garcia, Miltos Makris, François
Maniquet, Ross McKitrick, Sushama Murthy, Pierre Pestieau, Matthew Rablen, Em-
manuelle Taugourdeau, Henry Tulkens, Unal Zenginobuz, and the members of the
Mirrlees Review of the UK tax system.
We also want to thank again the people we thanked for the ﬁrst edition, many of
whom have also contributed to this edition: Paul Belleﬂamme, Tim Besley, Chuck

Jean notes that the chapter on behavioral economics has beneﬁted from the inspiring
lecturesgivenbyDouglasBernheimandVincentCrawfordatthe2011ECORESummer
School in Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium. He also wishes to thank his Master’s degree
students at UCL who tested several of the chapters. Gareth wishes to thank ATAX
(University of New South Wales), ENS Cachan, NYU in London, and Universitat
Autònoma de Barcelona for generous hospitality while parts of the book were written
and tested. He also wishes to thank the Association of Public Economic Theory for
providing such excellent conferences that make it possible to keep in touch with the
book’s users.
We observed in the Preface to the ﬁrst edition that Public Economics is about the
government and the economic effects of its policies. We should also observe that public
economics continually absorbs new ideas from other ﬁelds and uses these whenever
they can improve the understanding of policy. This book offers an extended insight into
what Public Economics says and what it can do. We hope that you enjoy it.

Preface to First Edition
This book has been prepared as the basis for a ﬁnal-year undergraduate or ﬁrst-year
graduate course in Public Economics. It is based on lectures given by the authors at
several institutions over many years. It covers the traditional topics of efﬁciency and
equity but also emphasizes more recent developments in information, games, and,
especially, political economy.
The book should be accessible to anyone with a background of intermediate microe-
conomics and macroeconomics. We have deliberately kept the quantity of math as low
as we could without sacriﬁcing intellectual rigor. Even so, the book remains analytical
rather than discursive.
To support the content, further reading is given for each chapter. This reading is
intended to offer a range of material from the classic papers in each area through recent
contributions to surveys and critiques. Exercises are included for each chapter. Most
of these should be possible for a good undergraduate but some may prove challenging.
There are many people who have contributed directly or indirectly to the prepara-
tion of this book. Nigar Hashimzade is entitled to special thanks for making incisive
comments on the entire text and for assisting with the analysis in chapters 11 and 24.
Thanks are also due to Paul Belleﬂamme, Tim Besley, Chuck Blackorby, Christopher
Bliss, Craig Brett, John Conley, Richard Cornes, Philippe De Donder, Sanjit Dhami,

PUBLIC ECONOMICS AND ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY


1
An Introduction to Public Economics
1.1
Public Economics
The study of public economics has a long tradition. It developed out of the original
political economy of John Stuart Mill and David Ricardo, through the public ﬁnance
tradition of tax analysis into public economics, and has now returned to its roots with
the development of the new political economy. From the inception of economics as a
scientiﬁc discipline, public economics has always been one of its core branches. The
explanation for why it has always been so central is the foundation that it provides for
practical policy analysis. This has always been the motivation of public economists,
even if the issues studied and the analytical methods employed have evolved over
time. We intend the theory described in this book to provide an organized and coherent
structure for addressing economic policy in a rigorous and coherent way.
In the broadest interpretation, public economics is the study of economic efﬁciency,
distribution, and government economic policy. The subject encompasses topics as
diverse as responses to market failure due to the existence of externalities, the motives
for tax evasion, and the explanation of bureaucratic decision-making. In order to reach
into all of these areas, public economics has developed from its initial narrow focus on
the collection and spending of government revenues to its present concern with every
aspect of government interaction with the economy.
Public economics attempts to understand both how the government makes decisions
andwhat decisionsitshouldmake. Tounderstandhowthegovernmentmakesdecisions,
it is necessary to investigate the motives of the decision makers within government,
how the decision makers are chosen, and how they are inﬂuenced by outside forces.
Determining what decisions should be made involves studying the effects of the al-
ternative policies that are available and evaluating the outcomes to which they lead.
These aspects are interwoven throughout the text. By pulling them together, this book
provides an accessible introduction to both of these aspects of public economics.
1.2
Methods
The feature that most characterizes modern public economics is the use made of eco-
nomic models. These models are employed as a tool to ensure that arguments are
conductedcoherentlywitharigorouslogicalbasis. Modelsareusedforanalysisbecause

4
Part I: Public Economics and Economic Efﬁciency
the possibilities for experimentation are limited and past experience cannot always be
relied on to provide a guide to the consequences of new policies. Each model is in-
tended to be a simpliﬁed description of the part of the economy that is relevant for the
analysis. What distinguishes economic models from those in the natural sciences is the
incorporation of independent decision-making by the ﬁrms, consumers, and politicians
that populate the economy. These actors in the economy do not respond mechanically
but are motivated by personal objectives and are strategic in their behavior. Capturing
the implications of this complex behavior in a convincing manner is one of the key
skills of a successful economic modeler.
Onceamodelhasbeenchosen, itsimplicationshavetobederived. Theseimplications
are obtained by applying logical arguments that proceed from the assumptions of the
model to a set of formally correct conclusions. Those conclusions then need to be
given an interpretation in terms that can be related to the original question of interest.
Policy recommendations can subsequently be derived but always with a recognition
of the limitations of the model. A careful line has to be drawn between conclusions
that are justiﬁable given the model and conclusions that go beyond what the model can
support.
The institutional setting for the study of public economics is invariably the mixed
economy where individual decisions are respected but the government attempts to af-
fect these through the policies it implements. Within this environment many alternative
objectives can be assigned to the government. For instance, the government can be as-
sumed to care about the aggregate level of welfare in the economy and to act selﬂessly
in attempting to increase this. Such a viewpoint is the foundation of optimal policy
analysis that inquires how the government should behave. But there can be no pre-
sumption that actual governments act in this way. An alternative, and sometimes more
compelling view, is that the government is composed of a set of individuals pursuing
their own selﬁsh agenda. Such a view provides a very different interpretation of the
actions of the government and often provides a foundation for understanding how gov-
ernments actually choose their policies. This perspective will also be considered in this
book.
The focus on the mixed economy makes the analysis applicable to most developed
and developing economies. It also permits the study of how the government behaves
and how it should behave. To provide a benchmark from which to judge the outcome
of the economy under alternative policies, the command economy with an omniscient
planner is often employed. This, of course, is just an analytical abstraction.

Chapter 1: An Introduction to Public Economics
1.3
Analyzing Policy
The method of policy analysis in public economics is to build a model of the economy
and to ﬁnd its equilibrium. Policy analysis is undertaken by tracing the effects of a
policy through the ways in which it changes the equilibrium of the economy relative
to some status quo. Alternative policies are contrasted by comparing the equilibria to
which they lead.
In conducting the assessment of policy, it is often helpful to emphasize the distinc-
tion between positive and normative analysis. The positive analysis of government
investigates topics such as why there is a public sector, where government objectives
emerge, and how government policies are chosen. It is also about understanding what
effects policies have on the economy. In contrast, normative analysis investigates what
the best policies are, and aims to provide a guide to good government. These are not
entirely disjoint activities. To proceed with a normative analysis, it is ﬁrst necessary to
conduct the positive analysis: it is not possible to say what is the best policy without
knowing the effects of alternative policies upon the economy. It could also be argued
that a positive analysis is of no value until used as part of a normative analysis of pol-
icy. Normative analysis is conducted under the assumption that the government has a
speciﬁed set of objectives and its action are chosen in the way that best achieves these.
Alternative policies (including the policy of laissez faire or, literally “leave to do”) are
compared by using the results of the positive analysis. The optimal policy is that which
best meets the government’s objective. Hence the equilibria for different policies are
determined and the government’s objective is evaluated for each equilibrium.
In every case restrictions are placed on the set of policies from which the government
may choose. These restrictions are usually intended to capture limits on the information
that the government has available. The information the government can obtain on the
consumers and ﬁrms in the economy restricts the degree of sophistication that policy
can have. For example, the extent to which taxes can be differentiated among different
taxpayersdependsontheinformationthegovernmentcanacquireabouteachindividual.
Administrative and compliance costs are also relevant in generating restrictions on
possible policies.
Whenthegovernment’sobjectiveistakentobesomeaggregatelevelofsocialwelfare
in the economy, important questions are raised as to how welfare can be measured. This
issue is discussed in some detail in a later chapter, but it can be noted here that the answer
involves invoking some degree of comparability between the welfare levels of different
individuals. It has been the willingness to proceed on the basis that such comparisons

Part I: Public Economics and Economic Efﬁciency
can be made that has allowed the development of public economics. While differences

justiﬁable to investigate what they would imply if they could be made. Furthermore
general principles can be established that apply to any degree of comparability.

Part I of the book, which includes this chapter, introduces public economics and pro-
vides a review of basic results that are used repeatedly in later chapters. The discussion
of the methodology of public economics has shown that a necessary starting point for
the development of the theory of policy analysis is an introduction to economic model-
ing. This represents the content of chapter 2 in which the basic model of a competitive
economy is introduced. The chapter describes the agents involved in the economy and
characterizes economic equilibrium. An emphasis is placed upon the assumptions on
which the analysis is based since much of the subject matter of public economics follows
from looking at how the government should respond if these are not satisﬁed. Having
established the basic model, the chapter then investigates the efﬁciency of the com-
petitive equilibrium. This leads into some fundamental results in welfare economics.
The analysis of competitive equilibrium is based on the standard assumption that in-
dividuals act rationally in their pursuit of narrow self-interest. This assumption has
been increasingly challenged by mounting evidence of observed behavior (so-called
anomalies) that is inconsistent with rationality and self-interest. The literature that ex-
plores these inconsistencies is typically called behavioral economics. The anomalies
raise important questions in many areas of economic policy, so a review of the most
relevant parts of behavioral economics is undertaken in chapter 3.
The analysis of government begins in part II. Chapter 4 provides an overview of
the public sector. It ﬁrst charts the historical growth of public sector expenditure over
the previous century and then reviews statistics on the present size of the public sector
in several of the major developed economies. The division of expenditure and the
composition of income are then considered. The level of public debt has recently
become an issue of major policy importance, so data are given to demonstrate the
increase in debt over time and its allocation across countries. Finally, issues involved
in measuring the size of the public sector are addressed. The issues raised by the
statistics of chapter 4 are addressed by the discussion of theories of the public sector in
chapter 5. Reasons for the existence of the public sector are considered, as are theories
that attempt to explain its growth. Apositive analysis of how the government may have

Chapter 1: An Introduction to Public Economics
its objectives and actions determined is undertaken. An emphasis is given to arguments
for why the observed size of government may be excessive.
The focus of part III is on the consequences of market failure. Chapter 6 introduces
public goods into the economy and contrasts the allocation that is achieved when
these are privately provided with the optimal allocation. Mechanisms for improving
the allocation are considered and methods of preference revelation are also addressed.
This is followed by an analysis of clubs and local public goods, which are special
cases of public goods in general, in chapter 7. The focus in this chapter returns to an
assessment of the success of market provision. The treatment of externalities in chapter
8 relaxes another of the assumptions. It is shown why market failure occurs when
externalities are present and reviews alternative policy schemes designed to improve
efﬁciency. Imperfect competition and its consequences for taxation is the subject of
chapter 9. The measurement of welfare loss is discussed and emphasis is given to the
incidence of taxation. A distinction is also drawn between the effects of speciﬁc and ad
valorem taxes. Symmetry of information between trading parties is required to sustain
efﬁciency. When it is absent, inefﬁciency can arise. The implications of informational
asymmetries and potential policy responses are considered in chapter 10.
Part IV provides an analysis of the public sector and its decision-making processes.
This can be seen as a dose of healthy scepticism before proceeding to the body of
normative analysis. An important practical method for making decisions and choosing
governments is voting. Chapter 11 analyzes the success of voting as a decision mech-
anism and the tactical and strategic issues it involves. The main results that emerge
are the Median Voter Theorem and the shortcomings of majority voting. These results
are then used to develop the analysis of political competition. The consequences of
rent-seeking are analyzed in chapter 12. The theory of rent-seeking provides an alter-
native perspective upon the policy-making process that is highly critical of the actions
of government.
Part III focuses on economic efﬁciency. Part V complements this by considering
issues of equity. Chapter 13 analyzes the policy implications of equity considerations
and addresses the important restrictions placed on government actions by limited in-
formation. Several other fundamental results in welfare economics are also developed
including the implications of alternative degrees of interpersonal comparability. Chap-
ter 14 considers the measurement of economic inequality and poverty. The economics
of these measures ultimately re-emphasizes the fundamental importance of utility the-
ory. The chapter also stresses the importance of the intergenerational transmission of
poverty.

Part I: Public Economics and Economic Efﬁciency
Part VI is concerned with taxation. It analyzes the basic tax instruments and the
economics of tax evasion. Chapters 15 and 16 consider commodity taxation and income
taxation, which are the two main taxes levied on consumers. In both of these chapters
the economic effects of the instruments are considered and rules for setting the taxes
optimally are derived. The results illustrate the resolution of the equity/efﬁciency trade-
off in the design of policy and the consequences of the limited information available
to the government. In addition to the theoretical analysis the results of application
of the methods to data are considered. The numerical results are useful, since the
theoretical analysis leads only to characterizations of optimal taxes rather than explicit
solutions. These chapters all assume that the taxes that are levied are paid honestly
and in full. This empirically doubtful assumption is corrected in chapter 17, which
looks at the extent of the hidden economy and analyzes the motives for tax evasion and
its consequences. The ﬁnal chapter of this section, chapter 18, adopts a very abstract
approach to investigate the question of whether restricting attention to mixed economies
limits what can be achieved by policy intervention. It provides the comforting result
that there is no allocation mechanism that can out-perform competitive trade with tax
intervention.
Part VII studies public economics when there is more than one decision-making
body. Chapter 19 on ﬁscal federalism addresses why there should be multiple levels
of government and discusses the optimal division of responsibilities between different
levels. The concept of tax competition is studied in chapter 20. It is shown how tax
competition can limit the success of delegating tax-setting powers to independent ju-
risdictions. The globalization of the world economy and the closer integration of the
European economies has emphasized the importance of the international dimension of
taxation. A range of issues involved in the design of tax systems in a globalized world
are reviewed in chapter 21.
Part VIII concentrates on intertemporal issues in public economics. Chapter 22 de-
scribes the overlapping generations economy that is the main analytical tool of this part.
The concept of the Golden Rule is introduced for economies with production and cap-
ital accumulation, and the potential for economic inefﬁciency is discussed. Chapter 23
analyzes social security policy and relates this to the potential inefﬁciency of the com-
petitive equilibrium. Both the motivation for the existence of social security programs
and the determination of the level of beneﬁts are addressed. Ricardian equivalence is
linked to the existence of gifts and bequests. This part is completed by chapter 24, which
considers the effects of taxation and public expenditure on economic growth. Alterna-
tive models of economic growth are introduced, and the evidence linking government
policy to the level of growth is discussed.

Chapter 1: An Introduction to Public Economics
The ﬁnal part of the book, part IX, considers two applications of the theory. The
discussion of cost–beneﬁt analysis in chapter 25 draws on many of the earlier results
to detail a methodology for evaluating when the implementation of a project—which
can be interpreted as any change in policy—will increase social welfare. Chapter 26
completes the book with a discussion of the economics of climate policy. The focus
in the chapter is on how the tools of public economics can be applied to policy in the
presence of pervasive uncertainty.

Scope
This book is essentially an introduction to the theory of public economics. It presents
a uniﬁed view of this theory and introduces the most signiﬁcant results of the analysis.
As such, it provides a broad review of what constitutes the present state of public
economics.
What will not be found in the book are many details of actual institutions for the
collection of taxes or discussion of existing tax codes and other economic policies,
although relevant data are used to illuminate arguments. There are several reasons
for this. This book is much broader than a text focusing on taxation, and to extend the
coverage in this way, something else has to be lost. Primarily, however, the book is about
understanding the effects of public policy and how economists think about the analysis
of policy. This should give an understanding of the consequences of existing policies,
and to beneﬁt from the discussion does not require detailed institutional knowledge.
Furthermore tax codes and tax law are country-speciﬁc, and pages spent discussing
in detail the rules of one particular country will have little value for those resident
elsewhere. In writing the book we wished it to appeal to as broad an audience as
possible. From this perspective, the method of reasoning and the analytical results
described here have value independent of country-speciﬁc detail. Finally there are
many alternative texts available that describe tax law and tax codes in detail. These are
usually written for accountants and lawyers and have a focus rather distinct from that
adopted by economists.

Equilibrium and Efﬁciency
2.1
Introduction
The link between competition and efﬁciency can be traced back, at least, to Adam
Smith’s eighteenth-century description of the working of the invisible hand. Smith’s
description of individually motivated decisions being coordinated to produce a socially
efﬁcient outcome is a powerful one that has found resonance in policy circles ever
since. The expression of the efﬁciency argument in the language of formal economics,
and the deeper understanding that comes with it, is a more recent innovation.
The focus of this chapter is to review what is meant by competition and to describe
equilibrium in a competitive economy. The model of competition combines indepen-
dent decision-making of consumers and ﬁrms into a complete model of the economy.
Equilibrium is shown to be achieved in the economy by prices adjusting to equate
demand and supply. Most important, the chapter employs the competitive model to
demonstrate the efﬁciency theorems.
Surprisingly, equilibrium prices can always be found that simultaneously equate
demand and supply for all goods. What is even more remarkable is that the equilibrium
so obtained also has properties of efﬁciency. Why this is remarkable is that individual
households and ﬁrms pursue their independent objectives with no concern other than
their own welfare. Even so, the ﬁnal state that emerges achieves efﬁciency solely
through the coordinating role played by prices.
2.2
Economic Models
Prior to starting the analysis, it is worth reﬂecting on why economists employ models
to make predictions about the effects of economic policies. Models are used essentially
because of problems of conducting experiments on economic systems and because the
system is too large and complex to analyze in its entirety. Moreover formal modeling
ensures that arguments are logically consistent with all the underlying assumptions
exposed.
The models used, while inevitably being simpliﬁcations of the real economy, are
designed to capture the essential aspects of the problem under study. Although many
different models will be studied in this book, there are important common features that
apply to all. Most models in public economics specify the objectives of the individual

14
Part I: Public Economics and Economic Efﬁciency
agents (e.g., ﬁrms and consumers) in the economy, and the constraints they face, and
then aggregate individual decisions to arrive at market demand and supply. The equi-
librium of the economy is next determined, and in a policy analysis the effects of
government choice variables on this are calculated. This is done with various degrees
of detail. Sometimes only a single market is studied—this is the case of partial equilib-
rium analysis. At other times general equilibrium analysis is used with many markets
analyzed simultaneously. Similarly the number of ﬁrms and consumers varies from one
or two to very many.
An essential consideration in the choice of the level of detail for a model is that
its equilibrium must demonstrate a dependence on policy that gives insight into the
functioning of the actual economy. On the one hand, if the model is too highly speciﬁed,
it may not be capable of capturing important forms of response. On the other hand, if it
is too general, it may not be able to provide any clear prediction. The theory described
in this book will show how this trade-off can be successfully resolved. Achieving a
successful compromise between these competing objectives is the “art” of economic
modeling.
2.3
Competitive Economies
The essential feature of competition is that the consumers and ﬁrms in the economy
do not consider their actions to have any effect on prices. Consequently, in making
decisions, they treat the prices they observe in the market place as ﬁxed (or parametric).
This assumption can be justiﬁed when all consumers and ﬁrms are truly negligible in
size relative to the market. In such a case the quantity traded by an individual consumer
or ﬁrm is not sufﬁcient to change the market price. But the assumption that the agents
view prices as parametric can also be imposed as a modeling tool, even in an economy
with a single consumer and a single ﬁrm.
This deﬁning characteristic of competition places a focus on the role of prices, as
is maintained throughout the chapter. Prices measure values and are the signals that
guide the decisions of ﬁrms and consumers. It was the exploration of what determined
the relative values of different goods and services that led to the formulation of the
competitive model. The adjustment of prices equates supply and demand to ensure that
equilibrium is achieved. The role of prices in coordinating the decisions of independent
economic agents is also crucial for the attainment of economic efﬁciency.
The secondary feature of the economies in this chapter is that all agents have access
to the same information, or in formal terminology, that information is symmetric. This

15
Chapter 2: Equilibrium and Efﬁciency
does not imply that there cannot be uncertainty, but only that when there is uncertainty,
all agents are equally uninformed. Put differently, no agent is permitted to have an
informational advantage. For example, by this assumption, the future proﬁt levels of
ﬁrms are allowed to be uncertain and shares in the ﬁrms to be traded on the basis of
individual assessments of future proﬁts. What the assumption does not allow is for
the directors of the ﬁrms to be better informed than other shareholders about future
prospects and to trade proﬁtably on the basis of this information advantage.
Two forms of the competitive model are introduced in this chapter. The ﬁrst form is
an exchange economy in which there is no production. Initial stocks of goods are held
by consumers and economic activity occurs through the trade of these stocks to mutual
advantage. The second form of competitive economy introduces production. This is
undertaken by ﬁrms with given production technologies who use inputs to produce
outputs and distribute their proﬁts as dividends to consumers.
2.4
The Exchange Economy
The exchange economy models the simplest form of economic activity: the trade of
commodities between two parties in order to obtain mutual advantage. Despite the
simplicity of this model, it is a surprisingly instructive tool for obtaining fundamental
insights about taxation and tax policy. This will become evident as we proceed. This
section presents a description of a two-consumer, two-good exchange economy. The
restriction on the number of goods and consumers does not alter any of the conclusions
that will be derived; they will all extend to larger numbers. What restricting the numbers
does is allow the economy to be displayed and analyzed in a simple diagram.
Each of the two consumers has an initial stock, or endowment, of the economy’s two
goods. The endowments can be interpreted literally as stocks of goods, or less literally
as human capital, and are the quantities that are available for trade. Given the absence
of production, these quantities remain constant. The consumers exchange quantities
of the two commodities in order to achieve consumption plans that are preferred to
their initial endowments. The rate at which one commodity can be exchanged for
the other is given by the market prices. Both consumers believe that their behavior
cannot affect these prices. This is the fundamental assumption of competitive price-
taking behavior. More will be said about the validity and interpretation of this in
section 2.6.
Aconsumer is described by their endowments and their preferences. The endowment
of consumer h is denoted by ωh =

ωh
1, ωh
2

, where ωh
i ≥0 is h’s initial stock of good i.

When prices are p1 and p2, a consumption plan for consumer h, xh =

affordable if it satisﬁes the budget constraint
p1xh
1 + p2xh
2 = p1ωh

2.
(2.1)
The preferences of each consumer are described by their utility function. This func-
tion should be seen as a representation of the consumer’s indifference curves and does
not imply any comparability of utility levels between consumers—the issue of com-
parability is taken up in chapter 13. The utility function for consumer h is denoted by
Uh = Uh
xh
1 , xh
2

.
(2.2)
It is assumed that the consumers enjoy the goods (so the marginal utility of consumption
is positive for both goods) and that the indifference curves have the standard convex
shape.
This economy can be pictured in a simple diagram that allows the role of prices in
achieving equilibrium to be explored. The diagram is constructed by noting that the
total consumption of the two consumers must equal the available stock of the goods,
where the stock is determined by the endowments. Any pair of consumption plans
that satisﬁes this requirement is called a feasible plan for the economy. A plan for the
economy is feasible if the consumption levels can be met from the endowments, so that

i = 1, 2.
(2.3)
The consumption plans satisfying (2.3) can be represented as points in a rectangle with
sides of length ω1
1 + ω2
1 and ω1
2 + ω2
2. In this rectangle the southwest corner can be
treated as the zero consumption point for consumer 1 and the northeast corner as the
zero consumption point for consumer 2. The consumption of good 1 for consumer 1 is
then measured horizontally from the southwest corner and for consumer 2 horizontally
from the northeast corner. Measurements for good 2 are made vertically.
The diagram constructed in this way is called an Edgeworth box and a typical box
is shown in ﬁgure 2.1. It should be noted that the method of construction results in the
endowment point, marked ω, being the initial endowment point for both consumers.
The Edgeworth box is completed by adding the preferences and budget constraints of
the consumers. The indifference curves of consumer 1 are drawn relative to the south-
west corner and those of consumer 2 relative to the northeast corner. From (2.1) it can
be seen that the budget constraint for both consumers must pass through the endowment
point, since consumers can always afford their endowment. The endowment point is

common to both consumers, so a single budget line through the endowment point with
gradient −p1
p2 captures the market opportunities of the two consumers. Thus, viewed
from the southwest, it is the budget line of consumer 1, and viewed from the north-
east, the budget line of consumer 2. Given the budget line determined by the prices p1
and p2, the utility-maximizing choices for the two consumers are characterized by the
standard tangency condition between the highest attainable indifference curve and the
budget line. This is illustrated in ﬁgure 2.2, where x1 denotes the choice of consumer
1 and x2 that of 2.
At an equilibrium of the economy, supply is equal to demand. This is assumed to be
achieved via the adjustment of prices. The prices at which supply is equal to demand
are called equilibrium prices. How such prices are arrived at will be discussed later. For
the present the focus will be placed on the nature of equilibrium and its properties. The
consumer choices shown in ﬁgure 2.2 do not constitute an equilibrium for the economy.
This can be seen by summing the demands and comparing these to the level of the
endowments. Doing this shows that the demand for good 1 exceeds the endowment
but the demand for good 2 falls short. To achieve an equilibrium position, the relative
prices of the goods must change. An increase in the relative price of good 1 raises
the absolute value of the gradient −p1/p2 of the budget line, making the budget line
steeper. It becomes ﬂatter if the relative price of good 1 falls. At all prices the budget

line continues to pass through the endowment point so that a change in relative prices
sees the line pivot about the endowment point.
The effect of a relative price change on the budget constraint is shown in ﬁgure 2.3.
In the ﬁgure the price of good 1 has increased relative to the price of good 2. This causes
the budget constraint to pivot upward around the endowment point. As a consequence
of this change the consumers will now select consumption plans on this new budget
constraint.
The dependence of the consumption levels on prices is summarized in the consumers’
demand functions. Taking the prices as given, the consumers choose their consumption
plans to reach the highest attainable utility level subject to their budget constraints. The
level of demand for good i from consumer h is xh
i = xh
i (p1, p2). Using the demand
functions, we see that demand is equal to supply for the economy when the prices are
such that

i (p1, p2) + x2
i (p1, p2) = ω1
i + ω2
i ,
i = 1, 2.
(2.4)
A study of the Edgeworth box shows that an equilibrium is achieved when the prices
lead to a budget line on which the indifference curves of the consumers have a point of
common tangency. Such an equilibrium is shown in ﬁgure 2.4.
Having illustrated an equilibrium, we raise the question of whether an equilibrium
is guaranteed to exist. As it happens, under reasonable assumptions, it will always do
so. More important for public economics is the issue of whether the equilibrium has
any desirable features from a welfare perspective. This is discussed in depth in section
2.6 where the Edgeworth box is put to substantial use.

Equilibrium
Two further points now need to be made that are important for understanding the
functioning of the model. These concern the number of prices that can be determined
and the number of independent equilibrium equations. In the equilibrium conditions
(2.4) there are two equations to be satisﬁed by the two equilibrium prices. It is now
argued that the model can determine only the ratio of prices and not the actual prices.
Accepting this, it would seem that there is one price ratio attempting to solve two
equations. If this were the case, a solution would be unlikely, and we would be in the
position of having a model that generally did not have an equilibrium. This situation is
resolved by noting that the relationship between the two equilibrium conditions ensures
that there is only one independent equation. The single price ratio then has to be solved
by a single equation, making it possible for there to be always a solution.

20
Part I: Public Economics and Economic Efﬁciency
The ﬁrst point is developed by observing that the budget constraint always passes
through the endowment point and its gradient is determined by the price ratio. The
consequence of this is that only the value of p1 relative to p2 matters in determining
demands and supplies rather than the absolute values. The economic explanation for
this fact is that consumers are only concerned with the real purchasing power embodied
in their endowment, and not with the level of prices. Since their nominal income is equal
to the value of the endowment, any change in the level of prices raises nominal income
just as much as it raises the cost of purchases. This leaves real incomes unchanged.
The fact that only relative prices matter is also reﬂected in the demand functions.
If xh
i (p1, p2) is the level of demand at prices p1 and p2, then it must be the case that
xh
i (p1, p2) = xh
i (λp1, λp2) for λ > 0. A demand function having this property is
said to be homogeneous of degree 0. In terms of what can be learned from the model,
the homogeneity shows that only relative prices can be determined at equilibrium and
not the level of prices. So, given a set of equilibrium prices, any scaling up or down
of these prices will also be equilibrium prices because the change will not alter the
level of demand. This is as it should be, since all that matters for the consumers is
the rate at which they can exchange one commodity for another, and this is measured
by the relative prices. This can be seen in the Edgeworth box. The budget constraint
always goes through the endowment point so only its gradient can change, and this is
determined by the relative prices.
In order to analyze the model, the indeterminacy of the level of prices needs to be
removed. This is achieved by adopting a price normalization, which is simply a method
of ﬁxing a scale for prices. There are numerous ways to do this. The simplest way is
to select a commodity as the numéraire, which means that its price is ﬁxed at one,
and measure all other prices relative to this. The numéraire chosen in this way can be
thought of as the unit of account for the economy. This is the role usually played by
money but, formally, there is no money in this economy.
The second point is to demonstrate the dependence between the two equilibrium
equations. It can be seen that at the disequilibrium position shown in ﬁgure 2.2, the
demand for good 1 exceeds its supply whereas the supply of good 2 exceeds demand.
Considering other budget lines and indifference curves in the Edgeworth box will show
that whenever there is an excess of demand for one good, there is a corresponding
deﬁcit of demand for the other. There is actually a very precise relationship between
the excess and the deﬁcit that can be captured in the following way: The level of
excess demand for good i is the difference between demand and supply and is deﬁned
by Zi = x1
i + x2

where the second equality is a consequence of the budget constraints in (2.1). The
relationship in (2.5) is known asWalras’s law and states that the value of excess demand
is zero. This must hold for any set of prices, so it provides a connection between the
extent of disequilibrium and prices. In essence, Walras’s law is simply an aggregate
budget constraint for the economy. Since all consumers are equating their expenditure
to their income, so must the economy as a whole.
Walras’s law implies that the equilibrium equations are interdependent. Since p1Z1+
p2Z2 = 0, if Z1 = 0, then Z2 = 0 (and vice versa). That is, if demand is equal
to supply for good 1, then demand must also equal supply for good 2. Equilibrium
in one market necessarily implies equilibrium in the other. This observation allows
the construction of a useful diagram to illustrate equilibrium. Choose good 1 as the
numéraire (so p1 = 1) and plot the excess demand for good 2 as a function of p2. The
equilibrium for the economy is then found where the graph of excess demand crosses
the horizontal axis. At this point excess demand for good 2 is zero, so by Walras’s law,
it must also be zero for good 1. An excess demand function is illustrated in ﬁgure 2.5
for an economy that has three equilibria. This excess demand function demonstrates
Z2(1, p2)
p2
Figure 2.5
Equilibrium and excess demand

22
Part I: Public Economics and Economic Efﬁciency
why at least one equilibrium will exist. As p2 falls toward zero, demand will exceed
supply (good 2 becomes increasingly attractive to purchase), making excess demand
positive. Conversely, as the price of good 2 rises, it will become increasingly attractive
to sell, resulting in a negative value of excess demand for high values of p2. Since
excess demand is positive for small values of p2 and negative for high values, there
must be at least one point in between where it is zero.
Finally, it should be noted that the arguments made above can be extended to include
additional consumers and additional goods. Income, in terms of an endowment of many
goods, and expenditure, deﬁned in the same way, must remain equal for each consumer.
The demand functions that result from the maximization of utility are homogeneous of
degree zero in prices. Walras’s law continues to hold, so the value of excess demand
remains zero. The number of price ratios and the number of independent equilibrium
conditions are always one less than the number of goods.
2.5
Production and Exchange
The addition of production to the exchange economy provides a complete model of
economic activity. Such an economy allows a wealth of detail to be included. Some
goods can be present as initial endowments (e.g., labor); others can be consumption
goods produced from the initial endowments, while some goods, intermediates, can
be produced by one productive process and used as inputs into another. The fully
developed model of competition is called the Arrow–Debreu economy in honor of its
original constructors.
An economy with production consists of consumers (or households) and producers
(or ﬁrms). The ﬁrms use inputs to produce outputs with the intention of maximizing
their proﬁts. Each ﬁrm has available a production technology that describes the ways in
which it can use inputs to produce outputs. The consumers have preferences and initial
endowments as they did in the exchange economy, but they now also hold shares in the
ﬁrms. The ﬁrms’proﬁts are distributed as dividends in proportion to the shareholdings.
The consumers receive income from the sale of their initial endowments (e.g., their
labor time) and from the dividend payments.
Each ﬁrm is characterized by its production set, which summarizes the production
technology it has available. A production technology can be thought of as a complete
list of ways that the ﬁrm can turn inputs into outputs. In other words, it catalogs all
the production methods of which the ﬁrm has knowledge. For ﬁrm j operating in an
economy with two goods a typical production set, denoted Y j, is illustrated in ﬁgure 2.6.

Figure 2.6
Typical production set
This ﬁgure employs the standard convention of measuring inputs as negative numbers
and outputs as positive. The reason for adopting this convention is that the use of a unit
of a good as an input represents a subtraction from the stock of that good available for
consumption.
Considertheﬁrmshowninﬁgure2.6choosingtheproductionplanyj
1 = −2, yj
2 = 3.
When faced with prices p1 = 2, p2 = 2, the ﬁrm’s proﬁt is
πj = p1yj
1 + p2yj
2 = 2 × (−2) + 2 × 3 = 2.
(2.6)
The positive part of this sum can be given the interpretation of sales revenue, and
the negative part that of production costs. This is equivalent to writing proﬁt as the
differencebetweenrevenueandcost. Writteninthisway, (2.6)givesasimpleexpression
of the relation between prices and production choices.
The process of proﬁt maximization is illustrated in ﬁgure 2.7. Under the competitive
assumption the ﬁrm takes the prices p1 and p2 as given. These prices are used to
construct isoproﬁt curves, which show all production plans that give a speciﬁc level
of proﬁt. For example, all the production plans on the isoproﬁt curve labeled π = 0
will lead to a proﬁt level of 0. Production plans on higher isoproﬁt curves lead to
progressively larger proﬁts, and those on lower curves to negative proﬁts. Since doing
nothing (which means choosing yj
1 = yj
2 = 0) earns zero proﬁt, the π = 0 isoproﬁt curve
always passes through the origin.
The proﬁt-maximizing ﬁrm will choose a production plan that places it upon the high-
est attainable isoproﬁt curve. What restricts the choice is the technology that is available
as described by the production set. In ﬁgure 2.7 the production plan that maximizes

proﬁt is shown by y∗, which is located at a point of tangency between the highest attain-
able isoproﬁt curve and the production set. There is no other technologically feasible
plan that can attain higher proﬁt.
Itshouldbenotedhowtheisoproﬁtcurvesaredeterminedbytheprices. Thegeometry
in fact is that the isoproﬁt curves are at right angles to the price vector. The angle of
the price vector is determined by the price ratio, p2
p1 , so a change in relative prices will
alter the gradient of the isoproﬁt curves. The ﬁgure can be used to predict the effect
of relative price changes. For instance, if p1 increases relative to p2, which can be
interpreted as the price of the input (good 1) rising in comparison to the price of the
output (good 2), then the price vector becomes ﬂatter. This makes the isoproﬁt curves
steeper, so the optimal choice must move round the boundary of the production set
toward the origin. The use of input and the production of output both fall.
Now consider an economy with n goods. The price of good i is denoted pi. Production
is carried out by m ﬁrms. Each ﬁrm uses inputs to produce outputs and maximizes proﬁts
given the market prices. Demand comes from the H consumers in the economy. They
aim to maximize their utility. The total supply of each good is the sum of the production
of it by ﬁrms and the initial endowment of it held by the consumers.
Each ﬁrm chooses a production plan yj =

yj
1, . . . , yj

. This production plan is
chosen to maximize proﬁts subject to the constraint that the chosen plan must be in
the production set. From this maximization can be determined ﬁrm j’s supply function
for good i as yj
i = yj
i (p), where p = (p1, . . . , pn). The level of proﬁt is πj =
	n
i=1 piyj
i (p) = πj(p), which also depends on prices.

25
Chapter 2: Equilibrium and Efﬁciency
Aggregate supply from the production sector of the economy is obtained from the
supply decisions of the individual ﬁrms by summing across the ﬁrms. This gives the
aggregate supply of good i as
Yi(p) =
m

j=1
yj
i (p) .
(2.7)
Since some goods must be inputs, and others outputs, aggregate supply can be positive
(the total activity of the ﬁrms adds to the stock of the good) or negative (the total activity
of the ﬁrms subtracts from the stock).
Each consumer has an initial endowment of commodities and also a set of sharehold-
ings in ﬁrms. The latter assumption makes this a private ownership economy in which
the means of production are ultimately owned by individuals. In the present version
of the model, these shareholdings are exogenously given and remain ﬁxed. A more
developed version would introduce a stock market and allow them to be traded. For
consumer h the initial endowment is denoted ωh and the shareholding in ﬁrm j is θh
j .
The ﬁrms must be fully owned by the consumers, so 	H
h=1 θh
j = 1. That is, the shares
in the ﬁrms must sum to one. Consumer h chooses a consumption plan xh to maximize

This budget constraint requires that the value of expenditure be not more than the
value of the endowment plus income received as dividends from ﬁrms. Since ﬁrms
always have the option of going out of business (and hence earning zero proﬁt), the
dividend income must be nonnegative. The proﬁt level of each ﬁrm is dependent on
prices. A change in prices therefore affects a consumer’s budget constraint through a
change in the value of their endowment and through a change in dividend income. The
maximization of utility by the consumer results in demand for good i from consumer
h of the form xh
i = xh
i (p). The level of aggregate demand is found by summing the

26
Part I: Public Economics and Economic Efﬁciency
The same notion of equilibrium that was used for the exchange economy can be
applied in this economy with production. That is, equilibrium occurs when supply is
equal to demand. The distinction between the two is that supply, which was ﬁxed in
the exchange economy, is now variable and dependent on the production decisions
of ﬁrms. Although this adds a further dimension to the question of the existence of
equilibrium, the basic argument why such an equilibrium always exists is essentially
the same as that for the exchange economy.
As already noted, the equilibrium of the economy occurs when demand is equal to
supply or, equivalently, when excess demand is zero. Excess demand for good i, Zi (p),
can be deﬁned by
Zi (p) = Xi (p) −Yi (p) −
H

h=1
ωh
i .
(2.10)
Here excess demand is the difference between demand and the sum of initial endowment
and ﬁrms’ supply. The equilibrium occurs when Zi (p) = 0 for all of the goods i =
1, . . . , n. There are standard theorems that prove such an equilibrium must exist under
fairly weak conditions.
The properties established for the exchange economy also apply to this economy
with production. Demand is determined only by relative prices (so it is homogeneous
of degree zero). Supply is also determined by relative prices. Together, these imply that
excess demand is homogeneous of degree zero. To determine the equilibrium prices
that equate supply to demand, a normalization must again be used. Typically one of
the goods will be chosen as numéraire, and its price set to one. Equilibrium prices are
then those that equate excess demand to zero.
2.6
Efﬁciency of Competition
Economics is often deﬁned as the study of scarcity. This viewpoint is reﬂected in the
concern with the efﬁcient use of resources that runs throughout the core of the sub-
ject. Efﬁciency would seem to be a simple concept to characterize: if more cannot be
achieved, then the outcome is efﬁcient. This is certainly the case when an individual
decision maker is considered. The individual will employ their resources to maximize
utility subject to the constraints they face. When utility is maximized, the efﬁcient
outcome has been achieved.
Problems arise when there is more than one decision maker. To be unambiguous
about efﬁciency, it is necessary to resolve the potentially competing needs of different

27
Chapter 2: Equilibrium and Efﬁciency
decision makers. This requires efﬁciency to be deﬁned with respect to a set of aggregate
preferences. Methods of progressing from individual to aggregate preferences will be
discussed in chapters 11 and 13. The conclusions obtained there are that the determi-
nation of aggregate preferences is not a simple task. There are two routes we can use
to navigate around this difﬁculty. The ﬁrst is to look at a single-consumer economy
so that there is no conﬂict between competing preferences. But with more than one
consumer some creativity has to be used to describe efﬁciency. The second route is
met in section 2.6.2 where the concept of Pareto-efﬁciency is introduced. The trouble
with such creativity is that it leaves the deﬁnition of efﬁciency open to debate. We will
postpone further discussion of this until chapter 13.
Before we proceed further, some deﬁnitions are needed. A ﬁrst-best outcome is
achieved when only the production technology and the limited endowments restrict the
choice of the decision maker. The ﬁrst-best is essentially what would be chosen by an
omniscient planner with complete command over resources. A second-best outcome
arises whenever constraints other than technology and resources are placed on what the
planner can do. Such constraints could be limits on income redistribution, an inability
to remove monopoly power, or a lack of information.
2.6.1
Single Consumer
With a single consumer there is no doubt as to what is good and bad from a social
perspective: the single individual’s preferences can be taken as the social preferences.
To do otherwise would be to deny the validity of the consumer’s judgments. Hence, if
the individual prefers one outcome to another, then so must society. The unambiguous
nature of preferences provides signiﬁcant simpliﬁcation of the discussion of efﬁciency
in the single-consumer economy. In this case the “best” outcome must be ﬁrst-best
because no constraints on policy choices have been invoked nor is there an issue of
income distribution to consider.
If there is a single ﬁrm and a single consumer, the economy with production can
be illustrated in a helpful diagram. This is constructed by superimposing the proﬁt-
maximization diagram for the ﬁrm over the choice diagram for the consumer. Such a
model is often called the Robinson Crusoe economy. The interpretation is that Robinson
acts as a ﬁrm carrying out production and as a consumer of the product of the ﬁrm. It is
then possible to think of Robinson as a social planner who can coordinate the activities
of the ﬁrm and producer. It is also possible (though in this case less compelling!) to
think of Robinson as having a split personality and acting as a proﬁt-maximizing ﬁrm
on one side of the market and as a utility-maximizing consumer on the other. In the

28
Part I: Public Economics and Economic Efﬁciency
latter interpretation the two sides of Robinson’s personality are reconciled through the
prices on the competitive markets. The important fact is that these two interpretations
lead to exactly the same levels of production and consumption.
The budget constraint of the consumer needs to include the dividend received from
the ﬁrm. With two goods, the budget constraint is
p1[x1 −ω1] + p2[x2 −ω2] = π,
(2.11)
or
p1
x1 + p2
x2 = π,
(2.12)
where
xi, the change from the endowment point, is the net consumption of good i. This
is illustrated in ﬁgure 2.8 with good 2 chosen as the numéraire. The budget constraint
(2.12) is always at a right angle to the price vector and is displaced above the origin by
the value of proﬁt. Utility maximization occurs where the highest indifference curve is
reached given the budget constraint. This results in net consumption plan 
x∗.
The equilibrium for the economy is shown in ﬁgure 2.9, which superimposes ﬁgure
2.7 onto 2.8. At the equilibrium the net consumption plan from the consumer must
match the supply from the ﬁrm. The feature that makes this diagram work is the fact
that the consumer receives the entire proﬁt of the ﬁrm, so the budget constraint and the
isoproﬁt curve are one and the same. The height above the origin of both is the level

of proﬁt earned by the ﬁrm and received by the consumer. Equilibrium can only arise
when the point on the economy’s production set that equates to proﬁt maximization is
the same as that of utility maximization. This is point 
x∗= y∗in ﬁgure 2.9.
It should be noted that the equilibrium is on the boundary of the production set so
that it is efﬁcient: it is not possible for a better outcome to be found in which more
is produced with the same level of input. This captures the efﬁciency of production
at the competitive equilibrium, about which much more is said soon. The equilibrium
is also the ﬁrst-best outcome for the single-consumer economy, since it achieves the
highest indifference curve possible subject to the restriction that it is feasible under the
technology. This is illustrated in ﬁgure 2.9 where 
x∗is the net level of consumption
relative to the endowment point in the ﬁrst-best and at the competitive equilibrium.
A simple characterization of this ﬁrst-best allocation can be given by using the fact
that it is at a tangency point between two curves. The gradient of the indifference
curve is equal to the ratio of the marginal utilities of the two goods and is called the
marginal rate of substitution. This measures the rate at which good 1 can be traded for
good 2 while maintaining constant utility. The marginal rate of substitution is given by
MRS1,2 = U1
U2 , with subscripts used to denote the marginal utilities of the two goods.
Similarly the gradient of the production possibility set is termed the marginal rate of
transformation and denoted MRT1,2. The MRT1,2 measures the rate at which good 1
has to be given up to allow an increase in production of good 2. At the tangency point
the two gradients are equal, so

30
Part I: Public Economics and Economic Efﬁciency
MRS1,2 = MRT1,2.
(2.13)
The reason why this equality characterizes the ﬁrst-best equilibrium can be explained
as follows: The MRS captures the marginal value of good 1 to the consumer relative
to the marginal value of good 2, while the MRT measures the marginal cost of good
1 relative to the marginal cost of good 2. The ﬁrst-best is achieved when the marginal
value is equal to the marginal cost.
The market achieves efﬁciency through the coordinating role of prices. The consumer
maximizes utility subject to their budget constraint. The optimal choice occurs when
the budget constraint is tangential to the highest attainable indifference curve. The
condition describing this is that ratio of marginal utilities is equal to the ratio of prices.
Expressed in terms of the MRS, this is
MRS1,2 = p1
p2
.
(2.14)
Similarly proﬁt maximization by the ﬁrm occurs when the production possibility
set is tangential to the highest isoproﬁt curve. Using the MRT, we write the proﬁt-
maximization condition as
MRT1,2 = p1
p2
.
(2.15)
Combining these conditions, we ﬁnd that the competitive equilibrium satisﬁes
MRS1,2 = p1
p2
= MRT1,2.
(2.16)
The condition in (2.16) demonstrates that the competitive equilibrium satisﬁes the same
condition as the ﬁrst-best and reveals the essential role of prices. By the competitive as-
sumption, both the consumer and the producer are guided in their decisions by the same
price ratio. Each optimizes relative to the price ratio; hence their decisions are mutually
efﬁcient.
There is one special case that is worth noting before moving on. When the ﬁrm
has constant returns to scale, the efﬁcient production frontier is a straight line through
the origin. The only equilibrium can be when the ﬁrm makes zero proﬁts. If proﬁt was
positive at some output level, then the constant returns to scale allows the ﬁrm to double
proﬁt by doubling output. Since this argument can be repeated, there is no limit to the
proﬁt that the ﬁrm can make. Hence we have the claim that equilibrium proﬁt must be
zero. Now the isoproﬁt curve at zero proﬁt is also a straight line through the origin.

Constant returns to scale
The zero-proﬁt equilibrium can only arise when this is coincident with the efﬁcient
production frontier. At this equilibrium the price vector is at right angles to both the
isoproﬁt curve and the production frontier. This is illustrated in ﬁgure 2.10.
There are two further implications of constant returns. First, the equilibrium price
ratio is determined by the zero-proﬁt condition alone and is independent of demand.
Second, the proﬁt income of the consumer is zero, so the consumer’s budget constraint
also passes through the origin. As this is determined by the same prices as the isoproﬁt
curve, the budget constraint must be coincident with the production frontier.
In this single-consumer context the equilibrium reached by the market simply can-
not be bettered. Such a strong statement cannot be made when more consumers are
introduced because issues of distribution among consumers then arise. However, what
will remain is the ﬁnding that the competitive market ensures that ﬁrms produce at
an efﬁcient point on the frontier of the production set and that the chosen production
plan is what is demanded at the equilibrium prices by the consumers. The key to this
coordination are the prices that provide the signals guiding choices.
2.6.2
Pareto-Efﬁciency
When there is more than one consumer, the simple analysis of the Robinson Crusoe
economy does not apply. Since consumers can have differing views about the success
of an allocation, there is no single, simple measure of efﬁciency. The essence of the

32
Part I: Public Economics and Economic Efﬁciency
problem is that of judging among allocations with different distributional properties.
What is needed is some process that can take account of the potentially diverse views
of the consumers and separate efﬁciency from distribution.
To achieve this, economists employ the concept of Pareto-efﬁciency. The philos-
ophy behind this concept is to interpret efﬁciency as meaning that there must be no
unexploited economic gains. Testing the efﬁciency of an allocation then involves check-
ing whether there are any such gains available. More speciﬁcally, Pareto-efﬁciency
judges an allocation by considering whether it is possible to undertake a reallocation
of resources that can beneﬁt at least one consumer without harming any other. If it
is possible to do so, then there will exist unexploited gains. When no improving re-
allocation can be found, then the initial position is deemed to be Pareto-efﬁcient. An
allocation that satisﬁes this test can be viewed as having achieved an efﬁcient dis-
tribution of resources. For the present chapter this concept will be used uncritically.
The interpretations and limitations of this form of efﬁciency will be discussed in
chapter 13.
To provide a precise statement of Pareto-efﬁciency that applies in a competitive
economy, it is ﬁrst necessary to extend the idea of feasible allocations of resources
that was used in (2.3) to deﬁne the Edgeworth box. When production is included,
an allocation of consumption is feasible if it can be produced given the economy’s
initial endowments and production technology. Given the initial endowment, ω, the
consumption allocation x is feasible if there is production plan y such that
x = y + ω.
(2.17)
Pareto-efﬁciency is then tested using the feasible allocations. A precise deﬁnition
follows.
Deﬁnition 2.1
A feasible consumption allocation ˆx is Pareto-efﬁcient if there does
not exist an alternative feasible allocation x such that:
i. allocation x gives all consumers at least as much utility as ˆx, and
ii. allocation x gives at least one consumer more utility than ˆx.
These two conditions can be summarized as saying that allocation ˆx is Pareto efﬁcient
if there is no alternative allocation (a move from ˆx to x) that can make someone better
off without making anyone worse off. It is this idea of being able to make someone better
off without making someone else worse off that represents the unexploited economic
gains in an inefﬁcient position.

33
Chapter 2: Equilibrium and Efﬁciency
It should be noted even at this stage how Pareto-efﬁciency is deﬁned by the negative
property of being unable to ﬁnd anything better than the allocation. This is somewhat
different from a deﬁnition of efﬁciency that looks for some positive property of the
allocation. Pareto-efﬁciency also sidesteps issues of distribution rather than confronting
them. This is why it works with many consumers. More will be said about this in chapter
13 when the construction of social welfare indicators is discussed.
2.6.3
Efﬁciency in an Exchange Economy
The welfare properties of the economy, which are commonly known as the Two The-
orems of Welfare Economics, are the basis for claims concerning the desirability of
the competitive outcome. In brief, the First Theorem states that a competitive equilib-
rium is Pareto-efﬁcient and the Second Theorem that any Pareto-efﬁcient allocation
can be decentralized as a competitive equilibrium. Taken together, they have signiﬁ-
cant implications for policy and, at face value, seem to make a compelling case for the
encouragement of competition.
The Two Theorems are easily demonstrated for a two-consumer exchange economy
by using the Edgeworth box diagram. The ﬁrst step is to isolate the Pareto-efﬁcient
allocations. Consider ﬁgure 2.11 and the allocation at point a. To show that a is not a
Pareto-efﬁcient allocation, it is necessary to ﬁnd an alternative allocation that gives at
least one of the consumers a higher utility level and neither consumer a lower level.
In this case, moving to the allocation at point b raises the utility of both consumers
when compared to point a—we say in such a case that b is Pareto-preferred to a. This
2
a

1
Figure 2.11
Pareto-efﬁciency

34
Part I: Public Economics and Economic Efﬁciency
establishes that a is not Pareto-efﬁcient. Although b improves on a, it is not Pareto-
efﬁcient either: the allocation at c provides higher utility for both consumers than b.
The allocation at c is Pareto-efﬁcient. Beginning at c, any change in the allocation
must lower the utility of at least one of the consumers. The special property of point c is
that it lies at a point of tangency between the indifference curves of the two consumers.
As it is a point of tangency, moving away from it must lead to a lower indifference
curve for one of the consumers if not both. Since the indifference curves are tangential,
their gradients are equal, so
MRS1
1,2 = MRS2
1,2.
(2.18)
This equality ensures that the rate at which consumer 1 will want to exchange good 1
for good 2 is equal to the rate at which consumer 2 will want to exchange the two goods.
It is this equality of the marginal valuations of the two consumers at the tangency point
that results in there being no further unexploited gains and so makes c Pareto efﬁcient.
The Pareto-efﬁcient allocation at c is not unique. There are in fact many points of
tangency between the two consumers’ indifference curves. A second Pareto-efﬁcient
allocation is at point d in ﬁgure 2.11. Taken together, all the Pareto-efﬁcient allocations
form a locus in the Edgeworth box that is called the contract curve. This is illustrated in
ﬁgure 2.12. With this construction it is now possible to demonstrate the First Theorem.
A competitive equilibrium is given by a price line through the initial endowment
point, ω, that is tangential to both indifference curves at the same point. The common
point of tangency results in consumer choices that lead to the equilibrium levels of
demand. Such an equilibrium is indicated by point e in ﬁgure 2.12. As the equilibrium
2
e
Contract curve

Figure 2.12
The First Theorem

35
Chapter 2: Equilibrium and Efﬁciency
is a point of tangency of indifference curves, it must also be Pareto-efﬁcient. For the
Edgeworth box, this completes the demonstration that a competitive equilibrium is
Pareto-efﬁcient.
The alternative way of seeing this result is to recall that each consumer maximizes
utility at the point where their budget constraint is tangential to the highest indifference
curve. Using the MRS, we can write this condition for consumer h as MRSh
1,2 = p1/p2.
The competitive assumption is that both consumers react to the same set of prices, so
it follows that
MRS1
1,2 = p1
p2
= MRS2
1,2.
(2.19)
Comparing this condition with (2.18) provides an alternative demonstration that the
competitive equilibrium is Pareto-efﬁcient. It also shows again the role of prices
in coordinating the independent decisions of different economic agents to ensure
efﬁciency.
This discussion can be summarized in the precise statement of the theorem.
Theorem 2.2
(FirstTheorem ofWelfare Economics)
The allocation of commodities
at a competitive equilibrium is Pareto-efﬁcient.
This theorem can be formally proved by assuming that the competitive equilibrium is
not Pareto-efﬁcient and by then deriving a contradiction.Assuming that the competitive
equilibrium is not Pareto-efﬁcient implies that there is a feasible alternative that is at
least as good for all consumers and strictly better for at least one. Now take the consumer
who is made strictly better off. Why did that consumer not choose the alternative
consumption plan at the competitive equilibrium? The answer has to be because it
was more expensive than the choice at the competitive equilibrium and not affordable
with that consumer’s budget. Similarly for all other consumers the new allocation has
to be at least as expensive as their choice at the competitive equilibrium. (If it were
cheaper, they could afford an even better consumption plan that made them strictly
better off than at the competitive equilibrium.) Summing across the consumers, the
alternative allocation has to be strictly more expensive than the competitive allocation.
But the value of consumption at the competitive equilibrium must equal the value of the
endowment. Therefore the new allocation must have greater value than the endowment,
which implies it cannot be feasible. This contradiction establishes that the competitive
equilibrium must be Pareto-efﬁcient.

The theorem demonstrates that the competitive equilibrium is Pareto-efﬁcient, but
it is not the only Pareto-efﬁcient allocation. Referring back to ﬁgure 2.12, we have
that any point on the contract curve is also Pareto-efﬁcient because all are deﬁned by
a tangency between indifference curves. The only special feature of e is that it is the
allocation reached through competitive trading from the initial endowment point ω. If
ω were different, then another Pareto-efﬁcient allocation would be achieved. There is
in fact an inﬁnity of Pareto-efﬁcient allocations. Observing these points motivates the
Second Theorem of Welfare Economics.
The Second Theorem is concerned with whether any chosen Pareto-efﬁcient alloca-
tion can be made into a competitive equilibrium by choosing a suitable location for the
initial endowment. Expressed differently, can a competitive economy be constructed
that has a selected Pareto-efﬁcient allocation as its competitive equilibrium? In the
Edgeworth box this involves being able to choose any point on the contract curve and
turning it into a competitive equilibrium.
From the Edgeworth box diagram it can be seen that this is possible in the exchange
economy if the households’indifference curves are convex. The common tangent to the
indifference curves at the Pareto-efﬁcient allocation provides the budget constraint that
each consumer must face if they are to afford the chosen point. The convexity ensures
that given this budget line, the Pareto-efﬁcient point will also be the optimal choice of
the consumers. The construction is completed by choosing a point on this budget line
as the initial endowment point. This process of constructing a competitive economy to
obtain a selected Pareto-efﬁcient allocation is termed decentralization.

Chapter 2: Equilibrium and Efﬁciency
trading by consumers will take the economy to its equilibrium allocation e′. This is the
Pareto-efﬁcient allocation that was intended to be reached. Note that if the endowments
of the households are initially given by ω and the equilibrium at e′ is to be decentralized,
it is necessary to redistribute the initial endowments of the consumers in order to begin
from ω′.
The construction described above can be given a formal statement as the Second
Theorem of Welfare Economics.
Theorem 2.3
(Second Theorem of Welfare Economics)
With convex preferences,
any Pareto-efﬁcient allocation can be made a competitive equilibrium.
The statement of the Second Theorem provides a conclusion but does not describe
the mechanism involved in the decentralization. The important step in decentralizing a
chosen Pareto-efﬁcient allocation is placing the economy at the correct starting point.
For now it is sufﬁcient to observe that behind the Second Theorem lies a process of
redistribution of initial wealth. How this can be achieved is discussed later. Furthermore
the Second Theorem determines a set of prices that make the chosen allocation an
equilibrium. These prices may well be very different from those that would have been
obtained in the absence of the wealth redistribution.
2.6.4
Extension to Production
The extension of the Two Theorems to an economy with production is straightforward.
The major effect of production is to make supply variable: it is now the sum of the
initial endowment plus the net outputs of the ﬁrms. In addition a consumer’s income
includes the proﬁt derived from their shareholdings in ﬁrms.
Section 2.6.1 has already demonstrated efﬁciency for the Robinson Crusoe economy
that included production. It was shown that the competitive equilibrium achieved the
highest attainable indifference curve given the production possibilities of the economy.
Since the single consumer cannot be made better off by any change, the equilibrium
is Pareto-efﬁcient and the First Theorem applies. The Second Theorem is of limited
interest with a single consumer because there is only one Pareto-efﬁcient allocation,
and this is attained by the competitive economy.
When there is more than one consumer, the proof of the First Theorem follows the
same lines as for the exchange economy. Given the equilibrium prices, each consumer
is maximizing utility, so each consumer’s marginal rate of substitution is equated to the

38
Part I: Public Economics and Economic Efﬁciency
same price ratio. This is true for all consumers and all goods, yielding
MRSh
i,j = pi
pj
= MRSh′
i,j
(2.20)
for any pair of consumers h and h′ and any pair of goods i and j. This is termed ef-
ﬁciency in consumption. In an economy with production this condition alone is not
sufﬁcient to guarantee efﬁciency; it is also necessary to consider production. The
proﬁt-maximization decision of each ﬁrm ensures that it equates its marginal rate of
transformation between any two goods to the ratio of prices. For any two ﬁrms m and m′,
MRTm
i,j = pi
pj
= MRTm′
i,j,
(2.21)
a condition that characterizes efﬁciency in production. The price ratio also coordinates
consumers and ﬁrms, giving the top-level condition
MRSh
i,j = MRTm
i,j
(2.22)
for any consumer and any ﬁrm for all pairs of goods. As for the Robinson Crusoe
economy, the interpretation of this condition is that it equates the relative marginal
values to the relative marginal costs. Since (2.20) through (2.22) are the conditions
required for efﬁciency, this shows that the First Theorem extends to the economy with
production.
The formal proof of this claim mirrors that for the exchange economy, except for
the fact that the value of production must also be taken into account. Given this fact,
the basis of the argument remains that since the consumers chose the competitive
equilibrium quantities, anything that is preferred must be more expensive and hence
can be shown not to be feasible.
The extension of the Second Theorem to include production is illustrated in
ﬁgure 2.14. The set W describes the feasible output plans for the economy, with each
point w in W being the sum of a production plan and the initial endowment; hence
w = y+ω. Set Z describes the quantities of the two goods that would allow a Pareto im-
provement(are-allocationthatmakesneitherconsumerworseoffandmakesonestrictly
betteroff)overtheallocation ˆx1 toconsumer1and ˆx2 toconsumer2. IfW andZ arecon-
vex, which occurs when ﬁrms’production sets and preferences are convex, then a com-
mon tangent to W and Z can be found. This makes ˆx an equilibrium. Individual income
allocations, the sum of the value of endowment plus proﬁt income, can be placed any-
where on the budget lines tangent to the indifference curves at the individual allocations

ˆx1 and ˆx2 provided that they sum to the total income of the economy. This decentralizes
the consumption allocation ˆx1, ˆx2.
Before proceeding further, it is worth emphasizing that the proof of the Second The-
orem requires more assumptions than the proof of the First, so there may be situations
in which the First Theorem is applicable but the Second is not. The Second Theorem
requires that a common tangent be found, which relies on preferences and production
sets being convex. A competitive equilibrium can exist with some nonconvexity in the
production sets of the individual ﬁrms or the preferences of the consumers, so the First
Theorem will apply but the Second Theorem will not apply.
2.7
Lump-Sum Taxation
The discussion of the Second Theorem noted that it does not describe the mechanism
through which the decentralization is achieved. It is instead implicit in the statement
of the theorem that the consumers are given sufﬁcient income to purchase the con-
sumption plans forming the Pareto-efﬁcient allocation. Any practical value of the
Second Theorem depends on the government being able to allocate the required income
levels. The way in which the theorem sees this as being done is by making what are
called lump-sum transfers between consumers.

40
Part I: Public Economics and Economic Efﬁciency
Atransfer is deﬁned as lump sum if no change in a consumer’s behavior can affect the
size of the transfer. For example, a consumer choosing to work less hard or reducing
the consumption of a commodity must not be able to affect the size of the transfer.
This differentiates a lump-sum transfer from other taxes, such as income or commodity
taxes, for which changes in behavior do affect the value of the tax payment. Lump-
sum transfers have a very special role in the theoretical analysis of public economics
because, as we will show, they are the idealized redistributive instrument.
The lump-sum transfers envisaged by the Second Theorem involve quantities of
endowments and shares being transferred among consumers to ensure the necessary
income levels. Some consumers would gain from the transfers; others would lose.
Although the value of the transfer cannot be changed, lump-sum transfers do affect
consumers’ behavior because their incomes are either reduced or increased by the
transfers—the transfers have an income effect but do not lead to a substitution effect
between commodities. Without recourse to such transfers, the decentralization of the
selected allocation would not be possible.
The illustration of the Second Theorem in an exchange economy in ﬁgure 2.15 makes
clear the role and nature of lump-sum transfers. The initial endowment point is denoted
ω, and this is the starting point for the economy. It we assume that the Pareto-efﬁcient
allocation at point e is to be decentralized, then the income levels have to be modiﬁed
to achieve the new budget constraint. At the initial point the income level of h is ˆpωh
when evaluated at the equilibrium prices ˆp. The value of the transfer to consumer h that
is necessary to achieve the new budget constraint is Mh −ˆpωh = ˆp ˆxh −ˆpωh. One
2

Figure 2.15

41
Chapter 2: Equilibrium and Efﬁciency
way of ensuring this is to transfer a quantity
x1
1 of good 1 from consumer 1 to consumer
2. But any transfer of commodities with the same value would work equally well.
There is a problem, though, if we attempt to interpret the model this literally. For most
people, income is earned almost entirely from the sale of labor so that their endowment
is simply lifetime labor supply. This makes it impossible to transfer the endowment
since one person’s labor cannot be given to another. Responding to such difﬁculties
leads to the reformulation of lump-sum transfers in terms of lump-sum taxes. Suppose
that the two consumers both sell their entire endowments at prices ˆp. This generates
incomes ˆpω1 and ˆpω2 for the two consumers. Now make consumer 1 pay a tax of
amount T 1 = ˆp
x1
1 and give this tax revenue to consumer 2. Consumer 2 therefore
pays a negative tax (or, in simpler terms, receives a subsidy) of T 2 = −ˆp
x1
1 = −T 1.
The pair of taxes

T 1, T 2
moves the budget constraint in exactly the same way as the
lump-sum transfer of endowment. The pair of taxes and the transfer of endowment are
therefore economically equivalent and have the same effect on the economy. The taxes
are also lump sum because they are determined without reference to either consumers’
behavior and their values cannot be affected by any change in behavior.
Lump-sum taxes have a central role in public economics due to their success in
achieving distributional objectives. It should be clear from the discussion above that
the economy’s total endowment is not reduced by the application of the lump-sum taxes.
This point applies to lump-sum taxes in general. As households cannot affect the level
of the tax by changing their behavior, lump-sum taxes do not lead to any distortions in
choice. There are also no resources lost due to the imposition of lump-sum taxes, so
redistribution is achieved with no efﬁciency cost. In short, if they can be employed in
the manner described they are the perfect taxes.
2.8
Discussion of Assumptions
The description of the competitive economy introduced a number of assumptions con-
cerning the economic environment and how trade was conducted. These are important
since they bear directly on the efﬁciency properties of competition. The interpretation
and limitation of these assumptions is now discussed. This should provide a better
context for evaluating the practical relevance of the efﬁciency theorems.
The most fundamental assumption was that of competitive behavior. This is the
assumption that both consumers and ﬁrms view prices as ﬁxed when they make their
decisions. The natural interpretation of this assumption is that the individual economic
agents are small relative to the total economy. When they are small, they naturally

42
Part I: Public Economics and Economic Efﬁciency
have no consequence. This assumption rules out any kind of market power such as
monopolistic ﬁrms or trade unions in labor markets.
Competitive behavior leads to the problem of who actually sets prices in the economy.
In the exchange model it is possible for equilibrium prices to be achieved via a process
of barter and negotiation between the trading parties. However, barter cannot be a
credible explanation of price determination in an advanced economic environment.
One theoretical route out of this difﬁculty is to assume the existence of a ﬁctitious
“Walrasian auctioneer” who literally calls out prices until equilibrium is achieved. Only
at this point trade is allowed to take place. Obviously this does not provide a credible
explanation of reality.Although there are other theoretical explanations of price-setting,
none is entirely consistent with the competitive assumption. How to integrate the two
remains an unsolved puzzle.
The second assumption was symmetry of information. In a complex world there are
many situations in which this does not apply. For instance, some qualities of a product,
such as reliability (I do not know when my computer will next crash, but I expect it will
be soon), are not immediately observable but are discovered only through experience.
When it comes to re-sale, this causes an asymmetry of information between the existing
owner and potential purchasers. The same can be true in labor markets where workers
may know more about their attitudes toward work and potential productivity than a
prospective employer. An asymmetry of information provides a poor basis for trade
becausethecautionofthosetransactingpreventsthefullgainsfromtradebeingrealized.
When any of the assumptions underlying the competitive economy fail to be met,
and as a consequence efﬁciency is not achieved, we say that there is market failure.
Situations of market failure are of interest to public economics because they provide a
potential role for government policy to enhance efﬁciency. A large section of this book
is in fact devoted to a detailed analysis of the sources of market failure and the scope
for policy response.
As a ﬁnal observation, notice that the focus has been on positions of equilib-
rium. Several explanations can be given for this emphasis. Historically economists
viewed the economy as self-correcting so that, if it were ever away from equilib-
rium, forces exist that move it back toward equilibrium. In the long run, equilibrium
would then always be attained. Although such adjustment can be justiﬁed in simple
single-market contexts, both the practical experience of sustained high levels of un-
employment and the theoretical study of the stability of the price adjustment process
have shown that the self-adjusting equilibrium view is not generally justiﬁed. The
present justiﬁcations for focusing on equilibrium are more pragmatic. The analysis of a
model must begin somewhere, and the equilibrium has much merit as a starting point.

43
Chapter 2: Equilibrium and Efﬁciency
In addition, even if the ﬁnal focus is on disequilibrium, there is much to be gained
from comparing the properties of points of disequilibrium with those of the equilib-
rium. Finally, no positions other than those of equilibrium have any obvious claim to
prominence.
2.9
Summary
This chapter described competitive economies and demonstrated the Two Theorems of
Welfare Economics. To do this, it was necessary to introduce the concept of Pareto-
efﬁciency. While Pareto-efﬁciency was simply accepted in this chapter, it will be
considered very critically in chapter 13. The Two Theorems characterize the efﬁciency
properties of the competitive economy and show how a selected Pareto-efﬁcient alloca-
tion can be decentralized. It was also shown how prices are central to the achievement of
efﬁciency through their role in coordinating the choices of individual agents. The role
of lump-sum transfers or taxes in supporting the Second Theorem was highlighted.
These transfers constitute the ideal tax system because they cause no distortions in
choice and have no resource costs.
The subject matter of this chapter has very strong implications that are investigated
fully in later chapters. An understanding of the welfare theorems, and of their limita-
tions, is fundamental to appreciating many of the developments of public economics.
Since claims about the efﬁciency of competition feature routinely in economic debate,
it is important to subject it to the most careful scrutiny.

Behavioral Economics
3.1
Introduction
Behavioral economics involves both the introduction and the development within eco-
nomic theory of insights about behavior drawn from different domains of psychology.
It has been widely recognized for a long time (since at least the early contributions of
Allais and Ellsberg) that some of the central assumptions of standard economic analysis
may reﬂect an unrealistic representation of human behavior. To be sure, the standard
approach can produce wrong predictions on some occasions. Empirical and experi-
mental research has cataloged a wide range of anomalies: observed choices that do
not match the predictions of standard analysis. Behavioral economics is an attempt to
improve the predictive power of economics by building in more realistic descriptions
of individual behavior. It is useful for behavioral analysis to view people as departing
from standard economic behavior in three distinct ways: limited rationality, limited
will power, and limited self-interest.
In this chapter we consider public intervention motivated by the fact that people
can make invalid choices or mistakes. This form of public intervention is aimed at
protecting people against the consequences of their own decisions. There is a long
history of opposition to any form of paternalistic public intervention where the state
claims to know better what is “truly” good for people than they know for themselves.
The nature of paternalism is frequently illustrated by the analogy to the interference of
parents in their children’s choices and the limitation of those choices. We may readily
accept that parents can limit the freedom of choices of their children and make some
choices on their behalf, but the same argument is rarely accepted with adults and state
intervention. Libertarians are the most opposed to that kind of public intervention
by asking “are you too incompetent to know what’s best for yourself?” Traditional
(public) economics assumes that people know what is best for themselves and they can
get themselves to act according to their own best interest. In that context there is no
need for public intervention beyond redistribution and the correction of market failure.
To provide the motivation for the approach we take, it is necessary to clarify some
basic issues. We can distinguish three forms of public policies: paternalism, welfarism,
and behavioralism. Paternalism refers to policies aimed at beneﬁting individuals who
cannot be relied upon to pursue self-interest. It is most appropriate for children and
others with behavioral disorders deemed unable to make rational choice. Welfarism, as

52
Part I: Public Economics and Economic Efﬁciency
we have noted many times already, denotes government policy aimed at resolving the
trade-off between efﬁciency and equity in order to maximize a social objective func-
tion. Improving efﬁciency is uncontentious, since it implies a Pareto improvement and
as such will be unanimously supported. In contrast, attaining aims of equity implies re-
distribution, so there will be some consumers that lose from this (but others that gain).
Welfarismrepresentspoliciesintendedtobeneﬁtindividualswhenself-interest(broadly
deﬁned) cannot be relied upon because of the presence of market failures or the need for
redistribution. Behavioralism represents policies intended to beneﬁt individuals when
self-interest (again broadly deﬁned) cannot be relied upon because of the presence of
internal conﬂicts (internalities). The central idea is that if people make systematic mis-
takes or biased choices they may regret later on, public policy can manipulate those
mistakes and biases that hurt people (1) to help them to protect themselves and at the
same time (2) to respect their autonomy of choice.
There are two types of mistakes people can make and that can motivate public
intervention. First, people do not know what is best for themselves through a mere lack
of knowledge of the needed information. Suppose that people cannot easily distinguish
healthy and nonhealthy food. Then a policy enforcing effective “healthy” food labeling
is beneﬁcial to individuals (if not to the food industry). Second, people do know what is
best for themselves, but they cannot get themselves to act in the correct way because of
a lack of self-discipline. For example, I may plan to stop smoking tomorrow or plan to
start jogging tomorrow, but when tomorrow arrives I cannot get myself to do it. Public
policy aimed at helping me to do it will be beneﬁcial.
The purpose of this chapter is to describe how limited rationality, which is the
possibility that individuals can make biased choices or invalid choices, opens up the
scope for a wide range of policies intended to beneﬁt individuals who cannot be relied
upon because of internal conﬂicts. The policies must help people help themselves, and
at the same time the policies must respect their autonomy of choice. In that sense the
policies are not paternalistic. We will start by describing several examples of invalid
choices. We will then describe policies that can effectively help people help themselves
to do what is best for them. We will subsequently discuss the welfare evaluation of those
policies, and more important, what welfare criteria to adopt when revealed preferences
through individual choices cannot be relied upon to make welfare judgments, since
people can make invalid choices that do not represent their “true” preferences. The
ﬁnal section of the chapter discusses another important deviation from the standard
model, namely when people are not selﬁsh optimizing agents but display concern over
the material consumption of other agents. This section reﬂects the general idea that
people do care about giving and receiving fair treatment in a wide set of circumstances.

Chapter 3: Behavioral Economics
3.2
Behavioral Individuals
In chapter 2 we described an economy in which people had only economic motives
and were also fully rational. Those restrictions in the standard approach to public eco-
nomics are useful as they impose a research structure and discipline in all analysis of
the role and beneﬁt of public intervention. But the immediate question is: How does the
economy behave if people have noneconomic motives and rational responses (e.g., the
other-regarding-preference model)? Economic motives but irrational responses (e.g.,
the behavioral model)? Noneconomic motives and irrational responses (psychological
model)? It is obvious that the answers to important questions about how the economy
behaves, and what public interventions are needed when it misbehaves, vary signiﬁ-
cantly from one model of the economy to another. Each model corresponds to a different
vision of behavior in the economy. The role of the government is to set the conditions
under which irrational people can be harnessed creatively (without harming the ratio-
nal people) to serve the greater good. Some forms of irrational behavior may give the
government new opportunities to step in with policy interventions.
Behavioral economics is interested in three forms of imperfections in decision-
making due to imperfect rationality, imperfect will power, and imperfect self-interest.
We now explore these imperfections and their consequences.
3.2.1
Simple Example: How Much to Save?
The United States Consumer Expenditure Survey suggests that households spend more
out of dividend income than out of income from capital gains (Baker, Nagel, and
Wurgler 2006). Rational economic theory implies that the same proportion of the extra
money (when the extra is the same) should be spent in both cases. To address this issue,
Shefrin and Thaler (1988) conducted an experiment that asked subjects how much
they would spend out of an unexpected extra money gain of $2,400 in three possible
situations (or framings).
• First framing
The extra money is a bonus at work paid out at constant rate of $200
a month over a year (so that the total amount is $2,400). The median saving out of the
extra money was $100 monthly for a total saving of $1,200.
• Second framing
The extra money is a lump-sum payment of $2,400 this month.
The median response was that $400 would be spent immediately, and $35 a month for
the rest of the year. That makes total spending of $785, and so a total saving of $1,615.

54
Part I: Public Economics and Economic Efﬁciency
• Third framing
The extra money is invested in an interest-bearing account for ﬁve
years and the subjects receive at the end of ﬁve years $2,400 plus interest (so that
the present value of the payment is $2,400). The median response is that none of the
(future) capital would be spent during the ﬁrst year.
Rational people should spend the same portion of the extra money for all the frames.
Shefrin and Thaler interpret the deviation from the rational choice outcome as suggest-
ing that people place different kinds of income in different mental accounts: the current
income account (in frame 1), the asset income account (in frame 2), and the future in-
come account (in frame 3), and that they spend differently from each of these mental
accounts (spending much less out of the future income account). This is one of the
many facets of the so-called framing effect to which we return later. A framing effect
is usually said to occur when equivalent descriptions of a decision problem lead to
systematically different decisions. Framing effects are commonly taken as evidence
for incoherence in human decision-making, and for the empirical inapplicability of the
rational choice models used by economists.
3.2.2
Present Bias
Present bias is an explanation of the self-control problem. Strotz (1957) analyzed how
preferences that change over time would affect the saving decision, but present bias
is a much more general problem where people face a choice that is liable to change
their own preferences in the future. This is comparable to Odysseus when passing the
Sirens and their enchantingly seductive voices. Odysseus faced an interesting decision
on how to resist the temptation (either sailing close to the island to hear the Sirens but
then running the risk of directing his ship onto the rocks, or sailing past the island and
missing the chance to hear the Sirens).
A similar situation is the decision to initially engage in an addictive activity (gam-
bling, smoking, drinking, etc.). There is ﬁrst a decision to start the addictive activity
(option Smoke) or not (option No).An initial decision to start the addictive activity, like
smoking, leads to a future decision of whether to continue the addictive activity or to
stop (option Quit). Because of the addictive nature of the activity, future preferences
are such that option Smoke is preferred to option Quit: you are hooked to this addictive
activity in some sense. But initial preferences (before addiction kicks in) are such that
people may want to give it a try, so that option Quit seems better than option No,
which in turn is better than option Smoke, which is the awful option. So the initial
preferences at time t are
Quit ≻t No ≻t Smoke,

55
Chapter 3: Behavioral Economics
but future preferences at time t + 1 when the addiction has set in are
Smoke ≻t+1 Quit.
Facing this preference reversal, a naive individual ignores the issue entirely, and
plans to reach what is initially the best option Quit by starting the addictive activity.
But then in the next period, when the addiction has set in, the awful option Smoke is
the ﬁnal result. On the contrary, a sophisticated individual foresees that Smoke will be
preferred to Quit in the future so that Quit is not really a feasible option. The choices
boil down to either Smoke or No, and the sophisticated agent chooses No, avoiding
any risk of addiction. In this self-control problem there is, in effect, one individual self
today and an entirely different individual self in the future. The today self and the future
self have different preferences. The naive individual who ignores this duality seems
obviously irrational. The sophisticated individual is rational, in a sense, but achieves
rationality only by realizing the truth that there is a preference reversal between today
self and future self.
The self-control problem is a dynamic consistency problem in which the naive in-
dividual fails to take into account the future preference reversal at the initial stage.
There is an inconsistency between what he would like to do tomorrow, and what he
would do in effect tomorrow. Odysseus solved the present-bias problem in a different
way: by precommitment. He created an extra option by being tied to the mast of the
ship that allowed him to hear the Sirens without being able to direct his ship onto the
rocks. The introduction of methods of precommitment is always a useful public policy
intervention.
3.2.3
The (β, δ) Model of Self-Control
Rational choice implies time consistency, namely that decisions are not sensitive to
timing. Time consistency means that an initial consumption plan can be constructed,
and that this plan will not need to be revised as times passes. In many domains early
decisions are not carried out because consumption plans change over time. There are
many illustrations such as: next month I will quit smoking, next week I will study and
catch up on my homework, tomorrow morning I will wake up early and exercise; after
the Christmas vacation I will start eating better; next weekend I will send in this form,
next month I will start saving, and so forth. Early plans tend to have gratiﬁcation up
front and the “good” behavior to follow later (lie in today, but get up at 6 am tomorrow to
ﬁnish the problem set), but when tomorrow comes instant gratiﬁcation is again chosen
and the “good” part of the plan is delayed. It is as if people are inhabited by multiple
selves that disagree (internal conﬂict). Early selves make plans and choices that later

56
Part I: Public Economics and Economic Efﬁciency
selves will not want to follow. Plans made at a distance tend to be more patient than
choices made in the present. Dynamic inconsistency implies a conﬂict between early
and late selves (i.e., a preference reversal). It is in essence a self-control problem (like
procrastination, laziness, addiction, or compulsive consumption) where people cannot
act according to plans.
There is a simple way to model the self-control problem. As it involves intertemporal
choice, we need to use discounting factors for future utility levels. The self-control
problem can be represented by the (β, δ) model (or quasi-hyperbolic utility)
U = u0 + βδu1 + βδ2u2 + . . . + βδTuT ,
(3.1)
where δ < 1 is the standard discount rate and β ≤1 is self-control discounting. For
β = 1, there is no self-control problem. For β < 1, the immediate future is more heavily
discounted than the more-distant future (this is the “present bias”): in the long-run we
are relatively more patient than we are in the short run. The discount rate between any
two periods in the future is δ whereas the discount rate between the present (time 0)
and the immediate future (time 1) is βδ.
To see how the model works, consider a consumption decision involving utility u1
at t = 1 and delayed utility u2 at t = 2. If it is an investment good (like exercising,
studying, training, or savings), it has the feature that people must trade off the cost
u1 < 0 against a future beneﬁt u2 > 0. If it is a temptation good (like compulsive
consumption, unhealthy food, surﬁng on the web, or credit card usage), it has the
feature that people must trade off the reward u1 > 0 against a future cost u2 < 0. What
is the consumption decision from an ex ante perspective?
If the consumer could commit to a choice in advance, say at time t = 0, she would
consume if βδu1 + βδ2u2 ≥0 or, equivalently,
u1 + δu2 ≥0.
(3.2)
Note that the parameter β cancels out in the desired (future) consumption choice.
However, the consumer actually consumes at time t = 1 if
u1 + βδu2 ≥0.
(3.3)
Compared to the desired level of consumption set in advance, the naive individual (with
parameter β < 1) underconsumes investment goods (with delayed beneﬁt u2 > 0) and
overconsumes temptation goods (with delayed cost u2 < 0), since βδ < δ. This is
the self-control problem. Compared to the actual consumption, the naive individual
overestimates the consumption of investment good (u2 > 0) and underestimates the
consumption of temptation good (u2 < 0). Conversely, a sophisticated agent (without

57
Chapter 3: Behavioral Economics
self-control problem, so β = 1) will actually consume according to the plan since
βδ = δ.
3.2.4
Reference-Dependence Bias
One explanation for some of the observed anomalies is that people assess alternative
options by comparing them to a reference point. The reference point might be a previous
level of consumption or a target level of consumption. Whatever the explanation, the
key assumption is that utility is measured relative to the reference point.
Denote the reference point by r. Utility depends on a combination of an absolute (pos-
sibly stochastic) consumption utility, m(x), and a penalty function μ(m(x) −m(r)),
which is reference dependent since it is determined by the deviation m(x) −m(r) be-
tween consumption utility and reference utility. When the reference point is the same as
the bundle chosen, then x = r, and the penalty term disappears, so the model reduces
to standard consumer choice. This approach creates multiple equilibria, opening up a
role for marketing, advertising, and sales prices to inﬂuence preferences by creating
and changing the reference point. This approach also helps explain conformism and the
effect of experience on adaptive preference. Reference effects can be seen by compar-
ing the situation of owners and dealers in either the housing market or the car market.
Dealers do not expect to hold on to goods they receive. Since their reference point does
not include the goods, they do not experience a loss when selling them. In contrast, the
owner of a car and the owner of a house will exhibit some endowment effect according
to which their reference points include those goods, and so they feel more of a loss
when selling them. This is a general difference you feel when you buy a good for resale
rather than for utilization.
Another illustration of reference-dependent preferences is the fact that people value
income changes as well as income levels. Standard preferences involve valuing only in-
come and consumption levels. Reference-dependent preferences assume that the value
function v(x; r) is deﬁned over differences from a reference point r instead of over the
overall income level. A simpliﬁed version involves the following reference-dependent
preferences over income, x :
v(x; r) =

x −r
for x ≥r,
λ(x −r)
otherwise.
(3.4)
The parameter λ > 1 denotes a loss aversion parameter that overweights losses: the
value function is steeper for losses below the reference point (x < r) than for gains

58
Part I: Public Economics and Economic Efﬁciency
over the reference point (x > r). This simple formulation can explain the asymmetry
in the valuation of small equal-sized losses and gains exhibited in many experiments.
Loss aversion can also explain the endowment effect. Consider the housing market.
Homeowners willing to sell their houses are likely to ﬁx the sale prices with reference
to the initial purchase prices. A homeowner values the sale according to the extent
of deviation from the purchase price. If there is loss aversion, the homeowner will
overweight a price loss compared to a price gain. The homeowner who fears selling at
a loss is willing to ask a higher sale price. Obviously a higher sale price will increase
the utility of a sale, but it will also reduce the probability of a sale. The homeowner will
trade off these two opposing effects. The loss-averse homeowner will sell above the
purchase price. We observe similar application in the stock market where the tendency
is to sell “winners” and hold back “losers.”
The reference-dependent model can also explain some anomalies in response to price
changes. Consider the labor supply response to an hourly wage increase. For a rational
worker a higher hourly wage induces longer working hours (if the substitution effect
dominates the income effect). However, for a reference-dependent worker, the wage
increase may well reduce her labor supply if the wage increase shifts income above
the target income used as the reference point used to value labor choice. The worker
achieves her target income by working less. Similar reasoning applies to the response
of saving rates to interest rates: the household achieves the target, saving income, by
saving less when the interest rate is higher.
3.2.5
The Gambler’s Fallacy
The gambler’s fallacy is the ﬁrst of three behavioral anomalies we consider that in-
volve the mistakes people make when forming beliefs, and these mistakes distort their
decisions.
The least controversial type of mistake about objective, real world facts is non-
Bayesian statistical reasoning. Such errors are likely to affect investment decisions and
many other economic decisions under uncertainty. Consider the simple example of coin
ﬂips. Let {h, t} represents a lottery that pays $h if the next ﬂip of a coin comes up heads
(H) and $t if the next ﬂip comes up tails (T ). Consider the following situation: If the
person observes HHH, she chooses a lottery with h < t; that is, she chooses the lottery
that pays more if the next ﬂip is T . If h = t −, this is equivalent to a bet of the
amount  that T will come up next. If instead she observes that the previous ﬂips are
TTT, she chooses a lottery with h > t; that is, the lottery that pays more if the next ﬂip
is H. If h = t + , this is equivalent to a bet of the amount  that H will come up

59
Chapter 3: Behavioral Economics
next. And ﬁnally, if she has observed no ﬂips before, she chooses a lottery such that
h = t, considering that heads and tails are equally likely. These choices are wrong in
the sense that no matter what previous outcomes have appeared the probability of h
arriving next (or t) is always one-half.
The speciﬁc pattern of mistakes in these choices are called the gambler’s fallacy:
the person believes that if the same realization of the random process has occurred a
number of times, the other realization is in some sense “due” for the next draw.
3.2.6
Conﬁrmation Bias
Conﬁrmation bias arises from inferring less than what is justiﬁed from the observation
of a recent event. This is the tendency to perceive data as more consistent with a prior
hypothesis than they truly are. The agent updates her information based on unfolding
observations by overweighting information that conﬁrms her initial opinion and under-
weighting information that contradicts her initial opinion. This is a Bayesian updating
framework, except for the mistake (bias), in the encoding of data. The gambler’s fal-
lacy is a special case with the misperception that successive samples are drawn without
replacement.
Another deviation from Bayesian reasoning is irreversibility. According to Bayesian
rationality, if you discover that a piece of information is mistaken, the memory should
erase it so that it will have no impact on future judgment (i.e., information reversibility).
However, the brain is such that when new information merges with old information,
it is impossible to undo the effect of the old information even when such information
is mistaken. Information in the brain is long-lasting. For example, when juries are
instructed to ignore certain statements after they have been heard, it is hard for them
to fully ignore the statements when making their ﬁnal judgment. Information sticks
where it hits.
Hindsight bias is the opposite of conﬁrmation bias: it is inferring more than is justiﬁed
from the observation of a recent event. It reﬂects our tendency to rapidly rewrite our
memory of the past to ﬁt what we have just learned. Rapid rewriting creates “hindsight
bias”; that is, the ex post recollection of the ex ante probability of an event will be bi-
ased in the direction of the event’s realization. The problem is that revising our beliefs
rapidly reﬂects more about how little we knew before the event, and so we should
not reach too quickly to make strong beliefs out of recent events. Hindsight bias is on
display every day in sport events and news coverage. It is an important force in political
life and in organizational life.

60
Part I: Public Economics and Economic Efﬁciency
3.2.7
Conﬁdence Bias
Many studies show that people are often overconﬁdent. Think about cycling without a
helmet or driving without a seat belt because we believe our skills we help us avoid an
accident. Overconﬁdence is the tendency to overestimate one’s own (relative) abilities
and expect the resulting outcomes to be better than they will be. Similarly overoptimism
is the overestimation of general prospects.
There are many ways to model overconﬁdence with different practical implications.
One possibility is that people overestimate the output they can generate, or they overes-
timate the marginal productivity of their effort. In either case they may end up striving
less hard than if they were not overconﬁdent. A different possibility is that overcon-
ﬁdent persons think they are more skilled and talented that they really are. Drivers are
overconﬁdent about overall driving ability. This is especially true for young drivers
and men, but much less so for women and mature drivers.
Whether overconﬁdent persons will exert too little effort or too much will depend on
whether effort and skill are complementary. Obviously overconﬁdence is not uniform
in the population. For example, some studies show that women are less (over)conﬁdent
than men, which might explain why women feel the need to work harder at school to
achieve success.
3.2.8
Framing Bias
Any theory of rational choice must stipulate that the same problem will be evaluated in
the same way regardless of how the problem is described; thus different but equivalent
descriptions should lead to the same choice. Framing effects violate this bedrock norma-
tive condition of “description invariance.” As already discussed in the saving example,
a framing effect occurs when different but equivalent descriptions of a decision prob-
lem lead to systematically different decisions, and this is commonly taken as evidence
for incoherence in individual choices.
The best-known framing problem is risk framing. It was ﬁrst described by the so-
called Asian disease problem (Tversky and Kahneman 1981). Participants to the
experiment are ﬁrst told the following story: “The United State is preparing for the
outbreak of an unusual Asian disease, which is expected to kill 600 people. One possi-
ble program to combat the disease has been proposed.” Then some participants to the
experiment are presented with two options. A: If this program is adopted, 200 people
will be saved. B: If this program is adopted, there is a one-third probability that 600
people will be saved and a two-thirds probability that no people will be saved. Other

61
Chapter 3: Behavioral Economics
participants are presented with two other options. C: If this program is adopted, 400
people will die. D: If this program is adopted, there is a one-third probability that
nobody will die and a two-thirds probability that 600 people will die. The robust exper-
imental ﬁnding is that subjects tend to prefer the “sure thing” A when given options A
and B, but tend to prefer the gamble D when offered options C and D. Note, however,
that options A and C are equivalent, as are options B and D. Subjects thus appear
to be risk-averse for gains preferring option A to B, and risk-seeking for losses, pre-
ferring option D to C. This is a central feature of prospect theory (Kahneman and
Tversky 1979). In prospect theory, it is the decision maker’s private framing of the
problem in terms of gains or losses that determines her evaluation of the options;
the framing manipulation is thus viewed as a public tool for inﬂuencing this private
frame.
There are many other framing problems. In attribute framing a single attribute of a
single object is described in terms of either a positively valued attribute or an equivalent
negatively valued attribute. The subject is then required to provide some evaluation of
the described object. The typical and robust ﬁnding is that objects described in terms
of a positive attribute are generally evaluated more favorably than equivalent objects
described in terms of negative attribute. For example, in one study, beef described as
“75 percent lean” was given higher ratings than beef described as “25 percent fat.” In
goal framing subjects are urged to engage in some activity (e.g., wearing seat belts).
This plea involves a description of either the advantages of participating in the activity
or the corresponding disadvantages of not participating. The most common result is
that subjects are more likely to engage in the activity when the disadvantages of not
engaging, rather than the advantages of engaging, are emphasized.
The framing effects reﬂect more generally the fact that human perception and
cognition is heavily inﬂuenced by contrast. This is clear in the Titchener illusion
of circles, where a circle looks larger when surrounded by smaller circles than
when it is surrounded by larger circles. Since choices involve basic perceptions, it
would then be surprising if choices were not sensitive to contrast as well. Simi-
larly the comparison of an outcome with unrealized outcomes (disappointment) or
with outcomes from forgone choices (regret) imply that the appeal of choices de-
pends on the set of choices they are part of. There are situations where the possi-
bility for more choices implies that fewer choices are made, or even no choice alto-
gether. It is well documented that offering a broader set of choices can lead consumers
to buy less, whereas in the standard model more choices can only lead to more pur-
chases. The explanation is that the broader opportunity set makes choice more difﬁcult
and stressful, so some individuals may prefer to avoid choosing. Similarly individuals

62
Part I: Public Economics and Economic Efﬁciency
facing difﬁcult choices may prefer to go for a default option such as the “menu of
the day” (or the house wine) in a restaurant offering a very large choice of menus (or
wines).
3.2.9
Conformism Bias
Conformism in social psychology refers to the inclination of an individual to change
spontaneously, without any explicit order or request by someone else, her opinion
(beliefs) and or action (choices) to conform to the socially prevailing opinions and
actions. It is the individual tendency to change the intrinsic optimal choice toward the
most prevailing choices within a group.
We could attribute this conformism to some general force of learning, such as im-
itation or suggestion, regarded as innate and instinctive. There is nothing wrong with
that. However, it could also reﬂect a possible lack of autonomy leading to individual
mistakes when making choices. The conformism effect was forcefully demonstrated in
Asch’s famous experiment. The experiment consisted of many trials in which a subject
was placed in a group of people who were secretly accomplices of the experimenter. The
subject was asked to estimate the length of a line by matching it with one of three lines.
This estimate was provided after the other accomplices had successively expressed
their opinions. The reality of conformism emerged when the other accomplices an-
nounced a clearly wrong comparison line, as then about one-third of the tested subjects
revised their own (correct) opinions to conform to the wrong judgment of the group.
This ﬁnding is important because it violates one of the basic postulate of standard eco-
nomics, that is, the idea of full autonomy of the individual. Indeed, despite the lack of
any uncertainty about the correct judgment, agents may renounce their preferences (or
judgments) and conform to an erroneous choice of the others. This is conforming to
social pressures.
Unlike sociopsychologists, economists are reluctant to take conformism as a
primitive assumption but prefer to derive conformism endogenously. A ﬁrst possi-
ble explanation for this conformism bias is that individuals may suffer from being
“different” and that conformism is a reaction to this. Another explanation assumes
agents care about “status,” which can only be inferred from their actions. If all agents
prefer to be perceived as “good” by others and if they all agree about what is a “good”
type, then they will all make uniform choices through fear that they would appear “bad”
by deviating from the norm.
Asimplewayofmodelingconformismistoextendtheutilityfunctionofanindividual

63
Chapter 3: Behavioral Economics
choice xi and the “normal” choice m. The penalty function must be of the ﬁrst order,
for otherwise a small deviation away from the norm toward the intrinsic preferred
choice would be beneﬁcial as it would only cause a second-order loss in the penalty
function and ﬁrst-order gain in the intrinsic utility. Obviously the dispersion of choices
is important because the smaller the dispersion, the greater the degree of conformism.
A suitable penalty function that takes account of the dispersion of choices and the
ﬁrst-order condition is the index of individual conformity measuring the standardized
distance from the mode:

where xi is the choice of individual i, m(xi, x−i) is the mode and σ(xi, x−i) is the
standard deviation around the mode (where x−i denotes choice variables pertain-
ing to anyone other than individual i). This index is a simple and perhaps realistic
representation of how individuals synthetically compare themselves to others.
3.2.10
Identity and Social Norms
There is a substantial psychological literature on group identiﬁcation that is important
for social interaction and market allocation. A special case is the “identity economics”
coined by Akerlof and Kranton (2010). To get a grasp of this approach, consider the
relative performance of boys and girls at school. It is a general feature and well-
documented fact across various PISA (Program for International Student Assessment)
studies that girls perform better on average than boys at age 15. Why is it so? This
cannot be due to better salary prospects, since women are paid less and are more likely
to work part time. Pursuing the analysis is in fact intriguing because we cannot attribute
such difference to either family background or migration status nor to gender difference
in those factors. We cannot attribute such gender difference to school difference either
(because they attend the same schools in general). Finally, we can hardly claim gender
difference in cognitive ability. So there is something else. Something less visible and
obvious but still very important. What could it be? This is where identity and norm
come in.
When we examine people’s decisions from the perspective of their identities and
social norms, we provide new insights into many different economic questions. Who
people are and how they think of themselves is key to the decisions that they make.
Their identities and norms are basic motivations. Tastes vary with social norms. This
vision of tastes is important because norms are powerful sources of motivation. Norms

64
Part I: Public Economics and Economic Efﬁciency
affect ﬁne-grain decisions of the moment. Norms drive life-changing decisions as well:
on matters as important as whether to quit school, whether to go to university, or
whether to go to work.
The important determinant of whether an organization functions well is not only
the monetary incentive system, as standard economic models would suggest, but also
how well its members identify with the organization and with their activities within it.
Their work must have some meaning for them to function effectively in a company.
Workers may well be willing to trade a reduction in wages for “meaningful” work.
This is probably a central feature in the occupational choice of many workers in public
services with a real vocation of serving the public (e.g., in education, health, and justice
services). This effect refers to intrinsic motivation: the satisfaction a worker gets from
work for its own sake. An interesting phenomenon documented in psychology is the
possibility that extrinsic incentives (e.g., money) can “crowd out” intrinsic motivation.
Blood donation is a concrete illustration. In general, if workers do not identify with their
job, they will seek to game the incentive system, rather than to meet the organization’s
goals. Likewise good schooling occurs not as a result of monetary rewards and costs
but because students, parents, and teachers identify with their schools, and because
that identiﬁcation is associated with learning. Given this, education policy should
look at what some successful programs have done to establish a school identity that
motivates students and teachers to work according to a common purpose. If we focus
on training teachers in how to inspire their students to identify with their school rather
than teaching students to take standardized tests, we just might be able to reproduce
within these schools great results.
As economists and policy makers we could be content to continue looking only at
prices, incomes, and related statistics to explain people’s decisions. In some situations,
that might be enough to understand what is happening. But in other situations, we would
miss major sources of motivation and thus could adopt useless, if not counterproductive,
measures aimed at producing the outcomes we seek.
3.3
Behavioral Markets
In 1991 Vernon Smith attacked Daniel Kahneman (before both received Nobel Prize in
2002 for work in behavioral economics). Smith’s claim was that anomalies at the
individual level play no role at the aggregate level, in particular in competitive markets.
Introducing the possibility of systematic imperfections in individual rationality, as we
all are willing to accept, raises new questions in the study of markets. Among them

65
Chapter 3: Behavioral Economics
the central question is whether the market will erase or exploit limits on consumer
rationality? Does competitive pressure eliminate irrational choices and induce agents
to make rational choices?
Individuals make mistakes that markets do not fully correct. There are three factors
limiting the extent to which the market can remedy biased decisions. First, decisions are
not frequent and do not deliver clear feedback. Second, individuals are not specialized
in making those decisions. Third, individuals are protected from market pressure and
competition.
3.3.1
Money Pump
Davidson, McKinsey, and Suppes (1955) use the money pump argument to justify
rational choices. The argument is as follows. Suppose that a consumer has nontransitive
preferences for consumption bundles a, b, c, where a ≻b, b ≻c, and c ≻a. The
consumer has cyclic preferences, preferring a to b, b to c, and c to a, meaning that the
consumer is willing to trade a for c, next c for b, and then b for a, so getting back to
the initial bundle. That is, the cyclic consumer is always willing to pay a small amount
 of money to get a instead of b, b instead of c, and c instead of a. So, by allowing
the agent to cycle between the different bundles c, b, a, c, b, a, . . . against successive
small payments of  units of money, the market will “pump” an indeﬁnite amount
of money out of the consumer. This argument establishes that an irrational consumer
with intransitive preferences is doomed to bankruptcy when operating in the market. It
suggests that all intransitivities should be removed from a consumer’s preference.
3.3.2
Complementary Mistakes
Whether individual mistakes are erased or exacerbated depends on whether behaviors
are strategic substitutes or strategic complements. When behaviors are complements
(like in the stock market with buying or selling decisions), a small number of irrational
traders can force others to behave irrationally.
A good illustration is the guessing game. This guessing game is like a market bubble
where market participants are not rational and the market not in equilibrium. Consider
a classroom experiment where students are asked to pick a number between 0 and 100
and not to let others see their pick. The winner of the contest is the student who is
closest to two-thirds of the average number picked by all students (hence the name
of Guessing Game). Ties will be broken randomly. In this game there is no dominant

66
Part I: Public Economics and Economic Efﬁciency
strategy (i.e., a unique best guess independently of the guess of others). However, there
is a unique Nash equilibrium when every player is rational and expects each other to
behave rationally. To compute it, ask what guess would be irrational and eliminate
this guess. For instance, any guess above 66.67 is irrational for every player, since it
cannot possibly be two-thirds of the average guess. These guesses can reasonably be
eliminated for every player, but then since no player is expected to guess above 66.67
and two-thirds of 66.67 is approximately 44.45, any guess above 44.45 is also irrational.
This process of iterated elimination of weakly dominated guesses will continue until
all guesses above 0 have been eliminated.
Now when the experiment is performed among ordinary students, it is usually found
that the winning guess is much higher than 0. Some students guessed close to 100
indicating they did not understand the game at all. A large number of students guessed
33.3 (i.e., two-thirds of 50), indicating an expectation that other players will guess
randomly. A small but signiﬁcant numbers of students guessed 22.2 (i.e., two-thirds of
33.3), indicating a second iteration based on an assumption that others would guess
33.3. In many experiments the average guess was around 33, and the winning guess
was around 22. So we can see that the rational equilibrium does not predict well in
this strategic environment. Interestingly, even perfectly rational players participating
in such a game should not guess 0 unless they know that others players are rational. If
a rational player believes that others are not rational, she will not follow the chain of
elimination described above and she could rationally guess above 0.
Keynes (1936) believed that similar behavior was at work in the stock market and
could explain a market bubble. This is the case when the price of shares is not based
on what people think their fundamental value is; rather, the price is based on what they
think everyone else thinks their value is, or what everybody else would predict the
average value is.
The nonequilibrium approach assumes a “cognitive hierarchy” in which more “ra-
tional” players best-respond to the perception that others do less thinking. Nagel (1995),
based on an original idea of Hervé Moulin, suggested that people based their guesses
on different levels of rationality. She found many guesses on different levels of ratio-
nality: level 0 rationality (guessing 50); level 1 rationality with best response to level
0 rationality (guessing 33 in response to 50); level 2 rationality, with best response to
level 1 rationality (guessing 22 in response to 33); and so on. These cognitive hierar-
chy approaches are more precise than Nash equilibrium because they always predict a
single statistical distribution of play, and are generally more accurate than equilibrium
in predicting behavior. Interestingly, if the experiment is re-run with the same players,
the results will now come much closer to the rational prediction.

3.3.3
Rationality Tug-of-War
Will the market and ﬁrms take advantage of limited consumer rationality or will the
market and ﬁrms help consumers? Whether markets will correct irrationality depends
on factors like whether consumers know their own limits and hence are receptive to
advice, and whether there is more proﬁt in protecting consumers or taking advantage
of them.
As an illustration consider the Gabaix–Laibson (2006) model. There is a market of
products with “add-on” prices (e.g., bank transaction fees that can be easily hidden). If
consumers do not know about the hidden add-on price, then competitive ﬁrms will offer
a low price on base goods (below marginal cost) and will charge high markups on add-
ons. Sophisticatedconsumerswhoknowtheadd-onprice, butcaneasilysubstituteaway
from the add-on (e.g., avoiding bank ATM fees), will prefer products with expensive
add-ons to beneﬁt from the low base-good price. The naive consumers are subsidizing
the sophisticated consumers. As a consequence competition does not lead to add-on
prices being revealed (to protect the consumers) because a ﬁrm that reveals its add-
ons will not attract either naive consumer (mistakenly thinking price is too high) or
sophisticates beneﬁting from low base-good price.
3.4
Behavioral Policy
The standard economic approach assumes that people make appropriate decisions when
they are well informed. The role of the government is then to combat ignorance or
misinformation. So, if the government can provide relevant and reliable information
more effectively than private markets, it will be a potentially beneﬁcial intervention
for consumers to do so. Information and education campaigns to combat ignorance are
desirable to help people make informed choices.
Assuming information is not an issue, the reasons for government intervention still
involve market failure. It may be appropriate, for example, for the government to tax
pollution and subsidize charitable contributions to ensure adequate levels of their pro-
vision (see part III on departures from efﬁciency). However, once market failures are
corrected, underthestandardapproachtherewillbenothingwrongwiththechoicespeo-
ple make, given the constraints they face (obviously that does not rule out government
intervention to enforce property rights and redistribute resources!).
In practice, benevolent policy makers worry that people make inappropriate choices.
One important example is that governments are concerned that people save “too little”

68
Part I: Public Economics and Economic Efﬁciency
and that this is a systematic mistake given their present bias. Such decision-making
failures are another justiﬁcation for intervention.
3.4.1
Internalities versus Externalities
Behavioral public policy permits the possibility of decision-making failures, and this
opens up the possibility of enhancing individual welfare by correcting or preventing
“bad” choices. Behavioral policy is an extension of standard public policy. The common
feature is that public policy can change behavior by changing relative prices, budgets,
and information. The distinctive feature of behavioral policy is that there are additional
channels through which policy can change behavior and welfare, even if the policy
leaves prices, budgets, and information unchanged!
The central idea is that if people make systematic mistakes, or biased decisions they
regret later on, behavioral policy uses those mistakes and biases that hurt people (1) to
help them protect themselves and, at the same time, (2) to respect their autonomy of
choice.
What do all these “invalid” choices have in common? People are facing the wrong
prices.
Withtraditionalpublicpolicy, pricesarewrongormisalignedbecauseofexternalities.
Externalities are costs that people impose on others but do not internalize. So, in the
presence of externalities, the prices people pay for things do not reﬂect the “true cost”
to others: the market price is wrong. The point will be explored in depth in chapter 8.
With behavioral public policy, prices are wrong because of internalities. Internalities
are costs that people impose on themselves but do not internalize. So, in the presence
of internalities, the prices people pay for things do not reﬂect true costs to themselves.
This is so because people face internal conﬂicts in their choices: the question “Do you
want a piece of chocolate?” triggers an internal clash between temptation and reason for
someone on a diet program. People might have present bias, reference-dependent bias,
and so on. It is not enough simply begging people to do the right thing. The government
must realign prices and incentives so that it is in people’s own interest to do the right
thing.
Behavioral policy uses people’s biases to help them by making the healthy option the
default (status quo bias) and by giving immediate rewards for healthy choices (present
bias). Behavioral policy supercharges economic incentives with deposit contracts and
regret lotteries to act as commitment devices against people’s time inconsistency.
Behavioral public policy is consistent with the traditional justiﬁcation for public inter-
vention (the enforcement of property rights, correction of market failures, redistribution

69
Chapter 3: Behavioral Economics
of income). It also introduces justiﬁcations for intervention, notably by allowing public
policy that raises welfare by limiting the possibilities for decision-making failure and
its consequences.
3.4.2
Automatic Enrollment
Consider the public policy of automatic enrollment to a saving plan or organ donation
scheme with a small cost to opt out. The default option is the outcome resulting from
inaction. A rational consumer is not inﬂuenced by the default option because the cost
to opt out is small. But behavioral consumers are inﬂuenced by the default option
because of status quo bias. In practice, the choice of the default option matters: for
organ donation schemes and retirement saving plans there is considerable evidence
that the default option affects participation rates, even though such a default neither
affects opportunities (low cost to opt out) nor provides new information. Johnson and
Goldstein (Science 2003) report a signiﬁcant effect of automatic enrollment into organ
donation: the consent rate is 85.9 percent in Sweden with automatic enrollment against
4.3 percent in Denmark where there is no automatic enrollment. The introduction
of automatic enrollment in 401(K) pension plans in the United State also provides an
effective default option (costlessly changeable by employees). The default contribution
rate is 3 percent of the salary into the 401(K) plan and 100 percent of allocation to
the money market. Before the automatic enrollment, the participation rate was 40
percent with a dispersion of contribution rates. After the automatic enrollment, the
participation rate was 88 percent without dispersion of contribution rates, which are
mostly concentrated around the default rate of 3 percent. This automatic enrollment
policy looks nonpaternalistic because the desirable default can improve the welfare of
those who mindlessly adhere to the default without restricting the options of those who
do not. The policy faces little opposition because it is beneﬁcial to those who believe
there is a status quo bias, and it is harmless to those who believe there is no status quo
bias.
3.4.3
The SMarT Plan
People accumulate an inadequate level of savings because of the different biases
involved. The present bias implies a willingness to save, but only tomorrow. The
opportunity-cost bias implies a willingness to save but only out of pay increases.
The opportunity-cost bias reﬂects the tendency for people to treat “out-of-pocket”
costs differently from “opportunity costs.” People tend to underweight (or neglect)

70
Part I: Public Economics and Economic Efﬁciency
opportunity costs relative to out-of-pocket costs. The status quo bias implies a willing-
ness to adhere to a saving plan once implemented. Combining these different biases,
Benartzi and Thaler (2004) designed a saving plan to help workers save more. The plan
was implemented in a workplace with employees invited to join a saving plan. They
could elect in advance a portion of their current income, and also a possibly different
portion of future income, to be saved. This program induced large increases in saving.
Although workers chose to save little out of current income, they committed to save
a large portion of future income. In a short period of time, the average saving rate
increased from 4.4 to 8.8 percent.
3.4.4
Complementarity
Behavioral public policy should complement, not replace, more substantive public
policies. For example, if standard public policy suggests creating a price differential
between healthy and nonhealthy food, or between bottled water and a soda drink,
behavioral analysis could help us better understand the consumer response to various
forms of public intervention. Behavioral analysis could suggest whether consumers
would respond better to a subsidy on bottled water or to a tax on regular soda. It would
also suggests how to complement a tax-subsidy policy with more effective labeling
of healthy/nonhealthy food. But that’s the most it can do according to the behavioral
economists themselves.
The limits to behavioral policy arise from social interaction. Indeed a key difference
between psychologists and economists is that psychologists are interested in individual
behavior while economists are interested in explaining the outcome of social interac-
tion among many individuals. Behavioral economics focuses on human dysfunction
(interpreted as making irrational choices) with a perspective to help people become
more functional. But, in general, most people are sufﬁciently functional most of the
time. Hence the focus of economists on people who are “rational” remains a useful
benchmark to form policy choices. Behavioral analysis can contribute to the improve-
ment of existing policies, but it offers no realistic prospect of replacing policies. The
narrow and complex models of behavior used in psychology cannot easily be used to
study the behavior of many people interacting. However, it is the social interaction
of people that will eventually determine the ﬁnal outcome of any policy intervention.
The need to study groups that consist of large number of people requires constraints
on economics that are not present for the psychologist. Economists need simple and
broad models of behavior. Hence economists focus on rational and selﬁsh behavior that
provides a reasonable description over a broad range of social settings.

71
Chapter 3: Behavioral Economics
3.5
Behavioral Welfare
Standardwelfareanalysisisconcernedabouttheevaluationofpublicpolicy. Toevaluate
whether a policy is good or bad, we must evaluate its effect on individual welfare levels.
The effect of policies on welfare are calculated in two stages: (1) the effect of the policy
on behavior and (2) the effect of the change in behavior on welfare.
The standard welfare approach to compute the effect of policy on behavior is to
assume individuals will rationally respond to policy change. Then the preferences re-
vealed by choices are used to compute the effect of change in behavior on welfare.
The welfare effect of policy intervention is measured by the extent to which individ-
ual preferences are satisﬁed. The standard preference revelation axioms assume that
the choices people make are valid and thus correctly reveal their true preferences.
There is no conﬂict between actions and intentions. The assumption that preferences
are revealed by choices can be traced back to Vilfredo Pareto (or Wilfried Pareto at
birth). Pareto recommended the use of choices (“objective facts”) to reveal preferences
(“subjective fact”). This is a philosophical stance and not a robust empirical regularity.
Pareto justiﬁed his assumption by restricting attention only to repeated actions so that
rational choices emerge as the consequence of learning. For instance, credit card ac-
count holders learn to pay their bills on time by ﬁrst suffering the payment of a late fee
when they do not. But because Pareto clearly limited the domain of revealed preference
to “repeated actions” in which learning has taught people what they want, he leaves
out important economic decisions that are rare, partly irreversible, or difﬁcult to learn
about from trial and error: educational choices, occupational choices, retirement and
saving plans, fertility and mate choices, housing choices, and so forth. In principle, we
could consider that people learn by observing others, but people are generally far more
responsive to their own experiences than to the experience of others.
3.5.1
New Welfare Criterion
The real challenge with the behavioral approach is that people can make mistakes.
Choice mistakes represent a conﬂict between actions and intentions. So the question
is then how are (true) preferences revealed when choices reveal mistakes rather than
preferences, that is when actions do not reveal true intentions? There are many cases,
as described in earlier sections of this chapter, in which even the choices of mature
consumers do not reveal a true preference but rather reﬂect the combined inﬂuence of
true preferences and choice mistakes.

72
Part I: Public Economics and Economic Efﬁciency
When people cannot act according to plan or when people do not save enough for
their retirement, we cannot assume that they are acting in their own best interest, and
that those decisions (or nondecisions) are revealing their true preferences. If preferences
are only imperfectly revealed by choices, what yardstick can we use to evaluate policy
recommendations? The danger is to replace individual preferences by some ad hoc
external preferences to legitimate policy choices. This is the danger of paternalism such
as when parents teach their children how to behave based on their own preferences.
It may be legitimate to do this for children, but it is not legitimate for adults in full
control of their autonomy (unless they voluntarily accept to abandon their freedom of
choice). Often there exists a compromise, so economists may use choices to identify
(true) preferences but take care to acknowledge the possible wedge between revealed
preferences and true preferences.
3.5.2
Choice-Based Welfare Analysis
In standard theory, agents decide on choice, x, from a set of possible choices, X. The
goal of policy is to identify the optimal choice x∗, x∗∈X.
In behavioral models, agents choose from generalized choice sets G = (X, d) where
d is an ancillary condition that affects choice but by assumption does not affect (true)
preferences (e.g., salience, framing, default option). Let C(X, d)denote choice made
in a given generalized choice sets G. Choice mistakes and inconsistent choices imply
that different ancillary conditions d ̸= d′ lead to different choices even if the choice
set X is unchanged
C(X, d) ̸= C(X, d′)
for d ̸= d′.
(3.6)
We can thus deﬁne the revealed preference relation P as xP x′ if x is always chosen
over x′ for any ancillary conditions d. Using the revealed preference relation P , it is
possible to identify the choice set that maximizes welfare instead of a single point.
With sufﬁciently many observed choices, it is effectively possible to obtain bounds
on welfare. To illustrate this, consider three different saving plans with varying beneﬁts
and corresponding contributions rates: high (H), middle (M), and low (L). Suppose
that we have collected observations from two different framing conditions, d and d′. In
frame d, revealed preferences are H > M > L and the consumer chooses saving plan
H, whereas in frame d′ preferences are M > H > L and the consumer chooses saving
plan M. We do not need to understand why the frame affects the choice of saving plan
to make a welfare statement about the optimal policy. Indeed L cannot be optimal given
the observed choices because it is never chosen no matter what the framing condition

73
Chapter 3: Behavioral Economics
is. Therefore the optimal policy must be bounded between M and H. That delivers
bounds on welfare based entirely on choice observations.
The revealed preference relation can identify the set of choices that maximizes wel-
fare (but not the unique optimal choice). Welfare bounds are tight when choices are less
sensitive to framing conditions, that is, when behavioral problems are small. However,
welfare bounds and the set of optimal policies are large when behavioral problems are
large. In the previous example, if there exists another frame d′′ such that L > M > H,
then L would be chosen and the welfare bounds would include L, M, and H. That
is, any saving plans could be the optimal policy. So this approach is not restrictive
enough to generate policy prescriptions when ancillary conditions exist that lead to
vast changes in choices. There are two alternatives solutions: preferences reﬁnements
and the structural model.
3.5.3
Reﬁnement and Structural Modeling
The idea behind preference reﬁnement is to discard certain ancillary conditions that
have become too “contaminated” for welfare analysis. For instance, by dropping the
nonvalid framing d′′, we can eliminate plan L from the set of optimal policies. With
fewer ancillary conditions we have more restrictive bounds on welfare and policy.
There is a good argument that supports this alternative for redistributive policies and
the importance of the status quo. According to reference dependence, people tend to
concern themselves more with income change (gains and losses) than income levels.
Moreover feeling the impact of loss is larger than feeling the impact of gain (loss
aversion). As a result people will give higher subjective weight to avoiding a loss than
experiencing a gain. Status quo comes into play if the redistributive policies cause the
rich to lose and the poor to gain. Due to loss aversion more prominent weight is given
to the rich relative to the poor when a redistributive policy is being evaluated.
Structuralmodelingtakesadifferentapproach. Theideaofmappingobservedchoices
directly into statements about welfare is abandoned. Instead, the observed choices
are interpreted using a behavioral model that seeks to explain their deviations from
rationality. The objective is to discover preferences by building a behavioral model
that can explain how ancillary conditions affect the choices, and then to use this model
to predict which choices reveal true preferences. By this approach, it is assumed that
preferences can be identiﬁed from the observed choices on the basis of a structural
decision-making model. For example, one could construct a present-bias (β, δ) model
that explains saving plan choices, and then calculate the optimal policy within such a
model using normative discounting with β = 1.

3.5.4
Application: Global Warming
Global warming involves intertemporal trade-offs that raise important normative
questions for public policy. We discuss the economics of climate policy more fully in
chapter 26. Here we focus on the fact that any discussion of policy must invoke trade-
offs between different time periods (bear a cost now to mitigate emissions in order to
beneﬁt from lower temperatures later) and between different generations (should the
current generation emit pollution that changes the climate for future generations?). In-
deed, whether or not people are rational, there are good reasons why revealed choices
cannot be used to infer the true intertemporal preferences of an agent, and why the
choices cannot be relied upon to make normative judgments. We consider in turn the
rational model and the irrational model.
For people who are rational, there is no reason for the policy maker to give any
normative value to the discount rate revealed by individual choices. Basically, why
should the payoff at time t have less weight than payoffs at time t + ? A good ex-
planation may relate to the risk of mortality. But then how can we account for the fact
that young adults are markedly less patient than middle-aged and older adults? Yet,
discounting to account for the mortality risk is too small to account for the revealed
exponential discounting rate of around 5 percent per year. This is a matter of consid-
erable importance for curbing global warming. Indeed the policy recommendations
for addressing global warming are heavily dependent on the choice of the normative
discount rate. The Stern Report (2006) used a normative discount rate of 0.1 percent
per year to make its recommendations, namely a normative discount rate about 1/50th
of the revealed discount rate of 5 percent. It is therefore not surprising to ﬁnd such a
big gap between the call for immediate and massive actions to curb CO2 emissions
in the Stern Report and what people seem willing to accept. The rational approach to
intertemporal choice assumes a constant discount rate whereby agents make choices
that are consistent over time. The exponential discount function with constant dis-
count rate, U = u(x0) + δu(x1) + δ2u(x2) + . . . , as originally stated by Ramsey
(1928), is the only discount function that generates dynamically consistent choices:
preferences held at some point in time do not change with the passage of time (un-
less obviously new information arrives). No preference reversal is often invoked as a
rationality requirement.
If people are irrational, their choices may contradict their intentions. As was the
case with the self-control problem, nonconstant discount rates imply dynamically in-
consistent choices. For the global warming problem, suppose that an agent can make
some investment at a cost of C (i.e., pollution abatement costs) to gain delayed beneﬁts

75
Chapter 3: Behavioral Economics
of B (i.e., curb global warming). For simplicity, suppose that the beneﬁt occurs one
period after the investment cost. The agent has a (β, δ) preference, also called a quasi-
hyperbolic discounting function whereby cost and beneﬁts at times 0, 1, 2, . . . , n, are
discounted respectively by rates 1, βδ, βδ2, βδ3, . . . , βδn, with 0 < β, δ ≤1. When
β = 1, the model is identical to the constant exponential discounting model. When
β < 1, this model replicates the “hyperbolic discounting” pattern with more periodic
discounting in the short run than in the long run. Consider the case β = 1/2 and δ = 1.
Let C = 100 and B = 180 so that the undiscounted beneﬁt is larger than the undis-
counted cost. When evaluated from an earlier perspective t periods before the cost has
to be incurred, t ≥1, this investment is desirable because
−βδtC + βδt+1B = −
1
2

100 +
1


180 = 90 > 0.
(3.7)
But the investment becomes nondesirable when the agent is asked to act immediately:
−C + βδB = −100 +
1
2

180 = −10 < 0.
(3.8)
So the agent is faced with conﬂicting preferences.
When asked to make a binding commitment in advance, the agent will chose to invest.
When such precommitment is not feasible, the agent will not invest, since she always
reneges from her previous plan when the moment arrives to act. In such a case revealed
choices cannot be used to infer the true intertemporal preference of the agent, and can-
not be relied upon to make normative judgments. Additional normative assumptions
are needed. For instance, we could assume that β = 1 in order to evaluate the pol-
icy choice from the perspective of the rational self of this agent with a no–self-control
problem. Bernheim and Rangel (2005) provide a formal justiﬁcation of this normative
criterion based on aggregation principles when the consumer’s horizon is sufﬁciently
long. The problem is similar to the welfare aggregation involving many individuals to
rank policies: here we aggregate over multiple selves. The idea is that person at time
t is a different person at time t + 1 due to the preference reversal. As in the problem
with multiple consumers, it is possible to apply a multi-person welfare analysis. If the
consumers’ horizon is sufﬁciently long, the aggregation is over many different selves.
Then the reason for using normative criterion β = 1 is that the consumer evaluates
trade-offs between any two periods t and t + 1 by exactly the same discount rate in all
periods but one; then the inﬂuence of anyone self must decline to zero as the number
of selves becomes large. To put it differently, if we aggregate preferences according
to the frequency with which rationality prevails, we end up using rational preferences

76
Part I: Public Economics and Economic Efﬁciency
for normative analysis because the “momentary lapses” of reason approach zero when
considered over a very long horizon. Obviously momentary lapses of reason matter for
positive analysis because they have long-lasting effects.
3.6
Other-Regarding Preferences
Standard economics assumes that agents are rational and selﬁsh. We have already
discussed numerous deviations from rationality. We now discussed deviations from
selﬁsh behavior. Experimental economics has conﬁrmed the predictions of competi-
tive markets, namely that even with a limited number of participants, experimental
markets clear at competitive prices. The experimental results give support to the pre-
dictions of the competitive equilibrium model analyzed in chapter 2. The equilibrium
outcome was based on selﬁsh optimization by agents interested only in their own
material consumption and proﬁts. In contrast in a strategic environment (where an
individual choice can affect someone else), agents do not seem to act according to
the standard model of selﬁsh optimization. For instance, in the simplest ultimatum
game that we describe next, the deviations from the standard model are systematic.
The deviation is not from rationality but rather from the standard assumption of selﬁsh
behavior.
3.6.1
Ultimatum Game
In the ultimatum game two players bargain over the distribution of a surplus of ﬁxed size
1. The ﬁrst player (proposer) chooses any share of the surplus s ∈[0, 1]. The second
player (responder) either accepts or rejects the proposal. If the responder accepts the
proposal s, then the responder’s payoff is r(s) = s and the proposer’s payoff is p(s) =
1−s. If the responder rejects the proposal, both receive nothing p = r = 0. It is a Nash
equilibrium for the proposer to offer s > 0 and for the responder to accept any offer
greater or equal to s. However, such an equilibrium is not fully rational (i.e., subgame-
perfect) because it relies on the (noncredible) threat that the responder will reject the
positive offers less than s. So the unique (subgame-perfect) Nash equilibrium involves
the proposer making an offer s = 0 (if the set of possible proposals is continuous) and
the responder will accept the offer as matter of indifference. So in equilibrium s∗= 0,
and the payoffs are r(s∗) = 0 and p(s∗) = 1.
The ultimatum game is simple with sharp predictions: the proposer demands es-
sentially everything and the responder accepts. However, those sharp predictions are

77
Chapter 3: Behavioral Economics
systemically wrong in the sense that they are violated in most experiments. Low pro-
posals giving less than 1
5 to the responder are rare (s < 0.2) and proposals giving more
than 1
2 to the responder are also rare (s > 0.5). Equal or almost equal splits are frequent
(s ⋍0.5). Proposals are also rejected in some experiments, with the probability of
rejection increasing as the responder’s share of the surplus s decreases.
Inacompetitiveenvironment theresultsfromtheplayofultimatumgameexperiments
are again compatible with the predictions of self-interest. Consider a variation of the
ultimatum game with a unique responder but n > 1 proposers (i.e., competition among
n proposers). The proposers simultaneously make an offer to the unique responder.
So the list of offers is s = (s1, . . . , si, . . . , sn). If the responder accepts the offer si
from proposer i, then the responder earns si, the proposer i earns 1 −si, and other
proposers earn nothing. If the responder rejects all offers, then everyone earns nothing.
The subgame perfect (Nash) equilibrium involves the responder receiving almost all
of the surplus with s∗⋍1. And experiments conﬁrm this equilibrium prediction of
self-interest.
3.6.2
Social Preferences
In social organizations, people make friends and enemies, and compare themselves
to others. Workers may thus sacriﬁce some potential earnings to help their friends
and harm their enemies, or to create better social comparisons. It is also well docu-
mented that the perception of fairness is a key determinant of strike action. If people
compare their own wages to those who work in similar activities, then the results may
create turnover costs or costs in a social organization.
There are many different forms of social preferences, displaying Selﬁshness, Altru-
ism, Fairness, or Envy. They can collectively be called SAFE preferences and they
depend on how the others’ material consumption enters your own utility function. For
the sake of clarity, consider an exchange economy with only one good (which we call
income) and two individuals. Each individual has preferences, not only over her own
income but also over the income of the other. Preferences are complete, transitive, and
continuous with the resulting utility for individual i being vi(yi, yj) (where i ̸= j).
Utility is increasing in own income, so ∂vi/∂yi > 0. By this formulation, four types of
social preferences are possible:
1. Selﬁshness
Utility is independent of the income of the other:
∂vi(yi, yj)
∂yj
= 0
for all yi, yj.
(3.9)

78
Part I: Public Economics and Economic Efﬁciency
2. Altruism
Utility is increasing in the income of the other. Altruism is a form of
unconditional kindness to others:
∂vi(yi, yj)
∂yj
> 0
for all yi, yj.
(3.10)
3. Envy
Utility is decreasing in the income of the other. An envious person always
values the material payoff of other negatively. It is a form of unconditional enviousness
to others:
∂vi(yi, yj)
∂yj
< 0
for all yi, yj.
(3.11)
4. Fairness
Utility is either increasing or decreasing in the income of the other, if the
other is respectively poorer or richer. It is a form of inequity aversion that can exhibit
both altruism or envy to other depending on relative position:
∂vi(yi, yj)
∂yj

≤0
for all yi ≤yj,
> 0
for all yi > yj.
(3.12)
If agents have extended preferences depending both on their own monetary payoffs
and on the payoffs of others, then the equilibrium outcomes can be reconciled with
experimental ﬁndings. In fact such extended preferences do a good job in organizing
experimental results that are at odds with standard predictions (e.g., as in the ultimatum
game described above).
3.6.3
Market Impact
What is the impact of other-regarding preferences on the market behavior? Consider
the competitive economy of chapter 2 with price-taking consumers and ﬁrms but with
other-regarding preferences. There are two forms of preference interdependence: (1)
consumers do care about the consumption levels of others (consumption externalities),
and (2) they do care about the budget possibilities of others (income externalities).
Consequently the utility of individual i will depend both on her own material con-
sumption xi and on the consumption choices of others x−i as well as her own budget
possibilities bi compared to the budget sets of others b−i. Denote by ui(xi, x−i, b) the
utility of individual i from consumption proﬁle x = (xi, x−i) and the budget proﬁle
b = (bi, b−i). Preferences are assumed to be strictly convex and strictly monotone
in own consumption. Price-taking behavior in competitive markets implies that own

79
Chapter 3: Behavioral Economics
consumption decisions have no impact on prices and nobody is rationed at the pre-
vailing prices. Also the consumption decisions and budget possibilities of others are
taken as given when making own consumption choices. So the price-taking consumer
i chooses her own consumption that solves
max
xi∈bi
ui(xi, x−i, b).
(3.13)
The optimal consumption of individual i, x∗
i (x−i, bi, b−i), is a function of her
own budget bi and the consumption and budget sets of others (x−i, b−i). If the own
consumption choices are independent of the consumption choices and budget sets of
others, then we say that consumers behave as if they were selﬁsh. This is the case under
the following separability assumption:
Deﬁnition 3.1
(Dufwenberg et al. 2011)
The preferences of consumers i are
separable if for all x, x′and all b, b′,
ui(xi, x−i, b) ≥u(x′
i, x−i, b) ⇐⇒ui(xi, x′
−i, b′) ≥u(x′
i, x′
−i, b′).
(3.14)
This separability assumption is required to make a meaningful comparison between
the competitive equilibria in an economy with and without other-regarding preferences.
Hence agents who care directly about the consumption of others cannot be directly
distinguished from selﬁsh agents in their consumption behavior. They look as if they
are selﬁsh even though they are not. In a Walrasian equilibrium each ﬁrm j maximizes
its proﬁts π∗
j for given price p∗, each consumer i chooses her utility maximizing
consumption bundle x∗
i for given budget sets b∗, and the budget sets are compatible
with equilibrium price p∗in the sense that b∗
i =

xi : p∗xi ≤p∗ωi + jθijπ∗
j (p∗)

with ωi the initial endowment of individual i and θij the proﬁt share of individual i in
ﬁrm j. The major theorem concerning the comparison of equilibria now follows.
Theorem 3.2
(Dufwenberg et al. 2011)
If all agents have separable preferences that
are strictly monotone in own consumption, any Walrasian equilibrium of an economy
with other-regarding preferences is a Walrasian equilibrium of the standard economy
with selﬁsh preferences.
This result implies that the competitive market outcome is consistent with behavior
far more general than selﬁsh optimization. There is a simple intuition for this result. If
an agent’s decision does not inﬂuence the market price or the volume of trade, then he
has no opportunity to change the material consumptions of others in the economy. As a

80
Part I: Public Economics and Economic Efﬁciency
result in a competitive environment agents typically behave as if they care only about
their own material consumption, even though they have more general preferences.
There is a dual observation that is more familiar. In certain noncompetitive environ-
ments people may act as if they were altruistic, even if they care only about their own
material consumption. This is the case in many environments intended to induce coop-
eration among selﬁsh agents (e.g., think of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change). The
fact that market equilibrium may not be affected by other-regarding preferences does
not mean that the market’s outcome will be efﬁcient (contrarily to the standard compet-
itive economy). In general, the market outcome will be inefﬁcient. Also this result does
not exclude the possibility that the market outcome can be affected by other-regarding
preferences when there are some forms of market failures such as those described in
part III on departures from efﬁciency.
3.7
Conclusions
In this chapter we did not seek to be completely comprehensive, but only to provide an
introductory account of the main themes in behavioral economics, and to explore some
of the implications for public policy. For that purpose there was no need and no attempt
to pursue the theory into every one of its corners. There was no attempt either to be
sophisticated in bringing risk or expectation into the theory, except in a very simple
way. We also only introduced dynamic considerations in a nonformal manner because
this is an issue we analyze in more depth in part VIII of the book.
To conclude this review of behavioral approach to economics, there is one puzzle
we would like to share with the reader. This puzzle is reminiscent of the one raised by
Little (1956) about the so-called welfare economics revolution. The puzzle is that the
conclusions of behavioral economics are important and inﬂuential, especially among
economists and possibly policy makers, but very few economists are clear as to what the
word“behavioral”means, orwhatpreciselythetheoryisabout. Indeeditisonlyrecently
that the word “behavioral” has been employed. Time inconsistency, habit formation,
satisﬁcing, and social interaction ﬁgured in economic analysis long before they were
swept under the umbrella of behavioral economics. It is by no means clear what this
word means (except nonstandard preferences, beliefs, or choices). It is, to put it differ-
ently, not clear what behavioral economics is about. Despite this lack of clarity, the ideas
we have discussed have inﬂuenced the opinions of many people. It obviously could not
have had any such inﬂuence if its conclusions had been meaningless, or merely formal
and recognized as such. Its conclusions certainly have some real (nonformal) meaning.

81
Chapter 3: Behavioral Economics
It is also fair to say that it is rather difﬁcult to test the theory simply because there
are many competing explanations for the mistakes people can make in their decisions.
Since the subject matter is often something that arouses peoples’ emotions such as
eating disorders, illicit drug use, excessive alcohol consumption, smoking, gambling,
compulsive consumption, and excessive debt, the result seems to be a lack of balance
with the conclusions of the theory being either passionately attacked or passionately
defended. Only the future will tell us if the theory is likely to have much direct inﬂuence
on public policy. In the meantime the theory is likely to have a considerable indirect
inﬂuence by molding the opinions of economics students and, possibly as a result,
some of its fashionable conclusions passing into ordinary language and being taken for
granted as though they were the most obvious scientiﬁc truth. The automatic enrollment
policy is a good illustration of that.

Search and procrastination (Carroll et al. 2010). Let a “naive” consumer have discount
parameters 0 < β < 1 and δ = 1 (daily discounting so that δ ⋍1). The daily loss from delay
is L (the daily beneﬁt loss). The search cost ct is stochastic and drawn from a uniform
distribution on the interval [0, 1]. Let W describe the cost function today, with
W(c) =

(Overconﬁdence). A worker chooses effort e, which has cost c(e) that is increasing and
convex in e. The productivity of effort also depends on a variable called skill s so that output
is
x = f(e, s) + θ,
where f (e, s) is increasing and concave in each component, and θ is a random term that can
be called “luck.” The random term θ is distributed according to μ(θ). The ﬁrm pays a linear
wage based on output
w(x) = w0 + αx.
Assuming separability between effort cost and wage beneﬁt, the expected utility is
EV(e) =

θ
U(w(f (e, s) + θ))μ(θ)dθ −c(e).
a. Suppose that skill does not matter and that f (e, s) = e. Compute the optimal effort choice.
b. Now assume that the worker overestimates the marginal productivity of effort by a factor
β > 0 so that ˆf (e, s) = (1 + β)e. Show that this overconﬁdent worker may cut back on
effort.
3.11
Consider the previous exercise with f (e, s) increasing and concave and with a nonzero cross
derivatives fe,s = ∂2f (e, s)
∂e∂s
̸= 0. fe,s > 0 if e and s are complements, and fe,s < 0 if e and s
are substitutes.
a. Compute the optimal effort choice conditional on the skill level.
b. Now assume the worker overestimates her skill value by a factor  so that ˆs = s + .
Show that whether a worker who is overconﬁdent in this way will cut back on work (or do
the opposite) depends on whether effort and skill are complementary.

(Beauty contest). “…professional investment may be likened to those newspaper compe-
titions in which the competitors have to pick out the six prettiest faces from a hundred
photographs, the prize being awarded to the competitor whose choice most nearly corre-
sponds to the average preferences of the competitors as a whole; so that each competitor has
to pick, not those faces which he himself ﬁnds prettiest, but those which he thinks likeliest
to catch the fancy of the other competitors, all of whom are looking at the problem from the
same point of view. It is not a case of choosing those which, to the best of one’s judgment,
are really the prettiest, nor even those which average opinion genuinely thinks the prettiest.
We have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligences to anticipating what

average opinion expects the average opinion to be. And there are some, I believe, who prac-
tice the fourth, ﬁfth and higher degrees.” (John Maynard Keynes, The General Theory of
Employment, Interest, and Money).
In reference to the quote above, consider the following guessing game. There are 100
participants, and each participant announces independently and simultaneously a number
between 0 and 100 (only integers are allowed). There is a fee of $1 to participate to the
guessing game, to be redistributed as a prize of $100 to the winner. The participant who
guessed closest to a target wins the prize.

(Ultimatum game). Consider a ﬁxed income of y to share between two players. Player 1 is
the proposer and demands x1 for himself. Player 2 who is the responder accepts or rejects
the demand. If the demand is accepted, the payoffs are v1 = x1 and player 2’s payoff is
v2 = y −x1.
a. What is the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium if both players are selﬁsh?
b. What would happen if both players are fair?
3.14
The utility function of individual i is given by ui(yi, yj) = log yi + λ log yj, where yi is
individual i’s income, yj is individual j’s income, and λ is a parameter representing the
other-regarding preference.
a. For what values of λ is individual i selﬁsh?
b. For what values of λ is individual i an altruist?
c. For what values of λ is individual i fair?
d. For what values of λ is individual i envious?
3.15
(Envy model). Consider a 2-player model of envy with the utility function of individual i
given by ui(yi, yj), where ∂ui/∂yi > 0 and ∂ui/∂yj < 0. Show that any division of an
object of ﬁxed size in which the responder gets nothing will be necessarily rejected by the
responder.
3.16
Consider a two-stage version of the ultimatum game with a shrinking amount to be distributed
among two selﬁsh players. The amount to be distributed in stage 1 is 1. Player 1 demands x1
and player 2 accepts or rejects the demand. If player 2 accepts, he receives 1 −x1. If player
2 rejects, he can make a counterdemand x2 and player 1 can accept or reject, but then the
amount to be distributed is reduced to λ < 1. If player 1 accepts the counterdemand x2, he
receives λ −x2. If player 1 rejects the counterdemand, both players receive 0.
a. Compute the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium.
b. Show that the equilibrium demand by player 1 is decreasing in λ. Explain.

Repeat the previous two-stage ultimatum game with a shrinking amount to be distributed,
but now assume a linear model of envy with utility of player i,

ui(yi, yj) = yi −αyj,
with the envy preference parameter α > 0.

Introduction
In 1913 the Sixteenth Amendment to the US Constitution gave Congress the legal
authority to tax income. In so doing, it made income taxation a permanent feature of
the US tax system and provided a signiﬁcant source of additional tax revenues. Revenue
collection passed the $1 billion mark in 1918, increased to $5.4 billion by 1920, and
reached $43 billion in 1945. It was not until the tax cut of 1981 that this process of
growth showed any marked sign of slowing. This growth in tax revenue was matched
by an equal growth in government expenditure. The US experience is typical of similar
developments in all industrialized economies.
This chapter provides a statistical overview of the public sector in modern market
economies. Data are presented on government expenditure and revenue. The purpose
is to give both a historical perspective and an insight into the current situation.
From the numerous items of expenditure and sources of revenue, we can observe
the extent and range of activities in which the public sector is involved. A surprising
feature that the data reveals is the similarity in public sector behavior in countries that
are otherwise very diverse culturally. Speciﬁcally, the difference in the size of the public
sector between the social-market economies of northern Europe and the free-market
economies of North America and Asia is rather less than might be imagined.
4.2
Historical Development
The historical development of the public sector over the past century can be summarized
as one of signiﬁcant growth. For the typical industrially developed economy, govern-
ment expenditure was only a small proportion of the gross domestic product (GDP)
at the start of the twentieth century. Expenditure then rose steadily over the next sixty
years, leveling out toward the end of the century. The details behind this broad-brush
description are illustrated in the ﬁgures that follow.
Figure 4.1 shows the growth of public spending during the last century for ﬁve
developed economies. This depicts expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic
product to give an idea of the size of the public sector relative to the economy as a
whole. Only a selection of years is plotted, but the ﬁgure provides a clear impression of
the overall trend. Although there is a persistent difference in the levels of expenditure

Total expenditure, 1870 to 2010 (% of GDP)
among the three European countries (France, Germany, and United Kingdom) and the
non-European countries (Japan and United States) the pattern of growth is the same
for all. These ﬁve economies had a clear long-run upward path in public spending
relative to the gross domestic product. Starting with a level of public spending around
10 percent of the gross domestic product in 1870, this increased markedly around 1910
and then continued to rise afterward. In 1996 the United States had the lowest public
spending level of the ﬁve countries at 32.4 percent, but even this is one-third of the gross
domestic product. France had the highest level at 55 percent. Anumber of explanations
for this long-run increase have been proposed. These explanations are presented in
chapter 5.
A more detailed view of the changes in the level of expenditure over the last thirty
years is provided in ﬁgure 4.2. The picture displayed is of a slowing, or even a stagna-
tion, of the growth in public sector expenditure, particularly over the past twenty years.
Although expenditure was higher in 2007 than in 1970 for the six countries shown, the
increases for the United Kingdom and the United States were very small (from 38.8
to 43.9 percent for the United Kingdom and from 31.7 to 36.9 percent for the United
States). For the United Kingdom especially, expenditure was clearly higher in the early
1980s (peaking at 47.5 percent in 1981) than in 2007. This picture was changed signif-
icantly by the ﬁnancial crisis. Expenditure rose sharply for all the countries between
2008 and 2009 as the governments increased spending to reﬂate their economies. There
has been a small fall in expenditure since the peak in 2009, but it remains at a level
about that of 2007. Overall, the ﬁgure suggests that there has been convergence in

the level of expenditure between the countries. For example, in 1970, expenditure in
Japan was approximately half that in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, but
by 2002, it had reached 38.8 percent in Japan and almost matched that in the United
Kingdom. The gap has widened again since (to 6.3 percentage points), as the United
Kingdom has been affected more than Japan by the ﬁnancial crisis.
Figure 4.3 shows the path of expenditure in selected subcategories of public spending
during the last century, again expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product. This
breakdown into categories is helpful in understanding the composition of the long-run
increase in ﬁgure 4.1. Defense spending constituted one of the largest items of public
spending in the late nineteenth century. It has since been somewhat erratic and driven
in large part by the history of international relations. In all cases defense spending
peaked at midcentury and has fallen continually since. In 1996 the United States spent
the largest proportion its gross domestic product on defense (4 percent).
The most marked rises have come from social spending on items such as education,
health, and pensions. Expenditure on education and pensions has risen sharply as a share
of the gross domestic product in all ﬁve countries since the early twentieth century but
particularly so since midcentury (and perhaps slightly earlier in the United Kingdom).
In all ﬁve countries it is currently around 5 percent of the gross domestic product. Health
expenditure has risen more rapidly. Even in the United States, which has a primarily
private health care system, the public sector expenditure on health was 6.3 percent of the
gross domestic product in 1994. The signiﬁcant increase in expenditure on pensions is

important from a policy perspective.As discussed further in chapter 23, many countries
are facing a “pensions crisis” in which the current rate of expenditure on state pensions
is unsustainable. The basis of this is clearly apparent in the rate of expenditure increase
in France and Germany.
Data on public sector expenditure for a wider range of countries in 2010 is given in
ﬁgure 4.4. This includes developed, developing, and transition economies. The ﬁgure
clearly justiﬁes the claim that the public sector is signiﬁcant in countries across the
world. France has the highest level of public sector expenditure (at 56.6 percent) and

stantial government involvement. They are clearly not free-market economies with
minimal government intervention. These values for the size of the public sector em-
phasize the importance of studying how government should best choose its means of
revenue collection and its allocation of expenditure.
As a ﬁnal point, it is worth noting that data on expenditures typically understate
the full inﬂuence of the public sector on the economy. For instance, regulations such
as employment laws and safety standards affect economic activity but do not directly

Composition of Expenditure
The historical data display the broad trend in public expenditure. This section looks
in more detail at the composition of expenditure. Expenditure is considered from the
perspective of its allocation between various levels of government and its division into
categories.
Figure 4.5 allocates expenditures among the different levels of government (net
of all transfers between levels). The signiﬁcant difference between the United King-
dom, which has no expenditures at the state level, and Germany and the United States
is explained by their political structures. Germany and the United States are federal
countries that have central government, state government, and local government. In
contrast, the United Kingdom is a unitary country that has only central and local gov-
ernments. The ﬁgures reveal that expenditure at the state level is similar in Germany
and the United States (20 and 22 percent respectively), although local government is

larger in the United States (26 percent compared to 15 percent). Despite the different
political structure in the United Kingdom, the proportion of expenditure at the local
level is identical to that in the United States (26 percent). By deﬁnition, central expen-
diture in the United Kingdom (73 percent) is then equal to the proportions of central
plus state in the United States.
Figure 4.6 displays the different compositions of general spending in the United
States, United Kingdom, and Germany. The diversity of public sector activity is clear
from the list of spending categories. Interestingly, spending on the goods associated
with the core functions of the state—defense and public order—is relatively minor and
forms about 10 percent of spending when averaged across the countries.Administrative
and governmental costs are recorded under the heading of general public services and
add no more than another 12 percent on average.

in the United States). Spending on housing and community amenities, on recreation and
culture, and on transport and communications sectors are comparatively small. Sub-
sidies to the agriculture, energy, mining, manufacturing, and construction sectors are
brought together here under the heading of other economic affairs and also appear rela-
tively minor. Social security and welfare spending is the largest single item in all coun-
tries under this classiﬁcation. This is so even in the United States where, at 19 percent,
it is noticeably smaller than in Germany and the United Kingdom (44 and 35 percent
respectively).Averaged across the three countries it constitutes over a third of spending.
Figures 4.7 to 4.9 show how spending responsibilities are allocated among differ-
ent tiers of government in the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany. This
provides an interesting contrast between the two federal countries (Germany and the
United States) as compared with the unitary country (United Kingdom). Yet, even
though the political structures are signiﬁcantly different, some common features can
be observed. Certain items such as defense are always allocated to the center. Re-
distributive functions also tend to be concentrated centrally, for the good reason that
redistribution between poor and rich regions is only possible in that way and also be-
cause attempts at redistribution at lower levels are vulnerable to frustration through
migration of richer individuals away from localities with internally redistributive pro-
grams. Education, in contrast, is largely devolved to lower levels, either to the states
or to local government. Public order is also typically dealt with at lower levels. Health
spending is always substantial at the central level but can also be important at lower
tiers, as in Germany.
The fact that spending is made at a lower level need not mean that it is ﬁnanced from
taxesleviedlocally. Inmostmultiple-tiersystemsthecentralgovernmentpartlyﬁnances

spending activities of the lower tiers. In the latter case the incentives of lower tiers to
spend can be changed by the design of the grant formula, and central government can
use this as a way to encourage recognition of externalities between localities.

Revenue
The discussion of public sector expenditure is now matched by a discussion of revenue.
The following ﬁgures ﬁrst trace the historical path of tax revenues and then relate
revenues to different tax instruments and to alternative levels of government.

Composition of state spending
The ﬁrst set of statistics consider the growth of total tax revenue from 1965 to 2009.
Figure 4.10 charts total tax revenue for seven countries expressed as a percentage of the
gross domestic product. The general picture that emerges from this mirrors that drawn
from the expenditure data. All of the countries have witnessed some growth in tax
revenue over the period, and there has also been a degree of convergence. The ﬁnancial
crisis and resulting recession have caused tax revenues to fall from 2007 to 2009. In
2009 government revenue in these countries ranged between 24 and 42 percent of the
gross domestic product.
Looking more closely at the details, France (42 percent) and the United Kingdom (34
percent) have the highest percentage, closely followed by Canada (32 percent). Japan

(27 percent), Turkey (25 percent), and the United States (24 percent) are somewhat
lower. The country with the most growth in tax revenue is Turkey, with revenue rising
from 11 percent of the gross domestic product in 1965 to 33 percent in 2000 (but
declining since then). Tax revenue also grew strongly in Japan between 1965, when it
was 11 percent of the gross domestic product, and 1990, when it reached 30 percent,
but has leveled off since. Overall, the data show surprising uniformity among these
countries with all achieving a similar outcome. The ﬁgures that follow present the
details behind these aggregates.
Figure 4.11 shows at the proportion of tax revenue raised by six categories of the tax
instrument in 2009. Note that income and proﬁt taxes raise the largest proportion of

revenue in Australia (56 percent), Canada (47 percent), the United States (41 percent),
and the United Kingdom (39 percent). Social security taxes are the largest proportion in
Japan (40 percent), France (39 percent), and Germany (39 percent). Taxes on goods and
services are the most signiﬁcant item in Turkey (46 percent) and Korea (32 percent).
There is also noticeable division between the European countries, where taxes on goods
and services are much more signiﬁcant, and the United States. For instance, taxes on
goods and services raise 29 percent of revenue in the United Kingdom, but only 18
percent in the United States. This is a reﬂection of the importance of value-added
taxation (VAT) in Europe where it has been a signiﬁcant element of EU tax policy.
Property taxes are signiﬁcant in the majority of countries (14 percent in the United
States, 12 percent in the United Kingdom, and 12 percent in Korea). Payroll taxes are
only really signiﬁcant in Australia (5 percent).
The next two ﬁgures display the proportion of tax revenue raised by each level of
government. Figure 4.12 shows the proportions in ﬁve federal countries. In contrast,
ﬁgure 4.13 shows the ﬁve unitary countries. For all the federal countries the central
government raises more revenue than state government. The two are closest in Canada,
with the central government raising 42 percent and the provinces 39 percent, and in
Germany, with the central government raising 31 percent and the provinces (Bundes-
lander) 22 percent. The federal governments in Australia and the United States raise
considerably more revenue than the states (80 and 16 percent for Australia and 34 and

21 percent for the United States). In all countries local government raises the smallest
proportion of revenue. The US local government raises 17 percent of revenue, which
is the largest value among these countries. The smallest proportion of revenue raised
by local government is 3.5 percent in Australia.
The unitary countries in ﬁgure 4.13 display the same general feature: that the central
government raises signiﬁcantly more revenue than local government. The largest value
is 67 percent in Turkey and the smallest 31 percent in France. Local government is
most signiﬁcant in Japan (28 percent) and least signiﬁcant in Turkey (9 percent).
From comparing the federal and unitary countries, it can be seen that local govern-
ment raises slightly more revenue on average in the unitary countries than the federal
countries. What really distinguishes them is the size of central government. The ﬁgures
suggest that the revenue raised by central government in the unitary countries is almost
the same on average as that of central plus state in the federal countries. The absence
of state government does not therefore put more emphasis on local government in the
unitary countries. Instead, the role of the state government is absorbed within central
government.
The ﬁnal set of ﬁgures presents the share of revenue raised by each category of tax
instrument at each level of government for two federal countries, the United States
and Germany, and two unitary countries, Japan and the United Kingdom. Most of
the previous ﬁgures have shown remarkable similarities in the behavior of a range of

104
Part II: Government
countries. In contrast, allocating revenues to tax instruments for the alternative levels
of government reveals some interesting differences.
For the United States ﬁgure 4.14 shows that the importance of income and proﬁts
taxes falls as the progression is made from central to local government (90 percent
for central, 5 percent for local). Their reduction is matched by an increase in the
importance of property taxes from 2 percent for central government up to 73 percent
for local government. It would be easy to argue that this is the natural outcome since
property is easily identiﬁed with a local area but income is not. However, ﬁgure 4.15
for Germany shows that the opposite pattern can also arise with income and proﬁt taxes
becoming more important for local government (78 percent of revenue) than for central
government (38 percent of revenue). Despite this difference Germany and the United
States do share the common feature that property taxes are more important for local
government than for central government.
The same data are now considered for two unitary countries. In Japan (ﬁgure 4.16)
income and proﬁts taxes are almost equally important for both central government (50
percent of revenue) and local government (51 percent). They are also more important
for both levels of government than any other category of tax instrument. Where the
difference arises is that property taxation is much more signiﬁcant for local government
(raising 30 percent of revenue) than for central (6 percent). For central government, gen-
eral taxes (24 percent of revenue) make up the difference. The UK data, in ﬁgure 4.17,

present an extreme version of the importance of property taxation for local govern-
ment. As the ﬁgure shows, property taxes raised 100 percent of tax revenue for local
government. No revenue is raised by local government in the United Kingdom from
income and proﬁt taxes.
As compared, the data for the unitary and federal countries do not reveal any standard
pattern of revenues within each group. In fact the differences are as marked within the
categories as they are across the categories. The one feature that is true for all four
countries is that property taxes raise a larger proportion of revenue for local government
than they do for central government.
This section has looked at data on tax revenues from an aggregate level down to the
revenue raised from each category of tax instrument for different levels of government.
What the ﬁgures show is that at an aggregate level there are limited differences among
the countries. Those for which data are reported have converged on a mixed-economy
solution with tax revenues at a similar percentage of the gross domestic product. The
most signiﬁcant differences emerge when the source of revenue for the various levels of
government is analyzed. Even countries that have adopted the same form of government
structure (either unitary or federal) can have very different proportions of revenue raised
by the various categories of tax instrument.

107
Chapter 4: Public Sector Statistics
4.5
Government Debt
When the level of government expenditure exceeds the value of revenue, the budget
is in deﬁcit. Deﬁcits are ﬁnanced by issuing debt, so the stock of debt represents an
accumulation of past deﬁcits. Debt can be viewed as the substitution of current govern-
ment expenditure for future expenditure. It imposes a cost (the service and repayment
of the debt) on future taxpayers in order to provide expenditure for current taxpayers.
The level of government debt has become an issue of major policy importance due
to the increasing debt levels in many countries. The increase in debt has occurred for
two reasons. First, many governments have responded to the global ﬁnancial crisis by
boosting expenditure at a time of falling revenues. Second, the operation of the euro
has provided poor incentives for ﬁscal prudence in the European Union countries that
adopted the single currency.
The debt levels of governments are usually sustainable—in the sense that promised
payments on the debt can be made—but there are occasions when governments cannot
make the promised payments. In such cases the government defaults on the promises
to pay. When a corporation defaults on debt, it is put into liquidation by the holders of
the debt and the value of its assets is distributed among them. In contrast, a default by
a government (a sovereign debt default) cannot be met with liquidation of the country.
The only consequence for a county is future difﬁculty in borrowing, and the higher
rates that will have to be paid on future debt to compensate for the perceived increase
in risk. If a country issues debt in its own currency, then it need not default (although
some countries, such as France in the sixteenth century, have chosen to repudiate debt).
Instead, a country has the option of simply printing more money to repay the debt but
then has to live with the inﬂationary consequences. The more signiﬁcant problems
arise when a country either issues debt denominated in a foreign currency (e.g., a South
American country issuing bonds denominated in dollars) or, as in the unique case of
the euro, issues debt in its own currency but cannot unilaterally print more money.
The roots of the global ﬁnancial crisis are usually traced to the bursting of a bubble in
the United States housing market after it peaked in 2007. The bubble had been ﬁnanced
by extensive mortgage borrowing at cheap rates. These mortgages were securitized
(bundled together and sold in packages) and then traded as ﬁnancial securities (securi-
tized mortgage obligations) in their own right. As mortgage borrowers began to default
on their loans, the securitized mortgage obligations became risky and collapsed in value.
This undermined the ﬁnancial position of the holders of these securities. The conse-
quence was acute liquidity problems in the US banking system in 2008, and the failure

108
Part II: Government
of major ﬁnancial institutions in the United States and elsewhere. The level of credit
available declined, causing a slowdown in real economic activity and the recession of
2009. The response of many governments was to boost their economies through ﬁscal
stimulus and monetary expansion. Signiﬁcant expenditure was also made to provide
support and bailouts for ﬁnancial institutions. These actions lead to rising government
debt.
The story for the euro countries is partly related to the debt crisis and partly to the
operational structure of the euro. Ireland, in particular, has incurred debts because of
the ﬁnancial crisis. The Irish economy had its own boom and became over-inﬂated
through the 1990s. The onset of recession elsewhere in the world in 2008 hit the Irish
economy hard. An alternative story is appropriate for Greece. After joining the euro
Greece enjoyed much lower interest rates than it had previously faced. It chose to
borrow heavily at these new low rates to ﬁnance higher levels of current consumption.
This reﬂected a combination of a simple change in the intertemporal trade-off and the
intention of the incumbent government to secure short-term popularity.
The time path of the budget deﬁcit for several countries is shown in ﬁgure 4.18 for
1996 to 2009. A noticeable feature of the data is that the deﬁcits in Germany and Italy
do not show any marked variation over the time interval. The effect of the ﬁnancial

Chapter 4: Public Sector Statistics
crisis can be seen from 2008 but the effect does not push the deﬁcits signiﬁcantly below
the long-term trend. In contrast, the other countries show strongly widening deﬁcits
from 2006. The largest increases were in Greece and Ireland, which explains why these
countries have been at the center of the crisis in the euro area. The United Kingdom
and the United States follow fairly similar paths that reﬂect the use of ﬁscal stimulus
policies in both countries.
High and rising debt is a source of justiﬁable concern. It is not only government debt
that has grown but also corporate and household debt. Over the past thirty years the
ratio of total debt to gross domestic product in advanced economies has risen from 167
percent in 1980 to 314 percent in 2011. This level of debt is unprecedented. Figures
4.19 to 4.21 show the growth in this debt for a range of countries. With the exception
of Japan, corporate debt has shown a general tendency to rise, and it has risen sharply
in most countries from 2000 to 2010. The growth of government debt is particularly
marked in Japan and Greece, but all the countries shown had higher levels of debt in
2010 than in 1980. The pattern for household debt is not so uniform. Italy, France, and
Spain have had signiﬁcant increases in household debt, but in Italy and France this has
been from a very low level in 1980. In contrast, household debt fell between 2000 and
2010 in Germany and Japan.

Chapter 4: Public Sector Statistics
The level of debt accumulated by some euro area countries has led to a crisis for the
currency. The crisis has involved several countries (Greece, Ireland, and Italy being
the notable examples) coming close to defaulting on their debts and requiring ﬁnancial
bailouts. The increase in aggregate debt of the 17 countries that have adopted the euro
is shown in ﬁgure 4.22. The level was steady at around 70 percent of the gross domestic
product until the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008; then it rose sharply to 90 percent in 2011. This
level of indebtedness has arisen despite the countries being notionally subject to the
conditions of the Stability and Growth Pact, which requires the government deﬁcit to
be less than 3 percent of the gross domestic product and debt to be less than 60 percent
of the gross domestic product. It is clear that these conditions were simply not enforced
because of the lack of any credible enforcement mechanism.
Details of the debt levels in individual euro area countries is reported in ﬁgure 4.23.
Over the period in which the euro had been in existence, the debt to the gross domestic
product ratios have increased signiﬁcantly (with the exception of Spain). Ireland had
the greatest increase relative to the gross domestic product, which is why it required
a ﬁnancial bailout in 2010. Greece has the highest debt ratio in 2010 at 152.6 percent
of the gross domestic product, followed by Italy at 119.5 percent of the gross domestic
product. Both countries came close to defaulting on debt in 2011. The lowest levels of

The past two decades witnessed a massive accumulation of debt across the world.
Corporations, governments, and households have contributed to this process. The
ﬁgures have revealed how the level of debt was increased by the global ﬁnancial crisis.
Debt places a burden on the public ﬁnances of a country. Countries can usually print
money to avoid default, but this is not an option for euro area countries where debt is
causing some of them very severe problems.
4.6
Measuring the Government
The ﬁgures examined above have provided several different viewpoints on the public
sector. They have traced both the division of expenditure and the level of expenditure.
For the purpose of obtaining a broad picture of the public sector, these are interesting
and informative statistics. However, they do raise two important questions that must
be addressed in order to gain a proper perspective on their meaning.

113
Chapter 4: Public Sector Statistics
The ﬁrst issue revolves around the fact that the ﬁgures have expressed the size of the
public sector relative to the size of the economy as a whole. To trace the implications of
this, take as given that there exists an accurate measure of the expenditure level of the
public sector. The basic question is then: What should this expenditure be expressed as
a proportion of? The standard approach is to use the nominal gross domestic product
(i.e., gross domestic product measured using each year’s own prices), but this is very
much an arbitrary choice that can have a signiﬁcant impact on the interpretation of the
ﬁnal expenditure ﬁgure.
Recall from basic national income accounting that the size of the economy can be
measured in either nominal or real terms, using gross output or net output. Domestic
or national product can be employed. Outputs can be valued at market prices or factor
prices. For many purposes, as long as the basis of measurement is made clear, the choice
of measure does not make much real difference. Where it can make a critical difference
is in the impression it gives about the size of the public sector. By adopting the smallest
measure of the size of the economy (which depends on a number of factors, e.g., the
level of new investment relative to depreciation, the structure of the tax system, and
income from abroad), the apparent size of the public sector can be increased by several
percentage points over that when using the largest expenditure level.
While not changing anything of real economic signiﬁcance, such manipulation of
the ﬁgures can be very valuable in political debate. There is a degree of freedom for
those who are supportive of the public sector, or are opponents of it, to present a ﬁgure
that is more favorable for their purposes. This may be useful for those wishing to push
a particular point of view, but it hinders informed discussion. Consequently, as long
as the ﬁgures are calculated in a consistent way, it does not matter for comparative
purposes which precise deﬁnition of output is used. In contrast, for an assessment of
whether the public sector is “too large,” it can matter signiﬁcantly.
The second issue of measurement concerns what should be included within the
deﬁnition of government. To see what is involved here, consider the question of whether
state-run industries should be included. Assume that these are allowed to function as
if they were private ﬁrms, so that they follow the objective of proﬁt maximization and
simply remit their proﬁts to the government. In this case they should certainly not be
included, since the government is acting as if it were a private shareholder. The only
differencebetweenthestate-runﬁrmandanyotherprivateﬁrminwhichthegovernment
is a shareholder would be the extent of the shareholding. Conversely, assume that the
state-run ﬁrm was directed by the government to follow a policy of investment in
impoverished areas and to use cross-subsidization to lower the prices of some of its

114
Part II: Government
products. In this case there are compelling reasons to include the activities of the ﬁrm
within the measure of government.
What this example illustrates is that it is not government expenditure per se that is
interesting to the economist. What is instead really relevant is the degree of inﬂuence
the government has over the economy. When the government is simply a shareholder, it
is not directly inﬂuencing the ﬁrm’s decisions. The converse is true when it directs the
ﬁrm’s actions. Looked at in this way, measuring the size of government via its expendi-
ture is a means of estimating government inﬂuence using an easily observable statistic.
In fact the extent of government inﬂuence is somewhat broader than just its expendi-
ture. What must also be included are the economic consequences of government-backed
regulations and restrictions on economic behavior. Minimum wage laws, weights and
measures regulation, health and safety laws, are all examples of government inter-
vention in the economy. However, none of these would feature in any observation of
government expenditure.
What this discussion shows is that there is a degree of ﬂexibility in interpreting mea-
sures of government expenditure. Furthermore government inﬂuence on the economy
is only approximately captured by the expenditure ﬁgure. The true extent, including all
relevant laws and regulations, is most certainly much larger.
4.7
Conclusions
This chapter has reviewed the expenditures and revenues of the public sector using
data from a range of countries. Despite their clear cultural differences the countries
considered have all experienced the same phenomenon of signiﬁcant public sector
growth in the last century. From being only a minor part of the economy at the start of
the last century, the public sector had grown to be signiﬁcant proportion of the gross
domestic product in all developed countries by the end of the century. There is some
variation within the ﬁgures for the precise level of public expenditure, but the pattern
of growth is the same for all. There is also evidence that the growth has now ceased,
and unless there is some major upheaval, the size of the public sector will now remain
fairly constant.
In terms of the composition of public sector revenue and expenditure, it can be noted
that there are differences in the details among countries. However, there is common
reliance on similar tax instruments. Spending patterns are also not too dissimilar. It is

115
Chapter 4: Public Sector Statistics
these commonalities that make the ideas and concepts of public economics so broadly
applicable.

Theories of the Public Sector
5.1
Introduction
The statistics of chapter 4 have described the size, growth, and composition of the pub-
lic sector in a range of developed and developing countries. The data illustrated that the
pattern of growth was similar across countries, as was the composition of expenditure.
Although there is some divergence in the size of the public sector, it is signiﬁcant in all
the countries. Such observations raise two interrelated questions. First, why is there a
public sector at all—would it not be possible for economic activity to function satisfac-
torily without government intervention? Second, is it possible to provide a theory that
explains the increase in size of the public sector and the composition of expenditure?
The purpose of this chapter is to consider possible answers to these questions.
The chapter begins with a discussion of the justiﬁcations that have been proposed for
the public sector. These show how the requirements of efﬁciency and equity lead to a
range of motives for public sector intervention in the economy.Alternative explanations
forthegrowthinthesizeofthepublicsectorarethenassessed.Asaby-product, theyalso
provide an explanation for the composition of expenditure. Finally, some economists
would argue that the public sector is excessively large. Several arguments for why this
may be so are considered.
5.2
Justiﬁcation for the Public Sector
Two basic lines of argument can be advanced to justify the role of the public sector.
These can be grouped under the headings of efﬁciency and equity. Efﬁciency relates to
arguments concerning the aggregate level of economic activity, whereas equity refers
to the distribution of economic beneﬁts. In considering these arguments, it is natural to
begin with efﬁciency because this is the more fundamental concept.
5.2.1
The Minimal State
The basic motivation for the existence of a public sector follows from the observation
that entirely unregulated economic activity cannot operate in a sophisticated way. In
short, an economy would not function effectively if there were no property rights (the

120
Part II: Government
rules deﬁning the ownership of property) or contract laws (the rules governing the
conduct of trade).
Without property rights, satisfactory exchange of commodities could not take place
given the lack of trust that would exist between contracting parties. This argument can
be traced back to Thomas Hobbes, who viewed the government as a social contract that
enables people to escape from the anarchic “state of nature” where their competition
in pursuit of self-interest would lead to a destructive “war of all against all.” The
institution of property rights is a ﬁrst step away from this anarchy. In the absence of
property rights, it would not be possible to enforce any prohibition against theft. Theft
discourages enterprise, since the gains accrued may be appropriated by others. It also
results in the use of resources in the unproductive business of theft prevention.
Contract laws determine the rules of exchange. They exist to ensure that the partici-
pants in a trade receive what they expect from that trade or, if they do not, have open
an avenue to seek compensation. Examples of contract laws include the formalization
of weights and measures and the obligation to offer product warranties. These laws
encourage trade by removing some of the uncertainty in transactions.
The establishment of property rights and contract laws is not sufﬁcient in itself.
Unless they can be policed and upheld in law, they are of limited consequence. Such law
enforcement cannot be provided free of cost. Enforcement ofﬁcers must be employed
and courts must be provided in which redress can be sought. In addition an advanced
society also faces a need for the enforcement of more general criminal laws. Moving
beyond this, once a country develops its economic activity, it will need to defend its
gainsfrombeingstolenbyoutsiders. Thisimpliestheprovisionofdefenseforthenation.
As the statistics made clear, national defense has at times been a very costly activity.
Consequently, even if only the minimal requirements of the enforcement of contract
and criminal laws and the provision of defense are met, a source of income must be
found to pay for them. This need for income requires the collection of revenue, whether
these services are provided by the state or by private sector organizations. But they are
needed in any economy that wishes to develop beyond the most rudimentary level.
Whether it is most efﬁcient for a central government to collect the revenue and provide
the services could be debated. Since there are some good reasons for assuming that this
is the case, the coordination of the collection of revenue and the provision of services
to ensure the attainment of efﬁcient functioning of economic activity provides a natural
role for a public sector.
This reasoning illustrates that to achieve even a most minimal level of economic
organization, some unavoidable revenue requirements are generated and require ﬁ-
nancing. From this follows the ﬁrst role of the public sector, which is to assist with

121
Chapter 5: Theories of the Public Sector
the attainment of economic efﬁciency by providing an environment in which trade can
ﬂourish. The minimal state provides contract law, polices it, and defends the economy
against outsiders. The minimal state does nothing more than this, but without it, orga-
nized economic activity could not take place. These arguments provide a justiﬁcation
for at least a minimal state and hence the existence of a public sector and of public
expenditure.
Having concluded that the effective organization of economic activity generates a
need for public expenditure, one role for public economics is to determine how this
revenue should be collected. The collection should be done with as little cost as possible
imposed on the economy. Such costs arise from the distortion in choice that arise from
taxation. Public economics aims to understand these distortions and to describe the
methods of minimizing their impact.
5.2.2
Market versus Government
Moving beyond the basic requirements for organized economic activity, there are other
situationswhereinterventionintheeconomycanpotentiallyincreasewelfare. However,
unlike the minimal provision and revenue requirements, there will always be a degree
of contentiousness about additional intervention whatever the ground on which it is
motivated. The situations where intervention may be warranted can be divided into
two categories: those that involve market failure and those that do not.
When market failure is present, the argument for considering whether intervention
would be beneﬁcial is compelling. For example, if economic activity generated exter-
nalities (effects that one economic agent imposes on another without their consent), so
that there is divergence between private and social valuations and the competitive out-
come is not efﬁcient, it may be felt necessary for the state to intervene to limit the inefﬁ-
ciency that results. This latter point can also be extended to other cases of market failure,
such as those connected to the existence of public goods and of imperfect competition.
Reacting to such market failures is intervention motivated on efﬁciency grounds.
It must be stressed that this reasoning does not imply that intervention will always be
beneﬁcial. In every case it must be demonstrated that the public sector has the ability
to improve on what the unregulated economy can achieve. This will not be possible
if the choice of policy tools is limited or government information is restricted. It will
also be undesirable if the government is not benevolent. These various imperfections
in public intervention will be a recurrent theme of this book.
Whilesomeusefulinsightsfollowfromtheassumptionofanomnipotent, omniscient,
and benevolent policy maker, in reality it can give us very misleading ideas about the

122
Part II: Government
possibilities of beneﬁcial policy intervention. It must be recognized that the actions
of the state, and the feasible policies that it can choose, are often restricted by the
same features of the economy that make the market outcome inefﬁcient. One role for
public economics is therefore to determine the desirable extent of the public sector or
the boundaries of state intervention. For instance, if we know that markets will fail
to be efﬁcient in the presence of imperfect information, then to establish the merit of
government intervention, it is crucial to know if a government subject to the same
informational limitations can achieve a better outcome.
Furthermore a government managed by nonbenevolent ofﬁcials and subject to po-
litical constraints may fail to correct market failures and may instead introduce new
costs of its own creation. It is important to recognize that this potential for government
failure is as important as market failure and that both are often rooted in the same
informational problems. At a very basic level the force of coercion must underlie every
government intervention in the economy. All policy acts take place, and in particular,
taxes are collected and industry is regulated, with this force in the background. But
the very power to coerce raises the possibility of its misuse. Although the intention
in creating this power is that its force should serve the general interest, nothing can
guarantee that once public ofﬁcials are given this monopoly of force, they will not try
to abuse this power in their own interest.
5.2.3
Equity
In addition to market failure, government intervention can be motivated by the obser-
vation that the economy may have widespread inequality of income, opportunity, or
wealth. This can occur even if the economy is efﬁcient in a narrow economic sense.
In such circumstances the level of economic welfare as viewed by the government
may well be raised by a policy designed to alleviate these inequalities. This is the rea-
soning through which the provision of state education, social security programs, and
compulsory pension schemes are justiﬁed. It should be stressed that the gains from
these policies are with respect to normative assessments of welfare, unlike the positive
criterion lying behind the concept of economic efﬁciency.
Inthecasesofbothmarketfailureandwelfare-motivatedpolicies, policyintervention
concerns more than just the efﬁcient collection of revenue. The reasons for the failure
of the economy to reach the optimal outcome have to be understood, and a policy that
can counteract these has to be designed. Extending the scope of the public economics
to address such issues provides the breadth to the subject.

123
Chapter 5: Theories of the Public Sector
5.2.4
Efﬁciency and Equity
When determining economic policy, governments are faced with two conﬂicting aims.
All governments are concerned with organizing economic activity so that the best use
is made of economic resources. This is the efﬁciency side of policy design. To varying
degrees, governments are also concerned to see that the beneﬁts of economic activity
are distributed fairly. This is the equity aspect of policy design.
The difﬁculty facing the government is that the requirements of equity and efﬁciency
frequently conﬂict. It is often the case that the efﬁcient policy is highly inequitable,
while the equitable policy can introduce signiﬁcant distortions and disincentives. Given
this fact, the challenge for policy design is to reach the correct trade-off between equity
and efﬁciency. Quite where on the trade-off the government should locate is dependent
on the relative importance it assigns to equity over efﬁciency.
In this context it is worth adding one ﬁnal note concerned with the nature of the
arguments often used in this book. A standard simpliﬁcation is to assume that there
is a single consumer or that all consumers are identical. In such a setting there can
be no distributional issues, so any policy recommendations derived within it relate
only to efﬁciency and not to equity. The reason for proceeding in this way is that it
usually permits a much simpler analysis to be undertaken and for the conclusions to
be much more precise. When interpreting such conclusions in terms of practical policy
recommendations, their basis should never be overlooked.
5.3
Public Sector Growth
The data of chapter 4 showed quite clearly the substantial growth of the public sector
in a range of countries during the past century. There are numerous theories that have
been advanced to explain why this has occurred. These differ in their emphasis and
perspective and are not mutually exclusive. In fact it is reasonable to argue that a
comprehensive explanation would involve elements drawn from all.
5.3.1
Development Models
The basis of the development models of public sector growth is that the economy expe-
riences changes in its structure and needs as it develops. Tracing the nature of the devel-
opment process from the beginning of industrialization through to the completion of the
development process, a story of why public sector expenditure increases can be told.

124
Part II: Government
It is possible to caricature the main features of this story in the following way: The
early stage of development is viewed as the period of industrialization during which
the population moves from the countryside to the urban areas. To meet the needs that
result from this, there is a requirement for signiﬁcant infrastructural expenditure in
the development of cities. The typically rapid growth experienced in this stage of
development results in a signiﬁcant increase in expenditure, and the dominant role of
infrastructure determines the nature of expenditure.
In what are called the middle stages of development, the infrastructural expenditure
of the public sector becomes increasingly complementary with expenditure from the
private sector. Developments by the private sector, such as factory construction, are
supported by investments from the public sector, such as the building of connecting
roads. As urbanization proceeds and cities increase in size, so does population density.
This generates a range of externalities such as pollution and crime. An increasing
proportion of public expenditure is then diverted away from spending on infrastructure
to the control of these externalities.
Finally, in the developed phase of the economy, there is less need for infrastructural
expenditure or for the correction of market failure. Instead, expenditure is driven by
the desire to react to issues of equity. This results in transfer payments, such as social
security, health, and education, becoming the main items of expenditure. Of course,
once such forms of expenditure become established, they are difﬁcult to ever reduce.
They also increase with heightened expectations and through the effect of an aging
population.
Although this theory of the growth of expenditure concurs broadly with the facts, it
has a number of weaknesses. Most important, it is primarily a description rather than
an explanation. From an economist’s perspective, the theory is lacking in that it does
not have any behavioral basis but is essentially mechanistic. What an economist really
would wish to see is an explanation in which expenditure is driven by the choices of
the individuals that constitute the economy. In the development model the change is
just driven by the exogenous process of economic progress. Changes in expenditure
should be related to how choices change as preferences or needs evolve over time.
5.3.2
Wagner’s Law
AdolphWagner was a nineteenth-century economist who analyzed data on public sector
expenditure for several European countries, Japan, and the United States. These data
revealed the fact that was shown in chapter 4: the share of the public sector in gross
domestic product had been increasing over time. The content of Wagner’s law was

125
Chapter 5: Theories of the Public Sector
an explanation of this trend and a prediction that it would continue. In contrast to the
basic developments models, Wagner’s analysis provided a theory rather then just a
description and an economic justiﬁcation for the predictions.
The basis for the theory consists of three distinct components. First, it was observed
that the growth of the economy results in an increase in complexity. Economic growth
requires continual introduction of new laws and the development of the legal structure.
Law and order imply continuing increases in public sector expenditure. Second, there
was the process of urbanization and the in creased externalities associated with it. These
two factors have already been discussed in connection with the development models.
The ﬁnal component underlying Wagner’s law is the most behavioral of the three
and is what distinguishes it from other explanations. Wagner argued that the goods
supplied by the public sector have a high income elasticity of demand. This claim
appears reasonable, for example, for education, recreation, and health care. Given this
fact, as economic growth raises incomes, there will be an increase in demand for these
products. In fact from a high elasticity it can be inferred that public sector expenditure
does rise as a proportion of income. This conclusion is the substance of Wagner’s law.
There have been many attempts at establishing whether Wagner’s law is empirically
valid. The problem that surfaces in all of these tests is how to disentangle the causality
between public expenditure and the level of income. Wagner’s law proposes that it is
income that explains expenditure. In contrast, there is much macroeconomic theory
in favor of the argument that government spending explains the level of income—this
was the essential insight of Keynesian economics. Tests to date have not convincingly
resolved this issue.
In many ways Wagner’s law provides a good explanation of public sector growth.
Its main failing is that it concentrates solely on the demand for public sector services.
What must determine the level is some interaction between demand and supply. The
supply side is explicitly analyzed in the next model.
5.3.3
Baumol’s Law
Rather than work from the observed data, Baumol’s law starts from an observation
about the nature of the production technology in the public sector. The basic hypothesis
is that the technology of the public sector is labor-intensive relative to that of the private
sector. In addition the type of production undertaken leaves little scope for increases
in productivity, and that makes it difﬁcult to substitute capital for labor. As examples,
hospitals need minimum numbers of nurses and doctors for each patient, and maximum
class sizes place lower limits on teacher numbers in schools.

126
Part II: Government
Competition on the labor market ensures that labor costs in the public sector are
linked to those in the private sector. Although there may be some frictions in trans-
ferring between the two, wage rates cannot be too far out of line. However, in the
private sector it is possible to substitute capital for labor when the relative cost of labor
increases. Furthermore technological advances in the private sector lead to increases
in productivity. These increases in productivity result in the return to labor rising. The
latter claim is simply a consequence of optimal input use in the private sector resulting
in the wage rate being equated to the marginal revenue product.
Since the public sector cannot substitute capital for labor, the wage increases in
the private sector feed through into cost increases in the public sector. Maintain-
ing a constant level of public sector output must therefore result in public sector
expenditure increasing. If public sector output/private sector output remain in the
same proportion, public sector expenditure rises as a proportion of total expenditure.
This is Baumol’s law, which asserts the increasing proportional size of the public
sector.
There are a number of problems with this theory. It is entirely technology driven
and does not consider aspects of supply and demand or political processes. There are
also reasons for believing that substitution can take place in the public sector. For
example, additional equipment can replace nurses, and less qualiﬁed staff can take on
more mundane tasks. Major productivity improvements have also been witnessed in
universities and hospitals. Finally, there is evidence of a steady decline in public sector
wages relative to those in the private sector. This reﬂects lower skilled labor being
substituted for more skilled.

A Political Model
A political model of public sector expenditure needs to capture the conﬂict in public
preferences between those who wish to have higher expenditure and those who wish
to limit the burden of taxes. It must also incorporate the resolution of this conﬂict and
show how the size and composition of actual public spending reﬂects the preferences of
the majority of citizens as expressed through the political process. The political model
we now describe is designed to achieve these aims. The main point that emerges is that
the equilibrium level of public spending can be related to the income distribution, and
more precisely that the growth of government is closely related to the rise of income
inequality.
To illustrate this, consider an economy with H consumers whose incomes fall into a
range between a minimum of 0 and a maximum of ˆy. The government provides a public

127
Chapter 5: Theories of the Public Sector
good that is ﬁnanced by the use of a proportional income tax. The utility of consumer
i who has income yi is given by
ui(t, G) = [1 −t] yi + b(G),
(5.1)
where t is the income tax rate and G the level of public good provision. The function b(·)
represents the beneﬁt obtained from the public good, and it is assumed to be increasing
(so the marginal beneﬁt is positive) and concave (so the marginal beneﬁt is falling) as
G increases. We denote by μ the mean income level in the population of consumers,
so the government budget constraint is
G = tHμ.
(5.2)
Using this budget constraint, a consumer with income yi will enjoy utility from
provision of a quantity G of the public good of
ui(G) =

1 −G
Hμ

yi + b(G).
(5.3)
The ideal level of public good provision for the consumer is given by the ﬁrst-order
condition
∂ui(G)
∂G
≡−yi
Hμ + b′(G) = 0.
(5.4)
This condition relates the marginal beneﬁt of an additional unit of the public good,
b′(G), to its marginal cost
yi
Hμ. The quantity of the public good demanded by the con-
sumer depends on their income relative to the mean, since this determines the marginal
cost.
The marginal beneﬁt of the public good has been assumed to be a decreasing function
of G, so it follows that the preferred public good level is decreasing as income rises. The
reason for this is that with a proportional income tax the rich pay a higher share of the
cost of public good than the poor. Thus public good provision will disproportionately
beneﬁt the poor.
The usual way to resolve the disagreement over the desired level of public good is to
choose by majority voting. If the level of public good is to be determined by majority
voting, which level will be chosen? In the context of this model the answer is clear-cut
because all consumers would prefer the level of public good to be as close as possible
to their preferred level. Given any pair of alternatives, consumers will vote for that
which is closest to their preferred alternative. The alternative that is closest for the
largest number of consumers will receive maximal support. There is in fact only one

128
Part II: Government
option that will satisfy this requirement: the option preferred by the consumer with the
median income. The reason is that exactly one-half of the electorate, above the median
income (the rich), would like less public good and the other half, below the median (the
poor), would like more public good. Any alternative that is better for one group would
be opposed by the other group with opposite preferences. (We explore the theory of
voting in detail in chapter 11.)
The political equilibrium G∗, determined by the median voter, is then the solution to
b′(G∗) = ym
Hμ,
(5.5)
where ym
μ is the income of the median voter relative to the mean. Since the marginal
beneﬁts decrease as public good provision increases, the political equilibrium level of
public good increases with income inequality as measured by the ratio of the median to
mean income. Accordingly, more inequality as measured by a lower ratio of the median
to mean income would lead the decisive median voter to require more public spending.
Government activities are perceived as redistributive tools. Redistribution can be
explicit, such as social security and poverty alleviation programs, or it can take a
more disguised form like public employment, which is probably the main channel of
redistribution from rich to poor in many countries. Because of its nature, and interaction
with the tax system, the demand for redistribution will increase as income inequality
increases as demonstrated by this political model.
5.3.5
Ratchet Effect
Models of the ratchet effect develop the modeling of political interaction in a differ-
ent direction. They assume that the preference of the government is to spend money.
Explanations of why this should be so can be found in the economics of bureaucracy,
which is explored in the next section. For now the fact is just taken as given. In contrast,
it is assumed that the public do not want to pay taxes. Higher spending can only come
from taxes, so by implication the public partially resists this; they do get some beneﬁt
from the expenditure. The two competing objectives are moderated by the fact that
governments desire re-election. This makes it necessary for government to take some
account of the public’s preferences.
The equilibrium level of public sector expenditure is determined by the balance be-
tween these competing forces. In the absence of any exogenous changes or of changes
in preferences, the level of expenditure will remain relatively constant. In the historical
data on government expenditure, the periods prior to 1914, between 1920 and 1940,

129
Chapter 5: Theories of the Public Sector
and post-1945 can be interpreted as displaying such constancy. Occasionally, though,
economies go through periods of signiﬁcant upheaval such as occurs during wartime.
During these periods normal economic activity is disrupted. Furthermore the equilib-
rium between the government and the taxpayers becomes suspended. Ratchet models
argue that wartime permits the government to raise expenditure with the consent of the
taxpayers on the understanding that this is necessary to meet the exceptional needs that
have arisen.
The ﬁnal aspect of the argument is that the level of expenditure does not fall back to
its original level after the period of upheaval. Several reasons can be advanced for this.
First, the taxpayers become accustomed to the higher level of expenditure and perceive
this as the norm. Second, debts incurred during the period of upheaval have to be paid
off later. This requires the raising of ﬁnance. Third, promises made by the government
to the taxpayers during periods of upheaval then have to be met. These can jointly
be termed ratchet effects that sustain a higher level of spending. Finally, there may
occur an inspection effect after an upheaval whereby the taxpayers and government
reconsider their positions and priorities. The discovery of previously unnoticed needs
then provides further justiﬁcation for higher public sector spending.
The prediction of the ratchet-effect model is that spending remains relatively constant
unless disturbed by some signiﬁcant external event. These events can trigger substantial
increases in expenditure. The ratchet and inspection effects work together to ensure that
expenditure remains at the higher level until the next upheaval.
The description of expenditure growth given by this political model is broadly consis-
tent with the data of chapter 4. Before 1914, between 1918 and 1940, and post-1945 the
level of expenditure is fairly constant but steps up between these periods. Whether this
provides support for the explanation is debatable because the model was constructed
to explain these known facts. In other words, the data cannot be employed as evidence
that the model is correct, given that the model was designed to explain that data.

Excessive Government
The theories of the growth of public sector expenditure described above attempt to
explain the facts but do not offer comment on whether the level of expenditure is
deﬁcientorexcessive. Theymerelydescribeprocessesanddonotattempttoevaluatethe
outcome. There are in fact many economists who argue that public sector expenditure
is too large and represents a major burden on the economy. While the evidence on this
issue is certainly not conclusive, there are a number of explanations of why this should

130
Part II: Government
be so. Several are now described that reach their conclusions not through a cost–beneﬁt
analysis of expenditure but via an analysis of the functioning of government.
5.4.1
Bureaucracy
A traditional view of bureaucrats is that they are motivated solely by the desire to serve
the common good. They achieve this by conducting the business of government in the
most efﬁcient manner possible without political or personal bias. This is the idealistic
image of the bureaucrat as a selﬂess public servant. There is a possibility that such a
view may be correct. Having said this, there is no reason why bureaucrats should be
any different from other individuals. From this perspective it is difﬁcult to accept that
they are not subject to the same motivations of self-serving.
Adopting this latter perspective, the theoretical analysis of bureaucracy starts with
the assumption that bureaucrats are indeed motivated by maximization of their private
utilities. If they could, they would turn the power and inﬂuence that their positions
give them into income. But, due to the nature of their role, they face difﬁculties in
achieving this. Unlike similarly positioned individuals in the private sector, they cannot
exploit the market to raise income. Instead, they resort to obtaining utility from pursuing
nonpecuniary goals. A complex theory of bureaucracy may include many factors that
inﬂuence utility such as patronage, power, and reputation. However, to construct a
basic variant of the theory, it is sufﬁcient to observe that most of these factors can be
related to the size of the bureau. The bureaucrat can therefore be modeled as aiming to
maximize the size of his bureau in order to obtain the greatest nonpecuniary beneﬁts.
It is as a result of this behavior that the size of government becomes excessive.
To demonstrate excessive bureaucracy, let y denote the output of the bureau as
observed by the government. In response to an output y, the bureau is rewarded by
the government with a budget of size B (y). This budget increases as observed output
rises (B′ (y) > 0) but at a falling rate (B′′ (y) < 0 ). The cost of producing output is
given by a cost function C (y). Marginal cost is positive (C′ (y) > 0) and increasing
(C′′ (y) > 0). It is assumed that the government does not know this cost structure—only
the bureaucrat fully understands the production process. What restrains the behavior
of the bureaucrat is the requirement that the budget received from the government is
sufﬁcient to cover the costs of running the bureau.
The decision problem of the bureaucrat is then to choose output to maximize the
budget subject to the requirement that the budget is sufﬁcient to cover costs. This
optimization can be expressed by the Lagrangian
L = B(y) + λ[B (y) −C(y)] ,
(5.6)

131
Chapter 5: Theories of the Public Sector
where λ is the Lagrange multiplier on the constraint that the budget equals cost. Dif-
ferentiating the Lagrangian with respect to y and solving characterizes the optimum
output from the perspective of the bureaucrat, yb, by
B′
yb
=
λ
λ + 1C′
yb
.
(5.7)
Since the Lagrange multiplier, λ, is positive, this expression implies that B′< C′ at the
bureaucrats optimum choice of output.
We wish to contrast the bureaucracy outcome with the outcome that occurs when
the government has full information. With full information there exists a variety of
ways to model efﬁciency. One way would be to place the bureau within a more general
setting and consider its output as one component of overall government intervention. A
cost–beneﬁt calculation for government intervention would then determine the efﬁcient
level of bureau output. A simpler alternative, and the one we choose to follow, is to
determine the efﬁcient output by drawing an analogy between the bureau and a proﬁt-
maximizing ﬁrm. The ﬁrm chooses its output to ensure that the difference between
revenue and costs is made as large as possible. By this analogy, the bureau should
choose output to maximize its budget less costs, B (y) −C (y). For the bureau this is
the equivalent of proﬁt maximization.
Differentiating with respect to y, we equate the marginal effect of output on the
budget to marginal cost and determine the efﬁcient output y∗. The efﬁcient output
satisﬁes B′ (y∗) = C′ (y∗). The output level chosen by the bureaucrat can easily be
shown to be above the efﬁcient level. This argument is illustrated in ﬁgure 5.1. The
increasing marginal cost curve and declining marginal beneﬁt curve are consequences
of the assumptions already made. The efﬁcient output occurs at the intersection of these
curves. In contrast, the output chosen by the bureaucrat satisﬁes B′ 
yb
< C′ 
yb
, so
it must lie to the right of y∗. In fact the budget covers costs when the area under the
marginal budget curve a equals the area under the marginal cost curve b. It is clear
from this ﬁgure that the large size of the bureaucracy is determined by the excesses of
an individual bureaucrat.
This simple model shows how the pursuit of personal objectives by bureaucrats
can lead to an excessive size of bureaucracy. Adding together the individual bureaus
that comprise the public sector makes this excessive in the aggregate. The excessive
size is simply an inefﬁciency, since money is spent on bureaus that are not generating
sufﬁciently valuable results.
The argument just given is enticing in its simplicity, but it is restricted by the fact
that it is assumed that the bureaucrats have freedom to set the size of the bureau. There

are various ways this limitation can be addressed. Useful extensions are to have the
freedom constrained by political pressure or through a demand function. Although
doing either of these would lessen the excess, the basic moral that bureaucrats have
incentives to overly enlarge their bureaus would still remain. Whether they do so in
practice is dependent on the constraints placed on them.
5.4.2
Budget-Setting
An alternative perspective on excessive bureaucracy can be obtained by considering
a different process of budget determination. A motivation for this is the fact that each
government department is headed by a politician who obtains satisfaction from the size
of the budget. Furthermore, in many government systems, budgets for departments are
determined annually by a cabinet meeting. This meeting takes the budget bids from
the individual departments and allocates a central budget on the basis of these bids.
Providing a model incorporating the bids then determines how departments’ budgets
evolve over time.
Asimple process of this form can be the following: Let the budget for year t be given
by Bt. The budget claim for year t + 1 is then given by
Bc
t+1 = [1 + α]Bt,
(5.8)

133
Chapter 5: Theories of the Public Sector
where α > 0 is the rate at which departments inﬂate their budget claims. Such a rule
represents a straightforward mechanical method of updating the budget claim—last
year’s is taken and a little more added. It is, of course, devoid of any basis in efﬁciency.
The meeting of cabinet then takes these bids and proportionately reduces them to reach
the ﬁnal allocation. The agreed budget is written as
Bt+1 = [1 −γ ]Bc
t+1 = [1 −γ ] [1 + α]Bt,
(5.9)
where 0 < γ < 1 is the rate at which the cabinet deﬂates each budget claim. The
expression above gives a description of the change in the budget over time.
It can be seen that if α > γ , then the budget will grow over time. Its development
bears little relationship to needs, so there is every possibility that expenditure will
eventually become excessive even if it initially begins at an acceptable level. When
α < γ , the budget will fall over time. Although either case is possible, the observed
pattern of growth lends some weight to the former assumption.
This form of model could easily be extended to incorporate more complex dynamics
but without enhancing the content of the simple story it tells. The modeling of budget de-
termination as a process entirely independent on what is good for the economy provides
an important alternative perspective on how the public sector may actually function.
Even if the truth is not quite this stark, reasoning of this kind does put into context
models that are based on the assumption that the government is informed and efﬁcient.
5.4.3
Monopoly Power
The basis of elementary economics is that market equilibrium is determined via the
balance of supply and demand. Those supplying the market are assumed to be distinct
from those demanding the product. In the absence of monopoly power, the equilibrium
that is achieved will be efﬁcient. If the same reasoning could be applied to the goods
supplied by the public sector, then efﬁciency would also arise there. Unfortunately,
there are two reasons why efﬁciency is not possible. First, the public sector can award
itself a monopoly in the supply of its goods and services. Second, this monopoly power
may be extended into market capture.
Generally, a proﬁt-maximizing monopolist will always want to restrict its level of
output below the competitive level so that monopoly power will provide a tendency
for too little government rather than the converse. This would be a powerful argument
were it not for the fact that the government can choose not to exercise its monopoly
power in this way. If it is attempting to achieve efﬁciency, then it will certainly not

134
Part II: Government
do so. Furthermore, since the government may not be following a policy of proﬁt
maximization, it might actually exploit its monopoly position to oversupply its output.
This takes the analysis back in the direction of the bureaucracy model.
The idea of market capture is rather more interesting and arises from the nature of
goods supplied by the public sector. Rather than being standard market goods, many of
them are complex in nature and not fully understood by those consuming them. Natural
examples of such goods would be education and health care. In both cases the consumer
may not understand quite what the product is, nor what is best for them. Although this
is important, it is also true of many other goods. The additional feature of the public
sector commodities is that demand is not determined by the consumers and expressed
through a market. Instead, it is delegated to specialists such as teachers and doctors.
Furthermore these same specialists are also responsible for setting the level of supply.
In this sense they can be said to capture the market.
The consequence of this market capture is that the specialists can set the level of
output for the market that most meets their objectives. Naturally, since most would
beneﬁt from an expansion of their profession, within limits, this gives a mechanism
that leads to supply in excess of the efﬁcient level. The limits arise because they won’t
want to go so far that competition reduces the payment received or lowers standards
too far. Effectively they are reaching a trade-off between income and power, where the
latter arises through the size of the profession. The resulting outcome has no grounds
in efﬁciency and may well be too large.
5.4.4
Corruption
Corruption does not emerge as a moral aberration but as a general consequence of gov-
ernment ofﬁcials using their power for personal gain. Corruption distorts the allocation
of resources away from productive toward rent-seeking occupations. Rent-seeking
(studied in chapter 12) is the attempt to obtain a return above what is judged adequate
by the market. Monopoly proﬁt is one example, but the concept is much broader. Cor-
ruption is not just redistributive (taking wealth from others to give it to some special
interests), it can also have enormous efﬁciency costs. By discouraging the entrepreneurs
on whom they prey, corruptible ofﬁcials may have the effect of stunting economic
growth.
Perhaps the most important form of corruption in many countries is predatory regula-
tion. This is the process by which the government intentionally creates regulations that
entrepreneurs have to pay bribes to get around. Because it raises the cost of productive
activity, this form of corruption reduces efﬁciency. The damage is particularly large

135
Chapter 5: Theories of the Public Sector
when several government ofﬁcials, acting independently, create distinct obstacles to
economic activity so that each can collect a separate bribe in return for removing the ob-
stacle (e.g., creating the need for a license and then charging for it). When entrepreneurs
face all these independent regulatory obstacles, they eventually cease trying, or else
move into the underground economy to escape regulation altogether. Thus corruption
is purely harmful from this perspective.
How could we give a positive role for a bribe-based corruption system? One pos-
sibility is that bribery is like an auction mechanism that directs resources to their best
possible use. For example, corruption in procurement is similar to auctioning off the
contract to the most efﬁcient entrepreneur who can afford the highest bribe. However,
there are some problems with this bribery-based system. First, we care about the means
as well as the ends. Bribery is noxious.Allowing bribery will destroy much of the good-
will that supports the system. Second, people should not be punished for their honesty.
Indeed honest government ofﬁcials can be used to create benchmarks by which to judge
the performance of the more opportunistic ofﬁcials. Third, it is impossible to optimize
or even manage underground activities such as bribery.
5.4.5
Government Agency
Another explanation for excessive government is the lack of information available to
voters. The imperfect information of voters enables the government to grow larger by
increasing the tax burden. From this perspective government growth reﬂects the abuse
of power by greedy bureaucrats. The central question is then how to set incentives that
encourage the government to work better and to cost less, subject to the information
available.
To illustrate this point, consider a situation where the cost to the government of
supplying a public good can vary. The unit cost is either low, at cℓ, or is high, at ch.
The gross beneﬁt to the public from a level Gi of public good is given by the function
b(Gi), which is increasing and concave. The net beneﬁt is b(Gi)−ti, where ti is the tax
paid to the government for the public good provision. The chosen quantity of the public
good will depend on the unit cost of the government. The beneﬁt to the government of
providing the public good is the difference between the tax and the cost. So, when the
cost is ci, the beneﬁt is ti −ciGi.
When the public is informed about the level of cost of the government, the quantity
of public good will be chosen to maximize the net beneﬁt subject to the government
breaking even. For cost ci, the public net beneﬁt with the government breaking even
is b(Gi) −ciGi. The public will demand a level of public good such that the marginal

136
Part II: Government
beneﬁt is equal to the marginal cost, namely b′(Gi) = ci, and will pay the government
ti = ciGi, for i = h, ℓ. This is shown in ﬁgure 5.2.
Now assume that the public cannot observe whether the government has cost cℓor
ch. The government can then beneﬁt by misrepresenting the cost to the public: for
instance, it can exaggerate the cost by adding expenditures that beneﬁt the government
but not the public. When the cost is high, the government cannot exaggerate. When
the cost is low, the government is better off pretending the cost is high to get tax th for
the amount Gh of public good instead of getting tℓfor producing Gℓ. Misrepresenting
in this way leads to the beneﬁt of Gh[ch −cℓ] for the government, which is shown in
ﬁgure 5.2.
To eliminate this temptation, taxpayers must pay an extra amount r > 0 to the gov-
ernment in excess of its cost when the government pretends to have the low cost. This
is called the informational rent. Since the truly high-cost government cannot further
inﬂate its cost, the public pays th = chGh when the government reports a high cost. If
the reported cost is low, the taxpayers demand the amount Gℓof public good deﬁned
by b′(Gℓ) = cℓand pay the government tℓ= cℓGℓ+ r, where r is exactly the extra
revenue the government could have made if it had pretended to have high cost. To give
a government with a low cost just enough revenue to offset its temptation to pretend
to have higher cost, it is necessary that r = [ch −cl]Gh. This is the rent required to
induce truthful revelation of the cost and have the provision of the public good equal
to that when the public is fully informed.

Chapter 5: Theories of the Public Sector
It is possible for the taxpayers to reduce this excess payment by demanding that the
high-cost government supply less than it would with full information. Assume that cost
is low with probability pℓand high with probability ph = 1 −pℓ. By maximizing
their expected beneﬁt subject to the government telling the truth, it can be shown that
revelation can be obtained at the least cost by demanding an amount Gh of public
services deﬁned by
b′(Gh) = ch +
pℓ
1 −pℓ
[ch −cℓ].
(5.10)
This quantity is lower than that with full information. The distortion of the quantity
demanded from the high-cost government results from a simple cost–beneﬁt argument.
It trades off the beneﬁt of reducing the rent, which is proportional to the cost difference
[ch −cℓ], and the probability pℓthat the government is of the low-cost type against the
cost of imposing the distortion of the quantity on the high-cost government that occurs
with probability 1 −pℓ.
Therefore, if the government is truly low cost, it need not be given the high tax.
However, to eliminate the temptation for cost inﬂation, taxpayers have to provide the
government just enough of the rent as a reward for reporting truthfully when its cost of
public services is low. Because the ability of the government to misrepresent its costs
allows it to earn rents and distort the level of provision, eventually the informational
rent makes the government bigger than it should be.
5.4.6
Cost Diffusion
The last explanation we present for the possibility of excessively large government
is the common resource problem. The idea is that spending authorities are dispersed
while the treasury has the responsibility of collecting enough revenue to balance the
overall budget. Each of the spending authorities has its own spending priorities, with
little consideration for others’ priorities, that it can be better met by raiding the overall
budget. This is the common resource problem, just like that of several oil companies
tapping into a common pool underground or ﬁshermen netting in a single lake. In all
cases it leads to excess pressure on the common resource. From this perspective, a single
committeewithexpenditureauthoritywouldhaveamuchbettersenseoftheopportunity
cost of public funds, and could better compare the merits of alternative proposals, than
the actual dispersed spending authorities. The current trend toward federalism and
devolution aggravates this common-pool problem. The reason is essentially that each
district can impose projects whose cost is shared by all other districts, and so support

138
Part II: Government
higher size projects than they would if they had to cover the full costs. We discuss in
more detail the various aspects of federalism in chapter 19.
The problem can also be traced down to the individual level. Consider public services
like pensions, health care, and schools and infrastructure work like bridges, roads, and
rail tracks. It is clear that for these public services, and many others, the government
does not charge the direct users the full marginal cost but subsidizes the activities partly
or wholly from tax revenues. There is an obvious equity concern behind this fact. But it
is then natural that users who do not bear the full cost will support more public services
than they would if they had to cover the full cost. The same argument applies in the
opposite direction when contemplating some cut in public spending: contributors who
are asked to make concessions are concentrated and possibly organized through a lobby
with large per capita beneﬁts from continued provision of speciﬁc public services. In
contrast, the beneﬁciaries of downsizing public spending, the taxpayers as a whole,
are diffuse with small per capita stakes. This makes it less likely that they can offer
organized support for the reform. To sum up, many public services are characterized by
the concentration of beneﬁts to a small group of users or recipients and the diffusion of
costs to the large group of taxpayers. This results in biases toward continuous demand
for more public spending.
5.5
Conclusions
This chapter has provided a number of theories of public sector growth that are designed
to explain the data presented in chapter 4. Each theory has some points to commend
it, but none is entirely persuasive. It is fair to say that all provide a partial insight
and have some element of truth. A more general story drawing together the full set of
components, including the ratchet effect, income effect, political process, production
technology, and bureaucracy, would have much in its favor. This would be especially
so if combined with the voting models of chapter 11.
The bureaucracy models are particularly attractive because they show how economic
analysis can be applied to what appears to be a noneconomic problem. In doing so,
they generate an interesting conclusion that casts doubt on the efﬁciency of government.
This illustrates how the method of economic reasoning can be applied to understand
the outcome of what is at ﬁrst sight a noneconomic problem.
The perennial question of whether the government has grown too large is difﬁcult
to answer. The reason is that the government is both complementary to the market
and a competitor of the market. As a major employer the government competes with

139
Chapter 5: Theories of the Public Sector
businesses looking to hire talented people. The possibility that the best and brightest be-
come public ofﬁcials and politicians, rather than entrepreneurs, is considered by many
as very costly to society, since they are seen as devoting their talents to taking wealth
from others rather than creating it. When people pay taxes, they have less money to
spend on other goods and services provided by the market. Likewise, when the govern-
ment borrows money, it competes with companies looking to raise capital. In some areas
like health care and education, public and private services compete with each other. But
at the same time the government also serves as a useful complement to every business
activity by providing basic infrastructure and civil order. Every business depends on
the government for things like protection of life and property, a transportation network,
civil courts, and a stable currency. Without these things, people couldn’t do business.
Finally, whether an activity is carried out in the public sector or the private sec-
tor is itself endogenous. As in architecture, the functions suggest the form. Take the
example of education where the goals are multiple (literacy, vocational skills, citizen-
ship, equality of chance, preparation for life) and not precisely measurable and where
several stakeholders are involved (parents, employers, students, teachers, taxpayers)
with possibly conﬂicting interests. It is not immediately clear that the market with its
single-minded focus can cope adequately with all these aspects, and the risk is that the
market could bias the activity toward dimensions that matter more for proﬁt-making.

Public Goods

Introduction
When a government provides a level of national defense sufﬁcient to make a country
secure, all inhabitants are simultaneously protected. Equally, when a radio program is
broadcast, it can be received simultaneously by all listeners in range of the transmitter.
The possibility for many consumers to beneﬁt from a single unit of provision violates
the assumption of the private nature of goods underlying the efﬁciency analysis of
chapter 2. The Two Theorems relied on all goods being private in nature, so they can
only be consumed by a single consumer. If there are public goods such as national
defense in the economy, then market failure occurs and the unregulated competitive
equilibrium will fail to be efﬁcient. This inefﬁciency implies that there is a potential
role for government intervention.
The chapter begins by deﬁning a public good, and distinguishing between public
goodsandprivategoods. Doingsoprovidesconsiderableinsightintowhymarketfailure
arises when there are public goods. The inefﬁciency is demonstrated by analyzing the
equilibrium that is achieved when it is left to the market to provide public goods. The
Samuelson rule characterizing the efﬁcient provision of a public good is then derived.
This permits a comparison of the equilibrium and with an efﬁcient allocation.
The focus of the chapter next turns to the consideration of methods through which
efﬁciency can be achieved. The ﬁrst of these, the Lindahl equilibrium, is based on the
observation that the price each consumer pays for the public good should reﬂect their
valuation of it. The Lindahl equilibrium achieves efﬁciency, but since the valuations
are private information, it generates incentives for consumers to provide false informa-
tion. Mechanisms designed to elicit the correct statement of these valuations are then
considered. The theoretical results are contrasted with the outcomes of experiments
designed to test the extent of false statement of valuations and the use of market data
to calculate valuations. These results are primarily static in nature. To provide some
insight into the dynamic aspects of public good provision, the chapter is completed
by the analysis of two different forms of fund-raising campaign that permit sequential
contributions.

Deﬁnitions
Thepurepublicgood hasbeenthesubjectofmosteconomicanalysesofpublicgoods. In
many ways the pure public good is an abstraction that is adopted to provide a benchmark
case against which other, more realistic, cases can be assessed. A pure public good has
the following two properties:
• Nonexcludability
If the public good is supplied, no consumer can be excluded from
consuming it.
• Nonrivalry
Consumption of the public good by one consumer does not reduce the
quantity available for consumption by any other.
In contrast, a private good is excludable at no cost and is perfectly rivalrous: if it is
consumed by one person, then none of it remains for any other. Although they were
not made explicit, these properties of a private good have been implicit in how we
have analyzed market behavior in earlier chapters. As we will see, the efﬁciency of the
competitive economy is dependent on them.
The two properties that characterize a public good have important implications.
Consider a ﬁrm that supplies a pure public good. Since the good is nonexcludable,
if the ﬁrm supplies one consumer, then it has effectively supplied the public good to
all. The ﬁrm can charge the initial purchaser but cannot charge any of the subsequent
consumers. This prevents it from obtaining payment for the total consumption of the
public good. The fact that there is no rivalry in consumption implies that the consumers
should have no objection to multiple consumption. These features prevent the operation
of the market equalizing marginal valuations as it does to achieve efﬁciency in the
allocation of private goods.
In practice, it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd any good that perfectly satisﬁes both the conditions of
nonexcludability and nonrivalry precisely. For example, the transmission of a television
signal will satisfy nonrivalry, but exclusion is possible at ﬁnite cost by scrambling the
signal. Similar comments apply, for example, to defense spending, which will eventu-
ally be rivalrous as a country of ﬁxed size becomes crowded and from which exclusion
is possible by deportation. Most public goods eventually suffer from congestion when
too many consumers try to use them simultaneously. For example, parks and roads are
public goods that can become congested. The effect of congestion is to reduce the ben-
eﬁt the public good yields to each user. Public goods that are excludable, but at a cost,
or suffer from congestion beyond some level of use are called impure. The properties

of impure public goods place them between the two extremes of private goods and pure
public goods.
A simple diagram summarizing the different types of good and the names given to
them is shown in ﬁgure 6.1. These goods vary in the properties of excludability and
rivalry. In fact, it is helpful to envisage a continuum of goods that gradually vary in
nature as they become more rivalrous or more easily excludable.
The pure private good and the pure public good have already been identiﬁed. An
example of a common property good is a lake that can be used for ﬁshing by anyone
who wishes, or a ﬁeld that can be used for grazing by any farmer. This class of goods
(usually called the commons) is studied in chapter 8. The problem with the commons
is the tendency of overusing them, and the usual solution is to establish property rights
to govern access. This is what happened in the sixteenth century in England where
common land was enclosed and became property of the local landlords. The landlords
then charged grazing fees, and so cut back the use. In some instances property rights are
hard to deﬁne and enforce, as is the case of the control over the high seas or air quality.
For this reason only voluntary cooperation can solve the international problems of
overﬁshing, acid rain, and the greenhouse effect. Club goods are public goods for which
exclusion is possible. The terminology is motivated by sport clubs whose facilities are
a public good for members but from which nonmembers can be excluded. Clubs are
studied in chapter 7.

Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
6.3
Private Provision
Public goods do not conform to the assumptions required for a competitive economy to
be efﬁcient. Their characteristics of nonexcludability and nonrivalry lead to the wrong
incentives for consumers. Since they can share in consumption, each consumer has
an incentive to rely on others to make purchases of the public good. This reliance on
others to purchase is call free-riding, and it is this that leads to inefﬁciency.
To provide a model that can reveal the motive for free-riding and its consequences,
consider two consumers who have to allocate their incomes between purchases of a
private good and of a public good. Assume that the consumers take the prices of the two
goods as ﬁxed when they make their decisions. If the goods were both private, we could
move immediately to the conclusion that an efﬁcient equilibrium would be attained.
What makes the public good different is that each consumer derives a beneﬁt from the
purchases of the other. This link between the consumers, which is absent with private
goods, introduces strategic interaction into the decision processes. With the strategic
interaction the consumers are involved in a game, so equilibrium is found using the
concept of a Nash equilibrium.
The consumers have income levels M1 and M2. Income must be divided between
purchases of the private good and the public good. Both goods are assumed to have a
price of 1. With xh used to denote purchase of the private good by consumer h and gh
to denote purchase of the public good, the choices must satisfy the budget constraint
Mh = xh +gh. The link between consumers comes from the fact that the consumption
of the public good for each consumer is equal to the total quantity purchased, g1 + g2.
Hence, when making the purchase decision, each consumer must take account of the
decision of the other.
This interaction is captured in the preferences of consumer h by writing the utility
function as
Uh
xh, g1 + g2
.
(6.1)
The standard Nash assumption is now imposed that each consumer takes the purchase
of the other as given when they make their decision. By this assumption, consumer 1
chooses g1 to maximize utility given g2, while consumer 2 chooses g2 given g1. This
can be expressed by saying that the choice of consumer 1 is the best reaction to g2 and
that of consumer 2 the best reaction to g1. The Nash equilibrium occurs when these
reactions are mutually compatible, so that the choice of each is the best reaction to the
choice of the other.

Preferences and choice
The Nash equilibrium can be displayed by analyzing the preferences of the two
consumers over different combination of g1 and g2. Consider consumer 1. Using the
budget constraint, we can write their utility as U1
M1 −g1, g1 + g2
. The indifference
curves of this utility function are shown in ﬁgure 6.2. These can be understood by noting
that an increase in g2 will always lead to a higher utility level for any value of g1. For
given g2, an increase in g1 will initially increase utility as more preferred combinations
of private and public good are achieved. Eventually, further increases in g1 will reduce
utility as the level of private good consumption becomes too small relative to that of
public good. The income level places an upper limit upon g1.
Consumer 1 takes the provision of 2 as given when making their choice. Consider
consumer 2 having chosen g2. The choices open to consumer 1 then lie along the
horizontal line drawn at g2 in ﬁgure 6.2. The choice that maximizes the utility of
consumer 1 occurs at the tangency of an indifference curve and the horizontal line—
this is the highest indifference curve they can reach. This is shown as the choice ˆg1. In
the terminology we have chosen, ˆg1 is the best reaction to g2. Varying the level of g2
will lead to another best reaction for consumer 1. Doing this for all possible g2 traces
out the optimal choices of g1 shown by the locus through the lowest point on each
indifference curve. This locus is known as the Nash reaction function (or best-response
function) and depicts the value of g1 that will be chosen in response to a value of g2.
This construction can be repeated for consumer 2 and leads to ﬁgure 6.3. For consumer
2, utility increases with g1, and thus indifference curves further to the right reﬂect

higher utility levels. The best reaction for consumer 2 is shown by ˆg2, which occurs
where the indifference curve is tangential to the vertical line at g1. The Nash reaction
function links the points where the indifference curves are vertical.
The Nash equilibrium occurs where the choices of the two consumers are the best
reactions to each other, so neither has an incentive to change their choice. This can only
hold at a point where the Nash reaction functions cross. The equilibrium is illustrated
in ﬁgure 6.4 in which the reaction functions are simultaneously satisﬁed at their inter-
section. By deﬁnition, ˆg1 is the best reaction to ˆg2 and ˆg2 is the best reaction to ˆg1.
The equilibrium is privately optimal: if a consumer were to unilaterally raise or reduce
his purchase, then he would move to a lower indifference curve.
Having determined the equilibrium, its welfare properties can now be addressed.
From the construction of the reaction functions, it follows that at the equilibrium the
indifference curve of consumer 1 is horizontal and that of consumer 2 is vertical. This
is shown in ﬁgure 6.5. It can be seen that all the points in the shaded area are Pareto-
preferred to the equilibrium—moving to one of these points will make both consumers
better off. Starting at the equilibrium, these points can be achieved by both consumers
simultaneously raising their purchase of the public good. The Nash equilibrium is
therefore not Pareto-efﬁcient, although it is privately efﬁcient. No further Pareto im-
provements can be made when a point is reached where the indifference curves are
tangential. The locus of these tangencies, which constitutes the set of Pareto-efﬁcient
allocations, is also shown in ﬁgure 6.5.

154
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
The analysis has demonstrated that when individuals privately choose the quantity
of the public goods they purchase, the outcome is Pareto-inefﬁcient. A Pareto im-
provement can be achieved by all consumers increasing the purchases of public goods.
Consequently, compared to Pareto-preferred allocations, the total level of the public
good consumed is too low. Why is this so? The answer can be attributed to strategic
interaction and the free-riding that results. The free-riding emerges from each consumer
relying on the other to provide the public good and thus avoiding the need to provide
for themselves. Since both consumers are attempting to free-ride in this way, too little
of the public good is ultimately purchased. In the absence of government intervention
or voluntary cooperation, inefﬁciency arises.
6.4
Efﬁcient Provision
Efﬁciency in consumption for private goods is guaranteed by each consumer equating
their marginal rate of substitution to the price ratio. The strategic interaction inherent
with public goods does not ensure such equality. At a Pareto-efﬁcient allocation with
the public good, the indifference curves are tangential. However, this does not imply
equality of the marginal rates of substitution because the indifference curves are deﬁned
over quantities of the public good purchased by the two consumers. As will soon be
shown, the efﬁciency condition involves the sum of marginal rates of substitution and
is termed the Samuelson rule in honor of its discoverer.
The basis for deriving the Samuelson rule can be observed in ﬁgure 6.5, where the
locus of Pareto-efﬁcient allocations has the property that the indifference curves of the
two consumers are tangential. The gradient of these indifference curves is given by
the rate at which g2 can be traded for g1 while keeping utility constant. The tangency
conditions can then be expressed by requiring that the gradients are equal so that

Multiplying across by MRS1
G,x × MRS2
G,x, we solve (6.4) and get the ﬁnal expression
MRS1
G,x + MRS2
G,x = 1.
(6.5)
This is the two-consumer version of the Samuelson rule.
To interpret this rule, the marginal rate of substitution should be viewed as a measure
of the marginal beneﬁt of another unit of the public good. The marginal cost of a
unit of public good is one unit of private good. Therefore the rule says that an efﬁcient
allocation is achieved when the total marginal beneﬁt of another unit of the public good,
which is the sum of the individual beneﬁts, is equal to the marginal cost of another unit.
The rule can easily be extended to incorporate additional consumers: the total beneﬁt
remains the sum of the individual beneﬁts.
Further insight into the Samuelson rule can be obtained by contrasting it with the
corresponding rule for efﬁcient provision of two private goods. For two consumers, 1
and 2, and two private goods, i and j, this is
MRS1
i,j = MRS2
i,j = MRTi,j,
(6.6)
where MRTi,j denotes the marginal rate of transformation, the number of units of
one good the economy has to given up to obtain an extra unit of the other good. (The
MRTG,x between public and private good was assumed to be equal to 1 in the derivation
of the Samuelson rule in equation 6.5.) The difference between (6.5) and (6.6) arises
because an extra unit of the public good increases the utility of all consumers so that
the social beneﬁt of this extra unit is found by summing the marginal beneﬁts. This
does not require equalization of the marginal beneﬁt of all consumers. In contrast, an
extra unit of private good can only be given to one consumer or another. Efﬁciency
then occurs when it does not matter who the extra unit is given to so that the marginal
beneﬁts of all consumers are equalized.
The Samuelson rule provides a very simple description of the efﬁcient outcomes, but
this does not mean that efﬁciency is easily obtained. It was already shown that efﬁciency
will not be achieved if there is no government intervention and agents act noncoop-
eratively (i.e., adopt Nash behavior). But what form should government intervention

156
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
take? The most direct solution would be for the government to take total responsibility
for provision of the public good and to ﬁnance it through lump-sum taxation. Because
lump-sum taxes do not cause any distortions, this would ensure satisfaction of the rule.
However, there are numerous difﬁculties in using lump-sum taxation, which will be
explored in detail in chapter 13. The same shortcomings apply here, thus ruling out the
employment of lump-sum taxes. The use of other forms of taxation would introduce
their own distortions, and these would prevent efﬁciency from being achieved. In ad-
dition, to apply the Samuelson rule, the government must know the individual beneﬁts
from public good provision. In practice, this information is not readily available, and
the government must rely on what individuals choose to reveal.
The consequence of these observations is that efﬁciency will not be attained through
direct public good provision if ﬁnanced by distortionary taxes. Hence we have the mo-
tivation for considering alternative allocation mechanisms that can provide the correct
level of public good by eliciting preferences from consumers.
6.5
Voting
The failure of private actions to provide a public good efﬁciently suggests that alter-
native allocation mechanisms need to be considered. There are a range of responses
that can be adopted to counteract the market failure, ranging from intervention with
taxation through to direct provision by the government. In practice, the level of provi-
sion for public goods is frequently determined by the political process, with competing
parties in electoral systems differing in the level of public good provision they promise.
The selection of one of the parties by voting then determines the level of public good
provision.
We have already obtained a ﬁrst insight into the provision of public goods by voting
in chapter 5. That analysis focused on voting over the tax rate as a proxy for government
size when people had different income levels. What we wish to do here is provide a
contrast between the voting outcome and the efﬁcient level of public good provision
when people differ in tastes and (possibly) income levels. Consider a population of
consumers who determine the quantity of public good to be provided by a majority
vote. The cost of the public good is shared equally among the consumers, so, if G units
of the public good are supplied, the cost to each consumer is G
H . With income Mh, a
consumer can purchase private goods to the value of Mh−G
H after paying for the public
good. This provides an effective price of 1
H for each unit of the public good and a level

curves and the most preferred quantity of public good are shown in the upper part of
ﬁgure 6.6 (assuming, for convenience, the same income levels for all consumers).
So that the Median Voter Theorem can be applied (see chapter 11 for details), assume
that there is an odd number, H, of consumers, where H > 2 , and that each of the
consumers has single-peaked preferences for the public good. This second assumption
implies that when the level of utility is graphed against the quantity of public good, there
will be a single value of Gh that maximizes utility for consumer h. Such preferences
are illustrated in the lower panel of ﬁgure 6.6. The consumers are numbered so that
their preferred levels of public good satisfy G1< G2< . . . < GH.

in the ranking. We label
the median consumer as m and denote their chosen quantity of the public good by
Gm. A remarkable feature of the majority voting outcome is that nobody is able to
manipulate the outcome to their advantage by misrepresenting their preference, so
sincere voting is the best strategy. The reason is that anyone to the left of the median can

move the outcome further away from their preferred position, and vice versa for anyone
to the right of the median.
Having demonstrated that voting will reveal preferences and that the voting outcome
will be the quantity Gm, it now remains to ask whether the voting outcome is efﬁcient.
The value Gm is the preferred choice of consumer m, so it solves

where Mm denotes the income of the median voter that can differ from the median
income with heterogeneous preferences. The ﬁrst-order condition for the maximization
can be expressed in terms of the marginal rate of substitution to show that the voting
outcome is described by
MRSm = 1

In contrast, because the marginal rate of transformation is equal to 1, the efﬁcient
outcome satisﬁes the Samuelson rule

Contrasting these, the voting outcome is efﬁcient only if

(6.10)
Therefore majority voting leads to efﬁcient provision of the public good only if the
median voter’s MRS is equal to the mean MRS of the population of voters. There
is no reason to expect that it will, so it must be concluded that majority voting will
not generally achieve an efﬁcient outcome. This is because the voting outcome does
not take account of preferences other than those of the median voter: changing all

159
Chapter 6: Public Goods
the preferences except those of the median voter does not affect the voting outcome
(although it would affect the efﬁcient level of public good provision).
Can any comments be offered on whether majority voting typically leads to too much
or too little public good? In general, the answer has to be no, since no natural restrictions
can be appealed to and the median voter’s MRS may be lower or higher than the mean.
If it is lower, then too little public good will provided. The converse holds if it is higher.
The only approach that might give an insight is to note that the distribution of income
has a very long right tail. If the MRS is higher for lower income voters, then the nature
of the income distribution suggests that the median MRS is higher than the mean. Thus
voting will lead to an excess quantity of public good being provided. Alternatively, if
the MRS is increasing with income, then voting would lead to underprovision.
6.6
Personalized Prices
We have now studied two allocation mechanisms that lead to inefﬁcient outcomes. The
private market fails because of free-riding, and voting fails because the choice of the
decisive median voter need not match the efﬁcient choice. What these have in common
is that the consumers face incorrect incentives. In both cases the decision makers take
account only of the private beneﬁt of the public good rather than the broader social
beneﬁt (i.e., that public good contribution also beneﬁts others). As a rule, efﬁciency
will only be attained by modifying the incentives to align private and social beneﬁts.
The ﬁrst method for achieving efﬁciency involves using an extended pricing mech-
anism for the public good. This mechanism uses prices that are “personalized,” with
each consumer paying a price that is designed to ﬁt their situation. These personalized
prices modify the actual price in two ways. First, they adjust the price of the public
good in order to align social and private beneﬁts. Second, they further adjust the price
to capture each consumer’s individual valuation of the public good.
This latter aspect can be understood by considering the differences between public
and private goods. With a private good, consumers face a common price but choose
to purchase different quantities according to their preferences. In contrast, with a pure
public good, all consumers consume the same quantity. This can only be efﬁcient if
the consumers wish to purchase the same given quantity of the public good. They
can be induced to do so by correctly choosing the price they face. For instance, a
consumer who places a low value on the public good should face a low price, while a
consumer with a high valuation should face a high price. This reasoning is illustrated in
table 6.1.

160

The idea of personalized pricing can be captured by assuming that the government
announces the share of the cost of the public good that each consumer must bear. For
example, it may say that each of two consumers must pay half the cost of the public
good. Having heard the announcement of these shares, the consumers then state how
much of the public good they wish to have supplied. If they both wish to have the
same level, then that level is supplied. If their wishes differ, the shares are adjusted
and the process repeated. The adjustment continues until shares are reached at which
both wish to have the same quantity. This ﬁnal point is called a Lindahl equilibrium.
It can easily be seen how this mechanism overcomes the two sources of inefﬁciency.
The fact that the consumers only pay a share of the cost reduces the perceived unit price
of the public good. Hence the private cost appears lower, and the consumers increase
their demands for the public good. Additionally the shares can be tailored to match
the individual valuations.
To make this reasoning concrete, let the share of the public good that has to paid by
consumer h be denoted τ h. The scheme must be self-ﬁnancing, so, with two consumers,
τ 1+τ 2 = 1. Now let Gh denote the quantity of the public good that household h would
choose to have provided when faced with the budget constraint
xh + τ hGh = Mh.
(6.11)
The Lindahl equilibrium shares

τ 1, τ 2
are found when G1 = G2. The reason why
efﬁciency is attained can be seen in the illustration of the Lindahl equilibrium in ﬁgure
6.7. The indifference curves reﬂect preferences over levels of the public good and
shares in the cost. The shape of these captures the fact that each consumer prefers
more of the public good but dislikes an increased share. The highest indifference curve
for consumer 1 is to the northwest and the highest for consumer 2 to the northeast.
Maximizing utility for a given share (which gives a vertical line in the ﬁgure) achieves
the highest level of utility where the indifference curve is vertical. Below this point the
consumer is willing to pay a higher share for more public good, and above it is just the
other way around. Hence the indifference curves are backward-bending. The Lindahl

reaction functions are then formed as the loci of the vertical points of the indifference
curve. The equilibrium requires that both consumers demand the same level of the
public good; this occurs at the intersection of the reactions functions. At this point
the indifference curves of the two consumers are tangential and the equilibrium is
Pareto-efﬁcient.
To derive the efﬁciency result formally, note that utility is given by the function
Uh 

good is

This is the Samuelson rule for the economy, and it establishes that the equilibrium
is efﬁcient. The personalized prices equate the individual valuations of the supply of
public goods to the cost of production in a way that uniform pricing cannot. They also
correct for the divergence between private and social beneﬁts.

Gaining by false announcement
Although personalized prices seem a very simple way of resolving the public good
problem, when considered more closely a number of difﬁculties arise in actually ap-
plying them. First, there is the very practical problem of determining the prices in an
economy with many consumers. The practical difﬁculties involved in announcing and
adjusting the individual shares are essentially insurmountable. Second, there are issues
raised concerning the incentives for consumers to reveal their true demands.
The analysis assumed that the consumers were honest in revealing their reactions to
the announcement of cost shares, meaning they simply maximize utility by taking the
share of cost as given. However, there will be a gain to any consumer who attempts
to cheat, or manipulate, the allocation mechanism. By announcing preferences that
do not coincide with their true preferences, it is possible for a consumer to shift the
outcome in their favor, provided that the other does not do likewise. To see this, assume
that consumer 1 acts honestly and that consumer 2 knows this and knows the reaction
function of 1. In ﬁgure 6.8 an honest announcement on the part of consumer 2 would
lead to the equilibrium eL where the two Lindahl reaction functions cross. However, by
claiming their preferences to be given by the dashed Lindahl reaction function rather
than the true function, the equilibrium can be driven to point eM, which represents the
maximization of 2’s utility given the Lindahl reaction function of 1. This improvement
for consumer 2 reveals the incentive for dishonest behavior.

163
Chapter 6: Public Goods
The use of personalized prices can achieve efﬁciency only if the consumers act
honestly. A consumer who acts strategically is able to manipulate the outcome to her
advantage. Indeed it is clear that the search for a means of attaining an allocation that
satisﬁes the Samuelson rule should be restricted to allocation mechanisms that cannot
be manipulated in this way. This is the focus of the next section.
6.7
Mechanism Design
The previous section showed how consumers have an incentive to reveal false infor-
mation on demand when personalized prices are being determined. From the consistent
application of the assumption of utility maximization we observed that a consumer will
behave dishonestly if it is in their interests to do so. This fact has led to the search
for allocation mechanisms that are immune from attempted manipulation. As will be
shown, the design of some of these mechanisms leads households to reveal their true
preferences. Because of this property these mechanisms are called preference revelation
mechanisms.
6.7.1
Examples of Preference Revelation
The general problem of preference revelation is now illustrated by considering two
simple examples. In both examples people are shown to gain by making false statements
oftheirpreferences. Iftheyactrationally, thentheywillchoosetomakefalsestatements.
Sincethesesituationshavethenatureofstrategicgames, wecalltheparticipantsplayers.
Example 1: False Understatement
The decision that has to be made is whether to produce or not produce a ﬁxed quantity
of a public good. If the public good is not produced, then G = 0. If it is produced,
G = 1. The cost of the public good is given by C = 1. The gross beneﬁt of the public
good for players 1 and 2 is given by v1 = v2 = 1. Since the social beneﬁt of providing
the good is v1 +v2 = 2, which is greater than the cost, it is socially beneﬁcial to provide
the public good.
Each player makes a report, rh, of the beneﬁt they receive from the public good.
This report can either be false, in which case rh = 0 , or truthful so that rh = vh = 1.
Based on the reports, the public good is provided if the sum of announced valuations
is at least as high as the cost. This gives the collective decision rule to choose G = 1 if
r1 +r2 ≥C = 1, and to choose G = 0 otherwise. The cost of the public good is shared

164
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
between the two players, with the shares proportional to the announced valuations. In
detail,
ch = 1
if rh = 1 and rh′ = 0,
(6.14)
ch = 1
2
if rh = 1 and rh′ = 1,
(6.15)
ch = 0
if rh = 0 and rh′ = 0 or 1.
(6.16)
The net beneﬁt, the difference between true beneﬁt and cost, which is termed the payoff
from the mechanism, is then given by
Uh = vh −ch if r1 + r2 ≥1,
(6.17)
= 0
otherwise.
(6.18)
This information is summarized in the payoff matrix in ﬁgure 6.9.
From the payoff matrix it can be seen that the announcement rh = 0 is a weakly
dominant strategy for both players. For instance, if player 2 chooses r2 = 1, then
player 1 will choose r1 = 0. Alternatively, if player 2 chooses r2 = 0, then player 1 is
indifferent between the two strategies of r1 = 0 and r1 = 1. The Nash equilibrium of
the game is therefore ˆr1 = 0, ˆr2 = 0.
In equilibrium both players will understate their valuation of the public good. As
a result the public good is not provided, despite provision being socially beneﬁcial.
The reason is that the proportional cost-sharing rule gives an incentive to underreport
preferences for public good. With both players underreporting, the public good is not
provided. To circumvent this problem, we can make contributions independent of the
reports. This is our next example.

Chapter 6: Public Goods
Example 2: False Overstatement
The second example is distinguished from the ﬁrst by considering a public good
that is socially nondesirable with a cost greater than the social beneﬁt. The possible
announcements and the charging scheme are also changed.
It is assumed that the gross payoffs when the public good is provided are
v1 = 0 < v2 = 3
4.
(6.19)
With the cost of the public good remaining at 1, these payoffs imply that
v1 + v2 = 3
4 < C = 1,
(6.20)
so the social beneﬁt from the public good is less than its cost.
The possible announcements of the two players are given by r1 = 0 or 1 and r2 = 3
4
or 1. These announcements permit the players to either tell the truth or overstate the
beneﬁt so as to induce public good provision. Assume that there is also a uniform
charge for the public good if it is provided, so ch = 1
2 if r1 + r2 ≥c = 1, and ch = 0
otherwise. These valuations and charges imply the net beneﬁts
Uh = vh −ch
if r1 + r2 ≥1,
(6.21)
Uh = 0
otherwise.
(6.22)
These can be used to construct the payoff matrix in ﬁgure 6.10.
The weakly dominant strategy for player 1 is to play r1 = 0 and the best response
of player 2 is to select r2 = 1 (which is also a dominant strategy). Therefore the
Nash equilibrium is ˆr1 = 0, ˆr2 = 1, which results in the provision of a socially

6.7.2
Clarke–Groves Mechanism
The preceding examples showed that true valuations may not be revealed for some
mechanisms linking announcement to contribution. Even worse, it is possible for the
wrong social decision to be made. The question then arises as to whether there is a
mechanism that will always ensure that true values are revealed (as for voting), and
at the same time that the level of public good provided is efﬁcient (which voting
cannot do).
The potential for constructing such a mechanism, and the difﬁculties in doing so, can
be understood by retaining the simple allocation problem of the examples that involves
the decision on whether to provide a single public good of ﬁxed size. The construction
of a length of road or the erection of a public monument both ﬁt this scenario. It is
assumed that the cost of the project is known, and it is also known how the cost is
allocated among the consumers that make up the population. What needs to be found
from the consumers is how much their valuation of the public good exceeds, or falls
short of, their contribution to the cost. Each consumer knows the beneﬁt they will
gain if the public good is provided, and they know the cost they will have to pay. The
difference between the beneﬁt and the cost is called the net beneﬁt. This can be positive
or negative. The decision rule is that the public good is provided if the sum of reported
net beneﬁts is (weakly) positive.
Considertwoconsumerswithtruenetbeneﬁts v1 andv2. Themechanismweconsider
is the following. Each consumer makes an announcement of his or her net beneﬁt.
Denote by rh the report of h, h = 1, 2. The public good is provided if the sum of
announced net beneﬁts satisﬁes r1 + r2 ≥0. If the public good is not provided, each
consumer receives a payoff of 0. If the good is provided, then each consumer receives
a side payment equal to the reported net beneﬁt of the other consumer; hence, if the
public good is provided, consumer 1 receives a total payoff of v1 + r2 and consumer
2 receives v2 + r1. It is these additional side payments that will lead to the truth being
told by inducing each consumer to “internalize” the net beneﬁt of the public good for
the other. If the public good is not provided, no side payments are made.
To see how this mechanism works, assume that the true net beneﬁts and the reports
can take the values of either −1 or +1. The public good will not be provided if both

167
Chapter 6: Public Goods
report a value of −1, but if at least one reports +1, it will be provided. The payoffs
to the mechanism are summarized in the payoff matrix in ﬁgure 6.11. The claim we
now wish to demonstrate is that this mechanism provides no incentive to make a false
announcement of the net beneﬁt. To do this, it is enough to focus on player 1 and show
that the player will report truthfully when v1 = −1 and when v1 = +1. The payoffs
relating to the true values are in the two payoff matrices in ﬁgure 6.12.
Take the case of v1 = −1. Then consumer 1 ﬁnds the true announcement to be
weakly dominant—the payoff from being truthful (the top row) is greater if r2 = −1
and equal if r2 = + 1. Next take the case of v1 = + 1. Consumer 1 is indifferent
between truth and nontruth. But the point is that there is now no incentive to provide a
false announcement. Hence truth should be expected.
The problem with this mechanism is the side payments that have to be made. If the
public good is provided and v1 = v2 = +1, then the total side payments are equal to

2—which is equal to the total net beneﬁt of the public good. These side payments are
money that has to be put into the system to support the telling of truth. Obtaining the
truth is possible, but it is costly.
6.7.3
Clarke Tax
The problem caused by the existence of the side payments can be reduced but can never
be eliminated. The reason it cannot be eliminated entirely is simply that the mechanism
is extracting information, and this can never be done for free. The way in which the
side payments can be reduced is to modify the structure of the mechanism.
One way to do this is for side payments to be made only if the announcement of
a player changes the social decision. To see what this implies, consider calculating
the sum of the announced beneﬁts of all players but one. Whether this is positive or
negative will determine a social decision for those players. Now add the announcement
of the ﬁnal player. Does this change the social decision? If it does, then the ﬁnal player
is said to be pivotal, and a set of side payments is implemented that requires taxing
the pivotal agent for the cost inﬂicted on the other agent through the changed social
decision. This process is repeated for each player in turn. These side payments are the
Clarke taxes that ensure that the correct decision is made so that the public good is
produced if it is socially desirable and not otherwise. The use of Clarke taxes reduces
the number of circumstances in which the side payments are made.
In a game with only two players, the payoffs for player 1 when the Clarke taxes are
used are given by
v1
if
r1 + r2 ≥0
and
r2 ≥0,
(6.23)

and
r2 ≥0, with t1 = r2 ≥0,
(6.25)
0
if
r1 + r2 < 0
and
r2 < 0.
(6.26)
Only in the second and third cases is player 1 pivotal (respectively, by causing provision
and stopping provision of the public good), and for these cases a tax is levied on player 1
reﬂecting the cost to the other agent of changing public good provision (t1 = −r2 > 0
for the cost of imposing provision, and t1 = r2 ≥0 for the cost of stopping provision).
The Clarke taxes induce truth-telling and guarantee that the public good is provided
if and only if it is socially desirable. The explanation is that any misreport that changes
the decision about the public good would induce the payment of a tax in excess of the

169
Chapter 6: Public Goods
beneﬁt from the change in decision. Indeed, suppose that the public good is socially
desirable, so v1 +v2 ≥0, but that player 1 dislikes it, so v1 < 0. Then, given an honest
announcement from player 2 with r2 = v2, by underreporting sufﬁciently to prevent
provision of the public good (so r1 < −r2), player 1 becomes pivotal. Player 1 will
have to pay a tax of t1 = r2 = v2, which is in excess of the gain from nonprovision,
−v1 (since v1 + v2 ≥0 ⇒v2 ≥−v1). Hence player 1 is better off telling the truth,
and given this truth-telling, player 2 is also better off telling the truth (although in this
case he is the pivotal agent, inducing provision and paying a tax equal to the damage
of public good provision for player 1, t2 = −r1 = −v1).
The conclusion is that the Clarke tax induces preference revelation, and by restricting
side payments to pivotal agents only, it lowers the cost of information revelation.
6.7.4
Further Comments
The theory of mechanism design shows that it is possible to construct schemes that
ensure that the truth will be revealed and correct the social decision made. These
mechanisms may work, but they are undoubtedly complex to implement. Putting
this objection aside, it can still be argued that such revelation mechanisms are not
actually needed in practice. Two major reasons can be provided to support this
contention.
First, the mechanisms are built on the basis that the players will be rational and precise
in their strategic calculations. In practice, many people may not act as strategically as
the theory suggests. As in the theory of tax evasion, which we discuss in chapter 17,
nonmonetary beneﬁts may be derived simply from acting honestly. These beneﬁts may
provide a sufﬁcient incentive that the true valuation is reported. In such circumstances
the revelation mechanism will not be needed.
Second, the market activities of consumers often indirectly reveal the valuation
of public goods. To give an example of what is meant by this, consider the case of
housing. A house is a collection of characteristics, such as the number of rooms, size
of garden, and access to amenities. The price that a house purchaser is willing to pay is
determined by their assessment of the total value of these characteristics. Equally the
cost of supplying a house is also dependent on the characteristics supplied. By observing
the equilibrium prices of houses with different characteristics, it is possible to determine
the value assigned to each characteristic separately. If one of the characteristics relates
to a public good, for example, the closeness to a public park, the value of this public
good can then be inferred. Such implicit valuation methods can be applied to a broad
range of public goods by carefully choosing the related private good. Since consumers

170
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
have no incentive to act strategically in purchasing private goods, the true valuations
should be revealed.
The fact that consumers have an incentive to falsely reveal their valuations can also
be exploited to obtain an approximation of the true value. This can be done by running
two preference revelation mechanisms simultaneously. If one is designed to lead to
an underreporting of the true valuation and the other one to overreporting, then the
true value of the public good can be taken as lying somewhere between the over-
and underreports. The Swedish economist Peter Bohm has conducted an experimental
implementation of this procedure. In the experiment 200 people from Stockholm had to
evaluatethebeneﬁtofseeingapreviouslyunshowntelevisionprogram. Theparticipants
were divided into four groups each of which faced the following payment mechanisms:
(1) pay stated valuation, (2) pay a fraction of stated valuation such that costs are covered
from all payments, (3) pay a low ﬂat fee, and (4) no payment. Although the ﬁrst two
provide an incentive to underreport and the latter two to overreport, the experiment
found that there was no signiﬁcant difference in the stated valuations, suggesting that
misrevelation may not be as important as suggested by the theory.
6.8
More on Private Provision
The analysis of the private purchase of a public good in section 6.3 focused on the
issue of efﬁciency. The analysis showed that a Pareto improvement can be made from
the equilibrium point if both consumers simultaneously raise their contributions, so the
equilibrium cannot be efﬁcient. This ﬁnding was sufﬁcient to develop the contrast with
efﬁcient provision and to act as a basis for investigating mechanism design.
Although useful, these are not the only results that emerge from the private purchase
model. The model also generates several remarkably precise predictions about the effect
of income transfers and increases in the number of purchasers. These results are now
described and then contrasted with empirical and experimental evidence.
6.8.1
Neutrality and Population Size
The ﬁrst result concerns the effect of redistributing income. Consider transferring an
amount of income  from consumer 1 to consumer 2 so that the income of consumer 1
falls to M1 − and that of consumer 2 rises to M2 + . The objective is to calculate
the effect that this transfer has on the equilibrium level of public good purchases. To
do this, notice that the equilibrium in ﬁgure 6.5 is identiﬁed by the fact that it occurs

171
Chapter 6: Public Goods
where an indifference curve for consumer 1 crosses an indifference curve for consumer
2 at right angles. Hence the effect of the transfer on the equilibrium can be found by
determining how it affects the indifference curves.
Consider consumer 1 who has their income reduced by . If we reduce their public
good purchase by  and raise that of consumer 2 by , the utility of consumer 1 is
unchanged because

This transfer of income causes the indifference curves and the best-reaction function
of consumer 1 to move as illustrated in ﬁgure 6.13. The indifference curve through any
point g1, g2 before the income transfer shifts to pass through the point g1 −, g2 + 
after the income transfer.
The transfer of income has the same effect on the indifference curves and best-
reaction function of consumer 2. From the reduction in purchase of consumer 1 and
the increase by consumer 2, it follows that

Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
For consumer 2 the indifference curve through g1, g2 before the income transfer
becomes that through g1 −, g2 +  after the transfer.
These shifts in the indifference curves result in the equilibrium moving as in ﬁgure
6.14. The point where the indifference curves cross at right angles shifts in the same
way as the individual indifference curves. If the equilibrium was initially at ˆg1, ˆg2
before the income transfer, it is located at ˆg1 −, ˆg2 +  after the transfer.
The important result now comes from noticing that in the move from the original to
the new equilibrium, consumer 1 reduces his purchase of the public good by , but
consumer 2 increases her purchase by the same amount . These changes in the value
of purchases exactly match the change in income levels. The net outcome is that the
levels of private consumption remain unchanged for the two consumers, and the total
supply of the public good is also unchanged. As a consequence the income transfer
does not affect the levels of consumption in equilibrium—all it does is to redistribute
the burden of purchase. Income redistribution is entirely offset by an opposite redis-
tribution of the responsibility for purchases of the public good. This result, known as
income distribution invariance, is a consequence of the fact that the utility levels of the
consumers are linked via the quantity of a public good.
The second interesting result is that the transfer of income leaves the utility levels
of the two consumers unchanged. This has to be so because, as we have just seen,

Chapter 6: Public Goods
the consumption levels do not change. Therefore the redistribution of income has
not affected the distribution of welfare; the transfer is simply offset by the change in
public good purchases. If the income redistribution was due to government policy, this
becomes an example of policy neutrality: by changing their behavior, the individuals in
the economy are able to undo what the government is trying to do. Income redistribution
will always be neutral until the point is reached at which one of the consumers no longer
purchases the public good. Only then will further income transfers affect the distribution
of utility.
A third result follows easily from income invariance. Let both consumers have the
same utility function but possibly different income levels. Since the quantity of public
good consumed by both must be the same, the ﬁrst-order conditions require that both
must also consume the same quantity of private good; hence x1 = x2. Further these
common levels of consumption imply that the consumers must have the same utility
levels even if there is an initial income disparity. The private-purchase model therefore
implies that when the consumers have identical utilities, the choices made by the con-
sumers will equalize utilities even in the face of income differentials. The poor set their

This model can also be used to consider the consequence of variations in the number
of households. Maintaining the assumption that all the consumers are identical in
terms of both preferences and income, for an economy with H consumers the total
provision of the public good is G = 	H
h=1 gh and the utility of h is
Uh = U

(6.28)
Here ¯Gh is the total contributions of all consumers other than h . Since all consumers
are identical, it makes sense to focus on symmetric equilibria where all consumers
make the same contribution. Hence let gh = g for all h. It follows that at at symmetric
equilibrium
g =
¯G
H −1.
(6.29)
In a graph of g against ¯G an allocation satisfying (6.29) must lie on a ray through
the origin with gradient H −1. For each level of H, the equilibrium is given by the
intersection of the appropriate ray with the best-reaction function. This is shown in
ﬁgure 6.15.
The important point is what happens to the equilibrium level of provision as the
number of consumer tends to inﬁnity (the idealization of a “large” population). What

happens can be seen by considering the consequence of the ray in ﬁgure 6.15 becoming
vertical: the equilibrium will be at the point where the reaction function crosses the
vertical axis. As this point is reached, the provision of each consumer will tend to zero,
but aggregate provision will not, since it is the sum of inﬁnitely many zeros. This result
can be summarized by saying that in a large population each consumer will effectively
contribute nothing.
6.8.2
Experimental Evidence
The analysis of private purchase demonstrated that the equilibrium will not be Pareto-
efﬁcient and that, compared to Pareto-preferred allocations, too little of the public good
will be purchased. A simple explanation of this result can be given in terms of each
consumer relying on others to purchase and hence deciding to purchase too little. Each
consumer is free-riding on others’purchases, and since all attempt to free-ride, the total
value of purchases fails to reach the efﬁcient level. This conclusion has been subjected
to close experimental scrutiny.
The basic form of the experiment is to give participants a number of tokens that
can be invested in either a private good or a public good. Each participant makes a
single purchase decision. The private good provides a beneﬁt only to its purchaser
while purchase of public good provides a beneﬁt to all participants. The values are set
so that the private beneﬁt is less than the social beneﬁt. The beneﬁts are known to the

175
Chapter 6: Public Goods
participants and the total beneﬁt from purchases is the payoff to the participant at the
end of the experiment. It is therefore in the interests of each participant to maximize
his or her payoff.
To see how this works in detail, assume that there are 10 participants in the game.
Allow each participant to have 10 tokens to spend. A unit of the private good costs 1
token and provides a beneﬁt of 5 units (private beneﬁt = social beneﬁt = 5). A unit of
the public good also costs 1 token but provides a beneﬁt of 1 unit to all the participants
in the game (private beneﬁt = 1 < social beneﬁt = 10). The returns are summarized
in ﬁgure 6.16.
If the game is played once (a “one-shot” game), the Nash equilibrium strategy is to
purchase only the private good, since each token spent on the private good yields a
return ﬁve times higher than for the public good. In equilibrium, the total return to each
player is 50. In contrast, the socially efﬁcient outcome is for all players to purchase only
the public good and to generate a payoff of 100 to each player. The fact that the Nash
equilibrium differs from the efﬁcient outcome is because the private beneﬁts diverge
from the social beneﬁts. Thus, in the one-shot game, all tokens should be spent on the
private good.
In experimental implementations of this game the average value of purchases of the
public good has been approximately 30 to 90 percent of tokens, with most observations
falling in the 40 to 50 percent range. Interestingly, among student participants contri-
butions have been lowest for those studying economics, and fall with the number of
years of economics taken. Since the purchase of the public good is signiﬁcantly differ-
ent from 0, these results clearly do not support the predictions of the private-purchase
model.
Some experiments have repeated the purchase decision over several rounds, with
the view that this should allow time for the participants to learn about free-riding and
develop the optimal strategy. The results from such experiments are not as clear and a
wider range of purchases occurs. Free-riding is not completely supported, but instances

Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
have been reported in which it does occur. However, this ﬁnding should be treated
with caution, since having several rounds of the game introduces aspects of repeated
game theory. While it remains true that the only credible equilibrium of the repeated
game is the private-purchase equilibrium of the corresponding single-period game,
it is possible that in the experiments some participants were attempting to establish
cooperative equilibria by playing in a fashion that invited cooperation. Additionally
those not trained in game theory would have been unable to derive the optimal strategy
even though they could solve the single-period game.
Other results show that increasing group size leads to increased divergence from the
efﬁcient outcome when accompanied by a decrease in marginal return from the public
good, but the results do not support a pure numbers-in-group effect. This ﬁnding is
compatible with the theoretical ﬁnding that the effect of group size on the divergence
from optimality is, in general, indeterminate.
These results indicate that there is little evidence of free-riding in single-period,
or one-shot, games but in the repeated games the purchases fall toward the private-
purchase level as the game is repeated. In total, these experiments do not provide great
support for the equilibrium based on the private-purchase model with Nash behavior.
In the single-period games free-riding is unambiguously rejected. Although it appears
after several rounds in repeated games, the explanation for the strategies involved is
not entirely apparent. Neither a strategic nor a learning hypothesis is conﬁrmed. What
seems to be occurring is that the participants are initially guided more by a sense of
fairness than by Nash behavior. When this fairness is not rewarded, the tendency is
then to move toward the Nash equilibrium. The failure of experimentation to support
free-riding lends some encouragement to the views that although such behavior may
be individually optimal, it is not actually observed in practice.
6.8.3
Modiﬁcations
The experimental evidence has produced a number of conﬂicts with the predictions of
the theoretical model. The analysis of private purchase was based on two fundamental
assumptions. The utility of consumers was assumed to depend only on the consumption
of the private good and the total supply of the public good. This ensures that consumers
do not care directly about the size of their own contribution nor do they care about
the behavior of other consumers, except for how it affects the total level of the public
good. The second assumption was that the consumers acted noncooperatively and
played according to the assumptions of Nash equilibrium.

177
Chapter 6: Public Goods
The simplest modiﬁcation that can be made to the model is to consider the game
being played in a different way. The foundation of the Nash equilibrium is that each
player takes the behavior of the others as given when optimizing. One way to change
this is to consider “conjectural variations” so that each player forms an opinion as
to how their choice will affect that of others. If the conjectural variation is positive,
each player predicts that the others will respond to an increase in purchase by also
making additional purchases. Such a positive conjecture can be interpreted as being
more cooperative than the zero conjecture that arises in the Nash equilibrium and
leads to the equilibrium having greater total public good supply than the Nash equili-
brium.
Moving to non-Nash conjectures may alter the equilibrium level of the public good,
but it does not eliminate the neutrality properties. Furthermore the major objection to
this approach is that it is entirely arbitrary. There are sensible reasons founded in game
theory for focusing on the Nash equilibrium, and no other set of conjectures can appeal
to similar justiﬁcation. If the Nash equilibrium of the private-purchase model does not
agree with observations, it would seem that the objectives of the consumers and the
social rules they observe should be reconsidered, not the conjectures they hold when
maximizing.
One approach to modiﬁed preferences is to assume that consumers derive utility
directly from the contributions they make. For instance, making a donation to charity
can make a consumer feel good about herself; she is acting as a “good citizen.” This is
often referred to as the warm glow effect. With a warm glow, a purchase of the public
good provides a return from direct consumption of the public good and a further return
from the warm glow. The private warm glow effect increases the value of the purchase
and so raises the equilibrium level of total purchases. The equilibrium also no longer
has the same invariance properties. This would seem a signiﬁcant advance were it not
that the speciﬁcation of the warm glow is entirely arbitrary.
Aﬁnal modiﬁcation is to remove the individualism and allow for social interaction by
modifying the rules of social behavior. In the same way that social effects can arise with
tax evasion, they can also occur with public goods. One way to do this is to introduce
reciprocity, by which each consumer considers the contributions of others and contrasts
them to what she feels she should have made. If the contributions of others match, or
exceed, what is expected, then the consumer is assumed to feel under an obligation to
make a similar contribution. This again raises the equilibrium level of contribution.

178

6.9
Fund-Raising Campaigns
The model of voluntary purchase that we have considered so far has involved a single
one-off contribution decision. It is easy to appreciate that once these contributions
have been made, the consumers may look again at the situation and realize that it is
inefﬁcient. This could give them an incentive to conduct a second round of contribution
that will move the equilibrium closer to efﬁciency. Repeatedly applying this argument
suggests that it may be possible to eventually reach efﬁciency. We now assess this claim
by addressing it within a simple fund-raising game.
The basis of the fund-raising game is that a target level of funds must be achieved
before a public good can be provided. For example, consider the target as the minimum
cost of construction for a public library. Subscribers to the campaign take it in turn to
make either a contribution or a pledge to contribute. Only when the target is met does
the process cease. The basic question is whether such a fund-raising campaign can be
successful given the possibility of free-riding.
We model a campaign as a game with an inﬁnite horizon, meaning that solicitation
for donations can continue until the goal is met. There is one public good (or joint
project) whose production cost is C and two identical players X and Y. These players
derive the same beneﬁt, B, from the public good, so the total beneﬁt is 2B. Both also
have the same discount rate δ, 0 < δ < 1, for delaying completion of the project by
one period.
The players alternate in making contributions. The sequential (marginal) contribu-
tions are denoted (. . . , xt−1, yt, xt+1, . . .), where xt−1 denotes the contribution of
player X at time t −1 and yt denotes the contribution of player Y at time t. The game
ends, and the public good is provided, only when the total contributions cover the cost
of the public good. Individuals derive no beneﬁts from the public good before comple-
tion of the fund-raising, so the marginal contributions yield no return until the cost is
met. It follows that the incentive of each player to wait for the other one to contribute
(free-riding) must be balanced against the cost of delaying completion of the project.
We suppose that the public good is “socially desirable” (C< 2B) but that no single
player values the public good enough to bear the full cost (B< C). We now contrast
two different forms of fund-raising campaigns. In the ﬁrst, the contribution campaign,
the contributions are paid at the time they are made. In the second, the subscription
campaign, players are asked in sequence to make donation pledges that are not paid
until the cost is met.

179
Chapter 6: Public Goods
6.9.1
The Contribution Campaign
In the contribution campaign, contributions are sunk at the time they are made be-
cause a credible commitment cannot be made to make contributions later. The lack of
commitment leads each player to back his contribution to ensure that the other players
contribute their share. This is because past contributions are sunk and cannot inﬂuence
the division of the remaining cost between the players. As a result we show that it is
never possible to raise the money, even though the project is worthwhile.
The two players are asked in sequence to make a contribution. While there is no
natural end period, there is a total contribution level that is close enough to the cost
C that the contributor whose turn it is should complete the fund-raising rather than
waiting for the other one to make up the difference. Suppose that it is player X’s turn to
make a contribution offer at that ﬁnal round T . There exists a deﬁcit sufﬁciently small
that player X is indifferent between making up the difference and getting a payoff of
B −xT or between waiting in the expectation (at best) that player Y will make up the
difference in the next round and producing a payoff with delayed completion of δB.
Hence the maximal contribution of player 1 in the ﬁnal round T is
xT = (1 −δ)B,
(6.30)
so the contribution is equal to the beneﬁt of speeding up completion of the project.
We suppose that [1 −δ]B < C so that such a contribution cannot cover the full cost
and a donation from player Y must be solicited. Working backward, it is now player
Y’s turn to make a contribution at time T −1. Player Y anticipates that in bringing
(total) contributions up to C −xT at date T −1, player X will complete the project the
next period. So there exists a sufﬁciently small deﬁcit such that player Y is indifferent
between bringing total contributions up to that level, giving a payoff δB −yT −1, and
waiting for the other player to make such contribution while himself making the ﬁnal
contribution xT , which produces a payoff δ2[B −xT ] (i.e., two periods later you get
the completed project beneﬁt B and pay the last contribution xT ). Hence, substituted
for xT , the contribution at time T −1 that makes player Y indifferent is
yT −1 = δ

1 −δ2
B.
(6.31)
Proceeding backward to date T −2 , it is now the turn of player X to make a contribution.
Using the same line of argument, there exists a total contribution level at date T −2 such
that player X is indifferent between bringing total contribution up to that level to get
a payoff δ2[B −xT ] −xT −2 from completion in two periods or waiting and delaying

180

Going back further, it is possible to calculate how much each player is willing to

[1−δ2]. The remarkable feature is that the total potential for contributions never exceeds
the individual beneﬁt from the project, and because B< C, it is not possible to raise
sufﬁcient contributions for a successful campaign.
6.9.2
The Subscription Campaign
In the subscription game, agents alternate in making donation pledges and bear the cost
of their contribution only when and if enough contributions are pledged to complete
the project. In a sense, agents are able to make certain conditional commitments to
contribute in the future. This possibility to commit modiﬁes the strategic structure of
the game and alters the total amount that can be raised. As we now show, in this case it
becomes possible to raise an amount equal to the total valuation of all the contributors.
Once again, we start when the fund-raising operation is over and work backward.
Fix an arbitrary end point T with player X’s turn to make a donation pledge at date T .
There must exists a contribution deﬁcit sufﬁciently small to make player X indifferent
between ﬁnancing the deﬁcit himself to obtain a payoff B −xT and waiting for player
Y to make up the difference in the next period, with a delayed completion payoff of
δB. So the potential pledge of player X at date T is
xT = [1 −δ]B.
(6.36)
We continue to assume that [1 −δ]B < C so that we can solicit player Y’s donation.
Working backward, it is then up to player Y to pledge at date T −1. Player Y anticipates
that in bringing the total amount pledged up to C −xT at date T −1, player X will com-
plete the project in the next period. So there exists a sufﬁciently small deﬁcit such that
player Y is indifferent between making up the difference to get a payoff δ [B −yT −1]
and leaving player X to make up the difference, thereby delaying completion to get a
payoff of δ2 [B −xT ] (in which case it becomes worthwhile for Y to pledge himself
xT at date T ). Hence, substituting for xT , we obtain
yT −1 =

1 −δ2
B.
(6.37)
Going back to date T −2, it is up to player X to pledge. Again, there exists a total
amount pledged close enough to C −xT −yT −1 such that player X is indifferent
between bringing the total contribution up to that level, anticipating completion in two
rounds with a payoff δ2[B −xT −xT −2], and waiting for Y to pledge instead with a
payoff from switching position of δ3 [B −yT −1]. Substituting for xT and yT −1 gives

182

(6.38)
Proceeding likewise, we can go back further and calculate how much player Y will
pledge at date T −3 as

(6.39)
and player X will pledge at date T −4 the amount

This is the maximum amount that can be raised and is equal to the total valuations of all
the contributors. Hence it is always possible to raise enough money for any worthwhile
project because C < 2B.
These results have shown how allowing contributions to be repeated may lead to
efﬁcient private provision of the public good. But this conclusion is sensitive to the
assumptions made on the ability of contributors to make binding commitments.
6.10
Conclusions
This chapter has reviewed the standard analysis of the efﬁcient level of provision of a
public good leading to the Samuelson rule. The analysis of private purchase emphasized
the fact that this outcome will not be achieved without government intervention. The
efﬁciency rule describes an allocation that can only be achieved if the government is
unrestricted in its policy tools or, as the Lindahl equilibrium demonstrates, using prices
that are personalized for each consumer.
One aspect of public goods that prevents the government from making efﬁcient de-
cisions is the government’s lack of knowledge of consumers’ preferences and their
willingness to pay for public goods. Mechanisms were constructed that provide the
right incentives for consumers to correctly reveal their true valuation of the public
good. Experimental evidence suggests that consumer behavior when confronted with

183
Chapter 6: Public Goods
decision problems involving public goods does not fully conform with the theoreti-
cal prediction and that the private-purchase equilibrium may not be as inefﬁcient as
theory suggests. Furthermore misrevelation has not been conﬁrmed as the inevitable
outcome.

Club Goods and Local Public Goods
7.1
Introduction
One of the deﬁning features of the public goods of chapter 6 was nonrivalry: once the
good is provided, its use by one consumer does not affect the quantity available for
any other consumer. This is clearly an extreme assumption. Many commodities, such
as parks, roads, and sports facilities, satisfy nonrivalry to a point but are eventually
subject to congestion. Although not pure public goods, these goods cannot be classed
as private goods either.
A good that has some degree of nonrivalry but for which excludability is possible
is called a club good. The name is intended to reﬂect the fact that there are beneﬁts
to groups of consumers forming a club to coordinate provision and that the group size
may be less than the total population. The name also captures the fact that the clubs we
observe in practice are formed by groups of consumers to coordinate the provision of
such goods. For instance, a tennis club provides courts that are excludable and nonrival
for users at different times. International bodies, such as NATO, can also be interpreted
as clubs: NATO provides defense for its members, which is again partly nonrivalrous
and partly excludable (only partly because if the existence of NATO deters aggression
generally, nonmembers will also beneﬁt).
In our description of economic activity in the previous chapters we did not pay any
attention to the geography of trade. In effect we assumed that there is either a single
marketplace with consumers located close to it or that travel to markets is costless. It
is a fact of actual economic activity that consumers and markets are dispersed, and that
travel costs can be signiﬁcant. As a consequence public goods provided in a particular
geographical location need not be available except for those in the close vicinity. For
instance, radioandtelevisionsignalscanonlybereceivedwithinrangeofthetransmitter
and a police service may only patrol a limited jurisdiction. Provided that a consumer
is located within the relevant area, he can beneﬁt from the public good; otherwise, the
public good is unavailable to that consumer because the cost of traveling to enjoy it
exceeds the beneﬁt. Such goods are again not pure public goods as deﬁned in chapter
6 and are termed local public goods, with the name capturing the idea of geographical
restriction. The geographical restriction on availability can also be accompanied by
congestion within the region.

192
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
The issues that the chapter addresses are similar to those involved with pure public
goods. It begins by deﬁning club goods and local public goods and investigating the
relationshipsbetweenthem. Theefﬁciencyquestionisaddressednextforsingle-product
clubs and is related to the charging scheme required to support efﬁciency. The clubs
are then placed within an economy to consider whether efﬁciency is achieved at this
level. Local public goods are introduced, and the efﬁciency question is again addressed.
The extension is subsequently made to consider heterogeneous consumers, which leads
into a discussion of the inﬂuential Tiebout hypothesis of preference matching for local
public goods. The chapter is completed by a review of the empirical evidence on this
hypothesis.
7.2
Deﬁnitions
The purpose of this section is to provide precise deﬁnitions of the classes of goods
under discussion. Once this is done, it is possible to describe how these classes are
related.
The essential aspect of a club good is that it is possible for those who pay for its
provision to exclude those who do not. This is in contrast to the pure public good,
which was deﬁned by the impossibility of exclusion. In addition club goods are often
assumed to suffer from congestion, but this is not strictly necessary. However, con-
gestion provides a motive for exclusion and for the forming of a club to supply the
good.
A formal deﬁnition can be given as follows:
Deﬁnition 7.1 (Club good)
A club good is a good that is either nonrivalrous or partly
rivalrous but for which exclusion by the providers is possible.
The exclusion aspect of a club good can be taken literally, such as a check on mem-
bership credentials at the door to the club, or taken as representing some more general
legal authority to bar nonmembers. Its consequence is that issues of preference reve-
lation are not important for club goods. The beneﬁts of the club can only be obtained
by voluntarily choosing to become a member, and doing so immediately reveals pref-
erences. This observation is clearly important for the potential attainment of efﬁciency
by the market.
The deﬁning feature of a local public good is one of geography and the need to locate
within a speciﬁc geographical area in order to beneﬁt from the good. Once outside this

193
Chapter 7: Club Goods and Local Public Goods
area, the beneﬁt of the good is no longer obtained. This geographical constraint may
also be linked with congestion, which causes partial rivalry.
Deﬁnition 7.2 (Local public good)
A local public good can only beneﬁt those within
a given geographical area. It may be nonrivalrous within that area or it may be partially
rivalrous.
This deﬁnition of a local public good makes clear that the unique feature is the
geographic restriction. It leaves open the question of whether or not a local public
good is excludable. This is important for the following reason: as will be seen, the
focus of local public good theory is the analysis of local government and decisions on
taxation and expenditure. Whether the local public goods provided are excludable then
becomes a matter of policy rather than an inherent feature of the good. By this, it is
meant that local governments can use a variety of regulations to control access to the
public goods they offer. As examples, registration at schools can be restricted by policy
choice to pupils in the local area and the size of the local population can be controlled
by prohibition on new building. Another example is immigration policy that aims to
limit access to national public goods to native residents.
Consequently there are large overlaps between clubs and local public goods, and the
terms have often been used interchangeably. What has mostly distinguished the two
in the literature has been the issues that have been addressed using each concept. The
discussion of club goods has focused more on issues of efﬁciency with homogeneous
populations. In contrast, local public goods have found their most prominent use in the
analysis of heterogeneous populations and preference revelation. Furthermore local
public goods have been used to understand the role and structure of local government
whereas club goods have been more about the market. Even these distinctions are not
always binding.
7.3
Single-Product Clubs
The analysis of efﬁciency for a pure public good involves determining how much of
it should be provided. With a club good, it is not just the quantity of the good that
needs to be decided but also the size of the club membership. The latter is important
because of the effect of congestion. Adding a new member allows the cost of provid-
ing a given quantity of public good to be spread among more members but reduces
the beneﬁt obtained by each existing member. With a club good that suffers from

194
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
congestion, there is a second efﬁciency condition involved concerning the correct level
of membership.
7.3.1
Fixed Utilization
Consider now the simplest model of a club. There is a homogeneous population of
consumers who are identical in terms of tastes and income. One private good is available
and one club good. The club good can potentially suffer from congestion. The focus
of attention is on the decision of a single club. It is assumed that a club has formed
with the intention of supplying the club good (imagine a small committee of founder
members setting out its constitution) and is now in the process of deciding how much
of the good to supply and how many members to admit.
To complete the description of the decision problem, it is necessary to consider
the ﬁnancing of the club. Since the club has the ability to exclude nonmembers, it
is able to charge members for the privilege of membership. Unlike a pure public
good, there is then no barrier to ﬁnancing provision of the club good provided that
enough potential members are willing to pay for membership. The most natural as-
sumption to make on the method of charging is that the cost of the club be divided
equally among the members. This charging policy will ensure that the club just breaks
even.
Let each consumer have the utility function U (x, G, n), where x is the consumption
of a private good, G provision of the club good, and n the number of club members.
Utility increases in x and G, and decreases in n if there is congestion. If the cost of
providing G units of the club good is C(G), then the budget constraint of a mem-
ber with income M when the cost of the club is shared equally between members
will be
M = x + C(G)
n
.
(7.1)
The decision problem for those in charge of the club involves choosing G and n to
maximize the welfare of a typical member. Putting together the budget constraint and
the utility function, this can be expressed as
max
{G,n} U

M −C(G)
n
, G, n

.
(7.2)
The ﬁrst-order conditions for this optimization produce the following pair of equations
that characterize efﬁciency:

195
Chapter 7: Club Goods and Local Public Goods
nMRSG,x ≡nUG
Ux
= CG
(7.3)
and
MRSn,x ≡Un
Ux
= −C
n2 .
(7.4)
The ﬁrst of these conditions, (7.3), is a version of the Samuelson rule (6.5) and
describes the level of public good, G, that the club should supply. It states that the sum
of marginal rates of substitution between the public good and the private good for the n
identical members of the club should be equated to the marginal rate of transformation
(or the marginal cost), CG, of another unit of the club good. What it is most important
to observe from this condition is that the process of decision-making within the club
ensures that this efﬁciency condition is satisﬁed. The ability to exclude nonmembers
from consuming the club good permits the club to achieve the correct level of provision.
A club therefore achieves efﬁcient public good provision for its members.
To interpret (7.4), it should ﬁrst be noted that Un ≤0. If there is congestion, Un < 0
and an increase in the number of club members for a given level of provision will reduce
the utility of each through congestion effects. We can treat Un
Ux as the marginal utility
cost of another member of the club. This marginal utility cost is equated to the extent
to which another club member reduces the share of the cost for each existing member.
With Un < 0, (7.4) will determine an efﬁcient level of membership for the club that is
positive and ﬁnite. Again, the club will achieve efﬁciency through its internal decision-
making. In the absence of congestion Un = 0, so the efﬁcient club membership will
be inﬁnite. In practice, this can be interpreted as the club encompassing the entire
population. However, in contrast to the pure public good, the ability to exclude permits
the levy of a membership fee that can ﬁnance the cost of the club. The club therefore
achieves an efﬁcient level of membership.
The arguments to this point can be summarized as follows. A club is able to exclude
nonmembers from consumption of the public good and can levy a charge on members.
If all consumers are identical, then the club will achieve an efﬁcient level of the club
good and an efﬁcient level of membership. If the club good suffers from congestion,
then the membership will be restricted. Without congestion, the entire population will
be members of the club. The collection of membership fees by the club ensures that
it breaks even in its ﬁnancing of the provision of the club good. This fundamental
insight that clubs can attain efﬁciency in the provision of public goods is attributed to
the seminal work of Buchanan (1965) who was the ﬁrst to develop the theory of clubs.

196
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
In terms of the earlier discussion, Buchanan observed that joining a club constitutes an
act of preference revelation that permits the attainment of efﬁciency.
7.3.2
Variable Utilization
The model of the club used above does not probe too deeply into the nature of the
good that the club supplies. When this is considered further, it becomes apparent that
it is not the number of club members that matters for congestion but how frequently
the facilities of the club are used. Retaining the assumption that all club members are
identical, the total use of the club is equal to the product of the number of members and
the number of visits that each member makes to the club. In determining its provision,
a club will wish to optimize the number of visits in addition to the size of facility and
the membership.
The model can be easily extended to incorporate a variable rate of visitation into
the analysis. Let v be the number of visits that each member makes to the club. An
increase in the number of visits raises the utility of the member making those visits
but causes congestion through the total number of visits of all members. Letting the
total number of visits be V = nv, the utility function is written U = U (x, G, v, V ),
with the marginal utility to a visit, Uv, positive and the marginal congestion effect, UV ,
negative. The cost function for providing the club is also modiﬁed to make it dependent
on the total number of visits, nv.
With this extension the optimization problem for the club becomes
max
{x,G,v,n} U(x, G, v, V )
subject to
M = x + C(G, nv)
n
.
(7.5)
The necessary condition for efﬁcient provision of the public good by the club is
nUG
Ux
= CG.
(7.6)
Condition (7.6) is again the Samuelson rule for the club equating the sum of marginal
rates of substitution to the marginal cost of provision. The necessary condition for
efﬁcient club membership is
v UV
Ux
= −C
n2 + vCV
n .
(7.7)
In this condition, v UV
Ux is the marginal loss of utility through the congestion caused by
an additional club member. This is equated to the reduction in cost through increased

197
Chapter 7: Club Goods and Local Public Goods
membership, −C
n2 , offset by the increased cost of servicing additional visits, vCV
n . The
third efﬁciency condition determines the number of visits to the club that each member
should make. This is given by
Uv
Ux
= CV −nUV
Ux
,
(7.8)
which equates the marginal beneﬁt of an additional visit to the marginal maintenance
cost plus the marginal congestion cost an extra visit imposes on all members of the
club.
As with the case of ﬁxed visits, if the decision-making of the club is guided by these
three efﬁciency conditions, then it will ensure an efﬁcient allocation of resources for its
members. It will accept the correct number of members, provide the correct quantity of
public good, and set visit levels correctly. Therefore introducing a variable visitation
rate does not affect the basic conclusion that clubs will supply excludable public goods
efﬁciently.
However, there is a very important distinction between the cases of variable and
ﬁxed utilization. This analysis of variable utilization retained the assumption that there
is a ﬁxed charge for membership but no further charges for visits. Consequently, once
someone has become a member of the club, the price for each additional visit is zero. In
choosing visits, each member will only take account of the private cost of the increase
in congestion and not the cost they impose on other members. Therefore they will make
an excessive number of visits to the club. In brief, the ﬁxed charge does not impose
the correct incentives on members to decentralize the efﬁcient outcome. To implement
the optimum deﬁned, it is therefore necessary for a club charging a ﬁxed fee to directly
regulate the number of visits. This is rather strong restriction on the behavior of the
club and motivates the study of an alternative pricing scheme.
7.3.3
Two-Part Tariff
To provide a starting point for the study of a more sophisticated pricing scheme, it
is worth formalizing the ﬁnal comments of the previous subsection. Assume that the
club has chosen its efﬁcient provision, G∗, membership, n∗, and visits, v∗, and that its
membership fee, which is based on all members abiding by the number of visits, is given
by F ∗= C(G∗, n∗v∗)
n∗
. Now consider the incentives facing a member of the club who
believes all other members will make v∗visits. Putting together the budget constraint,
M = x + F ∗, and the utility function, the club member faces the optimization

198



(7.9)
The choice of v, taking the choices of G∗, [n∗−1] v∗, and F ∗as given, then satisﬁes
the necessary condition
Uv + UV = 0.
(7.10)
Consequently the member will choose to make visits to the point at which the marginal
utility of visits is completely offset by the marginal disutility of congestion. This is
not the efﬁciency condition as given by (7.8); it in fact leads to a number of visits in
excess of the optimum because the member disregards the congestion cost imposed on
others. This condition demonstrates how the membership fee fails to place the correct
incentives in place, so it can only be efﬁcient if visits are directly regulated.
Assume that instead of a membership fee, the club charges a price per visit (or user
fee). If the price is denoted p and the membership fee is set at F = 0, then the number
of visits is chosen to solve
max
{x,v} U


subject to
M = x + pv.
(7.11)
The necessary conditions for this optimization can be combined to give
p = Uv
Ux
+ UV
Ux
.
(7.12)
Given the price, visits will be made up to the point at which the price is equal to the
marginalbeneﬁtofanothervisitlesstheadditionalcongestioncostitcauses. Contrasting
this to (7.8) shows that the efﬁcient number of visits will be sustained if the price is set
so that
p = CV −(n −1)UV
Ux
.
(7.13)
However, it follows from efﬁcient membership condition (7.7) that at this price the
total revenue raised falls short of the cost of the club, since
nvp = C + nv UV
Ux
< C
(7.14)
by the fact that UV < 0. This inequality shows the important result that a membership
fee alone cannot both generate the correct number of visits and allow the club to break
even.

199
Chapter 7: Club Goods and Local Public Goods
The charging scheme that is required to ﬁnance the club and control visits is a two-
part tariff consisting of a membership fee and a user fee. Let the ﬁxed part of the
two-part tariff be given by F and the user fee be p. With this tariff the club solves
max
{x,v,G,n} U(x, G, v, nv)
subject to
M = x + F + pv,
and
nF + pnv = C(G, nv) ,
(7.15)
where both the individual budget constraint and the break-even constraint for the club
have been imposed. The necessary conditions for this optimization readily yield the
efﬁciency conditions (7.6) and (7.8), while the charging condition becomes
F + pv = vCV −nv UV
Ux
,
(7.16)
which is the analogue of (7.7). Taken together, these observations show that the two-part
tariff allows the club to break even and attain efﬁciency.
This section has addressed the issue of charging when the number of visits to the
club cannot be controlled directly. It has shown that with variable utilization a two-part
tariff is required. The cost per visit is used to control the number of visits while the
ﬁxed fee covers any residual payment needed for the club to break even.
7.4
Clubs and the Economy
The analysis of the decision process of an individual club demonstrated that the club
will ensure efﬁciency of provision for its membership. It is tempting to conclude from
this observation that the argument can be extended to the economy as a whole, with
efﬁciency in public good provision attained by the population of consumers separating
themselves into a series of efﬁcient clubs. This was the conclusion reached by Buchanan
(1965). We now argue that although this may sometimes be so, it is by no means
guaranteed.
There are two settings in which the issue of economywide efﬁciency can be con-
sidered. The ﬁrst setting, and the analytically simpler of the two, is to consider an
economy where the efﬁcient size of club is small relative to the total population. This
situation applies when the club suffers from signiﬁcant congestion, so its efﬁcient size
is relatively small, and population size is large. The second setting is when the efﬁcient
size of the club is large relative to the total population. This can arise either through
limited congestion or through there being a small population. Either of these settings

200
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
can potentially occur, and they give very different perspectives on the efﬁciency of
clubs at the level of the economy.
7.4.1
Small Clubs
Consider ﬁrst an economy in which the size of the efﬁcient membership of a club is
small relative to the size of the total population. This allows some very clear conclusions
to be obtained.
To understand the effect of this assumption, consider what happens as population size
increases. Initially, with a small population, there will either be some of the population
who are not in an efﬁciently sized club, or else every club will differ slightly in size
from the efﬁcient level. In the ﬁrst case, as the size of the population increases, the
number of those not in an efﬁciently sized club becomes trivial compared to the total
population, so the deviation from efﬁciency tends to zero. In the second case, as the
population increases, the deviation of each club from the optimum size becomes smaller
and smaller, so again the inefﬁciency tends to zero. Therefore increases in population
size eventually wipe out the deviation from efﬁciency.
The limiting interpretation of a large population is one which is inﬁnite in number.
Assuming an inﬁnite population allows the standard “tricks” that can be played with
an inﬁnity. In particular, if the population size is inﬁnite, then it can be divided exactly
into an inﬁnite number of optimal efﬁciently sized clubs. The provision of public goods
by clubs is then efﬁcient for each club and for the economy as a whole.
The conclusion of this analysis is that if the efﬁcient membership of each club is
small relative to the total population, then the outcome for the economy will be that
a very large number of clubs will form each with the correct number of members and
each providing the efﬁcient level of service. Hence efﬁciency will be attained for the
economy as a whole. In this case the efﬁciency of each individual club is reﬂected at
the aggregate level.
7.4.2
Large Clubs
The second case, which is more interesting from both a practical and an analytical
perspective, arises when the efﬁcient membership of each club is relatively large com-
pared to the total population. In this case the population size can support only a limited
number of efﬁciently sized clubs.
Two outcomes are then possible. It may be that the total population size is an integer
multiple of the number of clubs. This allows the population to be divided neatly among

Utility and club size
the clubs and efﬁciency is achieved. However, such a neat match between club size
and population is very unlikely. The more likely outcome is that there will be some
remainder when the total population is divided by optimum club size. The outcome in
this situation requires some careful analysis.
To focus the argument, assume that the total population is more than the optimum
size of a club but less than twice the optimum. With the total population denoted by N
and the optimum club size by n∗, utility as a function of the size of the club is graphed
in ﬁgure 7.1. The assumptions imply that membership of a club of size N
2 produces less
utility than that of a club of size n∗.
To determine the equilibrium, it is necessary to be clear about what is possible and
what is not in terms of membership fees. For reasons that will become clear, a distinction
must be made between cases where all members of a club must pay the same fee and
cases where fees can be different among members. The latter case can be interpreted
as all club members paying the same fee but making transfers, or “compensation”
payments, among themselves. If this occurs, the fees net of transfers will differ.
Equal Fees
Let all members of each club pay the same fee. In this case it is easy to see that two
clubs of size N
2 cannot be an equilibrium. Start from such a position and consider the
decision problem of an individual. Assume that all other club members remain in their

202
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
initial clubs, which is an application of Nash equilibrium. The individual can stay in
the same club or move to the other club. If individuals change clubs, the club they
move to increases in membership from N
2 to N+1
2 . This larger club provides greater
utility, so moving is the preferred choice. Existing members of the club also beneﬁt
from an increase in membership and will welcome a new member. Because there is an
incentive to change clubs, the initial position could not have been an equilibrium. For
there to be equilibrium, one club must be of efﬁcient size n∗and the other club of size
N −n∗. In equilibrium the members of the larger club have a higher level of utility.
Thus they have no motive to move to the smaller club, nor to accept members of the
smaller club, because they will be made worse off by doing so.
The next question is whether this outcome is optimal from the viewpoint of society.
The answer is dependent on the precise situation, but for the example in ﬁgure 7.1, the
possibilities can be grouped into four categories. To see this, note that the social decision
must be to choose whether to have one club or two clubs. When there is a single club, it
may be beneﬁcial to exclude some individuals from the club altogether. Alternatively,
the single club may contain the entire population. If it is optimal to have two clubs,
these may be equally sized or may be dissimilar. Summarizing this discussion gives
the following breakdown of potential optimum conﬁgurations:
1. a single club, some of the population excluded;
2. a single club containing the entire population;
3. two equally sized clubs; or
4. two unequal clubs.
Outcome 1 will occur if it is too costly to form a new club for a small number of
members and additional membership of the single club reduces the beneﬁt of existing
members signiﬁcantly. The contrast with outcomes 2, 3, and 4 depends on the costs of
congestion relative to the gains from being closer to the efﬁcient level of membership.
For instance, in outcome 3, with two equally sized clubs, both must have less than the
efﬁcient membership. The question then has to be asked whether it is better to take
one closer to the efﬁcient level (moving to outcome 4). Those in the larger club will
gain while those left in the smaller club will lose. Contrasting outcome 4 to outcome
2, the question has to be asked whether the smaller club in outcome 4 should be
closed completely and the population all placed in a single club. This will cause a
congestion cost for those initially in the larger club but may beneﬁt those who were
in the smaller club, since the per capita cost will be lower and public good provision
higher.

203
Chapter 7: Club Goods and Local Public Goods
At this level of generality it is not possible to proceed to identify the nature of the
optimal allocation without being completely speciﬁc about the relationships (the utility
function and congestion function) that underlie the model. What can be concluded is
that there is no necessity for the equilibrium position with two dissimilar sized clubs to
be the optimal outcome. So, from the perspective of the entire economy, the actions of
the clubs though individually efﬁcient do not guarantee social optimality. The reason is
that both clubs are competing to become larger, so when one club attracts new members
in order to grow, it does not take into account the cost inﬂicted on the members of the
other club that is becoming smaller.
To illustrate this point consider the following example: The total population, N, is
normalized to have size one (N = 1), and this population has to be allocated between
two clubs in proportions n and 1 −n (with 0 ≤n ≤1). The utility of being in a club
of size n is given by
U(n) = n3(1 −n)
(7.17)
so the utility-maximizing club size is three-quarters of the population (which is greater
than half the population, giving the situation illustrated in ﬁgure 7.1). Clubs with either
the entire population as members or with no members provide zero utility.
We graph the utility of each club member for each partition of the population between
the two clubs in ﬁgure 7.2. The ﬁgure measures the membership n in club A from the
left corner and the membership 1 −n of club B from the right corner. The width of the

ﬁgure is the total population, which is normalized to one. Utility in club A begins at 0
when n = 0 and rises to a maximum when n = 3
4. Reading from the right corner, we
see that utility in club B begins at 0 when n = 1 and rises to a maximum at n = 1
4. The
equilibrium outcome occurs when one club has an efﬁcient membership, with 3
4 of the
population, and the other is inefﬁcient, with just 1
4.
The key feature of this example is that population is too small to allow both clubs to
reachtheirutilitymaximizingsizeof 3
4. Theoptimaloutcomeisobtainedbymaximizing
total welfare
W(n) = nU(n) + (1 −n)U(1 −n).
(7.18)
The necessary condition for optimality is then
U(n) + nU′(n) = U(1 −n) + (1 −n)U′(1 −n),
(7.19)
which requires that the marginal gains of another member be the same for both clubs.
The average level of welfare, W(n)
N , is depicted by twin-peaked curve in ﬁgure 7.2. It
is then readily seen that optimality is achieved at one of the two peaks where there
are two unequally sized clubs. Furthermore the membership allocation at either of
these peaks has one club that exceeds the efﬁcient membership and another club that
falls below. The attainment of optimality requires that the size of the larger club be
pushed beyond the size that maximizes the utility of each member. The reason for
this is that welfare is concerned with the product of n and U(n), so there is always
an incentive to raise the membership of the club generating the higher utility for its
members.
Although this incentive always exists, it is never the dominant effect. Changing the
utility function can affect the optimal outcome, but it will preserve the fundamental
inefﬁciency of the equilibrium outcome. Figure 7.3 depicts the situation for the utility
function
U(n) = n2(1 −n).
(7.20)
The equilibrium involves two unequal clubs, one with 2
3 of the population and the other
with 1
3. The resulting average welfare function is single-peaked, with its maximum
occurring with two equally sized clubs of size n = 1 −n = 1
2. Hence optimality is
attained when both clubs are below the efﬁcient membership.
Unequal Fees
The case where equal fees were paid by all members of a club was complex in terms of
possible outcomes, but that where fees can be unequal is much more so. To gain some

insight into this statement, we begin with a consideration of the determination of the
equilibrium division of members between clubs.
As a starting point, let the allocation of members be the equilibrium found for the
no-transfer case where there is one club of size n∗and one of N −n∗. It was pre-
viously argued that there was no incentive for those in the optimal club to move and
no possibility of those in the smaller club being allowed to move. When unequal fees
are allowable, neither of these claims need be true. Consider ﬁrst a member of the
smaller club. If they were to move to the larger club, they would obtain a utility gain
of U(n∗+ 1) −U(N −n∗). Their presence makes the previously efﬁcient club too
large, so the welfare of its existing members will fall. However, the gain of the new
member could be sufﬁciently great that it would more than compensate the existing
members for their losses and yet still be better off. In other words, the new member
pays a fee greater than that of the existing members and the fee of existing members is
reduced more than sufﬁciently to compensate them for the additional crowding. If this
compensation is possible, then the move between clubs will be allowed and the initial
position cannot be an equilibrium.
Now consider reversing the argument and considering the incentive for a member of
the efﬁcient club to move to the smaller club. With equal fees this would never happen.
Now let unequal fees be allowed. If the move did occur, the club member moving would
lose utility of value U(n∗) −U(N −n∗+ 1), but the existing members of the smaller
club would each gain U(N −n∗+ 1) −U(N −n∗). If they could collectively agree
to pay compensation to the new member (meaning let them pay a lower membership

206
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
fee), then it is possible that the existing members could more than compensate the new
member for the loss incurred in their move while still remaining better off themselves.
These arguments reveal that members of the efﬁcient club may be enticed to the
smaller club and that members of the smaller club may be able to “buy” themselves into
the efﬁcient club. Both of these mechanisms may even be functioning simultaneously.
The outcome of this reasoning is that it may not be possible to ﬁnd any equilibrium,
and even if an equilibrium exists, it is not easy to characterize. Furthermore there is
even less reason to expect any equilibrium that is achieved to be efﬁcient. All of this
occurs because the population cannot be allocated to a set of clubs each with efﬁcient
membership except in the unlikely case of population size being a integer multiple of
the efﬁcient membership level. This problem does not diminish even when population
size increases.
There is one situation in which this argument does not apply. Consider again the
graph of utility as a function of club size drawn in ﬁgure 7.1. The problems of dividing
the population into efﬁcient clubs resulted from the fact that there was a unique value for
efﬁcient club membership. If the graph were instead like ﬁgure 7.4, with a ﬂat section
at its peak, then there would be a range of efﬁcient sizes. To see the effect of this, let
the efﬁcient club size range from 2 to 3. Then a population of 11 consumers could be
divided into three clubs of size 3 and one of size 2 and the economy would achieve
efﬁciency. Of course, with a population of size 11, this could not be done if efﬁcient

club size was unique (unless it was 11). Furthermore any population size greater than
11 can be divided into efﬁciently sized clubs.
The general version of this argument is illustrated in ﬁgure 7.5. For a single club
the range of efﬁcient memberships is between n′ and n′′. When there are two clubs,
efﬁciency can occur for the range 2n′ to 2n′′. This extension of the range continues as
additional clubs are introduced. Eventually, if the total population is large enough, the
ranges of values of total population for which efﬁciency cannot be achieved shrink to
zero (alternatively, the ranges of optimal size overlap) and all consumers can be placed
in efﬁcient clubs.
7.4.3
Conclusion
The conclusion of this section has to be that the efﬁciency of the individual club does
not always translate into efﬁciency for the economy. In a large population approximate
efﬁciency will be achieved, and individual utility will be virtually equal to maximal
attainable utility. However, when there is a small-number problem, efﬁciency will not
be achieved by the equilibrium allocation of members between clubs. This should not
be surprising since small numbers introduces problems akin to those found in oligopoly
markets. What occurs is that small groups of consumers are able to affect their own
utility levels by choosing to form efﬁciently sized clubs. Therefore they possess market
power, and this is reﬂected in the inefﬁciency. These problems are eliminated if there
are a range of efﬁcient club sizes.

Local Public Goods
The concept of a local public good was introduced in section 7.2. A local public good
has the feature that its beneﬁts are restricted to a particular geographical area and it
cannot be enjoyed outside of that area. In relating this idea to the analysis of club goods,
one could think of local communities as clubs that are formed to provide local public
goods. To become a member of a local community, a consumer must move into the area
(i.e., join the club) and pay whatever local taxes are levied in that community (i.e., pay
the membership fee). Once they have done this, they can then enjoy the local public
goods that are provided.
An important feature of the club good was that exclusion was possible, and it is
interesting to discuss whether this is the case with local public goods. There are two
points at which exclusion may be possible. First, a consumer must become resident
in an area in order to beneﬁt from the local public good. Although few (if any) local
authorities have the right to prevent the resale of houses or to forcibly evict existing
occupants, they do have the power to prevent additional new building. Consequently,
although reductions in population may be hard to achieve (unlike expulsions in an
ordinary club), the exclusion of additional members is possible. Second, there is the
payment of taxes. Any resident who refuses to pay local taxes can be either forced to
pay or excluded from the club, since local authorities have legal authority to collect
taxation. If we impose the possibility of exclusion, then the analysis of local public
goods becomes exactly that of the clubs we have already considered. However, the
analysis of nonexclusion is also of interest with local public goods, since this captures
the idea of a freely operating market in which individuals have the freedom to select
their preferred residential location. We now focus on nonexclusion.
The concept of local public goods can be applied to the provision of public services
by local regions in order to understand the allocation of a population between different
localities. Intuitively we can think of localities competing for population by setting the
package of public good provision and taxation they offer. Members of the population
look at what is offered in different localities and select the one that offers the highest
utility level. This will cause population ﬂows until no one can gain by moving locality.
This is similar to the adjustment process for club goods except for the fact that there is
free access (i.e., no possibility of barring access to new migrants even if the existing
population would lose from the immigration).
In this framework it is natural to question whether an efﬁcient equilibrium will be
attained. The localities are competing for population and no restrictions are imposed

209
Chapter 7: Club Goods and Local Public Goods
on the freedom of the population to move between regions. With clubs, efﬁciency was
achieved at least within the clubs. To see whether the same is true for local public
goods, it is necessary to construct a model of location choice.
Consider a total population of H consumers that is to be divided between two lo-
calities, with h being the population of a locality (we use different notation to avoid
confusion with club membership). Each locality provides a local public good ﬁnanced
through a charge on the population. As the population increases, the unit cost of the
public good per resident is reduced. This is the beneﬁt from increased population. There
is also a cost to increasing population. This can be motivated by assuming that there is
a ﬁxed resource in each region so that income per person falls as the population rises
and this resource has to be shared among a greater number.
These assumptions imply that income can be written as a decreasing function, M(h),
of the population of a locality. Think of wages or welfare beneﬁts reducing with in-
creased immigration. If the locality provides G units of the public good, the charge
per resident is G
h . Combining these obtains the income left to spend on private goods,
M(h) −G
h , and the resulting level of utility, U(M(h) −G
h , G).
It is assumed that localities choose the level of public good optimally given their
population. This eliminates the possibility of inefﬁciency through a level of provision
that does not satisfy the Samuelson rule. Given a population h, the level of public good
provision satisﬁes the Samuelson rule
hUG
Ux
= 1.
(7.21)
This condition can be solved to ﬁnd the level of public good, G(h), which depends on
the population of the locality. Substituting the level of the public good into the utility
function determines the level of utility as a function of population. This relationship
is written in brief as U(h). The implications of the model follow from the fact that an
increase in h can increase or decrease utility. Differentiating U(h) with respect to h
shows that
U′ = UxM′ + Ux
 G
h2

.
(7.22)
The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side is negative, since an increase in population reduces
income M, while the second term is positive because the cost of the public good is re-
duced. It is therefore unclear what the net effect will be. To analyze the model further,
assume that utility initially increases with the population until it reaches a maximum
and then decreases. In addition let U(H) >U(0) so that having all the population in

210
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
a single locality leads to higher utility than having no population. This can be moti-
vated by the fact that a small number of people ﬁnd it very expensive to provide the
public good, but the income is not reduced too far when the entire population is in one
locality.
The dynamics of migration are that the population always ﬂows from the locality
with the lower utility to the locality with the higher utility. An equilibrium is reached
when both localities offer the same utility level or else all the population is in one
region. Consequently, if U(H) ≥U(0), an equilibrium can have all the population
locating in one region or have the population divided between the two localities with
utilities equalized. In the latter equilibrium U(h1) = U(h2). The outcomes that can arise
in this model can be illustrated by graphing the utility against the population in the two
regions.
A possible structure of the utility function is shown in ﬁgure 7.6. This ﬁgure mea-
sures the population in locality 1 from the left corner and the population in locality 2
from the right corner. The width of the ﬁgure is the total population. The essential fea-
ture of this ﬁgure is that the population level that maximizes utility is less than half the
total population. There are ﬁve potential equilibria at a, b, c, d, and e. The equilibrium
at c is symmetric with both regions having a population of H
2 . This equilibrium is also
stable and will arise from any starting point between b and d. The two asymmetric
equilibria at b and d are unstable. For instance, starting just above b, the population

will adjust to c. Starting just below b, the population will adjust to a. The two extremes
points, a and e, where all the population are located within one of the two localities are
stable but inefﬁcient.
An alternative structure of utility is shown in ﬁgure 7.7. The change made is that
the utility-maximizing population of a locality is now greater than one-half of the
total population. There is still a symmetric and efﬁcient equilibrium at b. But this
equilibrium is now unstable: starting with a population below b, the ﬂow of population
will lead to the extreme outcome at a, whereas starting above b will lead to c. The two
extreme equilibria are stable but inefﬁcient. All consumers would prefer the symmetric
equilibrium to either of the extreme equilibria.
What this simple model shows is that there is no reason why ﬂows of population
between localities will achieve efﬁciency. It is possible for the economy to get trapped in
an inefﬁcient equilibrium. In this case the market economy does not function efﬁciently.
The reason for this is that the movement between localities of one consumer affects
both the population left behind and the population the consumer joins. These nonmarket
linkages lead to the inefﬁciency.

The Tiebout Hypothesis
The previous section has shown that inefﬁciency can arise when the population divides
between two regions on the basis of their provision of local public goods. From this
result it would be natural to infer that inefﬁciency will always be an issue with local
public goods. It is therefore surprising that the Tiebout hypothesis asserts instead that
efﬁciency will always be obtained with local public goods.
Tiebout observed that pure public goods lead to market failure because of the difﬁcul-
ties connected with information transmission. Since the true valuation by a consumer of
a public good cannot be observed and a pure public good is nonexcludable, free-riding
occurs and private provision is inefﬁcient. This point was explored in the previous
chapter. Now assume that there are a number of alternative communities where a con-
sumer can choose to live and that these differ in their provision of local public goods.
In contrast to the pure public good case, a consumer’s choice of which location to live
in provides a very clear signal of preferences. The chosen location is obviously the one
offering the provision of local public goods closest to the consumer’s ideal. Hence,
through community choice, preference revelation takes place. Misrepresenting prefer-
ence cannot help a consumer here, since the choice of a nonoptimal location merely
reduces the consumer’s welfare level. The only rational choice is to act honestly.
The ﬁnal step in the argument can now be constructed. When preference revelation is
taking place, it follows that if there are enough different types of community and enough
consumers with each kind of preference, then all consumers will allocate themselves
to a community that is optimal for them and each community will be optimally sized.
Thus the market outcome will be fully efﬁcient, and the inefﬁciencies discussed in
connection with pure public goods will not arise. Phrased more prosaically, consumers
reveal their preferences by voting with their feet, and this ensures the construction of
optimal communities. This also shows why the analysis of the previous section failed
to ﬁnd efﬁciency. The existence of at most two localities violated the large-number
assumption employed in this argument.
The signiﬁcance of this efﬁciency result, which is commonly called the Tiebout
hypothesis, has been much debated. Supporters view it as another demonstration of
the power of the market in allocating resources. Critics denounce it as simply another
empty demonstration of what is possible under unrealistic assumptions. Certainly the
Tiebout hypothesis has much the same foundations as the Two Theorems of Welfare
Economics, since both concern economies with no rigidities and large numbers of

213
Chapter 7: Club Goods and Local Public Goods
participants. But there is one important difference between the two: formalizing the
Tiebout hypothesis is a more difﬁcult task.
To obtain an insight into this difﬁculty, some of the steps in the previous argument
need to be retraced. It was assumed that consumers could move between communities
or at least choose between them with no restrictions on their choice. If housing markets
function efﬁciently, there should not be a problem in ﬁnding accommodation. Where
problems do arise is in the link between income and location. An assumption that can
justify the previous analysis is that consumers obtain all their income from “rents”
such as from the ownership of land, property, or shares. In this case it does not matter
where the consumers choose to reside, since the rents will accrue regardless of location.
Once some income is earned from employment, the Tiebout hypothesis only holds if all
employment opportunities are replicated in all communities. Otherwise, communities
with better employment prospects will appear more attractive even if they offer a
slightly less appealing set of local public goods. If the two issues become entangled in
this way, then the Tiebout hypothesis will naturally fail.
Further difﬁculties with the hypothesis arise when the numbers of communities and
individuals is considered. When these are both ﬁnite, the problems already discussed
above with achieving efﬁciency through market behavior arise again. These are com-
pounded when individuals of different types are needed to make communities work.
For example, assume that community A needs 10 doctors and 20 teachers to provide
the optimal combination of local public goods while community B requires 10 po-
lice ofﬁcers and 20 teachers. If doctors, teachers, and police ofﬁcers are not found in
the proportions 1:4:1, then efﬁciency in allocation between the communities cannot be
achieved. Furthermore, if all teachers have different tastes from doctors and from police
ofﬁcers, then neither community can supply the ideal local public good combination
to meet all tastes.
The efﬁciency of the allocation can nevertheless be recovered in two steps. First, if
we appeal again to the large population assumption, the issue of achieving the precise
mix of different types is eliminated—there will always be enough people of each
type to populate the localities in the correct proportions. Second, even if tastes are
different, it is still possible to obtain agreement on the level of public good through
the use of personalized prices. This issue has already been discussed for public goods
in connection with the Lindahl equilibrium. The same idea can be applied to local
public goods, in which case it would be the local taxes that are differentiated among
residents to equalize the level of public good demand and to attain efﬁciency with a
heterogeneous population.

214
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
The Tiebout hypothesis depends on the freedom of consumers to move to preferred
locations. This is only possible if there are no transactions costs involved in changing
location. In practice, such transactions costs arise in the commission that has to be
paid to estate agents, in legal fees, and in the physical costs of shipping furniture and
belongings. These can be signiﬁcant and cause friction in the movement of consumers
to the extent that suboptimal levels of provision will be tolerated to avoid paying these
costs.
To sum up, the Tiebout hypothesis provides support for allowing the market, by
which is meant the free movement of consumers, to determine the provision of local
public goods. By choosing communities, consumers reveal their tastes. They also have
to abide by local tax law, so free-riding is ruled out. Hence efﬁciency is achieved.
Although apparently simple, there are a number of difﬁculties when the practical im-
plementation of this hypothesis is considered. The population may not partition neatly
into the communities envisaged, and employment ties may bind consumers to locali-
ties whose local public good supply is not to their liking. Transactions costs in housing
markets may be signiﬁcant, and therefore limit the freedom of movement that is key to
the hypothesis. The hypothesis provides an interesting insight into the forces at work
in the formation of communities, but it does not guarantee efﬁciency.
7.7
Empirical Tests
The Tiebout hypothesis provides the reassuring conclusion that efﬁciency is attained by
localcommunitiesprovidingpublicgoodsefﬁciently. Ifcorrect, theforcesofeconomics
and local politics can be left to work unrestricted by government intervention. Given
the strength of this conclusion, and some of the doubts cast on whether the Tiebout
argument really works, it is natural to conduct empirical tests of the hypothesis.
In testing any hypothesis, it is ﬁrst necessary to determine what the observational
implications of the hypothesis will be. For Tiebout, this means isolating what may be
different between an economy in which the Tiebout hypothesis applies and one in which
it does not. Empirical testing has been handicapped by the difﬁculty of establishing
quite what this difference is.
The earlier empirical studies focused on property taxes, public good provision, and
house prices. The reason for this was made clear by Oates, who initiated this line of
research in 1969: local governments fund their activities primarily through property

public goods. Then the jurisdictions with higher property tax rates will be less attractive
and have lower house prices. Now let the provision of public goods vary. With tax rates
held constant, house prices should be higher in areas with more public good provision.
These effects offset each other, and if the public good effect is sufﬁciently strong,
jurisdictions with higher tax rates will actually have higher property prices. Oates
considered evidence on house prices, property tax rates, and educational provision
for 53 primarily residential municipalities in New Jersey. These municipalities were
chosen because the majority of residents commuted to work and hence were not tied
by employment to a particular location. The analysis showed that house prices were
reduced by high property taxes but increased by greater public good provision.
Whether these results were evidence in favor of the Tiebout hypothesis became the
subject of a debate that focused on the implications of the theory. Whereas Oates took
differences in property prices as an indication of the Tiebout hypothesis at work (on
the ground that more attractive locations would witness increased competition for the
housing stock), an alternative argument suggests that a given quality of house would
have the same price in all jurisdictions if Tiebout applied. The argument for uniform
prices is based on the view that property taxes are the price paid for the bundle of public
goods provided by the local government. If this price reﬂects the beneﬁt enjoyed from
the public goods, as it should if the Tiebout hypothesis is functioning, then it should
not affect property prices. Uniform property prices should therefore be expected if the
Tiebout hypothesis applies—an observation that lead to a series of studies looking for
uniform house prices across jurisdictions with different levels of public good provision.
Unfortunately, as Epple, Zelenitz, and Visscher (1978) show, the same conclusion is
true even when the Tiebout hypothesis does not hold so that net-of-tax property prices
should be uniform in all jurisdictions in all circumstances. Instead, they argue that
when the Tiebout hypothesis applies, housing demand is not affected by the property
tax rate, but when Tiebout does not apply, it is affected. Looking at prices, which are
equilibrium conditions, cannot then provide a test of Tiebout. Rather, a test has to be
based on the structural equations of housing demand and location demand and their
dependence, or otherwise, on tax rates. This conclusion undermines the earlier work
on property values but does not provide an easily implementable test.
As a response to these difﬁculties, alternative tests of the hypothesis have been
constructed. One approach to determining whether the Tiebout hypothesis applies is to
consider the level of demand for public goods from the residents of each locality. If the
Tiebout hypothesis applies, residents should have selected a residential location that
providesalevelofpublicgoodsinlinewiththeirpreferences. Hencewithineachlocality
there should be a degree of homogeneity in the level of demand for public goods. Note

216
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
carefully that this does not assert that all residents have the same preferences but only
that, given the taxes and other local charges they pay, their demands are equalized. The
test of the hypothesis is then to consider the variance in demand within regions relative
to the variance in demand across regions. Such a test was conducted by Gramlich
and Rubinfeld who studied households in Michigan suburbs and provided compelling
evidence that there was less variation within regions than across regions.
It is necessary to note that these results do not conﬁrm that the Tiebout hypothesis is
completely operating butonlythatsome sorting ofresidents is occurring. Itis supportive
evidence for the hypothesis but not complete conﬁrmation. This conclusion is only to
be expected since, given the extent of frictions in the housing market, the freedom of
movement necessary for the hypothesis to hold exactly is lacking.
Overall, the empirical work is suggestive that the right forces are at work to push the
economy toward the efﬁcient outcome of Tiebout but that there are residual frictions
that prevent the complete sorting required for the efﬁciency. Having said this, the tests
have been limited to data from suburban areas that have the highest chance of producing
the right outcome. In other locations, where the separation between work and location
is not so simple, the hypothesis would have less chance of applying.

Conclusions
The chapter has discussed the nature of club goods and local public goods, and drawn
the distinction between these and pure public goods. For a club good, the essential
feature is the possibility of exclusion, and it has been shown how exclusion allows an
individual club to attain efﬁciency. Although it is tempting to extend this argument to
the economy as a whole, a series of new issues arise when the allocation of a population
between clubs is analyzed. Efﬁciency may be attained, but it is not guaranteed.
Many of the same issues arise with local public goods whose beneﬁts are restricted to
a given geographical area. We have treated local public goods as a model of provision by
localities where each locality is described by the package of public good and taxation
that it offers. When there is no exclusion from membership, there is no implication
that efﬁciency will be attained when residential choice can be made from only a small
number of localities.
In contrast to this, the Tiebout hypothesis evokes a large-number assumption to argue
that the population will be able to sort itself into a set of localities, each of which is
optimal for its residents. At the heart of this argument is that choice of locality reveals
preferences for public goods, so efﬁciency becomes attainable. The Tiebout hypothesis

217
Chapter 7: Club Goods and Local Public Goods
has been subjected to empirical testing, but the evidence is at best inconclusive. While
it shows some degree of sorting and is certainly not a rejection of Tiebout, it does not
go as far as conﬁrming that the promised efﬁciency is delivered.

Externalities
8.1
Introduction
An externality is a link among economic agents that lies outside the price system of
the economy. Everyday examples include the pollution from a factory that harms a
local ﬁshery and the envy that is felt when a neighbor proudly displays a new car. Such
externalities are not controlled directly by the choices of those affected—the ﬁshery
cannot choose to buy less pollution nor can you choose to buy your neighbor a worse
car. This prevents the efﬁciency theorems described in chapter 2 from applying. Indeed
the demonstration of market efﬁciency was based on the following two presumptions:
• The welfare of each consumer depended solely on her own consumption decision.
• The production of each ﬁrm depended only on its own input and output choices.
In reality these presumptions may not be met. A consumer or a ﬁrm may be directly
affected by the actions of other agents in the economy; that is, there may be external
effects from the actions of other consumers or ﬁrms. In the presence of such externalities
the outcome of a competitive market is unlikely to be Pareto-efﬁcient because agents
will not take account of the external effects of their (consumption/production) decisions.
Typically the economy will generate too great a quantity of “bad” externalities and too
small a quantity of “good” externalities.
The control of externalities is an issue of increasing practical importance. Global
warming and the destruction of the ozone layer are two of the most signiﬁcant ex-
amples, but there are numerous others, from local to global environmental issues.
Some of these externalities may not appear immediately to be economic problems, but
economic analysis can expose why they occur and investigate the effectiveness of alter-
native policies. Economic analysis can generate surprising conclusions and challenge
standard policy prescriptions. In particular, it shows how government intervention that
induces agents to internalize the external effects of their decisions can achieve a Pareto
improvement.
The starting point for the chapter is to provide a working deﬁnition of an externality.
Using this, it is shown why market failure arises and the nature of the resulting inefﬁ-
ciency. The design of the optimal set of corrective, or Pigouvian, taxes is then addressed
and related to missing markets for externalities. The use of taxes is contrasted with
direct control through tradable licenses. Internalization as a solution to externalities is

224
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
considered. Finally these methods of solving the externality problem are set against the
claim of the Coase theorem that efﬁciency will be attained by trade even when there
are externalities.
8.2
Externalities Deﬁned
An externality has already been described as an effect on one agent caused by another.
This section provides a formal statement of this description, which is then used to
classify the various forms of externalities. The way of representing these forms of
externalities in economic models is introduced.
There have been several attempts at deﬁning externalities and of providing classiﬁca-
tions of various types of externalities. From among these the following deﬁnition is the
most commonly adopted. Its advantages are that it places the emphasis on recognizing
externalities through their effects and it leads to a natural system of classiﬁcation.
Deﬁnition 8.1 (Externality)
An externality is present whenever some economic
agent’s welfare (utility or proﬁt) is “directly” affected by the action of another agent
(consumer or producer) in the economy.
By “directly” we exclude any effects that are mediated by prices. That is, an ex-
ternality is present if a ﬁshery’s productivity is affected by the river pollution of an
upstream oil reﬁnery but not if the ﬁshery’s proﬁtability is affected by the price of oil
(which may depend on the oil reﬁnery’s output of oil). The latter type of effect (often
called a pecuniary externality) is present in any competitive market but creates no inef-
ﬁciency (since price mediation through competitive markets leads to a Pareto-efﬁcient
outcome). We will present later an illustration of a pecuniary externality.
This deﬁnition of an externality implicitly distinguishes between two broad cate-
gories. A production externality occurs when the effect of the externality is on a proﬁt
relationship and a consumption externality whenever a utility level is affected. Clearly,
an externality can be simultaneously both a consumption and a production externality.
For example, pollution from a factory may affect the proﬁt of a commercial ﬁshery and
the utility of leisure anglers.
Using this deﬁnition of an externality, it is possible to move on to how they can be
incorporated into the analysis of behavior. Denote, as in chapter 2, the consumption
levels of the households by x =

x1, . . . , xH
and the production plans of the ﬁrms
by y =

y1, . . . , ym
. It is assumed that consumption externalities enter the utility

225
Chapter 8: Externalities
functions of the households and that production externalities enter the production sets
of the ﬁrms. At the most general level, this assumption implies that the utility functions
take the form
Uh = Uh(x, y) ,
h = 1, . . . ,H,
(8.1)
and the production sets are described by
Y j = Y j(x, y) ,
j = 1, . . . , m.
(8.2)
In this formulation the utility functions and the production sets are potentially dependent
on the entire arrays of consumption and production levels. The expressions in (8.1)
and (8.2) represent the general form of the externality problem, and in some of the
discussion below a number of further restrictions will be employed.
It is immediately apparent from (8.1) and (8.2) that the actions of the agents in the
economy will no longer be independent or determined solely by prices. The linkages via
the externality result in the optimal choice of each agent being dependent on the actions
of others. Viewed in this light, it becomes apparent why competition will generally not
achieve efﬁciency in an economy with externalities.
8.3
Market Inefﬁciency
It has been accepted throughout the discussion above that the presence of externalities
will result in the competitive equilibrium failing to be Pareto-efﬁcient. The immediate
implication of this fact is that incorrect quantities of goods, and hence externalities, will
be produced. It is also clear that a non–Pareto-efﬁcient outcome will never maximize
welfare. This provides scope for economic policy to improve the outcome. The purpose
of this section is to demonstrate how inefﬁciency can arise in a competitive economy.
The results are developed in the context of a simple two-consumer model, since this is
sufﬁcient for the purpose and also makes the relevant points as clear as possible.
Consider a two-consumer, two-good economy where the consumers have utility
functions
U1 = x1 + u1(z1) + v1(z2)
(8.3)
and
U2 = x2 + u2(z2) + v2(z1).
(8.4)

226
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
The externality effect in (8.3) and (8.4) is generated by consumption of good z by the
consumers. The externality will be positive if vh(·) is increasing in the consumption
level of the other consumer and negative if it is decreasing.
To complete the description of the economy, it is assumed that the supply of good x
comes from an endowment ωh to consumer h, whereas good z is produced from good
x by a competitive industry that uses one unit of good x to produce one unit of good
z. Normalizing the price of good x at 1, the structure of production ensures that the
equilibrium price of good z must also be 1. Given this, all that needs to be determined for
this economy is the division of the initial endowment into quantities of the two goods.
Incorporating this assumption into the maximization decision of the consumers, the
competitive equilibrium of the economy is described by the equations
u′
h(zh) = 1,
h = 1, 2,
(8.5)
xh + zh = ωh,
h = 1, 2,
(8.6)
and
x1 + z1 + x2 + z2 = ω1 + ω2.
(8.7)
It is equation (8.5) that is of primary importance at this point. For consumer h these state
that the private marginal beneﬁt from each good, determined by the marginal utility,
is equated to the private marginal cost. The external effect does not appear directly
in the determination of the equilibrium. The question we now address is whether this
competitive market equilibrium is efﬁcient.
The Pareto-efﬁcient allocations are found by maximizing the total utility of con-
sumers 1 and 2, subject to the production possibilities. The equations that result from
this will then be contrasted to (8.5). In detail, a Pareto-efﬁcient allocation solves


x2 + u2(z2) + v2(z1)

,
(8.8)
subject to
ω1 + ω2 −x1 −z1 −x2 −z2 ≥0.
(8.9)
The solution is characterized by the conditions
u′
1(z1) + v′
2(z1) = 1
(8.10)
and

227
Chapter 8: Externalities
u′
2(z2) + v′
1(z2) = 1.
(8.11)
In (8.10) and (8.11) the externality effect can be seen to affect the optimal allocation
between the two goods via the derivatives of utility with respect to the externality. If
the externality is positive, then v′
h > 0 and the externality effect will raise the value
of the left-hand terms. It will decrease their value if there is a negative externality,
so v′
h < 0. It can then be concluded that at the optimum with a positive externality
the marginal utilities of both consumers are below their value in the market outcome.
The converse is true with a negative externality. The externality leads to a divergence
between the private valuations of consumption given by (8.5) and the corresponding
social valuations in (8.10) and (8.11). This observation has the implication that the
market outcome is not Pareto-efﬁcient.
In general, it can also be concluded that if the externality is positive then more
of good z will be consumed at the optimum than under the market outcome. The
converse holds for a negative externality. This situation is illustrated in ﬁgure 8.1.
The market outcome is represented by equality between the private marginal beneﬁt
of the good (PMB) and its marginal cost (MC). The social marginal beneﬁt (SMB) of
the good is the sum of the private marginal beneﬁt, u′
h(zh), and the marginal external
effect, v′
˜h(zh). When v′
˜h(zh) is positive, SMB is above PMB. The converse holds when
v′
˜h(zh) is negative. The Pareto-efﬁcient outcome equates the social marginal beneﬁt to
marginal cost. The market failure is characterized by too much consumption of a good

causing a negative externality and too little consumption of a good generating a positive

Externality Examples
The previous section has discussed externalities at a somewhat abstract level. We now
consider more concrete examples of externalities. Some of the examples are very simple
because of the binary nature of the choice and the assumption of identical individuals.
This modeling choice was widely used by Schelling to achieve an extremely simple
exposition that brings out the line of the argument very clearly. In addition it will
illustrate the range of situations that fall under the general heading of externalities.

River Pollution
This example, from Louis Gevers, is one of the simplest examples that can be described
using only two agents. Assume that two ﬁrms are located along the same river. The
upstream ﬁrm u pollutes the river, which reduces the production (e.g., the output of
ﬁsh) of the downstream ﬁrm d. Both ﬁrms produce the same output, which they sell at
a constant unit price of 1 so that total revenue coincides with production.
Labor and water are used as inputs. Water is free, but the equilibrium wage w on the
competitive labor market is paid for each unit of labor. The production technologies
of the ﬁrms are given by F u(Lu) and F d
Ld, Lu
, with ∂F d
∂Lu < 0 to reﬂect that the
pollution reduces downstream output. Decreasing returns to scale are assumed with
respect to own labor input. Each ﬁrm acts independently and seeks to maximize its
own proﬁt πi = F i(·) −wLi, taking prices as given.
The equilibrium is illustrated in ﬁgure 8.2. The total stock of labor is allocated be-
tween the two ﬁrms. The labor input of the upstream ﬁrm is measured from the left, that
of the downstream from the right. Each point on the horizontal axis represents a differ-
ent allocation between the ﬁrms. The upstream ﬁrm’s proﬁt maximization process is
represented in the upper part of the diagram and the downstream ﬁrm’s in the lower part.
As the input of the upstream ﬁrm increases, the production function of the downstream
ﬁrm moves progressively toward the horizontal axis. Given the proﬁt-maximizing in-
put level of the upstream ﬁrm, denoted Lu∗, the downstream ﬁrm can do no better than
choose Ld∗. At these choices the ﬁrms earn proﬁts πu and πd respectively. This is
the competitive equilibrium. We now show that this is inefﬁcient and that reallocating
labor between the ﬁrms can increase total proﬁt and reduce pollution.

Equilibrium with river pollution
Consider starting at the competitive equilibrium and make a small reduction in the
labor input to the upstream ﬁrm. Since the choice was optimal for the upstream ﬁrm,
the change has no effect on proﬁt for the upstream ﬁrm (recall that ∂πu
∂Lu = 0). However,
it leads to an outward shift of the downstream ﬁrm’s production function. This raises its
proﬁts. Hence the change raises aggregate proﬁt. This demonstrates that the competitive
equilibrium is not efﬁcient and that the externality results in the upstream ﬁrm using
too much labor and the downstream too little. Shifting labor to the downstream ﬁrm
raises total production and reduces pollution.

Trafﬁc Jams
The next example considers the externalities imposed by drivers on each other. Let there
be N commuters who have the choice of commuting by train or by car. Commuting by
train always takes 40 minutes regardless of the number of travelers. The commuting

time by car increases as the number of car users increases. This congestion effect, which
raises the commuting time, is the externality for travelers. Individuals must each make
decisions to minimize their own transportation time.
The equilibrium in the choice of commuting mode is depicted in ﬁgure 8.3. The
number of car users will adjust until the travel time by car is exactly equal to the travel
time by train. For the travel time depicted in the ﬁgure, the equilibrium occurs when
40 percent of commuters travel by car. The optimum occurs when the aggregate time
saving is maximized. This occurs when only 20 percent of commuters use a car.
The externality in this situation is that the car drivers take into account only their own
travel time but not the fact that they will increase the travel time for all other drivers.
As a consequence too many commuters choose to drive.
8.4.3
Pecuniary Externality
Consider a set of students each of whom must decide whether to be an economist or a
lawyer. Being an economist is great when there are few economists, and not so great
when the labor market becomes crowded with economists (due to price competition). If
the number of economists grows high enough, they will eventually earn less than their
lawyer counterparts. Suppose that each person chooses the profession with the best
earnings prospects. The externality (a pecuniary one!) comes from the fact that when
one more person decides to become an economist, he lowers all other economists’

231
Chapter 8: Externalities
incomes (through competition), imposing a cost on the existing economists. When
making his decision, he ignores this external effect imposed on others. The question is
whether the invisible hand will lead to the correct allocation of students across different
jobs.
The equilibrium depicted in ﬁgure 8.4 determines the allocation of students between
jobs. The number of economists will adjust until the earnings of an economist are
exactly equal to the earnings of a lawyer. The equilibrium is given by the percentage of
economists at point E. To the right of point E, lawyers would earn more and the number
of economists would decrease. Alternatively, to the left of point E economists are
relatively few in number and will earn more than lawyers, attracting more economists
into the profession.
The laissez-faire equilibrium is efﬁcient because the external effect is a change in
price. The cost to an economists of a lower income is a beneﬁt to employers. Since
employers’ beneﬁts equals employees’ costs, there is zero net effect. The policy im-
plication is that there is no need for government intervention to regulate the access to
professions. It follows that any public policy that aims to limit the access to some pro-
fession, like the numerus clausus, is not justiﬁed. Market forces will correctly allocate
the right number of people to each of the different professions.

The Rat Race Problem
The rat race problem is a contest for relative position as pointed out by GeorgeAkerlof.
It can help explain why students work too hard when ﬁnal marking takes the form of a
ranking. It can also explain the intense competition for a promotion in the workplace
when candidates compete with each other and only the best is promoted. We take the
classroom example here. Assume that performance is judged not in absolute terms but
in relative terms so that what matters is not how much is known but how much is known
compared to what other students know.
In this situation an advantage over other students can only be gained by working
harder than they do. Since this applies to all students, all must work harder. But since
performance is judged in relative terms, all the extra effort cancels out. The result
of this is an inefﬁcient rat race in which each student works too hard to no ultimate
advantage. If all could agree to work less hard, the same grades would be obtained with
less work. Such an agreement to work less hard cannot be self-supporting, since each
student would then have an incentive to cheat on the agreement and work harder.
A simple variant of the rat race with two possible effort levels is shown in ﬁgure 8.5.
In this ﬁgure, c, 0 < c < 1
2, denotes the cost of effort. For both students high effort is a
dominant strategy. In contrast, the Pareto-efﬁcient outcome is low effort. This game is
an example of the prisoners’ dilemma whereby a Pareto improvement could be made
if the players could make a commitment to the low-effort strategy.
Another example of rat race is the use of performance-enhancing drugs by athletes.
In the absence of effective drug regulations, many athletes will feel compelled to
enhance their performance by using anabolic steroids, and the failure to use steroids
might seriously reduce their success in competition. Since the rewards in athletics are

determined by performance relative to others, anyone that uses such drugs to increase
their chance of winning must necessarily reduce the chances of others (an externality
effect). The result is that when the stakes are high in the competition, unregulated
contests almost always lead to a race for using more and more performance-enhancing
drugs. However, when everyone does so, the use of such drugs yields no real beneﬁts
for the contestants as a whole: the performance-enhancing actions cancel each other.
At the same time the race imposes substantial risks. Anabolic steroids have been shown
to cause cancer of the liver and other serious health problems. Given what is at stake,
voluntary restraint is unlikely to be an effective solution, and public intervention now
requires strict drug testing of all competing athletes.
The rat race problem is present in almost every contest where something important
is at stake and rewards are determined by relative position. In an electoral competition
race, contestants spend millions on advertising, and governing bodies have now put
strict limits on the amount of campaign advertising. Similarly a ban on cigarette ad-
vertising has been introduced in many countries. Surprisingly enough, this ban turned
out to be beneﬁcial to cigarette companies. The reason is that the ban helped them out
of the costly rat race in defensive advertising where a company had to advertise because
the others did.
8.4.5
The Tragedy of the Commons
The tragedy of the commons arises from the common right of access to a resource. The
inefﬁciency to which it leads results again from the divergence between the individual
and social incentives that characterizes all externality problems.
Consider a lake that can be used by ﬁshermen from a village located on its banks.
The ﬁshermen do not own boats but instead can rent them for daily use at a cost c. If
B boats are hired on a particular day, the number of ﬁsh caught by each boat will be
F(B), which is decreasing in B. A ﬁsherman will hire a boat to ﬁsh if they can make a
positive proﬁt. Let w be the wage if they choose to undertake paid employment rather
than ﬁsh, and let p = 1 be the price of ﬁsh so that total revenue coincide with ﬁsh
catch F(B). Then the number of boats that ﬁsh will be such as to ensure that proﬁt from
ﬁshing activity is equal to the opportunity cost of ﬁshing, which is the forgone wage
w from the alternative job (if proﬁt were greater, more boats would be hired and the
converse if it were smaller). The equilibrium number of boats, B∗, then satisﬁes
π = F

B∗
−c = w.
(8.12)

234

The optimal number of boats for the community, B

the total proﬁt for the village, net of the opportunity cost from ﬁshing. Hence B

This gives the necessary condition

(8.14)
Since an increase in the number of boats reduces the quantity of ﬁsh caught by each,
F ′

< 0. Therefore contrasting (8.12) and (8.14) shows that B
◦< B∗, so the equi-
librium number of boats is higher than the optimal number. This situation is illustrated
in ﬁgure 8.6.
The externality at work in this example is that each ﬁsherman is concerned only
with their own proﬁt. When deciding whether to hire a boat, they do not take account
of the fact that they will reduce the quantity of ﬁsh caught by every other ﬁsherman.
This negative externality ensures that in equilibrium too many boats are operating on
the lake. Public intervention can take two forms. There is the price-based solution
consisting of a tax per boat so as to internalize the external effect of sending a boat on
the lake. As indicated in the ﬁgure, a correctly chosen tax will reduce the number of
boats so as to restore the optimal outcome. Alternatively, the quantity-based solution
consists of setting a quota of ﬁshing equal to the optimal outcome.

Bandwagon Effect
The bandwagon effect studies the question of how standards are adopted and, in partic-
ular, how it is possible for the wrong standard to be adopted. The standard application
of this is the choice of arrangement for the keys on a keyboard.
The current standard, Qwerty, was designed in 1873 by Christopher Scholes in
order to deliberately slow down the typist by maximizing the distance between the
most used letters. The motivation for this was the reduction of key-jamming problems
(remember this would be for mechanical typewriters in which metal keys would have
to strike the ink ribbon). By 1904 the Qwerty keyboard was mass produced and became
the accepted standard. The key-jamming problem is now irrelevant, and a simpliﬁed
alternative keyboard (Dvorak’s keyboard) has been devised that reduces typing time
by 5 to 10 percent.
Why has this alternative keyboard not been adopted? The answer is that there is a
switching cost. All users are reluctant to switch and bear the cost of retraining, and
manufacturers see no advantage in introducing the alternative. It has therefore proved
impossible to switch to the better technology.
This problem is called a bandwagon effect and is due to a network externality. The
decision of a typist to use the Qwerty keyboard makes it more attractive for manufactur-
ers to produce Qwerty keyboards, and hence for others to learn Qwerty. No individual

has any incentive to switch to Dvorak. The nature of the equilibrium is displayed in
ﬁgure 8.7. This shows the intertemporal link between the percentage using Qwerty at
time t and the percentage at time t + 1. The natural advantage of Dvorak is captured in
the diagram by the fact that the number of Qwerty users will decline over time starting
from a position where 50 percent use Qwerty at time t. There are three equilibria. Ei-
ther all will use Qwerty or Dvorak or else a proportion p∗, p∗> 50 percent, will use
Qwerty and 1 −p∗Dvorak However, this equilibrium is unstable, and any deviation
from it will lead to one of the corner equilibria. The inefﬁcient technology, Qwerty, can
dominate in equilibrium if the initial starting point is to the right of p∗.
8.5
Pigouvian Taxation
The description of market inefﬁciency has shown that its basic source is the divergence
between social and private beneﬁts (or between social and private costs). This fact has
been reinforced by the examples. A natural means of eliminating such divergence is
to employ appropriate taxes or subsidies. By modifying the decision problems of the
ﬁrms and consumers these can move the economy closer to an efﬁcient position.
To see how a tax can enhance efﬁciency, consider the case of a negative consumption
externality. With a negative externality the private marginal beneﬁt of consumption is
always in excess of the social marginal beneﬁt. These beneﬁts are depicted by the
PMB and SMB curves respectively in ﬁgure 8.8. In the absence of intervention, the
equilibrium occurs where the PMB intersects the private marginal cost (PMC). This
gives a level of consumption xm. The efﬁcient consumption level equates the PMC with
the SMB; this is at point xo. As already noted, with a negative externality the market
outcome involves more consumption of the good than is efﬁcient. The market outcome
can be improved by placing a tax on consumption. What it is necessary to do is to raise
the PMC so that it intersects the SMB vertically above xo. This is what happens for
the curve PMC′, which has been raised above PMC by a tax of value t. This process,
often termed Pigouvian taxation, allows the market to attain efﬁciency for the situation
shown in ﬁgure 8.8.
Based on arguments like that exhibited above, Pigouvian taxation has been proposed
as a simple solution to the externality problem. The logic is that the consumer or ﬁrm
causing the externality should pay a tax equal to the marginal damage the externality
causes (or a subsidy if there is a marginal beneﬁt). Doing so makes them take account
of the damage (or beneﬁt) when deciding how much to produce or consume. In many
ways this is a compellingly simple conclusion.

Pigouvian taxation
The previous discussion is informative but leaves a number of issues to be resolved.
Foremost among these is the fact that the ﬁgure implicitly assumes there is a single
agent generating the externality whose marginal beneﬁt and marginal cost are exhibited
and that there is a single externality. The single tax works in this case, but will it still
do so with additional externalities and agents? This is an important question to be
answered if Pigouvian taxation is to be proposed as a serious practical policy.
To address these issues, we use our example from the market failure section again.
This example involved two consumers and two goods with the consumption of one
of the goods, z, causing an externality. The optimal structure of Pigouvian taxes is
determined by characterizing the social optimum and inferring from that what the taxes
must be. Recall from (8.10) and (8.11) that the social optimum is characterized by the
conditions
u′
1(z1) + v′
2(z1) = 1
(8.15)
and
u′
2(z2) + v′
1(z2) = 1.
(8.16)
It is from contrasting these conditions to those for individual choice that the optimal
taxes can be derived.

238
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
Utilitymaximizationbyconsumer1willequatetheirprivatemarginalbeneﬁt, u′

to the consumer price q1. Given that the producer price is equal to 1 in this example,
(8.15) shows that efﬁciency will be achieved if the price, q1, facing consumer 1 satisﬁes
q1 = 1 −v′
2(z1).
(8.17)
Similarly from (8.16) efﬁciency will be achieved if the price facing consumer 2 satisﬁes
q2 = 1 −v′
1(z2).
(8.18)
These identities reveal that the taxes that ensure the correct difference between
consumer and producer prices are given by
t1 = −v′
2(z1)
(8.19)
and
t2 = −v′
1(z2).
(8.20)
Therefore the tax on consumer 1 is the negative of the externality effect their consump-
tion of good z inﬂicts on consumer 2. Hence, if the good causes a negative externality
(v′
2(z1) < 0), the tax is positive. The converse holds if it causes a positive externality.
The same construction and reasoning can be applied to the tax facing consumer 2, t2,
to show that this is the negative of the externality effect caused by the consumption of
good z by consumer 2. The argument is now completed by noting that these externality
effects will generally be different, and so the two taxes will generally not be equal.
Another way of saying this is that efﬁciency can only be achieved if the consumers face
personalized prices that fully capture the externalities that they generate.
So what does this say for Pigouvian taxation? Put simply, the earlier conclusion that
a single tax rate could achieve efﬁciency was misleading. In fact the general outcome
is that there must be a different tax rate for each externality-generating good for each
consumer. Achieving efﬁciency needs taxes to be differentiated across consumers and
goods. Naturally this ﬁnding immediately shows the practical difﬁculties involved in
implementing Pigouvian taxation. The same arguments concerning information that
were placed against the Lindahl equilibrium for public good provision with personal-
ized pricing are all relevant again here. In conclusion, Pigouvian taxation can achieve
efﬁciency but needs an unachievable degree of differentiation.
If the required degree of differentiation is not available, for instance, information
limitations require that all consumers must pay the same tax rate, then efﬁciency will

239
Chapter 8: Externalities
not be achieved. In such cases the chosen taxes will have to achieve a compromise. They
cannot entirely correct for the externality but can go some way toward doing so. Since
the taxes do not completely offset the externality, there is also a role for intervening
in the market for goods related to that causing the externality. For instance, pollution
from car use may be lessened by subsidizing alternative mode of transports. These
observations are meant to indicate that once the move is made from full efﬁciency,
many new factors become relevant, and there is no clean and general answer as to how
taxes should be set.
A ﬁnal comment is that the effect of the tax or subsidy is to put a price (respectively
positive or negative) on the externality. This leads to the conclusion, which will be
discussed in detail below, that if there are competitive markets for the externalities,
efﬁciency will be achieved. In other words, efﬁciency does not require intervention but
only the creation of the necessary markets.
8.6
Licenses
The reason why Pigouvian taxation can raise welfare is that the unregulated market
will produce incorrect quantities of externalities. The taxes alter the cost of generating
an externality and, if correctly set, will ensure that the optimal quantity of externality is
produced.An apparently simpler alternative is to control externalities directly by the use
of licenses. This can be done by legislating that externalities can only be generated up
to the quantity permitted by licenses held. The optimal quantity of externality can then
be calculated and licenses totaling this quantity distributed. Permitting these licenses
to be traded will ensure that they are eventually used by those who obtain the greatest
beneﬁt.
Administratively, the use of licenses has much to recommend it. As was argued in
the previous section, the calculation of optimal Pigouvian taxes requires considerable
information. The tax rates will also need to be continually changed as the economic
environment evolves. The use of licenses only requires information on the aggregate
quantity of externality that is optimal. Licenses to this value are released and trade is
permitted. Despite these apparently compelling arguments in favor of licenses, when
the properties of licenses and taxes are considered in detail, the advantage of the former
is not quite so clear.
The fundamental issue involved in choosing between taxes and licenses revolves
around information. There are two sides to this. The ﬁrst is what must be known to
calculate the taxes or determine the number of licenses. The second is what is known

240
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
when decisions have to be taken. For example, does the government know costs and
beneﬁts for sure when it sets taxes or issues licenses?
Taking the ﬁrst of these, although licenses may appear to have an informational
advantage this is not really the case. Consider what must be known to calculate the
Pigouvian taxes. The construction of section 8.5 showed that taxation required the
knowledge of the preferences of consumers and, if the model had included production,
theproductiontechnologiesofﬁrms. Suchextensiveinformationisnecessarytoachieve
the personalization of the taxes. But what of licenses? The essential feature of licenses
is that they must total to the optimal level of externality. To determine the optimal level
requires precisely, the same information as is necessary for the tax rates. Consequently
taxes and licenses are equivalent in their informational demands.
Now consider the issue of the information that is known when decisions must be
made. When all costs and beneﬁts are known with certainty by both the government
and individual agents, licenses and taxation are equivalent in their effects. This result
is easily seen by reconsidering ﬁgure 8.8. The optimal level of externality is xo, which
was shown to be achievable with tax t. The same outcome can also be achieved by
issuing xo licenses. This simple and direct argument shows there is equivalence with
certainty.
In practice, it is more likely that the government must take decisions before the actual
costs and beneﬁts of an externality are known for sure. Such uncertainty brings with it
the question of timing: Who chooses what and when? The natural sequence of events is
the following. The government must make its policy decision (the quantity of licenses
or the tax rate) before costs and beneﬁts are known. In contrast, the economic agents
can act after the costs and beneﬁts are known. For example, in the case of pollution by
a ﬁrm, the government may not know the cost of reducing pollution for sure when it
sets the tax rate but the ﬁrm makes its abatement decision with full knowledge of the
cost.
The effect of this difference in timing is to break the equivalence between the two
policies. This can be seen by considering ﬁgure 8.9, which illustrates the pollution
abatement problem for an uncertain level of cost. In this case the level of private
marginal cost takes one of two values, PMCL and PMCH, with equal probability.
Beneﬁts are known for sure. When the government chooses its policy, it is not known
whether private marginal cost is high or low, so it must act on the expected value,
PMCE. This leads to pollution abatement z∗being required (which can be supported
by licenses equal in quantity to present pollution less z∗) or a tax rate t∗.
Under the license scheme, the level of pollution abatement will be z∗for sure—
there is no uncertainty about the outcome. With the tax, the level of abatement will

depend on the realized level of cost since the ﬁrm chooses abatement after this is known.
Therefore, if the cost turns out to be PMCL, so that the cost of abatement is low, the ﬁrm
will be willing to undertake abatement up to level zL. If the realized cost is PMCH, so
abatement cost is high, the ﬁrm will choose to undertake the reduced level of abatement
zH. This is shown in ﬁgure 8.9. Two observations emerge from this. First, the claim
that licenses and taxation will not be equivalent when there is uncertainty is conﬁrmed.
Second, when cost is realized to be low, taxation leads to abatement in excess of z∗.
The converse holds when cost is high.
The analysis of ﬁgure 8.9 may be taken as suggesting that licenses are better, since
they do not lead to the variation in abatement that is inherent in taxation. However, it
should also be realized that the choices made by the ﬁrm in the tax case are responding to
the actual cost of abatement, so there is some justiﬁcation for what the ﬁrm is doing. In
general, there is no simple answer to the question of which of the two policies is better.
8.7
Internalization
Consider the example of a beekeeper located next door to an orchard. The bees pollinate
the trees and the trees provide food for the bees, so a positive production externality
runs in both directions between the two producers. According to the theory developed
above, the producers acting independently will not take account of this externality. This
leads to too few bees being kept and too few trees being planted.

242
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
The externality problem could be resolved by using taxation or insisting that both
producers raise their quantities. Although both these would work, there is another
simpler solution. Imagine the two producers merging and forming a single ﬁrm. If they
were to do so, proﬁt maximization for the combined enterprise would naturally take
into account the externality. By so doing, the inefﬁciency is eliminated. The method
of controlling externalities by forming single units out of the parties affected is called
internalization, and it ensures that private and social costs become the same. It works
for both production and consumption externalities whether they are positive or negative.
Internalization seems a simple solution, but it is not without its difﬁculties. To high-
light the ﬁrst of these, consider an industry in which the productive activity of each
ﬁrm causes an externality for the other ﬁrms in the industry. In this situation the inter-
nalization argument would suggest that the ﬁrms become a single monopolist. If this
were to occur, welfare loss would then arise due to the ability of the single ﬁrm to
exploit its monopoly position, and this may actually be greater than the initial loss due
to the externality. Although this is obviously an extreme example, the internalization
argument always implies the construction of larger economic units and a consequent
increase in market power. The welfare loss due to market power then has to be offset
against the gain from eliminating the effect of the externality.
The second difﬁculty is that the economic agents involved may simply not wish to
be amalgamated into a single unit. This objection is particularly true when applied to
consumption externalities. That is, if a household generates an externality for their
neighbor, it is not clear that they would wish to form a single household unit, particularly
if the externality is a negative one.
In summary, internalization will eliminate the consequences of an externality in a
very direct manner by ensuring that private and social costs are equated. However, it
is unlikely to be a practical solution when many distinct economic agents contribute
separately to the total externality, and it has the disadvantage of leading to increased
market power.
8.8
The Coase Theorem
After identifying externalities as a source of market failure, this chapter has taken the
standard approach of discussing policy remedies. In contrast to this, there has developed
a line of reasoning that questions whether such intervention is necessary. The focal
point for this is the Coase theorem, which suggests that economic agents may resolve
externality problems themselves without the need for government intervention. This

243
Chapter 8: Externalities
conclusion runs against the standard assessment of the consequences of externalities
and explains why the Coase theorem has been of considerable interest.
The Coase theorem asserts that if the market is allowed to function freely, then it
will achieve an efﬁcient allocation of resources. This claim can be stated formally as
follows.
Theorem 8.2 (Coase theorem)
In a competitive economy with complete information
and zero transaction costs, the allocation of resources will be efﬁcient and invariant
with respect to legal rules of entitlement.
The legal rules of entitlement, or property rights, are of central importance to the
Coase theorem. Property rights are the rules that determine ownership within the econ-
omy. For example, property rights may state that all agents are entitled to unpolluted
air or the right to enjoy silence (they may also state the opposite). Property rights also
determine the direction in which compensation payments will be made if a property
right is violated.
The implication of the Coase theorem is that there is no need for policy intervention
with regard to externalities except to ensure that property rights are clearly deﬁned.
When they are, the theorem presumes that to eliminate any market failure, those affected
by an externality will ﬁnd it in their interest to reach private agreements with those
causing it. These agreements will involve the payment of compensation to the agent
whose property right is being violated. The level of compensation will ensure that the
right price emerges for the externality and a Pareto-efﬁcient outcome will be achieved.
These compensation payments can be interpreted in the same way as the personalized
prices discussed in section 8.5.
As well as claiming that the outcome will be efﬁcient, the Coase theorem asserts
that the equilibrium will be invariant to the how property rights are assigned. This is
surprising since a natural expectation is, in the example, for the level of pollution under a
polluter-pays system (i.e., giving property rights to pollutees) to be less than that under a
pollutee-pays (i.e., giving property rights to the polluter). To show how the invariance
argument works, consider the example of a factory that is polluting the atmosphere of
a neighboring house. When the ﬁrm has the right to pollute, the householder can only
reduce the pollution by paying the ﬁrm a sufﬁcient amount of compensation to make
it worthwhile to stop production or to ﬁnd an alternative means of production. Let the
amount of compensation the ﬁrm requires be C. Then the cost to the householder of the
pollution, G, will either be greater than C, in which case the householder will be willing
to compensate the ﬁrm and the externality will cease, or it will be less than C and the

244
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
externality will be left to continue. Now consider the outcome with the polluter-pays
principle. The cost to the ﬁrm for stopping the externality now becomes C and the
compensation required by the household is G. If C is greater than G, the ﬁrm will be
willing to compensate the household and continue producing the externality; if it is less
than G, it stops the externality. Considering the two cases, it can be seen the outcome is
determined only by the value of G relative to C and not by the assignment of property
rights, which is essentially the content of the Coase theorem.
There is a further issue before invariance can be conﬁrmed. The change in property
rights between the two cases will cause differences in the ﬁnal distribution of income
due to the direction of compensation payments. Invariance can only hold if this redis-
tribution of income does not cause a change in the level of demand. This requires there
to be no income effects, or to put it another way, the marginal unit of income must be
spent in the same way by both parties.
When the practical relevance of the Coase theorem is considered, a number of issues
arise. The ﬁrst lies with the assignment of property rights in the market. With commodi-
ties deﬁned in the usual sense, it is clear who is the purchaser and who is the supplier,
and therefore the direction in which payment should be transferred. This is not the case
with externalities. For example, with air pollution it may not be clear that the polluter
should pay, with the implicit recognition of the right to clean air, or whether there is a
right to pollute, with clean air something that should have to be paid for. This leaves
the direction in which payment should go unclear. Without clearly speciﬁed property
rights, the bargaining envisaged in the Coase theorem does not have a ﬁrm foundation:
neither party would willingly accept that they were the party that should pay.
If the exchange of commodities would lead to mutually beneﬁcial gains for two
parties, the commodities will be exchanged unless the cost of doing so outweighs the
beneﬁts. Such transactions costs may arise from the need for the parties to travel to
a point of exchange or from the legal costs involved in formalizing the transactions.
They may also arise due to the search required to ﬁnd a trading partner. Whenever they
arise, transactions costs represent a hindrance to trade and, if sufﬁciently great, will
lead to no trade at all taking place. The latter results in the economy having a missing
market.
The existence of transactions costs is often seen as the most signiﬁcant reason for
the nonexistence of markets in externalities. To see how they can arise, consider the
problem of pollution caused by car emissions. If the reasoning of the Coase theorem
is applied literally, then any driver of a car must purchase pollution rights from all of
the agents that are affected by the car emissions each time, and every time, that the
car is used. Obviously this would take an absurd amount of organization, and since

245
Chapter 8: Externalities
considerable time and resources would be used in the process, transactions costs would
be signiﬁcant. In many cases it seems likely that the welfare loss due to the waste of
resources in organizing the market would outweigh any gains from having the market.
When external effects are traded, there will generally only be one agent on each side
of the market. This thinness of the market undermines the assumption of competitive
behavior needed to support the efﬁciency hypothesis. In such circumstances the Coase
theorem has been interpreted as implying that bargaining between the two agents will
take place over compensation for external effects and that this bargaining will lead to
an efﬁcient outcome. Such a claim requires substantiation.
Bargaining can be interpreted as taking the form of either a cooperative game between
agents or as a noncooperative game. When it is viewed as cooperative, the tradition
since Nash has been to adopt a set of axioms that the bargain must satisfy and to derive
the outcomes that satisfy these axioms. The requirement of Pareto-efﬁciency is always
adopted as one of the axioms so that the bargained agreement is necessarily efﬁcient. If
all bargains over compensation payments were placed in front of an external arbitrator,
then the Nash bargaining solution would have some force as descriptive of what such an
arbitrator should try and achieve. However, this is not what is envisaged by the Coase
theorem, which focuses on the actions of markets free of any regulation. Although
appealing as a method for achieving an outcome agreeable to both parties, the fact that
Nash bargaining solution is efﬁcient does not demonstrate the correctness of the Coase
theorem.
The literature on bargaining in a noncooperative context is best divided between
games with complete information and those with incomplete information, since this
distinction is of crucial importance for the outcome. One of the central results of non-
cooperative bargaining with complete information is due to Rubinstein who considers
the division of a single object between two players. The game is similar to the fund-
raising game presented in the public goods chapter. The players take turns to announce
a division of the object, and each period an offer and an acceptance or rejection are
made. Both players discount the future, so they are impatient to arrive at an agreed
division. Rubinstein shows that the game has a unique (subgame perfect) equilibrium
with agreement reached in the ﬁrst period. The outcome is Pareto-efﬁcient.
Theimportantpointisthecompleteinformationassumedinthisrepresentationofbar-
gaining. The importance of information for the nature of outcomes will be extensively
analyzed in chapter 10, and complete information is equally important for bargaining.
In the simple bargaining problem of Rubinstein the information that must be known
are the preferences of the two agents, captured by their rates of time discount. When
these discount rates are private information, the attractive properties of the complete

246
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
information bargain are lost, and there are many potential equilibria whose nature is
dependent on the precise speciﬁcation of the structure of bargaining.
In the context of externalities it seems reasonable to assume that information will be
incomplete, since there is no reason why the agents involved in bargaining an agreement
over compensation for an external effect should be aware of each other’s valuations
of the externality. When they are not aware, there is always the incentive to try to
exploit a supposedly weak opponent or to pretend to be strong and make excessive
demands. This results in the possibility that agreement may not occur even when it is
in the interests of both parties to trade.
To see this more clearly, consider the following bargaining situation. There are two
agents: a polluter and a pollutee. They bargain over the decision to allow or not the
pollution. The pollutee cannot observe the beneﬁt of pollution B but knows that it is
drawn from a distribution F(B), which is the probability that the beneﬁt is less than or
equal to B. Similarly the polluter cannot observe the cost of pollution C but knows that
it is drawn from a distribution G(C). Obviously the beneﬁt is known to the polluter and
the cost is known to the pollutee. Let us give the property rights to the pollutee so that he
has the right to a pollution-free environment. Pareto-efﬁciency requires that pollution
be allowed whenever B ≥C. Now the pollutee (with all the bargaining power) can
make a take-it-or-leave-it offer to the polluter. What will be the bargaining outcome?
The pollutee will ask for compensation T > 0 (since C > 0) to grant permission
to pollute. The polluter will only accept to pay T if his beneﬁt from polluting exceeds
the compensation he has to pay, so B ≥T . Hence the probability that the polluter will
accept the offer is equal to 1 −F(T ), that is, the probability that B ≥T . The best deal
for the pollutee is to ask for compensation that maximizes her expected payoff deﬁned
as the probability that the offer is accepted times the net gain if the offer is accepted.
Therefore the pollutee asks for compensation T ∗, which solves
max
{T } (1 −F(T )) [T −C] .
(8.21)
Clearly, the optimal value, T ∗, is such that
T ∗> C.
(8.22)
But then bargaining can result (with strictly positive probability) in an inefﬁcient out-
come. This is the case for all realizations of C and B such that C < B < T ∗, which
implies that the offer is rejected (since the compensation demanded exceeds the beneﬁt)
and thus pollution is not allowed, while Pareto-efﬁciency requires permission to pollute
to be granted (since its cost is less than its beneﬁt).

247
Chapter 8: Externalities
The efﬁciency thesis of the Coase theorem relies on agreements being reached on
the compensation required for external effects. The results above suggest that when
information is incomplete, bargaining between agents will not lead to an efﬁcient
outcome.
8.9
Nonconvexity
One of the basic assumptions that supports economic analysis is that of convexity.
Convexity gives indifference curves their standard shape, so consumers always prefer
mixtures to extremes. It also ensures that ﬁrms have nonincreasing returns so that
proﬁt maximization is well deﬁned. Without convexity, many problems arise with the
behavior of the decisions of individual ﬁrms and consumers, and with the aggregation
of these decisions to ﬁnd an equilibrium for the economy.
Externalities can be a source of nonconvexity. Consider the case of a negative pro-
duction externality. The panel at the left in ﬁgure 8.10 displays a ﬁrm whose output
is driven to zero by an externality regardless of the level of other inputs. An example
would be a ﬁshery where sufﬁcient pollution of the ﬁshing ground by another ﬁrm
can kill all the ﬁsh. In the panel at the right side of the ﬁgure, a zero output level is
not reached, but output tends to zero as the level of the externality is increased. In both
situations the production set of the ﬁrm is not convex.
In either case the economy will fail to have an equilibrium if personalized taxes are
employed in an attempt to correct the externality. Suppose that the ﬁrm were to receive
a subsidy for accepting externalities. Its proﬁt-maximizing choice would be to produce
Externality
Externality
Output

Nonconvexity

248
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
an output level of zero and to offer to accept an arbitrarily large quantity of externalities.
Since its output is zero, the externalities can do it no further harm, so this plan will lead
to unlimited proﬁts. If the price for accepting externalities were zero, the same ﬁrm
would not accept any. The demand for externalities is therefore discontinuous, and an
equilibrium need not exist.
There is also a second reason for nonconvexity with externalities. It is often assumed
that once all inputs are properly accounted for, all ﬁrms will have constant returns to
scale, since behavior can always be replicated. That is, if a ﬁxed set of inputs (i.e.,
a factory and staff) produces output y, doubling all those inputs must produce output
2y, since they can be split into two identical subunits (e.g., two factories and staff)
producing an amount y each. Now consider a ﬁrm subject to a negative externality,
and assume that it has constant returns to all inputs including the externality. From the
perspective of society, there are constant returns to scale. Now let the ﬁrm double all
its inputs, but with the externality held at a constant level. Since the externality is a
negative one, it becomes diluted by the increase in other inputs, and output must more
than double. The ﬁrm therefore faces private increasing returns to scale. With such
increasing returns, the ﬁrm’s proﬁt-maximizing decision may not have a well-deﬁned
ﬁnite solution and market equilibrium may again fail to exist.
These arguments provide some fairly powerful reasons why an economy with ex-
ternalities may not share some of the desirable properties of economies without. The
behavior that follows from nonconvexity can prevent some of the pricing tools that
are designed to attain efﬁciency from functioning in a satisfactory manner. At worst,
nonconvexity can even cause there to be no equilibrium in the economy.
8.10
Conclusions
Externalities are an important feature of economic activity. They can arise at a local
level between neighbors and at a global level between countries. The existence of
externalities can lead to inefﬁciency if no attempt is made to control their level. The
Coase theorem suggests that well-deﬁned property rights will be sufﬁcient to ensure
that private agreements can resolve the externality problem. In practice, property rights
are not well deﬁned in many cases of externality. Furthermore the thinness of the
market and the incomplete information of market participants result in inefﬁciencies
that undermine the Coase theorem.
The simplest policy solution to the externality problem is a system of corrective
Pigouvian taxes. If the tax rate is proportional to the marginal damage (or beneﬁt)

249
Chapter 8: Externalities
causedbytheexternality, thenefﬁciencywillresult. However, forthisargumenttoapply
when there are many consumers and ﬁrms requires that the taxes be so differentiated
between economic agents that they become equivalent to a system of personalized
prices. The optimal system then becomes impractical due to its information limitations.
An alternative policy response is the use of marketable licenses that limit the emission
of externalities. Licenses have some administrative advantages over taxes and will
produce the same outcome when costs and beneﬁts are known with certainty. With
uncertainty, licenses and taxes have different effects and combining the two can lead
to a superior outcome.

Consider two ﬁrms, X and Y, located on the same river bank. The two ﬁrms produce paper
for a printing works, and the production of paper requires the use of chemicals. Firm X is
located upstream from ﬁrm Y and has the production function x = 1,000 [ℓX]1/2, where ℓX
is the amount of labor used per day and x the amount of paper produced by ﬁrm X. Firm Y,
located downstream, has a similar production function, but its output can be affected by the
chemical waste produced by ﬁrm X. Hence ﬁrm Y has the following production function;
y =
1000 [ℓY ]1/2 [x −x0]−α
if x > x0,
1000 [ℓY ]1/2
if x < x0,
where x0 is the natural capacity for absorption of pollution by the river, ℓY the labor used,

There is a large number of commuters who decide to use either their car or the train. Commut-

Consider a binary choice to allow or not the emission of pollutants. The cost to consumers
of allowing the pollution is C = 2,000, but this cost is only observable to the consumers.
The beneﬁt for the polluter of allowing the externality is B = 2, 300, and only the polluter
knows this beneﬁt. Clearly, optimality requires this externality to be allowed, since B > C.
However, the ﬁnal decision must be based on what each party chooses to reveal.
a. Construct a tax-subsidy revelation scheme such that it is a dominant strategy for each
party to report truthfully their private information.

A chemical factory produces a product that is sold at the price of $10 per ton. The cost
of production is CF(y) = 0.5y2, where y is the number of tons of production. For each
ton of production, the factory produces 1 kg of pollutants that are either dispersed into the
atmosphere at a cost of $0 to the factory or captured and stored at a cost of $2 for each kg
of pollutant. The amount of dispersant pollutant is denoted e. The pollution causes a nearby
textile ﬁrm to have to wash its products twice with an additional cost of Ce = 0.5e2, which
does not depend on the amount of output, m, produced. The unit price of the output of the
textile ﬁrm is $5, and the cost of production CT = 0.02m2.
a. Determine the values of y, m, and e in the competitive equilibrium. How much does the
chemical factory spend on capturing the pollutant? What level of environmental cost does

Acompetitive reﬁning industry releases one unit of waste into the atmosphere for each unit of
reﬁned product. The inverse demand function for the reﬁned product is pd = 20 −q, which

pay price pd. The inverse supply curve for reﬁning is MPC = 2 + q, which represents the
marginal private cost curve when the industry produces q units. The marginal external cost

q units of waste. Marginal social cost is given by MSC = MPC + MEC.

Achemical producer dumps toxic waste into a river. The waste reduces the population of ﬁsh,

F, is located downstream and is negatively affected by the waste polluting the water. Every
ﬁsh produced by the farm can be sold for $2. The cost function of the ﬁsh farm is given by
cF (f ; x) = f + x2. The ﬁsh farm has a capacity constraint f ≤10.

Imperfect Competition
9.1
Introduction
The analysis of economic efﬁciency in chapter 2 demonstrated the signiﬁcance of
the competitive assumption that no economic agent has the ability to affect market
prices. Under this assumption prices reveal true economic values and act as signals
that guide agents to mutually consistent decisions. As the Two Theorems of Welfare
Economics showed, they do this so well that Pareto-efﬁciency is attained. Imperfect
competition arises whenever an economic agent has the ability to inﬂuence prices. To
be able to do so requires that the agent be large relative to the size of the market in
which they operate. It follows from the usual application of economic rationality that
those agents who can affect prices will aim to do so to their own advantage. This must
be detrimental to other agents and to the economy as a whole. This basic feature of
imperfect competition, and its implications for economic policy, will be explored in this
chapter.
Imperfect competition can take many forms. It can arise due to monopoly in product
markets and through monopsony in labor markets. Firms with monopoly power will
push prices above marginal cost in order to raise their proﬁts. This will reduce the
equilibrium level of consumption below what it would have been had the market been
competitive and will transfer surplus from consumers to the owners of the ﬁrm. Unions
with monopoly power can ensure that the wage rate is increased above its competitive
level and secure a surplus for their members. The increase in wage rate reduces em-
ployment and output. Firms (and even unions) can engage in non–price competition
by choosing the quality and characteristics of their products, undertaking advertising,
and blocking the entry of competitors.
Each of these forms of behavior can be interpreted as an attempt to increase market
power and obtain a greater surplus. When they can occur, the assumption of price-taking
behavior used to prove the Two Theorems is violated, and an economy with imperfect
competition will not achieve an efﬁcient equilibrium (with one special exception as is
detailed later). It then becomes possible that policy intervention can improve on the
unregulated outcome. The purpose of this chapter is to investigate how the conclusions
derived in earlier chapters need to be modiﬁed and to look at some additional issues
speciﬁc to imperfect competition.

256
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
The ﬁrst part of the chapter focuses on imperfect competition in product markets.
After categorizing types of imperfect competition, deﬁning the market structure, and
measuring the intensity of competition, the failure of efﬁciency is demonstrated when
there is a lack of competition. This is followed by a discussion of tax incidence in
competitiveandimperfectlycompetitivemarkets. Theeffectsofspeciﬁc andadvalorem
taxes are then distinguished, and their relative efﬁciency is assessed. The policies used
to regulate monopoly and oligopoly in practice are also described. There is next a
discussion of the recent European policy on the regulation of mergers. The ﬁnal part
of the chapter focuses on market power on the two sides of the labor market. Market
power from the supply side (monopoly power of a labor union) is contrasted with
monopsony power from the demand side. It is shown that both cases lead to inefﬁcient
underemployment with wages, respectively above and below competitive wages.
9.2
Concepts of Competition
Imperfect competition arises whenever an economic agent exploits the fact that they
have the ability to inﬂuence the price of a commodity. If the inﬂuence on price can be
exercised by the sellers of a product, then there is monopoly power. If it is exercised by
the buyers, then there is monopsony power, and if by both buyers and sellers, there is
bilateral monopoly. A single seller is a monopolist and a single buyer a monopsonist.
Oligopoly arises with two or more sellers who have market power, with duopoly being
the special case of two sellers.
An agent with market power can set either the price at which it sells, with the market
choosing quantity, or the quantity it supplies, with the market determining price. When
there is either monopoly or monopsony, it does not matter whether price or quantity is
chosen: the equilibrium outcome will be the same. If there is more than one agent with
market power, then the choice variable does make a difference. In oligopoly markets
Cournot behavior refers to the use of quantity as the strategic variable and Bertrand
behavior to the use of prices. Typically Bertrand behavior is more competitive in that
it leads to a lower market price. Entry by new ﬁrms may either be impossible, so that
an industry is composed of a ﬁxed number of ﬁrms, and not be hindered, or incumbent
ﬁrms may follow a policy of entry deterrence.
Forms of imperfect competition also vary with respect to the nature of products sold.
Products may be homogeneous, so that the output of different ﬁrms is indistinguishable
by the consumer, or differentiated, so that each ﬁrm offers a different variant. With ho-
mogeneous products, at equilibrium there must be a single price in the market. Product

257
Chapter 9: Imperfect Competition
differentiation can either be vertical (whereby products can be unambiguously ranked
in terms of quality) or horizontal (whereby consumers differ in which speciﬁcation they
prefer). Equilibrium prices can vary across speciﬁcations in markets with differentiated
products. The notion of product differentiation captures the idea that consumers make
choices among competing products on the basis of factors other than price. The exact
nature of the differentiation is very important for the market outcome. What differen-
tiation implies is that purchases of a product do not fall off to zero when its price is
raised above that of competing products. The greater the differentiation, the lower is
the willingness of consumers to switch among sellers when one seller changes its price.
The theory of monopolistic competition relates to this competition among many differ-
entiated sellers who can enjoy some limited monopoly power if tastes differ markedly
from one consumer to the next.
When products are differentiated, ﬁrms may engage in non–price competition. This
is the use of variables other than price to gain proﬁt. For example, ﬁrms may compete
by choosing the speciﬁcation of their product and the quantity of advertising used to
support it. The level of investment can also be a strategic variable if this can deter entry
by making credible a threat to raise output.
To limit the number of cases to be considered, this chapter will focus on Cournot be-
havior, so that quantity is the strategic variable, with homogeneous products. Although
only one of many possible cases, this perfectly illustrates most of the signiﬁcant impli-
cations of imperfect competition. It also has monopoly as a special case (when there is
a single ﬁrm) and competition as another (when the number of ﬁrms tends to inﬁnity).
9.3
Market Structure
The structure of the market describes the number and size of ﬁrms that compete within
it and the intensity of this competition. To describe the structure of the market, it is ﬁrst
necessary to deﬁne the market.
9.3.1
Deﬁning the Market
A market consists of the buyers and sellers whose interaction determines the price and
quantity of the good that is traded. Generally, two sellers will be considered to be in the
same market if their products are close substitutes. Measuring the own-price elasticity
of demand for a product tells us whether there are close substitutes available, but it
does not identify what those substitutes might be. To identify the close substitutes, one

258
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
must study cross-price elasticities of demand between products. When the cross-price
elasticity is positive, it indicates that consumers are increasing their demand for one
good as the price of the other good increases. The two products are thus close substitutes.
Another approach to deﬁning markets is to use the standard industry classiﬁcation that
identiﬁes products as close competitors if they share the same product characteristics.
Although products with the same classiﬁcation number are often close competitors, this
is not always true. For example, all drugs share the same classiﬁcation number but not
all drugs are close substitutes for each other.
Markets are also deﬁned by geographic areas, since otherwise identical products will
not be close substitutes if they are sold in different areas and the cost of transporting
the product from one area to another is large. Given this reasoning, one would expect
close competitors to locate as far as possible from each other, and it therefore may seem
peculiar to see them located close to one another in some large cities. This reﬂects a
common trade-off between market size and market share. For instance, antique stores in
Brussels are located next to one another around the Place du Grand Sablon. The reason
is that the bunching effect helps to attract customers in the ﬁrst place (market size),
even if they become closer competitors in dividing up the market (market sharing). By
locating close together, Brussels’ antique stores make it more convenient for shoppers
to come and browse around in search of some antiques. In other words, the bunching
of sellers creates a critical mass that makes it easier to attract shoppers.
9.3.2
Measuring Competition
We now proceed on the basis that the market has been deﬁned. What does it then mean
to say that there is “more” or “less competition” in this market? Three distinct dimen-
sions are widely used and need to be clearly distinguished.
The ﬁrst dimension is contestability, which represents the freedom of rivals to enter
an industry. It depends on legal monopoly rights (patent protection, operating licenses,
etc.) or other barriers to entry (economies of scale and scope, the marketing advantage
of incumbents, entry-deterring strategies, etc.). Entry barriers protect the market leader
from serious competition from newcomers. Contestability theory shows how the threat
of entry can constrain incumbents from raising prices even if there is only one ﬁrm
currently operating in the market. However, when markets are not perfectly contestable,
the threat of potential competition is limited, which allows the incumbents to reap
additional proﬁts.
A second dimension is the degree of concentration that represents the number and
distribution of rivals currently operating in the same market. As we will see, the

259
Chapter 9: Imperfect Competition
performance of a market depends on whether it is concentrated (having few sellers) or
unconcentrated (having many sellers). A widespread measure of market concentration
is the n-ﬁrm concentration ratio. This is deﬁned as the consolidated market share of the
n largest ﬁrms in the market. For example, the four-ﬁrm concentration ratio in the US
cigarette industry is 0.92, which means that the four largest cigarette ﬁrms have a total
market share of 92 percent (with the calculation of market share usually based on sales
revenue). Table 9.1 shows the four-ﬁrm concentration ratios for some US industries in
1987.
The problem with the n-ﬁrm concentration ratio is that it is insensitive to the distri-
bution of market shares among the largest ﬁrms. For example a four-ﬁrm concentration
ratio does not change if the ﬁrst-largest ﬁrm increases its market share at the expense of
the second-largest ﬁrm. To capture the relative size of the largest ﬁrms, another com-
monly used measure is the Herﬁndahl index. This index is deﬁned as the sum of the
squared market shares of all the ﬁrms in the market. Letting si be the market share of
ﬁrm i, the Herﬁndahl index is given by H = 	
i s2
i . Notice that the Herﬁndahl index in
a market with two equal-size ﬁrms is 1
2 and with n equal-size ﬁrms is 1
n. For this reason
a market with Herﬁndahl index of 0.20 is also said to have a number’s equivalent of 5.
For example, if there is one dominant ﬁrm with a market share of 44 percent and 100
identical small ﬁrms with a total market share of 56 percent, the Herﬁndahl is

Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
This market structure is then interpreted as being equivalent to one with 5 identical
ﬁrms. Herﬁndahls associated to some US industries are indicated in table 9.1. These
numbers show that the market for laundry ﬁrms, which has a number’s equivalent less
than 4, is more concentrated than the market for book publishers, which has a number’s
equivalent of 38.
The third dimension of the market structure is collusiveness. This is related to the
degree of independence of ﬁrms’ strategies within the market or its reciprocal, which
is the possibility for sellers to agree to raise prices in unison. Collusion can either be
explicit (e.g., a cartel agreement) or tacit (when it is in each ﬁrm’s interest to refrain
from aggressive price cutting). Explicit collusion is illegal and more easily detected
than tacit collusion. However, tacit collusion is more difﬁcult to sustain. Experience has
shown that it is unusual for more than a handful of sellers to raise prices much above
costs for a sustained period. One common reason is that a small ﬁrm may view the
collusive bargain among larger rivals as an opportunity to steal their market shares by
undercutting the collusive price, which in turn triggers a price war. The airline industry
is a good example in recent years of frequent price wars. The additional problem with
the airline industry is that ﬁxed cost is high relative to variable cost. This means that once
a ﬂight is scheduled, airlines face tremendous pressure to ﬁll their planes, and they are
willing to ﬂy passengers at prices close to marginal cost but far below average cost. Thus
with such pricing practices, airlines can take large ﬁnancial losses during price wars.
The three dimensions of market structure and the resulting intensity of competition
may be related. The freedom to enter a market may result in a larger number of ﬁrms
operating and thus a less concentrated market, which in turn may lead to the breakdown
of collusive agreement to raise prices.
9.4
Welfare
Imperfect competition, along with public goods, externalities, and asymmetric infor-
mation, is one of the standard forms of market failure that leads to the inefﬁciency of
equilibrium. It is the inefﬁciency that provides the motivation for economic policy in re-
lation to imperfect competition. To provide the context for the discussion of policy, this
section demonstrates the source of the inefﬁciency and reports measures of its extent.
9.4.1
Inefﬁciency
The most important fact about imperfect competition is that it invariably leads to
inefﬁciency. The cause of this inefﬁciency is now isolated in the proﬁt-maximizing

261
Chapter 9: Imperfect Competition
behavior of ﬁrms that have an incentive to restrict output so that price is increased
above the competitive level.
In a competitive economy equilibrium will exist where the price of each commodity
is equal to its marginal cost of production. This is due to the argument that ﬁrms will
always move to increase supply whenever price is above marginal cost, since price is
taken as given and additional supply will raise proﬁt. As all ﬁrms raise supply, prices
will fall until there is no incentive for further supply increases. This argument shows
that the proﬁt-maximizing behavior of competitive ﬁrms drives price down to marginal
cost. If marginal cost is constant at value c, then competition results in a price, p,
satisfying
p = c.
(9.2)
To see the cause of inefﬁciency with imperfect competition, consider ﬁrst the case of
monopoly. Assume that the monopolist produces with a constant marginal cost, c, and
chooses its output level, y, to maximize proﬁt. The market power of the monopolist
is reﬂected in the fact that as its output is increased, the market price of the product
will fall. This relationship is captured by the inverse demand function, p (y), which
determines price as a function of output. As y increases, p (y) decreases. Using the
inverse demand function, which the monopolist is assumed to know, we have the proﬁt
level of the ﬁrm as
π = [p (y) −c] y.
(9.3)
The ﬁrst-order condition describing the proﬁt-maximizing output level is
p + y dp
dy −c = 0,
(9.4)
which, since dp
dy < 0 (price falls as output increases), implies that p > c. The condition
in (9.4) shows that the monopolist will set price above marginal cost and that the
monopolist’s price does not satisfy the efﬁciency requirement of being equal to marginal
cost. The fact that the monopolist perceives that its output choice affects price (so dp
dy
is not zero) is reﬂected directly in the divergence of price and marginal cost.
The condition describing the choice of output can be re-arranged to provide further
insight into degree of divergence between price and marginal cost. Using the elasticity
of demand, ε = dy
dp
p
y < 0, the proﬁt-maximization condition can be written as
p −c
p
= 1
|ε|.
(9.5)

262
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
This equilibrium condition for the monopoly is called the inverse elasticity pricing rule.
In words, the condition says that the percentage deviation between the price and the
marginal cost is equal to the inverse of the elasticity of demand. The expression p−c
p
is the Lerner index. The Lerner index will be shown shortly to be strictly between zero
and one (i.e., |ε| > 1). The monopoly pricing rule can also be written as
p = μc,
(9.6)
where μ =
1
1−(1/|ε|) > 1 is called the monopoly markup and measures the extent to
which price is raised above marginal cost. This pricing rule shows that the markup
above marginal cost is inversely related to the absolute value of the elasticity of demand.
The higher the absolute value of the elasticity, the smaller is the monopoly markup.
In the extreme case of perfectly elastic demand, which equates to the ﬁrm having
no market power, price would be equal to marginal cost. For the markup μ to be ﬁnite
(i.e., price is well deﬁned), it must be the case that |ε| > 1 so that the monopolist
locates on the elastic part of the demand curve. If demand is inelastic, with |ε| ≤1,
then the monopolist makes maximum proﬁt by selling the smallest possible quantity at
an arbitrarily high price. Since the monopolist operates on the elastic part of the demand
curve with |ε| > 1, the Lerner index, p−c
p
= 1
|ε| ∈(0, 1), provides a simple measure of
market power ranging from zero for a perfectly competitive market to one for maximal
market power. Therefore a ﬁrm might have a monopoly, but its market power might
still be low because it is constrained by competition from substitute products outside
the market. By differentiating its product, a monopolist can insulate its product from
the competition of substitute products and thereby expands its market power.
This relation of the monopoly markup to the elasticity of demand can be easily
extended from monopoly to oligopoly. Assume that there are m ﬁrms in the market,
and denote the output of ﬁrm j by yj. The market price is now dependent on the total
output of the ﬁrms, y = 	m
j=1 yj. With output level yj, the proﬁt level of ﬁrm j is
πj = [p −c] yj.
(9.7)
Adopting the Cournot assumption that each ﬁrm regards its competitors’ outputs as
ﬁxed when it optimizes, the choice of output for ﬁrm j satisﬁes
p + yj
dp
dy −c = 0.
(9.8)
Now assume that the ﬁrms are identical and each produces the same output level, y
m.
The ﬁrst-order condition for choice of output (9.8) can then be re-arranged to obtain
the Lerner index

263
Chapter 9: Imperfect Competition
p −c

|ε|,
(9.9)
and the oligopoly price is given by
p = μ◦c,
(9.10)
where μ◦=
m
m−(1/|ε|) > 1 is the oligopoly markup. Thus, in the presence of several
ﬁrms in the market, the Lerner index of market power is deﬂated according to the
market share. As for monopoly, the value of the markup is related to the inverse of the
elasticity of demand. The Lerner index can be used to show that an oligopoly becomes
more competitive as the number of ﬁrms in the industry increases. This claim follows
from the fact that p−c
p
must tend to zero as m tends to inﬁnity. Hence, as the number
of ﬁrms increases, the Cournot equilibrium becomes more competitive and price tends
to marginal cost. The limiting position with an inﬁnite number of ﬁrms can be viewed
as the idealization of the competitive model.
There is one special case of monopoly for which the equilibrium is efﬁcient. Let the
ﬁrm be able to charge each consumer the maximum price that the consumer is able to
pay. To do so obviously requires the ﬁrm to have considerable information about its
customers. The consequence is that the ﬁrm extracts all consumer surplus and translates
it into proﬁt. It will keep supplying the good until price falls to marginal cost and there
is no more surplus to extract. So total supply will be equal to that under the competition.
This scenario, known as perfect price discrimination, results in all the potential surplus
in the market being turned into monopoly proﬁt. No surplus is lost due to the monopoly,
but all surplus is transferred from the consumers to the ﬁrm. Of course, this scenario
can only arise with an exceedingly well-informed monopolist.
9.4.2
Incomplete Information
Monopoly inefﬁciency can also arise from the ﬁrm having incomplete information,
even in situations where there would be efﬁciency with complete information. To see
this, suppose that a monopolist with constant marginal cost c faces a buyer whose
willingness to pay for a unit of the ﬁrm’s output is v. If there is complete information,
the ﬁrm and buyer will agree to a price between c and v, and the product will be traded.
The surplus from the transaction is shared between the two parties and no inefﬁciency
arises.
The difference that imperfect information can make is that trade will sometimes not
take place even though both parties would gain if they did trade. Suppose now that

264
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
the monopolist cannot observe v but knows from experience that it is drawn from a
distribution F(v), which is the probability that the buyer’s valuation is less or equal
to v. The function (1 −F(v)) is analogous to the expected demand when a purchaser
buys at most one unit because the probability that there is a demand at price v is the
probability that the buyer’s valuation is higher than the price. Assume that there are
potential gains from trade so v > c for at least a range of v. Pareto-efﬁciency requires
trade to occur if and only if v ≥c.
The monopolist’s problem is to offer a price p that maximizes its expected proﬁt
(anticipating that the buyer will not accept the offer if v < p). This price must fall
between c and v for trade to occur. The monopolist sets a price p∗that solves

Proﬁt if trade
(9.11)
From the assumption that there is a potential gain from trade, there must be a range of
values of v higher than c, and thus it is possible for the monopolist to charge a price
in excess of the marginal cost with the offer being accepted. Clearly, the price that
maximizes expected proﬁt must be p∗> c, so the standard conclusion of monopoly
holds that price is in excess of marginal cost. When trade takes place (so a value of v
occurs with c < p∗< v), the outcome is an efﬁcient trade. However, when a value of
v occurs with c < v < p∗, trade does not take place. This is inefﬁcient because trade
should occur when the beneﬁt exceeds the cost (v > c). The effect of the monopolist
setting price above marginal cost is to eliminate some of the potential trades.
For instance, assume that the willingness to pay v is uniformly distributed on the
interval [0, 1] with the marginal cost 0 < c < 1. Then the probability that trade takes
place at price p (expected demand) is 1−F(p) = 1−p, which gives expected revenue
[1 −F(p)] p = [1 −p] p and marginal revenue MR = 1 −2p. The expected proﬁt is
π = [1 −p] [p −c], and the proﬁt-maximizing pricing satisﬁes the ﬁrst-order condi-
tion [1−2p]+c = 0, which can be re-arranged to give monopoly price of p∗= 1+c
2 > c.
The parallel between this monopoly choice under incomplete information and the
standard monopoly problem is illustrated in ﬁgure 9.1.
9.4.3
Measures of Welfare Loss
It has been shown that the equilibrium of an imperfectly competitive market is not
Pareto-efﬁcient, except in the special case of perfect price discrimination. This makes
it natural to consider what the degree of welfare loss may actually be. The assessment

of monopoly welfare loss has been a subject of some dispute in which calculations
have provided a range of estimates from the effectively insigniﬁcant to considerable
percentages of potential welfare.
Theinefﬁciencyofmonopolywillbedescribedinchapter12andpartofthatargument
is now brieﬂy provided. Figure 9.2 assumes that the marginal cost of production is
constant at value c and that there are no ﬁxed costs. The equilibrium price if the industry
were competitive, pc, would be equal to marginal cost, so pc = c. This price leads
to output level yc and generates consumer surplus ADc. The inverse demand function
facing the ﬁrm, p(y), determines price as a function of output and is also the average
revenue function for the ﬁrm. This is denoted by AR. The marginal revenue function is
denoted MR. The monopolist’s optimal output, ym, occurs where marginal revenue and
marginal cost are equal. At this output level the price with monopoly is pm. Consumer
surplus is ABpm and proﬁt is pmBEc.
Contrasting the competitive and the monopoly outcomes shows that some of the
consumer surplus under competition is transformed into proﬁt under monopoly. This
is the area pmBEc, and it represents a transfer from consumers to the ﬁrm. However,
some of the consumer surplus is simply lost. This loss is the area BDE, which is
termed the deadweight loss of monopoly. Since the total social surplus under monopoly
(ABpm+pmBEc ) is less than that under competition (ADc), the monopoly is inefﬁcient.

Deadweight loss with monopoly
This inefﬁciency is reﬂected in the fact that consumption is lower under monopoly than
competition.
When the demand function is linear so that the AR curve is a straight line, the welfare
loss area BDE is equal to half of the area pmBEc. The area pmBEc is monopoly proﬁt,
which is equal to [pm −c]ym. This implies that the loss BDE is 1
2[pm −c] ym. From
the ﬁrst-order condition for the choice of monopoly output, (9.5), pm −c = −1
εpm.
By this result it follows that a measure of the deadweight loss is
Deadweight loss = −pmym
2ε
= −Rm
2ε ,
(9.12)
where Rm is the total revenue of the monopolist. This formula is especially simple
to evaluate to obtain an idea of the size of the deadweight loss. For example, if the
elasticity of demand is −2, then the welfare loss is 25 percent of sales revenue and is
therefore quite large.
Numerous studies have been published that provide measures of the degree of
monopoly welfare loss. A selection of these results is given in table 9.2. The smaller
values are obtained by calculating only the deadweight loss triangle. If these were
correct, then we could conclude that monopoly power is not a signiﬁcant economic
issue. This was the surprising conclusion of the initial study by Harberger in 1954, as it
challenged the conventional wisdom that monopoly must be damaging to the economy.
In contrast, the larger values of loss are obtained by including the costs of defending the

monopoly position. Chapter 12 considers the arguments proposed in the rent-seeking
literature for the inclusion of these additional components of welfare loss. These values
reveal monopoly loss to be very substantial.
It can be appreciated from table 9.2 that a broad range of estimates of monopoly wel-
fare loss have been produced. Some studies conclude that welfare loss is insigniﬁcant;
others conclude that it is very important. What primarily distinguishes these differing
estimates is whether it is only the deadweight loss that is counted or the deadweight
loss plus the cost of defending the monopoly. Which one is correct is an unresolved
issue that involves two competing perspectives on economic efﬁciency.
There is one further point that needs to be made. The calculations above have been
based on a static analysis in which there is a single time period. The demand function,
the product traded, and the costs of production are all given. The ﬁrm makes a single
choice and equilibrium is attained. What this ignores are all the dynamic aspects of
economic activity such as investment and innovation. When these factors are taken
into account, as Schumpeter forcefully argued, it is even possible for a monopoly to
generate dynamic welfare gains rather than losses. This claim is based on the argument
that investment and innovation will only be undertaken if ﬁrms can expect to earn a
sufﬁcient return. In a competitive environment, all gains are competed away, so the
incentives to innovate are eliminated. Conversely, holding a monopoly position allows
gains to be realized. This creates the incentive to invest and innovate. Furthermore
the incentive is strengthened by the monopoly’s desire to maintain its strong hold.
Dynamic gains can more than offset static losses, reinforcing the argument for allowing
monopoly. We return to this issue in the discussion of regulation in section 9.7.

9.5
Tax Incidence
The study of tax incidence is about determining the changes in prices and proﬁts that
follow the imposition of a tax. The formal or legal incidence of a tax refers to who is
legally responsible for paying the tax. The legal incidence can be very different from the
economic incidence, which relates to who ultimately has to alter his behavior because
of the tax.
To see this distinction, consider the following example. A tax of $1 is levied on a
commodity that costs $10, and this tax must be paid by the retailer. The legal incidence
is simple: for each unit sold the retailer must pay $1 to the tax authority. The economic
incidence is much more complex. The ﬁrst question has to be: What does the price
of the commodity become after the tax? It may change to $11, but this would be an
exception rather than the norm. It may, for example, rise instead only to $10.50. If
it does, $0.50 of the tax falls on the consumer to pay. What of the other $0.50? This
depends on how the producer responds to the tax increase. The producer may lower
the price of the commodity to the retailer from $9 to $8.75 and then bear $0.25 of the
tax. The remaining $0.25 of the tax is paid by the retailer. The economic incidence of
the tax is then very distinct from the legal incidence.
This example raises the question of what determines the economic incidence. The
answer is found in the demand and supply curves for the good that is taxed. Economic
incidence will ﬁrst be determined for the competitive case, and then it is shown how
the conclusions are modiﬁed by imperfect competition. Imperfect competition can in
fact result in very interesting conclusions concerning tax incidence.
Tax incidence analysis is at its simplest when there is competition and the marginal
cost of production is constant. In this case the supply curve in the absence of taxation
must be horizontal at a level equal to marginal cost; see ﬁgure 9.3. This gives the
before-tax price p = c. The introduction of a tax of amount t will raise this curve by
exactly the amount of the tax. The after-tax price, q, is at the intersection of the demand
curve and the new supply curve. It can be seen that q = p + t, so price will rise by
an amount equal to the tax. Hence the tax is simply passed forward by the ﬁrms onto
consumers, since price is always set equal to marginal cost plus tax.
When marginal cost is not constant and the supply curve slopes upward, the intro-
duction of a tax still shifts the curve vertically upward by the amount equal to the tax.
The extent to which price rises is then determined by the slopes of the supply and
demand curve. If the demand curve is vertical, price rises by the full amount of the tax;
otherwise, it will rise by less; see ﬁgure 9.4.

In summary, if the supply curve is horizontal (so supply is inﬁnitely elastic) or the
demand curve is vertical (so demand is completely inelastic), then price will rise by
exactly the amount of the tax. In all other cases it will rise by less, with the exact rise
being determined by the elasticities of supply and demand. When the price increase
is equal to the tax, the entire tax burden is passed by the ﬁrm onto the consumers.
Otherwise, the burden of the tax is shared between ﬁrms and consumers. Consequently
the extent to which the price is shifted forward from the producer onto the consumers
is dependent on the elasticities of supply and demand.
There are two reasons why tax incidence with imperfect competition is distinguished
from the analysis for the competitive case. First, prices on imperfectly competitive mar-
kets are set at a level above marginal cost. Second, imperfectly competitive ﬁrms may
also earn nonzero proﬁts, so taxation can affect proﬁt. To trace the effects of taxation, it
is necessary to work through the proﬁt-maximization process of the imperfectly com-
petitive ﬁrms. Such an exercise involves characterizing the optimal choices of the ﬁrms
and then seeing how they are affected by a change in the tax rate.
The incidence of a tax on output can be demonstrated by returning to the diagram
for monopoly proﬁt maximization. A tax of value t on output changes the tax-inclusive
marginal cost from c to c + t. In ﬁgure 9.5 this is shown to move the intersection
between the marginal revenue curve and the marginal cost curve from a to b. Output
falls from yo to yt, and price rises from p to q. In this case price rises by less than the

Tax undershifting

Chapter 9: Imperfect Competition
tax imposed—the difference between q and p is less than t. This is called the case of
tax undershifting. What it means is that the monopolist is absorbing some of the tax
and not passing it all on to the consumer.
With competition, the full value of the tax may be shifted to consumers but never
more. With monopoly, the proportion of the tax that is shifted to consumers is deter-
minedbytheshapeoftheAR curve(andhencetheMR curve). Incontrasttocompetition,
for some shapes of AR curve it is possible for the imposition of a tax to be met by a
price increase that exceeds the value of the tax. This is the case of tax overshifting and
is illustrated in ﬁgure 9.6. The imposition of the tax, t, leads to a price increase from
p to q. As is clear in the ﬁgure, q −p > t. This outcome could never happen in the
competitive case.
The feature that distinguishes the cases of overshifting and undershifting is the shape
of the demand function. Figure 9.5 has a demand function that is convex—it becomes
increasingly steep as quantity increases. In contrast, ﬁgure 9.6 involves a concave
demand function with a gradient that decreases as output increases. Either of these
shapes for the demand function is entirely consistent with the existence of monopoly.
The overshifting of taxation is also a possibility with oligopoly. To illustrate this,
consider the constant elasticity demand function X = pε, where ε < 0 is the elasticity
of demand. Since the elasticity is constant, so must be the markup at μo =
m
m−(1/|ε|).
Furthermore, because ε < 0 it follows that μo > 1. Applying the markup to marginal

cost plus tax obtains the equilibrium price of the oligopoly, q = μo[c + t]. The effect
of an increase in the tax is then
∂q
∂t = μo > 1,
(9.13)
so there is always overshifting with the constant elasticity demand function. This holds
for any value of m ≥1, and hence applies to both monopoly (m = 1) and oligopoly
(m ≥2). In addition, as m increases and the market becomes more competitive, μo will
tend to 1, as will ∂q
∂t , so the competitive outcome of complete tax shifting will arise.
Some estimates of the value of the tax-shifting term are given in table 9.3 for the
beer and tobacco industries. Both of these industries have a small number of dominant
ﬁrmsandanoligopolisticmarketstructure. Theﬁguresshowthatalthoughundershifting
arises in most cases, there is evidence of overshifting in the tobacco industry.
There is an even more surprising effect that can occur with oligopoly: an increase in
taxation can lead to an increase in proﬁt. The analysis of the constant elasticity case can
be extended to demonstrate this result. Since the equilibrium price is q = μo[c + t],
we use the demand function to obtain the output of each ﬁrm as
x = [μo]ε [c + t]ε
m
.
(9.14)
Using these values for price and output results in a proﬁt level for each ﬁrm of
π = [μo −1] [μo]ε [c + t]ε+1
m
.
(9.15)
The effect of an increase in the tax on the level of proﬁt is then given by
∂π
∂t = [μo −1] [μo]ε [ε + 1] [c + t]ε
m
.
(9.16)
The possibility of the increase in tax raising proﬁt follows by observing that if ε > −1,
then [ε + 1] > 0, so ∂π
∂t > 0. When the elasticity satisﬁes this restriction, an increase

273
Chapter 9: Imperfect Competition
in the tax will raise the level of proﬁt. Put simply, the ﬁrms ﬁnd the addition to their
costs to be proﬁtable.
It should be observed that such a proﬁt increase cannot occur with monopoly because
a monopolist must produce on the elastic part of the demand curve with ε < −1. With
oligopoly the markup remains ﬁnite provided that m −1
|ε| > 0 or ε < −1
m. Therefore
proﬁt can be increased by an increase in taxation if there is oligopoly.
The mechanism that makes this outcome possible is shown in ﬁgure 9.7, which
displays the determination of the Cournot equilibrium for a duopoly. The ﬁgure is
constructed by ﬁrst plotting the isoproﬁt curves. The curves denote sets of output levels
for the two ﬁrms that give a constant level of proﬁt. The proﬁt of ﬁrm 1 is highest
on the curves closest to the horizontal axis, and it reaches its maximum at the output
level, m1, which is the output ﬁrm 1 would produce if it were a monopolist. Similarly
the level of proﬁt for ﬁrm 2 is higher on the isoproﬁt curves closest to the vertical
axis, and is maximized at its monopoly output level, m2. The assumption of Cournot
oligopoly is that each ﬁrm takes the output of the other as given when it maximizes.
So for any ﬁxed output level for ﬁrm 2, ﬁrm 1 will maximize proﬁt on the isoproﬁt
curve that is horizontal at the output level of ﬁrm 2. Connecting the horizontal points
gives the best-reaction function for ﬁrm 1, which is labeled r1(y2). Similarly, setting
a ﬁxed output level for ﬁrm 1, we have that ﬁrm 2 maximizes proﬁt on the isoproﬁt
curve that is vertical at this level of 1’s output. Connecting the vertical points gives its
best-reaction function r2(y1).

Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
The Cournot equilibrium for the duopoly is where the best-reaction functions cross,
and the isoproﬁt curves are locally horizontal for ﬁrm 1 and vertical for ﬁrm 2. This
is point c in the ﬁgure. The Cournot equilibrium is not efﬁcient for the ﬁrms, and a
simultaneous reduction in output by both ﬁrms, which would be a move from c in the
direction of b, would raise both ﬁrms’ proﬁts. Further improvement in proﬁt can be
continued until the point that maximizes joint proﬁt, π1 + π2, is reached. Joint proﬁt
maximization occurs at a point of tangency of the isoproﬁt curves, which is denoted
by point b in ﬁgure 9.7. The ﬁrms could achieve this point if they were to collude, but
such collusion would not be credible because both the ﬁrms would have an incentive
to deviate from point b by increasing output.
It is this inefﬁciency that opens the possibility for a joint increase in proﬁt to be ob-
tained. Intuitively, how taxation raises proﬁt is by shifting the isoproﬁt curves in such a
way that the duopoly equilibrium moves closer to the point of joint proﬁt maximization.
Although total available production must fall as the tax increases, the ﬁrms secure a
larger fraction of the gains from trade. Unlike collusion, the tax is binding on the ﬁrms
and produces a credible reduction in output.
9.6
Speciﬁc and Ad valorem Taxation
The analysis of tax incidence has so far considered only speciﬁc taxation. With speciﬁc
taxation, the legally responsible ﬁrm has to pay a ﬁxed amount of tax for each unit of
output. The amount that has to be paid is independent of the price of the commodity.
Consequently the price the consumer pays is the producer price plus the speciﬁc tax.
This is not the only way in which taxes can be levied. Commodities can alternatively be
subject to ad valorem taxation so that the tax payment is deﬁned as a ﬁxed proportion
of the producer price. Consequently, as price changes, so does the amount paid in tax.
The fact that tax incidence has been analyzed only for speciﬁc taxation is not a
limitation when ﬁrms are competitive, since the two forms are entirely equivalent. The
meaning of equivalence here is that a speciﬁc tax and an ad valorem tax that lead to
the same consumer price will raise the same amount of tax revenue. Their economic
incidence is therefore identical.
This equivalence can be shown as follows. Let t be the speciﬁc tax on a commodity.
Then the equivalent ad valorem tax rate τ must satisfy the equation
q = p + t = [1 + τ] p.
(9.17)

275
Chapter 9: Imperfect Competition
Solving this equation, we have that τ = t
p is the ad valorem tax rate that leads to the
same consumer price as the speciﬁc tax. In terms of the incidence diagrams, both taxes
would shift the supply curve for the good in exactly the same way. The demonstration of
equivalence is completed by showing that the taxes raise identical levels of tax revenue.
The revenue raised by the ad valorem tax is R = τpX. Using the fact that τ = t
p, we can
write this revenue level as t
ppX = tX, which is the revenue raised by the speciﬁc tax.
This completes the demonstration that the speciﬁc and ad valorem taxes are equivalent.
With imperfect competition this equivalence between the two forms of taxation
breaks down: speciﬁc and ad valorem taxes that generate the same consumer price
generate different levels of revenue. The reason for this breakdown of equivalence, and
its consequences, are now explored.
The fact that speciﬁc and ad valorem taxes have different effects can be seen very
easily in the monopoly case. Assume that the ﬁrm sells at price q and that each unit
of output is produced at marginal production cost, c. With a speciﬁc tax the consumer
price and producer price are related by q = p + t. This allows the proﬁt level with a
speciﬁc tax to be written as
π = [q −t] x −cx = qx −[c + t] x.
(9.18)
The expression for this proﬁt level shows that the speciﬁc tax acts as an addition to the
marginal cost for the ﬁrm. Now consider instead the payment of an ad valorem tax at rate
τ. Since an ad valorem tax is levied as a proportion of the producer price, the consumer
price and producer price are related by q = [1 + τ] p; hence the consumers pay price
q and the ﬁrm receives p =
1
1+τ q. The proﬁt level with the ad valorem tax is then
π =
1
1 + τ qx −cx.
(9.19)
The basic difference between the two taxes can be seen by comparing these alternative
speciﬁcations of proﬁt. From the perspective of the ﬁrm, the speciﬁc tax raises marginal
production cost from c to c + t. In contrast, the ad valorem tax reduces the revenue
received by the ﬁrm from qx to
1
1+τ qx. Hence the speciﬁc tax works via the level of
costs, whereas the ad valorem tax operates via the level of revenue. With competition
this difference is of no consequence. But the very basis of imperfect competition is
that the ﬁrms recognize the effect their actions has on revenue—so the ad valorem tax
interacts with the expression of monopoly power.
The consequence of this difference is illustrated in ﬁgure 9.8. In the left-hand panel,
the effect of a speciﬁc tax is shown. In the right-hand panel, the effect of an ad valorem

276
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
tax is shown. The speciﬁc tax leads to an upward shift in the tax-inclusive marginal
cost curve. This moves the optimal price from p to q. The ad valorem tax leads to a
downward shift in average and marginal revenue net of tax as shown in ﬁgure 9.8. The
ad valorem tax leads from price p in the absence of taxation to q with taxation. The
resulting price increase is dependent on the slope of the marginal revenue curve.
What is needed to make a ﬁrm comparison between the effects of the two taxes
is some common benchmark. The benchmark chosen is a given consumer price. The
values of the speciﬁc and ad valorem taxes that lead to this consumer price are found.
The taxes are then contrasted by determining which raises the most tax revenue. This
comparison is easily conducted by returning to the deﬁnition of proﬁt in (9.19). With
the ad valorem tax, the proﬁt level can be expressed as
π =
1
1 + τ qx −cx =
1
1 + τ [qx −[c + τc] x].
(9.20)
The second term of (9.20) shows that the ad valorem tax is equivalent to the combined
use of a speciﬁc tax of value τc plus a proﬁt tax at rate
τ
1+τ . A proﬁt tax has no effect
on the ﬁrm’s choice, but it does raise revenue. Hence an ad valorem tax with its rate is
set so that
τc = t

leads to the same after-tax price as the speciﬁc tax. However, the ad valorem tax raises
more revenue. This is because the component τc collects the same revenue as the spe-
ciﬁc tax t, but the ad valorem tax also collects revenue from the proﬁt-tax component.
Hence the ad valorem tax must collect more revenue for the same consumer price. This
result can, alternatively, be expressed as the fact that for a given level of revenue, an
ad valorem tax leads to lower consumer price than a speciﬁc tax.
In conclusion, ad valorem taxation is more effective than speciﬁc taxation when
there is imperfect competition. The intuition behind this conclusion is that the ad
valorem tax lowers marginal revenue, and this reduces the perceived market power of
the ﬁrm. Consequently the ad valorem tax has the helpful effect of reducing monopoly
power, offsetting some of the costs involved in raising revenue through commodity
taxation.
9.7
Regulation of Monopoly
Up until this point the focus has been placed on the welfare loss caused by imperfect
competition and on tax incidence. As we have shown, there are two competing views
about the extent of the welfare loss, but even if the lower values are accepted, it is
still beneﬁcial to reduce the loss as far as possible. This raises the issue of the range of
policies that are available to reduce the adverse effects of monopoly.
When faced with imperfect competition, the most natural policy response is to en-
courage an enhanced degree of competition. There are several ways in which this can
be done. The most dramatic example is US antitrust legislation, which has been used to
enforce the division of monopolies into separate competing ﬁrms. This policy was ap-
plied to the Standard Oil Company, which was declared a monopoly and broken up into
competing units in 1911. More recently the Bell System telephone company was broken
up in 1984. This policy of breaking up monopolists represents extreme legislation and,
once enacted, leaves a major problem of how the system should be organized following
the breakup. Typically the industry will require continuing regulation, a theme to which
we return below.
Less dramatic than directly breaking up ﬁrms is to provides aids to competition. A
barrier to entry is anything that allows a monopoly to sustain its position and prevent
new ﬁrms from competing effectively. Barriers to entry can be legal restrictions such
as the issue of a single license permitting only one ﬁrm to be active. They can also be
technological in the sense of superior knowledge, the holding of patents, or the structure
of the production function. Furthermore some barriers can be erected deliberately by the

278
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
incumbent monopolist speciﬁcally to deter entry. For a policy to encourage competition,
it must remove or at least reduce the barriers to entry. The appropriate policy response
depends on the nature of the barrier.
If a barrier to entry is created by a legal restriction, it can equally be removed by a
change to the law. But here it is necessary to inquire as to why the restriction was created
initially. One possible answer would take us to the concept of rent-creation, which is
discussed in chapter 12. In that chapter the introduction of a restriction is seen as a
way of generating rent. An interesting example of the creation of such restrictions are
the activities of MITI (the Ministry of International Trade and Industries) in Japan. In
1961 MITI produced its “Concentration Plan,” which aimed to concentrate the mass-
production automakers into two to three groups. The intention behind this was to
sustain the international competition that ensued after the liberalization of auto imports
into Japan and to place the Japanese car industry in a stronger position for exporting.
These intentions were never fully realized, and the plan was ultimately undermined
by developments in the auto industry, especially the emergence of Honda as a major
manufacturer. Despite this, the example still stands as a good illustration of a deliberate
policy attempt to restrict competition.
If barriers to entry relate to technological knowledge, then it is possible for the
government to insist on the sharing of this knowledge. Both the concerns over the
bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows in the United States and the bundling of
Media Player with Windows in Europe are pertinent examples. In the United States
the outcome has been that Microsoft is obliged to provide rival software ﬁrms with
information that allows them to develop competing products, and to ensure that these
products work with the Windows operating system. Microsoft’s rivals are pushing for
a similar solution in the European Union. The existence of patents to protect the use of
knowledge is also a barrier to entry. The reasoning behind patents is that they allow a
reward for innovation: new discoveries are only valuable if the products in which they
are embedded can be exploited without competitors immediately copying them. The
production of generic drugs is one of the better-known examples of product copying.
Without patents, the incentive to innovate would be much reduced and aggregate wel-
fare would fall. The policy issue then becomes the choice of the length of a patent. It
must be long enough to allow innovation to be adequately rewarded but not so long that
it stiﬂes competition. Current practice in the United States is that the term of a patent
is twenty years from the date at which the application is ﬁled.
Barriers to entry can also be erected as a deliberate part of a corporate strategy de-
signed to deter competitors. Entry barriers can be within the law, such as sustained
advertising campaigns to build brand loyalty or the building of excess capacity to deter

279
Chapter 9: Imperfect Competition
entry, or they can be illegal such as physical intimidation, violence, and destruction
of property. Obviously the latter category can be controlled by recourse to the law if
potential competitors wish to do so. Potentially limitations could be placed on adver-
tising. The limitations on tobacco advertisements is an example of such a policy, but
this has been motivated on health grounds and not competition reasons. The role of
excess capacity is to provide a credible threat that the entry of a competitor will be met
by an increase in output from the incumbent with a consequent reduction in market
price. The reduction in price can make entry unproﬁtable, so sustaining the monopoly
position. Although the economic reasoning is clear, it is difﬁcult to see how litigation
could ever demonstrate that excess capacity was being held as an entry deterrent, and
this limits any potential policy response.
The enhancement of competition only works if it is possible for competitors to be
viable. The limits of the argument that monopoly can be tackled by the encouragement
of competition are confronted when the market is characterized by natural monopoly.
The essence of natural monopoly is that there are increasing returns in production and
thatthelevelofdemandissuchthatonlyasingleﬁrmcanbeproﬁtable. Thisisillustrated
in ﬁgure 9.9 where the production technology of the two ﬁrms involves a substantial
ﬁxed cost but a constant marginal cost. Consequently the average cost curve, denoted
AC, is decreasing while the marginal cost curve, MC, is horizontal. When there is a
monopoly, the single ﬁrm faces the demand curve AR1. Corresponding to this average
revenue curve is the marginal revenue curve MR1. The proﬁt-maximizing price for the

Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
monopoly is p and output is y1. It should be observed that the price is above the level
of average cost at output y1, so the monopolist earns a proﬁt.
Now consider the consequence of a second ﬁrm entering the market. The cost con-
ditions do not change, so the AC and MC curves are unaffected. Demand conditions
do change since the ﬁrms have to share the market. The simplest assumption to make
is that the two ﬁrms share exactly half the market each. This would hold if the total
market consists of two geographical areas each of which could be served by one ﬁrm.
Furthermore this is the most beneﬁcial situation for the ﬁrms since it keeps them from
competing. Any other way of sharing the market would lead to them to earning less
proﬁt. With the market shared equally, the demand facing each ﬁrm becomes AR2 (equal
to the old MR1) and marginal revenue, MR2. The proﬁt-maximizing price remains at
p, but now at output y2 this is below average cost. The two ﬁrms must therefore both
take a loss. Since this market sharing is the most proﬁtable way for the two ﬁrms to
behave, any other market behavior must lead to an even greater loss.
What this argument shows is that a market in which one ﬁrm can be proﬁtable
cannot support two ﬁrms. The problem is that the level of demand does not generate
enough revenue to cover the ﬁxed costs of two ﬁrms operating. The examples that are
usually cited of natural monopolies involve utilities such as water supply, electricity,
gas, telephone, and railways where a large infrastructure has to be in place to support
the market and is very costly to replicate. If these markets do conform to the situation
in the ﬁgure, then without government intervention, only a single ﬁrm could survive in
the market. Furthermore any policy to encourage competition will not succeed unless
the government can fundamentally alter the structure of the industry. It is not enough
just to try to get another ﬁrm to operate.
The two policy responses to natural monopoly most widely employed have been
public ownership and private ownership with a regulatory body controlling behavior.
When the ﬁrm is run under public ownership, its price should be chosen to maximize
social welfare subject to the budget constraint placed on the ﬁrm—the resulting price is
termed the Ramsey price. The budget constraint may require the ﬁrm to break even or to
generate income above production cost. Alternatively, the ﬁrm may be allowed to run
a deﬁcit that is ﬁnanced from other tax revenues. Assume that all other markets in the
economy are competitive. The Ramsey price for a public ﬁrm subject to a break-even
constraint will then be equal to marginal cost if this satisﬁes the constraint. If losses
arise at marginal cost, then the Ramsey price will be equal to average cost. The literature
on public sector pricing has extended this reasoning to situations where marginal cost
and demand vary over time such as in the supply of electricity. Doing this leads into

281
Chapter 9: Imperfect Competition
the theory of peak-load pricing. When other markets are not competitive, the Ramsey
price will reﬂect the distortions elsewhere in the economy.
Public ownership was practiced extensively in the United Kingdom and elsewhere
in Europe. All the major utilities including gas, telephone, electricity, water, and trains
were taken into public ownership. This policy was eventually undermined by the prob-
lems of the lack of incentive to innovate, invest, or limit costs. Together, these produced
a very poor outcome with the lack of market forces producing industries that were
overmanned and inefﬁcient. As a consequence the United Kingdom has undertaken a
privatization program that has returned all these industries to the private sector.
The treatment of the various industries since the return to private ownership illustrates
different responses to the regulation of natural monopoly. The water industry is broken
into regional suppliers that do not compete directly but are closely regulated. With
telephones, the network is owned by British Telecom, but other ﬁrms are permitted
access agreements to the network. This can allow them to offer a service without the
need to undertake the capital investment. In the case of the railways, the ownership of
the track, which is the ﬁxed cost, has been separated from the rights to operate trains,
which generates the marginal cost. Both the track owner and the train operators remain
regulated. With gas and electricity, competing suppliers are permitted to supply using
the single existing network.
Themostsigniﬁcantdifferencebetweenpublicownershipandprivateownershipwith
regulation is that under public ownership the government is as informed as the ﬁrm
about demand and cost conditions. This allows the government to determine the be-
havior of the ﬁrm using the best available information. Policy can only maximize the
objective function in an expected sense. So, although the available information may not
be complete, the best that is possible will be achieved. As an alternative to public own-
ership, a ﬁrm may remain under private ownership but be made subject to the control
of a regulatory body. This introduces possible asymmetries in information between the
ﬁrm and the regulator. Faced with limited information, one approach considered in the
theoretical literature is for the regulator to design an incentive mechanism that achieves
a desirable outcome. An example of such a regulatory scheme is the two-part tariff in
which the payment for a commodity involves a ﬁxed fee to permit consumption fol-
lowed by a price per unit of consumption, with these values being set by the regulator.
Alternatively, the regulator may impose a constraint on some observable measure of
the ﬁrm’s activities such as that it must not exceed a given rate of return on the capital
employed. Even more simple are the regulatory schemes in the United Kingdom that
involve restricting prices to rise at a slower rate than an index of the general price level.

282
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
The analysis has looked at a range of issues concerned with dealing with monopoly
power and how to regulate industries. The essence of policy is to move the economy
closer to the competitive outcome, but there can be distinct problems in achieving this.
Monopoly can arise because of the combination of cost and demand conditions, and
this can place limitations on what policies are feasible. Natural monopoly results in the
need for regulation.
9.8
Regulation of Oligopoly
9.8.1
Detecting Collusion
In an oligopolistic market ﬁrms can collectively act as a monopolist and are conse-
quently able to increase their prices. The problem for a regulatory agency is that such
collusion is often tacit and so difﬁcult to detect. However, from an economic view-
point there is no real competition, and a high price is the prima facie evidence of
collusion. The practical question for the regulator is whether a high price is the natural
outcome of competition in a market where there is signiﬁcant product differentiation
(and so little pricing constraint from substitute products) or whether it reﬂects price
collusion.
Nevo (2001) studied this question for the breakfast cereal industry where the four
leaders Kellogg, Quaker, General Mills, and Post were accused by Congressman Chuck
Schumer (March 1995) of charging “caviar prices for cornﬂakes quality.”After estimat-
ing price elasticities of demand for each brand of cereal, Nevo (2001) used these price
elasticities to calculate the Lerner index for each brand, p−c
p , that would prevail in the
industry if producers were colluding and acting as a monopolist. Nevo then calculated
the Lerner index for each brand if producers were really competing with each other.
Given the estimated demand elasticities, Nevo found that with collusion, the Lerner
index of each brand would be on average around 65 to 75 percent. With the ﬁrms
competing, the Lerner index would be on average around 40 to 44 percent. The next
step was to compare these estimates of the Lerner index for the hypothetical collusive
and competing industry with the actual Lerner index for the breakfast cereal industry
to see which hypothesis is the most likely. According to Nevo, the actual Lerner index
for the breakfast cereal market was about 45 percent in 1995. This market power index
is far below the 65 to 75 percent hypothetical Lerner index that would prevail in a
colluding industry and much closer to the Lerner index in the competing hypothesis.

but because of product differentiation that limits competition from substitute products
(after all, what is the substitute for a “healthy” cereal breakfast?).
9.8.2
Merger Policy
In its recent reform of merger regulation, the European Commission has recognized
that in oligopolistic markets a merger may harm competition and consequently increase
prices. Under the original European Commission Merger Regulation (ECMR) a merger
was incompatible with the common market if and only if it “creates or strengthens a
dominant position as a result of which competition would be signiﬁcantly impeded.”
The problem with this two-part cumulative test was that unless a merger was likely
to create or strengthen a dominant position, the question of whether it could lessen
competition did not arise and so could not be used to challenge a merger. However, one
can easily think of oligopoly situations where a merger would substantially lessen com-
petition without giving any individual ﬁrm a dominant position. Moreover the concept
of dominance is not easily established especially in the presence of tacit collusion. In
practice, the concept of dominance had different meanings depending on the circum-
stances. In particular, when there was some presumption of collusion, the European
Commission could use the concept of “collective” dominance, taking as a single unit a
group of sellers suspected to collude in their pricing policy. Just asAlice said in Through
the Looking Glass, the question comes to “whether you can make words mean so many
different things.”
In the 2004 reform of merger policy the European Commission shifted the attention
to the second part of the original regulation. The key article in the new ECMR says
that “a concentration which would signiﬁcantly impede effective competition, in the
common market or in a substantial part of it, in particular as a result of the creation or
strengthening of a dominant position, shall be declared incompatible with the common
market” (Article 2). Thus the European Commission has recognized that reducing
competition is not necessarily dominance but rather a result of how much competition
is left. The fundamental idea is that in oligopolistic markets a merger of two or more
rivals raises competitive concerns if the merging ﬁrms sell products that are close
substitutes. By removing the competitive constraint, merging ﬁrms are able to increase
their prices. This is the “unilateral effect” theory of competitive harm that has been
commonly used in the US merger regulation.
Economists have developed a large number of simulation methods, mostly based on
estimated demand elasticities, to determine the possible change in price resulting from
a merger. Simulation models combine market data on market shares, the own-price

284
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
elasticity of demand, and the cross-price elasticities of demand with a model of ﬁrm
behavior and anticipated reductions in cost from the merger to predict the likely price
effects. A practical example will be useful to illustrate the method. The example is
drawn from Hausman and Leonard (1997) and concerns the market for bath tissue. In
1995 the producer of the Kleenex brand acquired the producer of two competing brands
(Cottonelle and ScotTissue). The market shares for these products and other brands are
shown in table 9.4.
Using weekly retail scanner data that tracks household purchases in retail stores in
major US cities, it was possible to estimate own-price elasticities as shown in table 9.4.
The key cross-price elasticities were estimated to be 0.19 (Kleenex relative to Co-
tonelle), 0.18 (Kleenex relative to ScotTissue), 0.14 (Cottonelle relative to Kleenex),
and 0.06 (ScotTissue relative to Kleenex). In addition it was anticipated that the ac-
quisition would reduce the marginal cost of production for ScotTissue, Cottonelle,
and Kleenex by 4, 2.4, and 2.4 percent respectively. With these estimates of demand
elasticities, information about market shares, and the anticipated cost saving from the
acquisition of Cottonelle and ScotTissue by the Kleenex brand, it was possible to eval-
uate the price effects of the merger.Asimulation model based on these market estimates
and other assumptions about ﬁrm and market behavior (Nash equilibrium and constant
marginal costs) produced the following prices changes. The acquisition would lead to a
reduction in the price of ScotTissue and Cottonelle by 2.6 and 0.3 percent respectively,
and an increase in the price of Kleenex by 1.0 percent. Not surprisingly, the Antitrust
did not challenge the merger.

Unions and Taxation
As well as monopoly on product markets, it is possible to have unions creating market
power for their members on input markets. By organizing labor into a single collective
organization, unions are able to raise the wage above the competitive level and generate
a surplus for their members. The issue of tax incidence is also of interest when there
are unions, since they can employ their market power to reduce the effect of a tax on
the welfare of members.
The role of trade unions is to ensure that they secure the best deal possible for their
members. In achieving this, the union faces a trade-off between the wage rate and the
level of employment, since a higher wage will invariably lead to lower employment.
This trade-off has to be resolved by the union’s preferences.
A standard way of representing the preferences of a union is to assume that it has
a ﬁxed number, m, of members. Each employed member receives a wage w[1 −t],
where t is the tax on wage income. The unemployed members receive a payment of
b, which can represent either unemployment beneﬁt or the payment in a nonunionized
occupation. The level of employment is determined by a labor demand function n(w),
with higher values of w leading to lower levels of employment. If the wage rate is
w, the probability of any particular member being employed and receiving w[1 −t]
is n(w)
m . Consequently, if all members are assumed to have the same preferences, the
expected utility of a typical union member is
U = n (w)
m
u(w [1 −t]) + m −n (w)
m
u(b).
(9.22)
Since all union members have identical preferences, this utility function can also be
taken to represent the preferences of the union.
The union chooses the wage rate to maximize utility, so that the chosen wage satisﬁes
the ﬁrst-order condition
n′(w)[u(w [1 −t]) −u(b)] + n(w)[1 −t] u′(w[1 −t]) = 0.
(9.23)
The interpretation of this condition is that the optimal wage rate balances the marginal
utility of a higher wage against the value of the marginal loss of employment. Now
deﬁne the elasticity of labor demand by εn = n
w
w
n < 0 and the elasticity of utility by
εu =

w[1−t]

> 0. The ﬁrst-order condition (9.23) can then be written as
u(w[1 −t]) = μuu(b),
(9.24)

286
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
where μu =
1
1−(εu/|εn|) > 1 is the union markup relating the utility of an employed
member to that of an unemployed member. This markup is a measure of the unions
market power. Given a value for the utility elasticity, εu, the markup increases the lower
is the elasticity of labor demand, εn. As labor demand becomes perfectly elastic, as it
does if the labor market is perfectly competitive, then μu tends to 1, and the union can
achieve no advantage for its members.
The incidence of taxation can now be determined. To simplify, assume that the two
elasticities—and hence the markup—are constant. Then the utility of the after-tax wage
mustalwaysbearthesamerelationtotheutilityofunemploymentbeneﬁt. Consequently
w[1 −t] must be constant whatever the tax rate. This can only be achieved if the union
negates any tax increase by securing an increase in the wage rate that exactly offsets
the tax change. Consequently those who retain employment are left unaffected by the
tax change, but since the wage has risen, employment must fall. Overall, the union
members must be worse off. This argument can easily be extended to see that if the
elasticities are not constant, there is the potential for the overshifting, or undershifting,
of any tax increase. In this respect tax incidence with trade unions has very similar
features to incidence with monopoly.
9.10
Monopsony
A monopsony market is a market consisting of a single buyer who can purchase from
many sellers. The single buyer (or monopsonist) could be a ﬁrm that constitutes the
only potential buyer of an input. It could also be an individual or public organization
that is the only buyer of a product. For example, in many countries the government is
the monopsonist in the teaching and nursing markets. In local markets with only one
large employer, the local employer might literally be the only employment option in
the local community (a coal mine, supermarket, government agency, etc.), so it might
make sense that the local employer acts as a monopsonist in reducing the wage be-
low the competitive level. In larger markets with more than one employer, employers
association often have opportunities to coordinate their wage offers. This wage coor-
dination allows employers to act as a “demand” cartel in the labor market and thus
replicate the monopsony outcome. Just as monopoly results in supply reduction with
a price or wage above competitive levels, monopsony will result in demand reduction
with price or wage below competitive levels.
In a perfectly competitive market in which many ﬁrms purchase labor services, each
ﬁrm takes the price of labor as given. Each ﬁrm maximizes its proﬁts by choosing the

287
Chapter 9: Imperfect Competition
employment level that equates the marginal revenue product of labor with the wage
rate. In contrast, in a monopsony labor market, the monopsony ﬁrm pays a wage below
the competitive wage. The result is a shortage of employment relative to the competitive
level. The idea is that since the marginal revenue product from additional employment
exceeds the wage cost in a monopsony labor market the monopsonist employer might
want to hire more people at the prevailing wage. However, it would not want to increase
the wage to attract more workers because the gain from hiring additional workers (the
marginal revenue product) is outweighed by the higher wage bill it would face for its
existing workforce.
Figure 9.10 shows the equilibrium in a monopsony labor market. The competitive
equilibrium occurs at a market-clearing wage, wc, where the labor supply curve inter-
sects the demand curve. Suppose now there is a single buyer on this labor market. The
marginal revenue of labor is the additional revenue that the ﬁrm gets when it employs
an additional unit of labor. Suppose that the ﬁrm’s output as a function of its labor
use is Q(L) and that the ﬁrm is a price taker on the output market, so its output price
p is independent of the amount of output Q. Then the marginal revenue of labor is
MRL = p dQ
dL , which is decreasing due to decreasing returns to labor. This marginal
revenue is depicted in ﬁgure 9.10 as the downward-sloping labor demand curve. The
supply of labor is described by the “inverse” supply curve. The inverse supply curve

Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
w(L) describes the wage required to induce any given quantity of labor to be sup-
plied. Since the supply curve is upward sloping, dw
dL > 0. The total labor cost of the
monopsonist is Lw(L), and the marginal cost of labor is the extra cost that comes from
hiring one more worker MCL = w+ L dw
dL. This additional cost can be decomposed
into two parts: the cost from employing more workers at the existing wage, w, and the
cost from raising the wage for all workers, L dw
dL. Since dw
dL > 0, the marginal labor
cost curve lies everywhere above the labor supply curve, as indicated in ﬁgure 9.10.
The monopsonist will maximize proﬁt, π = pQ(L) −w(L)L, at the point where the
marginal revenue of labor is equal to marginal cost, p dQ
dL = w + L dw
dL.
The choice that gives maximum proﬁt occurs in ﬁgure 9.10 at the intersection be-
tween the marginal cost curve and the labor demand curve, yielding employment
level Lm and wage rate wm. Therefore in a monopsony labor market the monop-
sony ﬁrm pays a wage that is less than the competitive wage with employment level
below the competitive level. The monopsony equilibrium condition can also be ex-
pressed as an inverse elasticity pricing rule. Indeed the elasticity of labor supply is
εL = dL

(9.25)
Thisinversepricingrulesaysthatthepercentagedeviationfromthecompetitivewage
is inversely proportional to the elasticity of labor supply. In contrast to monopoly, the
key elasticity is the supply elasticity. Just as monopoly results in a deadweight loss,
so does monopsony leading to underemployment and underpricing of the input (in this
case labor) relative to the competitive outcome.
9.11
Conclusions
This chapter has shown how imperfect competition leads to a failure to attain Pareto-
efﬁciency. As with all such failures, this opens a potential role for government interven-
tion to promote efﬁciency. Estimates of the welfare loss due to imperfect competition
vary widely from the almost insigniﬁcant to considerable proportions of welfare, de-
pending on the perspective taken upon expenditures on securing the monopoly position.
These static losses have to be set against the possible dynamic gains.
Economic tax incidence relates to whoever ultimately has to change his behavior as
a consequence of taxation. With competition the outcome is fairly straightforward: the

289
Chapter 9: Imperfect Competition
cost of a commodity tax is divided between producers and consumers, with the division
depending on the elasticities of supply and demand. Imperfect competition introduces
two additional factors. Taxes may be overshifted so that price rises by more than the
value of the tax. In addition an increase in taxation may even raise the proﬁts of ﬁrms.
In contrast to the competitive case, speciﬁc and ad valorem taxation are not equivalent
with imperfect competition. In a choice between the instruments, ad valorem taxation
is more effective, since it has the effect of reducing perceived monopoly power.
To reduce the welfare loss, policy should attempt to encourage competition. In
some circumstances this can work, but when there is natural monopoly, this policy
has to be carefully considered. A natural monopoly could be taken into public own-
ership or run as a private ﬁrm with regulation. Recent policy has concentrated on the
latter.

(Varian)Adaily dose of theAIDS drug PLC sells for $18 in the United States and $9 in Uganda
(New York Times, September 21, 2000). Even at $9 a dose the drug company makes a proﬁt
on additional sales. But if the drug were sold at $9 to everyone, proﬁts would decline. Price
discrimination is not popular with consumers, especially those paying the higher price. To
evaluate whether differential pricing is good or bad, the critical question from the viewpoint
of economics is whether uniform price or differential pricing leads to more people getting the
drug. In general, there is no easy answer. Imagine that there are only two countries involved,
the United States and Uganda:
a. Imagine the US market for the PLC drug is more than ﬁve times the Ugandan market, and
the drug sells respectively for $18 and $9. What price is likely to prevail if only one price
can be charged? What would be the effect on total consumption and, especially, for drug
consumers in Uganda? What would be the effect on US drug consumers?
b. Imagine an anti-malarial drug that many people in Uganda would buy at $2 a dose and

Asymmetric Information
10.1
Introduction
Akey feature of the real world is asymmetric information. Most people want to ﬁnd the
right partner, one who is caring, kind, healthy, intelligent, attractive, trustworthy, and
so on. While attractiveness may be easily veriﬁed at a glance, many other traits people
seek in a partner are difﬁcult to observe, and people usually rely on behavioral signals
that convey partial information. There may be good reasons to avoid a potential mate
who is too eager to start a relationship with you, as this may suggest unfavorable traits.
Similarly it is hard not to infer that people who participate in dating services must be
on average less worth meeting, and the consensus appears to be that these services are
a bad investment. The reason is that the decision to resort to a dating agency identiﬁes
people who have trouble initiating their own relationships, which is indicative of other
unwelcome traits. The lack of information causes caution in dating, which can result
in good matches being missed.
Asymmetric information arises in economics when the two sides of the market have
different information about the goods and services being traded. In particular, sellers
typically know more about what they are selling than buyers do. This can lead to
adverse selection where bad-quality goods drive out good-quality goods, at least if other
actions are not taken. Adverse selection is the process by which buyers or sellers with
“unfavorable” traits are more likely to participate in the exchange. Adverse selection is
important in economics because it often eliminates exchange possibilities that would
be beneﬁcial to both consumers and sellers alike. There might seem some easy way to
resolve the problem of information asymmetry: let everyone reveal what they know.
Unfortunately, individuals do not necessarily have the incentive to tell the truth (think
about the mating example or the market identiﬁcation of high- and low-ability people).
Information imperfections are pervasive in the economy, and in some sense, it is
an essential feature of a market economy that different people know different things.
While such information asymmetries inevitably arise, the extent to which they do so
and their consequences depends on how the market is organized. The anticipation
that they will arise also affects market behavior. In this chapter we discuss the ways
in which information asymmetries affect market functioning and how they can be
partially overcome through policy intervention. We do not consider how the agents can
create information problems, for example, in an attempt to exploit market power by

298
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
differentiating products or by taking actions to increase information asymmetries as in
the general governance problem.
One fundamental lesson of information imperfection is that actions convey informa-
tion. This is a commonplace observation in life, but it took some time for economists
to fully appreciate its profound effects on how markets function. Many examples can
be given. A willingness to purchase insurance at a given price conveys information to
an insurance company, because those most likely to decide that the insurance is not
worthwhile are those who are least likely to have an accident. The quality of a guarantee
offered by a ﬁrm conveys information about the quality of its products as only ﬁrms
with reliable products are willing to offer a good guarantee. The number of years of
schooling may also convey information about the ability of an individual. More able
people may go to school longer and the higher wage associated with more schooling
may simply reﬂect the sorting that occurs rather than the ability-augmenting effect of
schooling itself. The willingness of an investor to self-ﬁnance a large fraction of the cost
of a project conveys information about his belief in the project. The size of deductibles
and co-payments that an individual chooses in an insurance contract may convey infor-
mation that he is less risk prone. The process by which individuals reveal information
about themselves through the choices that they make is called self-selection.
Upon recognizing that actions convey information, two important results follow.
First, when making decisions, agents will not only think about what they prefer, but
they will also think about how their choice will affect others’ beliefs about them. So
I may choose longer schooling not because I value what is being taught, but because
it changes others’ beliefs concerning my ability. Second, it may be possible to design
a set of choices that would induce those with different characteristics to effectively
reveal their characteristics through their choices. As long as some actions are more
costly for some types than others, it is an easy matter to construct choices that separate
individuals into classes: self-selection mechanisms could, and would, be employed to
screen. For example, insurance companies may offer a menu of transaction terms that
will separate out different classes of risk into preferring different parts of the menu.
In equilibrium both sides of the market are aware of the informational consequences
of their actions. In the case where the insurance company or employer takes the initia-
tive, self-selection is the main screening device. In the case where the insured, or the
employee, takes the initiative to identify himself as a better type, it is usually consid-
ered as a signaling device. So the difference between screening and signaling lies in
whether the informed or uninformed side of the market moves ﬁrst.
Whatever the actions taken, the theory predicts that the types of transactions that will
arise in practice are different from those that would emerge in a perfect-information

299
Chapter 10: Asymmetric Information
context. The fact that actions convey information affects equilibrium outcomes in a
profound way. On the one hand, since quality increases with price in adverse selec-
tion models, it may be proﬁtable to pay a price in excess of the market-clearing price.
In credit markets, the supply of loans may be rationed. In the labor market, the wage
rate may be higher than the market-clearing wage, leading to unemployment. There may
exist multiple equilibria. Two forms of equilibria are possible: pooling equilibria, in
which the market cannot distinguish among the types, and separating equilibria,
in which the different types separate out by taking different actions. On the other
hand, under plausible conditions, equilibrium might not exist (in particular, if the cost
of separation is too great).
Another set of issues arise when actions are not easily observable. An employer
would like to know how hard his employee is working; a lender would like to know
the actions the borrower will undertake that might affect the chance of reimbursement.
These asymmetries of information about actions are as important as the situations of
hidden knowledge. They lead to what is referred to as the moral hazard problem. This
term originates from the insurance industry, which recognized early that more insurance
reduces the precautions taken by the insured (and not taking appropriate precautions
was viewed to be immoral, hence the name). One way to solve this problem is to try to
induce desired behavior through the setting of contract terms. A borrower’s risk-taking
behavior may be controlled by the interest rate charged by the lender. The insured will
exert more care when facing contracts with large deductibles. But, in competing for risk-
averse customers, the insurance companies face an interesting trade-off. The insurance
has to be complete enough so that the individual will purchase. At the same time
deductibles have to be signiﬁcant enough to provide adequate incentives for insured
parties to take care.
This chapter will explore the consequences of asymmetric information in a number
of different market situations. It will describe the inefﬁciencies that arise and discuss
possible government intervention to correct these. Interpreted in this way, asymmetric
information is one of the classic reasons for market failure and will prevent trading
partners from realizing all the gains of trade. In addition to asymmetric information
between trading parties, it can also arise between the government and the consumers
and ﬁrms in the economy. When it does, it restricts the policies that the government can
implement. Some aspects of how this affects the effectiveness of the government will
be covered in this chapter; others will become apparent in later chapters. The main
implication that will emerge for public intervention is that even if the government also
faces informational imperfections, the incentives and constraints it faces often differ
from those facing the private sector. Even when government faces exactly the same

300
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
informational problems, welfare can be improved by market intervention. There are
interventions in the market that can make all parties better off.
10.2
Hidden Knowledge and Hidden Action
There are two basic forms of asymmetric information that can be distinguished. Hidden
knowledge refers to a situation where one party has more information than the other
party on the quality (or “type”) of a traded good or contract variable. Hidden action is
when one party can affect the “quality” of a traded good or contract variable by some
action, and this action cannot be observed by the other party.
Examplesofhiddenknowledgeabound. Workersknowmoreabouttheirownabilities
than the ﬁrm does; doctors know more about their own skills, the efﬁcacy of drugs, and
what treatment patients need than do either the patients themselves or the insurance
companies; the person buying life insurance knows more about his health and life
expectancy than the insurance ﬁrm; when an automobile insurance company insures an
individual, the individual may know more than the company about her inherent driving
skill and hence about her probability of having an accident; the owner of a car knows
more about the quality of the car than potential buyers; the owner of a ﬁrm knows more
about the ﬁrm than a potential investor; the borrower knows more about the riskiness
of his project than the lender does; and not least, in the policy world, policy makers
know more about their competence than the electorate.
Hidden knowledge leads to the adverse selection problem. To introduce this, suppose
that a ﬁrm knows that there are high-productivity and low-productivity workers and
that it offers a high wage with the intention of attracting high-productivity workers.
Naturally this high wage will also prove attractive to low-productivity workers, so
the ﬁrm will attract a combination of both types. If the wage is above the average
productivity, the ﬁrm will make a loss and be forced to lower the wage. This will result
inhigh-productivityworkersleavingandaverageproductivityfalling. Consequentlythe
wage must again be lowered. Eventually the ﬁrm will be left with only low-productivity
workers. The adverse selection problem is that the high wage attracts the workers the
ﬁrm wants (the high-productivity) and the ones it does not (the low-productivity). The
observation that the ﬁrm will eventually be left with only low-productivity workers
reﬂects the old maxim that “The bad drives out the good.”
There are also plenty of examples of hidden action. The manager of a ﬁrm does not
seek to maximize the return for shareholders but instead trades off her remuneration
for less work effort. Firms may ﬁnd it most proﬁtable to make unsafe products when

301
Chapter 10: Asymmetric Information
quality is not easily observed. Employers also want to know how hard their workers
work. Insurers want to know what care their insured take to avoid an accident. Lenders
want to know what risks their borrowers take. Patients want to know if doctors provide
the correct treatment or if, in an attempt to protect themselves from malpractice suits,
they choose conservative medicine, ordering tests and procedures that may not be in the
patient’s best interests, and surely not worth the costs. The tax authority wants to know
if taxing more may induce people to work less or to conceal more income. Government
wants to know if more generous pension replacement rates may induce people to retire
earlier. A welfaristic government will worry about the recipients of welfare spending
too much and investing too little, thus being more likely to be in need again in the
future. This concern will also be present among altruistic parents who cannot commit
not to help out their children when needy and governments who cannot commit not to
bail out ﬁrms with ﬁnancial difﬁculties.
From hidden actions arises the moral hazard problem. This refers to the inefﬁciency
that arises due to the difﬁculties in designing incentive schemes that ensure the right
actions are taken. For instance, the price charged for insurance must take into account
the fact that an insured person may become more careless once they have the safety net
of insurance cover.
10.3
Actions or Knowledge?
Although the deﬁnitions given above make moral hazard and adverse selection seem
quite distinct, in practice, it may be quite difﬁcult to determine which is at work. The
following example, due to Milgrom and Roberts, serves to illustrate this point.
Aradio story in the summer of 1990 reported a study on the makes and models of cars
that were observed going through intersections in the Washington, DC, area without
stopping at the stop signs. According to the story, Volvos were heavily overrepresented:
the fraction of cars running stop signs that were Volvos was much greater than the frac-
tion of Volvos in the total population of cars in the DC area. This is initially surprising
because Volvo has built a reputation as an especially safe car that appeals to sensible,
safety-conscious drivers. In addition Volvos are largely bought by middle-class couples
with children. How then is this observation explained?
One possibility is that people driving Volvos feel particularly safe in this sturdy,
heavily built, crash-tested car. Thus they are willing to take risks that they would not
take in another, less safe car. This implies that driving a Volvo leads to a propensity
to run stop signs. This is essentially a moral hazard explanation: the car is a form of

302
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
insurance, and having the insurance alters behavior in a way that is privately rational
but socially undesirable.
A second possibility is that the people who buy Volvos know that they are bad
drivers who are apt, for example, to be paying more attention to their children in
the back seat than to stop signs. The safety that a Volvo promises is then especially
attractive to people who have this private information about their driving, so they buy
this safe car in disproportionately large numbers. Hence a propensity for running stop
signs leads to the purchase of a Volvo. This is essentially a self-selection story: Volvo
buyers are privately informed about their driving habits and abilities and choose the
car accordingly.
This self-selection is not necessarily adverse selection. It only becomes adverse
selection if it imposes costs on Volvo. Quite the opposite may in fact be true, and the
self-selection of customers can be very proﬁtable.
It is also typically difﬁcult to disentangle the moral hazard problem from the adverse
selection problem in antipoverty programs because it is difﬁcult to decide whether
poverty is due to a lack of productive skill (adverse selection) or rather to a lack of
effort from the poor themselves who know they will get welfare assistance anyway
(moral hazard).
10.4
Market Unraveling
10.4.1
Hazard Insurance
In the Introduction we noted that asymmetric information can lead to a breakdown in
trade as the less-informed party began to realize that the least desirable potential partners
are those who are more willing to exchange. This possibility is now explored more
formally in a model of the insurance market in which individuals differ in their accident
probabilities. The basic conclusion to emerge is that in equilibrium some consumers do
not purchase insurance, even though they could proﬁtably be sold insurance if accident
probabilities were observable to insurance companies.
Assume that there is a large number of insurance companies and that the insurance
market is competitive. The insurance premium is based on the level of expected risk
among those who accept offers of insurance. Competition ensures that proﬁts are zero in
equilibrium through entry and exit. Furthermore, if there is any new insurance contract
that can be offered that will make a positive proﬁt given the contracts already available,
then one of the companies will choose to offer it.

303
Chapter 10: Asymmetric Information
The demand for insurance comes from a large number of individuals. These can be
broken down into many different types of individual who differ in their probability
of incurring damage of value d = 1. The probability of damage for an individual is
given by θ. Different individuals have different values of θ, but all values lie between 0
and 1. If θ = 1, the individual is certain to have an accident. Asymmetric information
is introduced by assuming that each individual knows their own value of θ but that
it is not observable by the insurance companies. The insurance companies do know
(correctly) that risks are uniformly distributed in the population over the interval [0, 1].
All of the individuals are risk averse, meaning that they are willing to pay an insurance
premium to avoid facing the cost of damage. For each type the maximal insurance
premium that they are willing to pay, π(θ), is given by
π(θ) = [1 + α] θ,
(10.1)
where α > 0 measures the level of risk aversion.
The assumption of competition among the insurance companies implies that in equi-
librium they must earn zero proﬁts. Now assume that insurance companies just offer
a single insurance policy to all customers. Given the premium (or price) of the policy,
π, the policy will be purchased by all the individuals whose expected value of damage
is greater than or equal to this. That is, an individual will purchase the policy if
π (θ) ≥π.
(10.2)
If a policy is to break even with zero proﬁt, the premium for this policy must just equal
the average value of damage for those who choose to purchase the policy. Hence (10.2)
can be used to write the break-even condition as
π = E(θ : π(θ) ≥π),
(10.3)
which is just the statement that the premium equals expected damage. Returning to
(10.1), the condition that π (θ) ≥π is equivalent to [1 + α] θ ≥π or θ ≥
π
1+α. Using
the fact that the θ is uniformly distributed gives

This equilibrium is illustrated in ﬁgure 10.1.
It occurs where the curve
E (θ : π(θ)≥π) crosses the 45o line—this intersection is the value given in (10.6). It
can be seen from the ﬁgure that insurance is only taken by those with high risks, namely
all those with risk θ ≥
1
1+2α. This reﬂects the process of market unraveling through
which only a small fraction of the potential consumers are actually served in equilib-
rium. The level of the premium is too high for the low-risk to ﬁnd it worthwhile to
take out the insurance. This outcome is clearly inefﬁcient, since the ﬁrst-best outcome
requires insurance for all consumers. To see this, note that the premium a consumer of
type θ is willing to pay satisﬁes
π(θ) = (1 + α)θ > θ
for all θ.
(10.7)
Therefore everyone is willing to pay more than the price the insurance companies need
to break even if they could observe probabilities of accident.
This ﬁnding of inefﬁciency is a consequence of the fact that the insurance companies
cannot distinguish the low-risk consumers from the high-risk. When a single premium
is offered to all consumers, the high-risk consumers force the premium up, and this
drives the low-risk out of the market. This is a simple example of the mechanism of

adverse selection in which the bad types always ﬁnd it proﬁtable to enter the market at
the expense of the good. Without any intervention in the market, adverse selection will
always lead to an inefﬁcient equilibrium.
10.4.2
Government Intervention
There is a simple way the government can avoid the adverse selection process by which
only the worst risks purchase insurance: it is by forcing all individuals to purchase the
insurance. Compulsory insurance is then a policy that can make many consumers better
off. With this, high-risk consumers beneﬁt from a lower premium than the actual risk
they face and lower than the level in (10.6)—it will actually be π = 1
2 <
1+α
1+2α. The
beneﬁt for some of the low-risk is that they can now purchase a policy at a more
favorable premium than that offered if only high-risk people purchased it. This beneﬁts
those close to the average who, although paying more for the policy than the level of
the actual risk they face. Only the very low-risk are made worse off—they would rather
have no insurance than pay the average premium.
The imposition of compulsory insurance may seem to be a very strong policy, since
in few circumstances are consumers forced by the government to make speciﬁc pur-
chases. But it is the policy actually used for many insurance markets. For instance,
both automobile insurance and employee protection insurance are compulsory. Health
care insurance and unemployment insurance are also compulsory. Aircraft have to be
insured. Pleasure boats have to be compulsorily insured in some countries (e.g., France)
but not in others (e.g., the United Kingdom), despite their representing a much greater
capital investment than automobiles. One argument that could be advanced to explain
this difference is the operation of self-selection into boating as a leisure activity: those
who choose to do it are by their nature either low-risk or sufﬁciently cautious to insure
without compulsion.
There is another role for government intervention. So far the arguments have con-
centrated on one of the simplest cases. Particularly restrictive was the assumption that
the probability of damage was uniformly distributed across the population. It was this
assumption (together with the proportional reservation premium) that ensured that the
curve E(θ : π(θ) ≥π) is a straight line with a single intersection with the 45 degree
line. When the uniform distribution assumption is relaxed, E(θ : π(θ) ≥π) will have
a different shape, and the nature of equilibrium may be changed. There exist in fact
functions for the distribution of types that lead to multiple equilibria. Such a case is il-
lustrated in ﬁgure 10.2. In this ﬁgure E(θ : π(θ) ≥π) crosses the 45 degree line three
times so that there are three equilibria that differ in the size of the premium. At the

Multiple equilibria
low-premium equilibrium, E1, most of the population is able to purchase insurance,
but at the high-premium equilibrium, E3, very few can.
Each of these equilibria is based on correct but different self-fulﬁlling beliefs. For
example, if the insurance companies are pessimistic and expect that only high-risk con-
sumers will take out insurance, they will set a high premium. Given a high premium,
only the high-risk will choose to accept the policy. The beliefs of the insurance com-
panies are therefore conﬁrmed, and the economy becomes trapped in a high-premium
equilibrium with very few consumers covered by insurance. This is clearly a bad out-
come for the economy, since there are also equilibria with lower premiums and wider
insurance coverage.
When there are multiple equilibria, the one with the lowest premium is Pareto-
preferred—it gives more consumers insurance cover and at a lower price. Consequently,
if one of the other equilibria is achieved, there is a potential beneﬁt from government
intervention. The policy the government should adopt is simple: it can induce the best
equilibrium (that with the lowest premium) by imposing a limit on the premium that can
be charged. If we are at the wrong equilibrium, the corresponding premium reduction
(from E2 →E1 or E3 →E1) will attract the good risks, making the cheaper insurance
policy E1 sustainable. This policy is not without potential problems. To see these,
assume that the government slightly miscalculates and sets the maximum premium
below the premium of policy E1. No insurance company can make a proﬁt at this price,
and all offers of insurance will be withdrawn. The policy will then worsen the outcome.

307
Chapter 10: Asymmetric Information
If set too high, one of the other equilibria may be established. To intervene successfully
in this way requires considerable knowledge on the part of the government.
This analysis of the insurance market has shown how asymmetric information can
lead to market unraveling with the bad driving out the good, and eventually to a po-
sition where fewer consumers participate in the market than is efﬁcient. In addition
asymmetric information can lead to multiple equilibria. These equilibria can also be
Pareto-ranked. For each of these problems, a policy response was suggested. The pol-
icy of making insurance compulsory is straightforward to implement and requires little
information on the part of the government. Its only drawback is that it cannot beneﬁt
all consumers, since the very low risk consumers are forced to purchase insurance
they do not ﬁnd worthwhile. In contrast, the policy of a maximum premium requires
considerable information and has signiﬁcant potential pitfalls.
10.5
Screening
If insurance companies are faced with consumers whose probabilities of having acci-
dents differ, then it will be to the companies’advantage if they can ﬁnd some mechanism
that permits them to distinguish between the high-risk and low-risk. Doing so allows
them to tailor insurance policies for each type and hence avoid the pooling of risks that
causes market unraveling.
The mechanism that can be used by the insurance companies is to offer a menu of
different contracts designed so that each risk type self-selects the contract designed for
it. By self-select, we mean that the consumers ﬁnd it in their own interest to select
the contract aimed at them. As we will show, self-selection will involve the high-risks
being offered full insurance coverage at a high premium, while the low-risks are offered
partial coverage at a low premium requiring them to bear part of the loss. The portion
they have to bear consists of a deductible (an initial amount of the loss) and co-insurance
(an extra fraction of the loss beyond the deductible). An equilibrium like this where
different types purchase different contracts is called a separating equilibrium. This
should be contrasted to the pooling equilibrium of the previous section in which all
consumers of insurance purchased the same contract. Obviously the high-risks will
lose from this separation, since they will no longer beneﬁt from the lower premium
resulting from their pooling with the low-risks.
To model self-selection, we again assume that the insurance market is competitive
so that in equilibrium insurance companies will earn zero proﬁts. Rather than have a
continuous range of different types, we now simplify by assuming there are just two

308
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
types of agents. The high-risk agents have a probability of an accident occurring of ph,
and the low-risks a probability pℓ, with ph > pℓ. The two types form proportions λh
and λℓof the total population, where λh + λℓ= 1. Both types have the same ﬁxed
income, r, and suffer the same ﬁxed damage, d, in the case of an accident.
If a consumer of type i buys an insurance policy with a premium π and payout (or
coverage) δ, the expected utility of this consumer type is given by
Vi(δ, π) = piu(r −d + δ −π) + (1 −pi)u(r −π).
(10.8)
When the consumer purchases no insurance (so π = 0 and δ = 0), expected utility is
Vi(0, 0) = piu(r −d) + (1 −pi)u(r).
(10.9)
It is assumed that the consumer is risk averse, so the utility function, u (·), is concave.
The timing of the actions in the model is described by the following two stages:
• Stage 1
Firms simultaneously choose a menu of insurance contracts Si = (δi, πi)
with contract i intended for consumers of type i.
• Stage 2
Consumers choose their most preferred contract (not necessarily the one
the insurance companies intended for them!).
We now analyze the equilibrium of this insurance market under a number of different
assumptions on information.
10.5.1
Perfect Information Equilibrium
In the perfect information equilibrium the insurance companies are assumed to be able
to observe the type of each consumer; that is, they know exactly the accident probability
of each customer. This case of perfect information is used as a benchmark to isolate
the consequences of the asymmetric information that is soon to be introduced.
Figure 10.3 illustrates the equilibrium with perfect information. The curved lines
are indifference curves—one curve is drawn for each type. The steeper curve is that
of the high-risk. The indifference curves are positively sloped because consumers are
willing to trade off greater coverage for a higher premium. They are concave because
of risk aversion. It is assumed that willingness to pay for extra coverage increases
with the probability of having an accident. This makes the indifference curves of the
high-risk steeper at any point than those of the low-risk so that the indifference curves
satisfy the single-crossing property. Single crossing means that any pair of indifference
curves—one for the low-risk and one for the high-risk—can only cross once. With
full information the insurance companies know the accident probability. They can then

offer contracts that trade off a higher premium for increased coverage at the rate of the
accident probability. That is, low-risk types can be offered any contract {π, δ} satisfying
π = pℓδ, and the high-risk any contract satisfying π = phδ. These equations give the
two straight lines in ﬁgure 10.3. These are the equilibrium contracts that will be offered.
To see this, note that if an insurance company offers a contract that is more generous
(charges a lower premium for the same coverage), this contract must make a loss, and
it will be withdrawn. Conversely, if a less generous contract is offered (so has a higher
premium for the same coverage), other companies will be able to better it without
making a loss. Therefore it will never be chosen.
Given this characterization of the equilibrium contracts, the ﬁnal step is to observe
that when these contracts are available, both types will choose to purchase full insur-
ance coverage. They will choose δ = d and pay the corresponding premium. Hence
the competitive equilibrium when types are observable by the companies is a pair of
insurance contracts S∗
h, S∗
ℓ, where
S∗
h = (d, phd)
(10.10)
and
S∗
ℓ= (d, pℓd),
(10.11)
so there is full coverage and actuarially fair premia are charged. As for any competitive
equilibrium with full (hence symmetric) information, this outcome is Pareto-efﬁcient.

10.5.2
Imperfect Information Equilibrium
Imperfect information is introduced by assuming that the insurance companies cannot
distinguish a low-risk consumer from a high-risk. We also assume that it cannot employ
any methods of investigation to elicit further information. As we will discuss later,
insurance companies routinely do try to obtain further information. The reasons why
they do and the consequences of doing so will become clear once it is understood what
happens if they don’t.
Given these assumptions, the insurance companies cannot offer the contracts that
arose in the full-information competitive equilibrium. The efﬁcient contract for the low-
risk provides any given degree of coverage at a lower premium than the contract for the
high-risk. Hence both types will prefer the contract intended for the low-risk (this is
adverseselectionagain!). Ifoffered, aninsurancecompanywillchargeapremiumbased
on the low-risk accident probability but have to pay claims at the population average
probability. It will therefore make a loss and have to be withdrawn. This argument
suggests what the insurance companies have to do: if they wish to offer a contract that
will attract the low-risk type, the contract must be designed in such a way that it does
not also attract the high-risk. This requirement places constraints on the contracts that
can be offered and is what prevents the attainment of the efﬁcient outcome.
Assume now that insurance companies offer a contract Sh designed for the high-
risk and a contract Sℓdesigned for the low-risk. To formally express the comments
in the previous paragraph, we say that when types are not observable, the contracts
Sh and Sℓhave to satisfy the self-selection (or incentive-compatibility) constraints.
These constraints require the low-risk to ﬁnd that the contract Sℓoffers them at least
as much utility as the contract Sh, with the converse holding for the high-risk. If these
constraints are satisﬁed, the low-risk will choose the contract designed for them, as
will the high-risk. The self-selection constraints can be written as
Vℓ(Sℓ) ≥Vℓ(Sh)
(ICu)
(10.12)
and
Vh(Sh) ≥Vh(Sℓ)
(ICd).
(10.13)
(These are labeled ICu and ICd because the ﬁrst has the low-risk types looking “up” at
the contract of the high-risk, the second has the high-risk looking “down” at the contract
of the low-risk. This becomes clear in ﬁgure 10.4.) As we have already remarked, the
contracts S∗
h, S∗
ℓarising in the full-information equilibrium do not satisfy ICd: the
high-risk will always prefer the low-risk’s contract S∗
ℓ.

Separating contracts
There is only one undominated pair of contracts that achieves the desired separation.
By undominated, we mean that no other pair of separating contracts can be introduced
that makes a positive proﬁt in competition with the undominated contracts. The prop-
erties of the pair are that the high-risk type receives full insurance at an actuarially fair
rate. The low-risk do not receive full insurance. They are restricted to partial coverage,
with the extent of coverage determined by where the indifference curve of the high-risk
crosses the actuarially fair insurance line for the low-risk. In addition the constraint
(10.13) is binding while the constraint (10.12) is not. This feature, that the “good” type
(here the low-risk) are constrained by the “bad” type (here the high-risk), is common
to all incentive problems of this kind.
It can easily be seen that the insurance contracts are undominated by any other pair
of separating contracts and make zero proﬁt for the insurance companies. To see that
no contract can be introduced that will appeal to only one type and yield positive proﬁt,
assume that such a contract was aimed at the high-risk. Then it must be more favorable
than the existing contract; otherwise, it will never be chosen. But the existing contract is
actuarially fair, so any contract that is more favorable must make a loss. Alternatively, a
contract aimed at the low-risk will either attract the high-risk too, and so not separate, or,
if it attracts only low-risk, will be unproﬁtable. There remains, though, the possibility
that a pooling contract can be offered that will attract both types and be proﬁtable.
To see how this can arise, consider ﬁgure 10.5. A pooling contract will appeal to
both types if it lies below the indifference curves attained by the separating contracts
(lower premium and possibly greater coverage). Since the population probability of

an accident occurring is p = λhph + λℓpℓ, an actuarially fair pooling contract {π, δ}
will relate premium and coverage by π = pδ. When λh is large, the pooling contract
will lie close to the actuarially fair contract of the high-risk and hence will be above
the indifference curve attained by the low-risks in the separating equilibrium. In this
case the separating contracts will form an equilibrium. Conversely, when λℓis large,
the pooling contract will lie close to the actuarially fair contract for the low-risk. It will
therefore be below the indifference curves of both types in the separating equilibrium
and, when offered, will attract both low- and high-risk types. When this arises, the
separating contracts cannot constitute an equilibrium, since an insurance company can
offer a contract marginally less favorable than the actuarially fair pooling contract,
attract all consumers, and make a proﬁt.
To summarize, there exists a pair of contracts that separate the population and are
not dominated by any other separating contracts. On the one hand, they constitute an
equilibrium if the proportion of high-risk consumers in the population is sufﬁciently
large (so that the low-risks prefer to separate and choose partial coverage rather than
be pooled with many high-risks and pay a higher premium). On the other hand, if
the proportion of low-risk is sufﬁciently large, there will be a pooling contract that is
preferred by both types and proﬁtable for an insurance company. In this latter case there
can be no separating equilibrium.
By using the same kind of argument, it can be shown that there is no pooling equilib-
rium. Consider a pooling contract S with full coverage and average risk premium. Any

contract S◦= (δ◦, π◦) in the wedge formed by the two indifference curves in ﬁgure
10.6 attracts only low-risks and makes a positive proﬁt. It will therefore be offered and
attract the low-risk away from the pooling contract. Without the low-risk the pooling
contract will make a loss.
In conclusion, there is no pooling equilibrium in this model of the insurance market.
There may be a separating equilibrium, but this depends on the population proportions.
When there is no separating equilibrium, there is no equilibrium at all. Asymmetric
information either causes inefﬁciency by leading to a separating equilibrium in which
the low-risk have too little insurance cover, or it results in there being no equilibrium
at all. In the latter case we cannot predict what the outcome will be.
10.5.3
Government Intervention
Government intervention in this insurance market is limited by the same information
restriction that affects ﬁrms: they cannot tell who is low-risk or high-risk directly but
can only make inferences from observing choices. This has the consequence that it
restricts policy intervention to be based on the same information as that available to
the insurance companies. Even under these restrictions the government can achieve
a Pareto improvement by imposing a cross-subsidy from low-risks to high-risks. It
does this by subsidizing the premium of the high-risk and taxing the premium of the
low-risk. It can do that without observing risk by imposing a minimal coverage for all
at the average risk premium.

Market intervention
The reason why this policy works is that the resulting transfer from the low-risks to
the high-risks relaxes the incentive constraint (ICd). This makes the set of insurance
policies that satisﬁes the constraints larger and so beneﬁts both types. This equilibrium
cannot be achieved by the insurance companies because it would require them all to act
simultaneously. This is an example of a coordination failure that prevents the attainment
of a better outcome.
This policy is illustrated in ﬁgure 10.7. Let the subsidy to the high-risk be given by th
and the tax on the low-risk be tℓ. The tax and subsidy are related to the transfer, t, by the
relationships th =
t
λh and tℓ=
t
λℓ. The premium for the low-risk then becomes pℓ+ tℓ
and for the high-risks ph −th. As ﬁgure 10.7 shows, the high-risks are strictly better
off and the low-risks are as well off as before because higher coverage is now incentive
compatible. The policy intervention has therefore engineered a Pareto improvement.
It should be noted that the government has improved the outcome, even though it has
the same information as the insurance companies. Government achieves this improve-
ment through its ability to coordinate the transfer—something the insurance companies
cannot do.
10.6
Signaling
The fundamental feature at the heart of asymmetric information is the inability to
distinguish the good from the bad. This is to the detriment of both the seller of a good

315
Chapter 10: Asymmetric Information
article, who fails to obtain its true value, and to the purchaser, who would rather pay a
higher price for something that is known to be good. It seems natural that this situation
would be improved if the seller could convey some information that convinces the
purchaser of the quality of the product. For instance, the seller may announce the
names of previous satisﬁed customers (employment references can be interpreted in
this way) or provide an independent guarantee of quality (e.g., a report on the condition
of a car by a motoring organization). Warranties can also serve as signals of quality for
durable goods because, if a product is of higher quality, it is less costly for the seller to
offer a longer warranty. Such information, generally termed signals, can be mutually
beneﬁcial.
It is worth noting the difference between screening and signaling. The less-informed
players (like the insurance companies) use screening (different insurance contracts) to
ﬁnd out what the better-informed players (insurance customer) know (their own risk).
In contrast, more-informed players use signals to help the less-informed players ﬁnd
out the truth.
For a signal to work it must satisfy certain criteria. First, it must be veriﬁable by the
receiver (i.e., the less-informed agent). Being given the name of a satisﬁed customer is
not enough—it must be possible to check back that they are actually satisﬁed. Second,
it must be credible. In the case of an employment reference this is dependent partly on
the author of the reference having a reputation to maintain and partly on the possibility
of legal action if false statements are knowingly made. Finally the signal must also
be costly for the sender (i.e., the better-informed agent) to obtain and the cost must
differ between various qualities of sender. In the case of an employment reference this
is obtained by a record of quality work. Something that is either costlessly obtainable
by both the senders of low- and high-quality or equally costly cannot have any value in
distinguishing between them. We now model such signals and see the effect that they
have on the equilibrium outcome.
The modeling of signaling revolves around the timing of actions. The basic assump-
tion is that the informed agent moves ﬁrst and invests in acquiring a costly signal.
The uninformed party then observes the signals of different agents and forms infer-
ences about quality on the basis of these signals. An equilibrium is reached when the
chosen investment in the signal is optimal for each informed agent and the inferences
of the uninformed about the meaning of signals are justiﬁed by the outcomes. As we
will see, the latter aspect involves self-supporting beliefs: they may be completely
irrational, but the equilibrium they generate does not provide any evidence to falsify
them.

316

10.6.1
Educational Signaling
To illustrate the consequences of signaling, we will consider a model of productivity sig-
naling in the labor market. The model has two identical ﬁrms that compete for workers
through the wages they offer. The set of workers can be divided into two types accord-
ing to their productivity levels. Some of the workers are innately low-productivity in
the form of employment offered by the ﬁrms, while the others are high-productivity.
Without any signaling, the ﬁrms are assumed to be unable to judge the productivity of
a worker.
The ﬁrms cannot directly observe a worker’s type before hiring, but high-productivity
workers can signal their productivity by being educated. Education itself does not alter
productivity, but it is costly to acquire. Firms can observe the level of education of a
potential worker and condition their wage offer on this. Hence education is a signal.
Investment in education will be worthwhile if it earns a higher wage. To make it an
effective signal, it must be assumed that obtaining education is more costly for the low-
productivity than it is for the high-productivity; otherwise, both will have the same
incentive for acquiring it.
Formally, let θh denote the productivity of a high-productivity worker and θℓthat of
a low-productivity worker, with θh > θℓ. The workers are present in the population in
proportions λh and λℓ, so λh + λℓ= 1. The average productivity in the population is
given by
E(θ) = λhθh + λℓθℓ.
(10.14)
Competition between the two ﬁrms ensures that this is the wage that would be paid
if there were no signaling and the ﬁrms could not distinguish between workers. For a
worker of productivity level θ, the cost of obtaining education level e is
C(e, θ) = e
θ ,
(10.15)
which satisﬁes the property that any given level of education is more costly for a
low-productivity worker to obtain.
The ﬁrms offer wages that are (potentially) conditional on the level of education;
“potentially” is added because there may be equilibria in which the ﬁrms ignore the
signal. The wage schedule is denoted by w(e). Given the offered wage schedule, the
workers aim to maximize utility, which is deﬁned as wages less the cost of education.
Hence their decision problem is
max
{e} w (e) −e
θ .

Single-crossing property
As shown in ﬁgure 10.8, the preferences in (10.16) satisfy the single-crossing prop-
erty when deﬁned over wages and education. Here Vℓdenotes an indifference curve
of a low-productivity worker and Vh that of a high-productivity type. At any point the
greater marginal cost of education for the low-productivity type implies that they have
a steeper indifference curve.
An equilibrium for this economy is a pair {e∗(θ), w∗(e)}, where e∗(θ) deter-
mines the level of education as a function of productivity and w∗(e) determines the
wage as a function of education. In equilibrium these functions must satisfy three
properties:
1. No worker wants to change his education choice given the wage schedule w∗(e).
2. No ﬁrm wants to change its wage schedule given its beliefs about worker types and
education choices e∗(θ).
3. Firms have correct beliefs given the education choices.
The ﬁrst candidate for an equilibrium is a separating equilibrium in which low-
and high-productivity workers choose different levels of education. Any separating
equilibrium must satisfy
(i) e∗(θℓ) ̸= e∗(θh),
(ii) w∗(e∗(θℓ)) = θℓ,
w∗(e∗(θh)) = θh,

Condition (i) is the requirement that low- and high-productivity workers choose
different education levels, (ii) that the wages are equal to the marginal products, and
(iii) that the choices are individually rational for the consumers. The values of the wages
given in (ii) are a consequence of signaling and competition between ﬁrms. Signaling
implies workers of different productivities are paid different wages. If a ﬁrm paid a
wage above the marginal product, it would make a loss on each worker employed.
This cannot be proﬁt maximizing. Alternatively, if one ﬁrm paid a wage below the
marginal productivity, the other would have an incentive to set its wage incrementally
higher. This would capture all the workers of that productivity level and would be
the more proﬁtable strategy. Therefore the only equilibrium values for wages when
signaling occurs are the productivity levels. This leaves only the levels of education to
be determined.
The equilibrium level of education for the low-productivity workers is found by
noting that if they choose not to act like the high-productivity, then there is no point in
obtaining any education—education is simply a cost that does not beneﬁt them. Hence
e∗(θℓ) = 0. By this fact and that wages are equal to productivities, the level of educa-
tion for the high-productivity workers can be found from the incentive compatibility
constraints. From (iiia),
θℓ≥θh −e∗(θh)
θℓ
,
(10.17)
or
e∗(θh) ≥θℓ[θh −θℓ].
(10.18)
Condition (10.18) provides the minimum level of education that will ensure that the
low-productivity workers choose not to be educated. Now from (iiib) it follows that
θh −e∗(θh)
θh
≥θℓ,
(10.19)
or
θh[θh −θℓ] ≥e∗(θh).

so the low-productivity workers obtain no education, the high-productivity have edu-
cation somewhere between the two limits and both are paid their marginal products.
An equilibrium satisfying these conditions is illustrated in ﬁgure 10.9.
Since there is a range of possible values for e∗(θh), there is not a unique equi-
librium but a set of equilibria differing in the level of education obtained by the
high-productivity. This set of separating equilibria can be ranked according to criterion
of Pareto-preference. Clearly, changing the level of education e∗(θh) within the speci-
ﬁed range does not affect the low-productivity workers. However, the high-productivity
workers always prefer a lower level of education, since education is costly. Therefore
equilibria with lower e∗(θh) are Pareto-preferred, and the most preferred equilibrium

is that with e∗(θh) = θℓ[θh −θℓ]. The Pareto-dominated separating equilibria are sup-
ported by the high-productivity worker’s fear that choosing less education will give
an unfavorable impression of their productivity to the ﬁrm and thus lead to a lower
wage.
There are arguments (called reﬁnements of equilibrium) to suggest that this most-
preferred equilibrium will actually be the one that emerges. Let the equilibrium level
of education for the high-productivity type, e∗(θh), be above the minimum required to
separate. Denote this minimum e0. Now consider the ﬁrm observing a worker with an
education level at least equal to e0 but less than e∗(θh). What should a ﬁrm conclude
about this worker? Clearly, the worker cannot be low-productivity, since such a choice
is worse for them than choosing no education. Hence the ﬁrm must conclude that
the worker is of high productivity. Realizing this, it then pays the worker to deviate,
since it would reduce the cost of an education. This argument can be repeated until
e∗(θh) is driven down to e0.
Signaling allows the high-productivity to distinguish themselves from the low-
productivity. It might be thought that this improvement in information transmission
would make signaling socially beneﬁcial. However, this need not be the case, since
the act of signaling is costly and does not add to productivity. The alternative to the
signaling equilibrium is pooling where both types purchase no education and are paid a
wage equal to the average productivity. The low-productivity would prefer this equilib-
rium as it raises their wage from θℓto E(θ) = λhθh + λℓθℓ. For the high-productivity
pooling is preferred if
E(θ) = λhθh + λℓθℓ> θh −θℓ[θh −θℓ]
θh
.
(10.23)
Since λℓ= 1 −λh, this inequality will be satisﬁed if
λh > 1 −θℓ
θh
.
(10.24)
Hence, when there are sufﬁciently many high-productivity workers so that the average
wage is close to the high productivity level, the separating equilibrium is Pareto-
dominated by the pooling equilibrium. In these cases signaling is individually rational
but socially unproductive. Again, the Pareto-dominated separating equilibrium is sus-
tained by the high-productivity workers’ fear that lowering their education would give
a bad impression of their ability to the ﬁrms and thus lead to lower wage. Actually the
no-signaling pooling equilibrium is not truly available to the high-productivity workers.

321
Chapter 10: Asymmetric Information
If they get no education, ﬁrms will believe they are low-productivity workers and then
offer a wage of θℓ. So we get the paradoxical situation that high-productivity workers
choose to signal, although they are worse off when signaling.
If the government were to intervene in this economy, it has two basic policy options.
The ﬁrst is to allow signaling to occur but to place an upper limit on the level of
education equal to θℓ[θh −θℓ]. It might choose to do this in those cases where the
pooling equilibrium does not Pareto-dominate the separating equilibrium. There is,
though, one problem with banning signaling and enforcing a pooling equilibrium. The
pooling equilibrium requires the ﬁrms to believe that all workers have the same ability.
If the ﬁrms were to “test” this belief by offering a higher wage for a higher level of
education, they would discover that the belief was incorrect. This is illustrated in ﬁgure
10.10. A low-productivity worker would be better off getting no education than getting
education above e∗whatever the ﬁrm’s belief and the resulting wage. Therefore the
ﬁrm should believe that any worker choosing an education level above e∗has high
productivity and should be offered a wage θh. But, if this is so, the high-productivity
worker could do better than the pooling equilibrium by deviating to an education level
slightly in excess of e∗to get a wage θh. Therefore the pooling equilibrium is unlikely,
since it involves unreasonable beliefs from the ﬁrms.
10.6.2
Implications
The model of educational signaling shows how an unproductive but costly signal can
be used to distinguish between quality levels through a set of self-supporting beliefs.
There will be a set of Pareto-ranked equilibria with the lowest level of signal the
most preferred. Although there is an argument that the economy must achieve the
Pareto-dominating signaling equilibrium, it is possible that this may not happen. If
it does not, the economy may become settled in a Pareto-inferior separating equilib-
rium. Even if this does not happen, it is still possible for the pooling equilibrium to
Pareto-dominate the separating equilibrium. This will occur when the high-productivity
workers are relatively numerous in the population, since in that case almost every
worker is getting unproductive but costly education to separate themselves from the
few bad workers.
There are several policy implications of these results. In a narrow interpretation,
they show how the government can increase efﬁciency and make everyone better off
by restricting the size of signals that can be transmitted. Alternatively, the government
could improve the welfare of everyone by organizing a cross-subsidy from the good to

322
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
the bad workers. This can take the form of a minimum wage for the low-productivity
workers in excess of their productivity ﬁnanced by wage limit for the high-productivity
workers that is below their productivity. Notice that a ban on signaling is an extreme
form of such cross-subsidization, since it forces the same wage for all. When the pooling
equilibrium is Pareto-preferred, signals should be eliminated entirely. More generally,
the model demonstrates how market solutions may endogenously arise to combat the
problems of asymmetric information. These solutions can never remove the problems
entirely—someone must be bearing the cost of improving information ﬂows—and can
even exacerbate the situation.
The basic problem for the government in responding to these kinds of problems is that
it does not have a natural informational advantage over the private agents. In the model
of education there is no reason to suppose that the government is any more able to tell
the low-productivity workers from the high-productivity (in fact there is every reason
to suspect that the ﬁrms would be better equipped to do this). Faced with these kinds
of problems, the government would have little to offer beyond the cross-subsidization
we have just mentioned.

10.7
Moral Hazard (Hidden Action)
A moral hazard problem arises when an agent can affect the “quality” of a traded good
or contract variable by some action that is not observed by other agents. For instance, a
houseowner once insured may become lax in her attention to security, such as leaving
windows open, in the knowledge that if burgled she will be fully compensated. Or a
worker, once in employment, may not fully exert himself, reasoning that his lack of
effort may be hidden among the effort of the workforce as a whole. Such possibilities
provide the motive for contracts to be designed that embody incentives to lessen these
effects.
In the case of the worker, the employment contract could provide for a wage that is
dependent on some measure of the worker’s performance. Ideally the measure would
be his exact productivity, but except for the simplest cases, this could be difﬁcult to
measure. Difﬁculties can arise because production takes place in teams (a production
line can often be interpreted as a team) with the effort of the individual team member
impossible to distinguish from the output of the team as a whole. They can also arise
through randomness in the relation between effort and output. As examples, agricul-
tural output is driven by the weather, maintenance tasks can depend on the (variable)
condition of the item being maintained, and production can be dependent on the random
quality of other inputs.
We now consider the design of incentive schemes in a situation with moral hazard.
The model we choose embodies the major points of the previous discussion: effort
cannot be measured directly, so a contract has to be based on some observable variable
that roughly measures effort.
10.7.1
Moral Hazard in Insurance
The moral hazard problem that can arise in an insurance market is that effort on acci-
dent prevention is reduced when consumers become insured. If accident-prevention
effort is costly, for instance, driving more slowly is time-consuming or eating a
good diet is less enjoyable, then a rational consumer will seek to reduce such ef-
fort when it is beneﬁcial to do so (and the beneﬁts are raised once insurance is
offered). Insurance companies must counteract this tendency through the design of their
contracts.
To model this situation, assume an economy populated by many identical agents.
The income of an agent is equal to r with probability 1 −p and r −d with probability

324
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
p. Here p is interpreted as the probability of an accident occurring and d the mon-
etary equivalent of the accident damage. Moral hazard is introduced by assuming
that the agents are able to affect the accident probability through their prevention
efforts.
To simplify, it is assumed that effort, e, can take one of two values. If e = 0, an agent
is making no effort at accident prevention and the probability of an accident is p(0).
Alternatively, if e = 1, the agent is making maximum effort at accident prevention and
the probability is p(1). In line with these interpretations, it is assumed that p(0) > p(1),
so the probability of the accident is higher when no effort is undertaken. The cost of
effort for the agents, measured in utility terms, is c(e) ≡ce.
In the absence of insurance, the preferences of the agent are described by the expected
utility function
Uo(e) = p(e)u(r −d) + (1 −p(e)))u(r) −ce,
(10.25)
where u(r −d) is the utility if there is an accident and u(r) is the utility if there is
no accident. It is assumed that the agent is risk averse, so the utility function u (·) is
concave.
The value of e, either 0 or 1, is chosen to maximize this utility. Effort to prevent the
accident will be undertaken (e = 1) if
Uo(1) > Uo(0).
(10.26)
Evaluating the utilities and rearranging shows that e = 1 if
c ≤c0 ≡[p(0) −p(1)] [u(r) −u(r −d)] .
(10.27)
Here c0 is the critical value of effort cost. If effort cost is below this value, effort will be
undertaken. Therefore, in the absence of insurance, effort will be undertaken to prevent
accidents if the cost of doing so is sufﬁciently small.
Consider now the introduction of insurance contracts. A contract consists of a pre-
mium π paid by the consumer and an indemnity δ, δ ≤d, paid to the consumer if
they are subject to an accident. The consumer’s preferences over insurance policies
(meaning different combinations of π and δ) and effort are given by
U(e, δ, π) ≡p(e) u (r −π + δ −d) + [1 −p(e)] u(r −π) −ce,
(10.28)
with U(e, 0, 0) = Uo(e).

10.7.2
Effort Observable
To provide a benchmark with which to measure the effects of moral hazard, we ﬁrst
analyze the choice of insurance contract when effort is observable by the insurance
companies. In this case there can be no efﬁciency loss, since there is no asymmetry of
information.
If the insurance company can observe e, it will offer an insurance contract that is
conditional on effort choice. The contract will therefore be of the form {δ(e) , π(e)} ,
with e = 0, 1. Competition among the insurance companies ensures that the contracts
on offer maximize the utility of a representative consumer subject to constraint that the
insurance companies at least break even. To meet this latter requirement the premium
must be no lower than the expected payment of indemnity. For a given e (recall this is
observed) the policy therefore solves
max
{δ,π} U(e, δ, π)
subject to
π ≥p(e) δ.
(10.29)
The solution to this is a policy

δ∗(e) = d, π∗(e) = p(e)d

,
(10.30)
so that the damage is fully covered and the premium is fair given the effort level chosen.
This is illustrated in ﬁgure 10.11. The straight line is the set of contracts that are fair (so
π = p(e) δ), and I is the highest indifference curve that can be achieved given these
contracts. (Note that utility increases with a lower premium and greater coverage.) The
ﬁrst-best contract is therefore full insurance with δ∗(e) = d and π∗(e) = p(e)d.
At the ﬁrst-best contract, the resulting utility level is
U∗(e) = u (r −p(e)d) −ce.
(10.31)
Effort will be undertaken (e = 1) if
U∗(1) ≥U∗(0) ,
(10.32)
which holds if
c ≤c1 ≡u(r −p(1) d) −u (r −p(0) d).
(10.33)
That is, the cost of effort is less than the utility gain resulting from the lower premium.
An interesting question is whether the ﬁrst-best contract encourages the supply of
effort, in other words, whether the level of effort cost below which effort is supplied in
the absence of the contract, c0, is less than that with the contract, c1. Calculations show

326
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
that the outcome may go in either direction depending on the accident probabilities
associated with effort and no effort.
10.7.3
Effort Unobservable
When effort is unobservable, the insurance companies cannot condition the contract on
it. Instead, they must evaluate the effect of the policies on the choices of the consumers
and choose the policy taking this into account.
The preferences of the consumer over contracts are determined by the highest level of
utility they can achieve with that contract, given that they have made the optimal choice
of effort. Formally, the utility V(δ, π) arising from contract (δ, π) is determined by
V(δ, π) ≡max
{e=0,1} U(e, δ, π).
(10.34)
The basic analytical difﬁculty in undertaking the determination of the contract is the
nonconvexity of preferences in the contract space (δ, π). This nonconvexity arises at
the point in the contract space where the consumers switch from no effort (e = 0)
to full effort (e = 1). When supplying no effort their preferences are determined
by U(0, δ, π) and when they supply effort by U(1, δ, π). At any point (ˆδ, ˆπ) where
U(0, ˆδ, ˆπ) = U(1, ˆδ, ˆπ), the indifference curve of U(0, ˆδ, ˆπ) is steeper than that of
U(1, ˆδ, ˆπ) because the willingness to pay for extra coverage is higher when there is no

effort and thus a high risk of accident. This is illustrated in ﬁgure 10.12, where δ∗(π)
denotes the locus of points where the consumer is indifferent to e = 0 and e = 1.
This locus separates those who make effort from those who make no effort. For each
premium π, there is an indemnity level δ∗(π) such that if δ < δ∗(π), then e = 1, but
if δ ≥δ∗(π), then e = 0. This indemnity level rises with the premium, so δ∗(π) is an
increasing function of π. In words, if the coverage rate for any given premium is too
high, agents will no longer ﬁnd proﬁtable to undertake effort.
10.7.4
Second-Best Contract
The second-best contract maximizes the consumer’s utility subject to the constraint that
it must at least break even. The optimization problem describing this can be written as
that of maximizing V(δ, π) subject to the constraints that
(i) π ≥p (1) δ
for δ < δ∗(π),
(ii) π ≥p (0) δ
for δ∗(π) ≤δ < d.
The ﬁrst constraint applies if the consumer chooses to supply effort (e = 1) and
requires that the contract break even. The second constraint is the break even condition
if the consumer chooses to supply no effort (e = 0).

Second-best contract
The problem is solved by calculating the solution under the ﬁrst constraint and
evaluating the resulting level of utility. Then the solution is found under the second
constraint and utility is evaluated again. The two levels of utility are then compared, and
the one yielding the highest utility is the optimal second-best contract. This reasoning
provides two contracts that are candidates for optimality. These are illustrated in ﬁgure
10.13 by E0 and E1 and have the following properties:
Contract E0
No effort and full coverage at high price;
Contract E1
Effort and partial coverage at low price.
Which of these contracts is optimal will depend on the cost, c, of effort. When
this cost is low, contract E1 will be optimal and partial coverage will be offered to
consumers. Conversely, when the cost is high, then it will be optimal to have no effort
and contract E0 will be optimal. By this reasoning, it follows that there must be some
value of the cost of effort at which the switch is made between E0 and E1. Hence there
exists a value of effort, c2, with c2 < c1, such that c ≤c2 implies that the second-best
contract is E1 and c > c2 implies that the second-best contract is E0.
It can now be shown that the second-best contract is inefﬁcient. Since the critical
level of cost, c, determining when effort is supplied satisﬁes c < c1, the outcome
has to be inefﬁcient relative to the ﬁrst-best. Furthermore there is too little effort if
c2 < c < c1 and too little coverage if c < c2. These results are summarized in
table 10.1.

Government Intervention
The market failure associated with moral hazard is very profound. The moral hazard
problem arises from the nonobservability of the level of care. When individuals are fully
insured they tend to exert too little precaution but also over-use insurance. Consider, for
instance, a patient who may be either sick with probability 0.09 or very sick with proba-
bility 0.01. In the two events his medical expenses will be $1,000 and $10,000. At a fair
premium of $190 the patient will not have to pay anything if he gets sick and would buy
such insurance if risk averse. But then suppose that when he is a little sick, there is some
chance, however small, that he can be very sick. Then he would choose the expensive
treatment given that there is no extra cost to the patient and all the extra cost is borne
by the insurance company. Each individual ignores the effect of his reckless behavior
and overconsumption on the premium, but when they all act like that, the premium
increases. The lack of care by each inﬂates the premium, which generates a negative
externality on others. An important implication is that the market cannot be efﬁcient.
Another way to see this generic market inefﬁciency is that the provision of insurance
in the presence of moral hazard causes the insured individual to receive less than the
full social beneﬁt of his care. As a result not only will the individual expend less than
the socially optimal level of care but also there will be an insurance-induced externality.
This implies that the potential scope for government intervention with moral hazard is
substantial. Can the government improve efﬁciency by intervention when moral hazard
is present? In answering this question, it is important to specify what information is
available to the government. For a fair evaluation of government intervention, it is
natural to assume that the government has the same information as the private sector.
In this case it can be argued that efﬁcient government intervention is still possible. The
beneﬁcial effects of government intervention stem from the government’s capacity to
tax and subsidize. For example, the government cannot monitor smoking, which has
an adverse effect on health, any better than an insurance company. But the government
can impose taxes, not only on cigarettes but also on commodities that are complements
and subsidize substitutes that have a less adverse effect. Also the taxation of insurance

330
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
induces ﬁrms to offer insurance at less than fair price. As a consequence individuals
buy less insurance and expend more effort (as efﬁciency requires).
10.8
Public Provision of Health Care
10.8.1
Efﬁciency
Economists do not expect the private market for health care insurance to function
well. Our previous discussion suggests that informational problems result in the private
provision of health insurance having incomplete and inefﬁcient coverage. The existence
of asymmetric information between insurers and insured leads to adverse selection,
which can result in the market breaking down, and the nonexistence of certain types of
insurance. The moral hazard problem can lead to incomplete insurance in the form of
co-payments and deductibles for those who have insurance. Another problem caused
by the presence of moral hazard is that the insured who become sick will want to
overconsume and doctors will want to oversupply health care, since it is a third party
that pays. It is not surprising therefore that the government may usefully intervene in
the provision of health care.
There is strong evidence that in the OECD countries the public sector plays an
important role in the provision of insurance for health care. From OECD health data, in
1994 the proportion of publicly provided health expenses was 44 percent in the United
States, 70 percent in Germany, 73 percent in Italy, 75 percent in France, and 83 percent
in Sweden and the United Kingdom. The question is why the government intervenes
so extensively in the health care ﬁeld. In answering the question, one must bear in
mind that the government faces many of same informational problems as the private
sector. Like a private insurer, it faces the moral hazard of patients who get insurance
exerting too little effort in risk-reducing activities and overconsuming health services,
and doctors having the incentive to oversupply health services at too high a cost.
One advantage of public provision is to prevent the adverse selection problem by
making health coverage compulsory and universal. It is tempting to believe that the
actual provision of insurance need not be public to accomplish this effect. Indeed the
actual provision of health insurance could remain private and the government mandate
that all individuals have to purchase health insurance and private insurers have to insure
anyone who applies for insurance. However, mandates may be difﬁcult to enforce at
the individual level, and the incentive for private ﬁrms to accept only the good risks is
a permanent concern. Another advantage of public provision is that as a predominant

331
Chapter 10: Asymmetric Information
insurer it can exert monopsony power with considerable leverage over health suppliers
in inﬂuencing the prices they set or the amount of services they prescribe.
The fact that private insurance is subject to the problem of moral hazard is less helpful
in explaining government provision. Indeed it is questionable whether the government
has any advantage in dealing with the problem of moral hazard, since it cannot observe
the (hidden) activities of the insured any better than private insurers. One possible form
of advantageous government intervention is the taxing and subsidizing of consumption
choices that inﬂuence the insured’s demand for health care (e.g., a subsidy for health
club membership and taxes on smoking). This argument, as noticed by Prescott and
Townsend (1984), is based on a presumption that the government can monitor these
consumption choices better than the private market; otherwise, private insurers could
condition contracts on their clients’ consumption choices and the government would
have no advantage over the market. So the potential scope for government provision
with moral hazard is seemingly limited.
However, there is a more subtle form of moral hazard that provides a reason for direct
government delivery of health care: the time-consistency problem. Imagine that health
insurance is provided by the private sector only. Each individual must decide how much
insurance to purchase. In a standard insurance situation, risk-averse individuals would
fully insure if they could get a fair price. However, in this case they may recognize that
if they do not fully insure, a welfaristic government will provide for them should they
become ill and uninsured. They have thus an incentive to buy too little insurance and to
rely on the government to ﬁnance their health care when they become sick. This phe-
nomenon is called the Samaritan’s dilemma, and it implies that people will underinvest
resources available in the present, knowing that the truly welfaristic government will
come to their rescue in the future. The problem is particularly acute for life-threatening
diseases where denial of insurance is tantamount to a death sentence for the patient.
Asimilar time-consistency problem arises on the insurer’s side: insurance companies
cannotcommittoguaranteeingthattheratechargedforinsurancewillnotchangeasthey
discover progressively more about the health conditions of their clients. Competition
will force insurance companies to update their rate to reﬂect any new information about
an individual’s medical condition. Insurance could then become so expensive for some
individuals that they could not afford it. With recent advances in genetic testing and
other long-range diagnoses, this problem of the uninsured is likely to grow in the future.
With no insurance against unfavorable test results or for the denial of insurance when
a policy terminates, those more desperate to get insurance will ﬁnd it increasingly
hard to get it from the private market. The supply- and demand-side time-consistency
problems were explicitly recognized in the United States by President Clinton, and

332
Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
used as a reason to make participation in health insurance compulsory. In response to
the uninsured problem, the government provides a substitute for insurance by directly
funding health care to the poor and long-term sick (Medicaid in the United States).
Another advantage of public provision of insurance is to achieve pooling on a much
larger scale with improved risk-sharing. In including every person in a nationwide
insurance scheme and pooling health insurance with other forms of insurance (unem-
ployment, pension, etc.), public insurance comes closer to the “ideal” optimal insurance
that requires the pooling of all the risks faced by individuals and a single contract
covering them jointly (with a single deductible against all risks).
Both adverse selection and moral hazard have been central in the debates over health
care reform in Europe and North America. Consider, for example, the debate about
medicalsavingsaccounts(MSA)intheUnitedStates. Thesewereintendedtoencourage
people to buy insurance with more deductibles and co-payments, thereby reducing the
risk of moral hazard. But critics argued that they will trigger a process of adverse
selection where those less likely to need medical care will avail themselves of MSA.
So those opting for the MSA with larger deductibles might indeed face higher total
medical costs despite the improved incentives (they take more care), simply because
of the self-selection process. Another response to moral hazard problems in the United
States is the mandatory pre-admission referral by peer review organizations before
hospitalization. The increasing popularity of health maintenance organizations can
also be viewed as a response to moral hazard by attracting cost-conscious patients who
wish to lower the cost of insurance. Finally the increasing use of co-payments in many
countries appears to be the effective method of cost containment.
10.8.2
Redistributive Politics
Government provision not only requires mandatory insurance to eliminate the adverse
selection problem, but it also involves socializing insurance. Once insurance is com-
pulsory and ﬁnanced (at least partly) by taxation, redistributive considerations play
a central role in explaining the extensive public provision of insurance. Government
programs that provide the same amount of public services to all households may still
be redistributive. The amount of redistribution in fact depends on how the programs
are ﬁnanced and how valuable the services are to individuals with different income
levels.
First, a public health care program offering services that are available to all and
ﬁnanced by a proportional income tax will redistribute income from the rich to the
poor. If there is not too much diversity of tastes and if consumption of health care
is independent of income, all those with incomes below the average are subsidized

333
Chapter 10: Asymmetric Information
by those above the average. Given the empirical fact that a majority of voters have
incomes below the average, a majority of voters would approve of public provision.
With diversity of tastes, different individuals prefer different levels of consumption
even when incomes are the same and the “one-size-ﬁts-all” public provision may no
longer be desirable for the majority. So the trade-off is between income redistribution
and preference-matching. However, insofar as consumption of medical care is mostly
the responsibility of doctors, reﬂecting standard medical practices, the preference-
matching concern is likely to be negligible.
The second way that redistribution occurs is from the healthy to the sick (or the
young to the aged). The tax payments of any particular individual do not depend on that
individual’s morbidity. It follows that higher morbidity individuals receive insurance
in the public system that is less expensive than the insurance they would get in the
private market. So, if a taxpayer has either high morbidity or low income, then his tax
price of insurance is lower than the price of private insurance. This taxpayer will vote
for public provision. The negative correlation between morbidity and income suggests
that the majority below average income are also more likely to be in relatively poor
health and so in favor of public insurance.
The third route to redistribution is through opting-out. Universal provision of health
care by the government can redistribute welfare from the rich to the poor because the
rich refuse the public health care and buy higher quality private health services ﬁnanced
by private insurance. For example, individuals may have to wait to receive treatment
in the public system, whereas private treatment is immediate. In opting-out, they lose
the value of the taxes they pay toward public insurance, and the resources available for
those who remain in the public sector increases as the overall pressure on the system
decreases (i.e., the waiting list shortens). So redistribution is taking place because the
rich are more likely to use private health care, even though free public health care is
available. This redistribution will arise even if everyone contributes the same amount
to public health insurance.
Redistribution via health care is also more effective in targeting some needy groups
than redistribution in cash. The majority may wish to redistribute from those who inherit
good health to those who inherit poor health, which can be thought of as a form of social
insurance. If individual health status could be observed, the government would simply
redistribute in cash, and there would be no reason for public health insurance. But,
because it cannot observe an individual’s poor state of health, providing health care in-
kind is a better way to target those individuals. The healthy individuals are less likely
to pretend to be unhealthy when health care is provided in-kind than if government
were to offer cash compensation to everyone claiming to be in poor health. This is the
self-selection beneﬁt of in-kind redistribution.

334

Evidence
Information asymmetries have signiﬁcant implications for the working of competitive
markets and the scope for government intervention. Detailed policy recommendations
for alleviating these problems also differ depending on whether we face the adverse
selection or moral hazard problems. It is crucial to test in different markets the empirical
relevance of adverse selection and moral hazard. Such a test is surprisingly simple in
the insurance market because both adverse selection and moral hazard predict a positive
correlation between the frequency of accident and insurance coverage. This prediction
turnsouttobeverygeneralandtoextendtoavarietyofmoregeneralcontexts(imperfect
competition, multidimensional heterogeneity, etc.).
The key problem is that such correlation can be given two different interpretations
depending on the direction of the causality. Under adverse selection high-risk agents,
knowing they are more likely to have an accident, self-select by choosing more exten-
sive coverage. Alternatively, under moral hazard agents with more extensive coverage
are also less motivated to exert precaution, which may result in higher accident rates.
The difference matters a lot for health insurance if we want to assess the impact of
co-payments and deductibles on consumption and its welfare implications. Indeed
it is a well-documented fact that better coverage is correlated with higher medical
expenses. Deductibles and co-payments are likely to be desirable if moral hazard
is the main reason, since they reduce overconsumption. But, if adverse selection is
the main explanation, then limiting coverage can only reduce the amount of insur-
ance available to risk-averse agents with little welfare gain. Evidence on selection
versus incentives can be tested in a number of ways, and we brieﬂy describe some
of them.
Manning et al. (1987) separate moral hazard from adverse selection by using a ran-
dom experiment in which individuals are exogenously allocated to different contracts.
Between 1974 and 1977 the Rand Health Insurance Experiment randomly assigned
households in the United States to one out of 14 different insurance plans with different
co-insurance rates and upper limits on annual out-of-pocket expenses. Compensation
was paid in order to guarantee that no household would lose by participating in the
experiment. Since individuals were randomly assigned to contracts, any differences in
observed behavior can be interpreted as a response to the different incentive structures
of the contracts. This experiment has provided some of the most interesting and robust
tests of moral hazard and the sensitivity of the consumption of medical services to
out-of-pocket expenditures. The demand for medical services was found to respond

335
Chapter 10: Asymmetric Information
signiﬁcantly to changes in the amount paid by the insuree. The largest decrease in the
use of services arises between a free service and a contract involving a 25 percent
co-payment rate.
Chiappori et al. (1998) exploit a 1993 change in French regulations to which health
insurance companies responded by modifying their coverage rates in a non-uniform
way. Some companies increased the level of deductibles, while others did not. They test
for moral hazard by using groups of patients belonging to different companies who were
confronted with different changes in co-payments and whose use of medical services
was observed before and after the change in regulation. They ﬁnd that the number
of home visits by general practitioners signiﬁcantly decreased for the patients who
experienced the increase in co-payments but not for those whose coverage remained
constant.
Another interesting study is by Cardon and Hendel (2001) who test for moral hazard
versus adverse selection in the US employer-provided health insurance. As argued
before, acontractwithlargerco-paymentsislikelytoinvolvelowerhealthexpenditures,
either because of the incentive effect of co-payments or because the high-risk self-select
by choosing contracts with lower co-payments. The key identifying argument is that
agents do not select their employer on the basis of the health insurance coverage. As
a consequence the differences in behavior across employer plans can be attributed to
incentive effects. They ﬁnd strong evidence that incentives matter.
Another way to circumvent the difﬁculty in empirically distinguishing between ad-
verse selection and moral hazard is to consider the annuity market. The annuity market
provides insurance against the risk of outliving accumulated resources. It is more
valuable to those who expect to live longer. In this market we can safely expect that
individuals will not substantially modify their behavior in response to annuity income
(e.g., exerting more effort to extend length of life). It follows that differential mortality
rates for annuitants who purchase different types of annuities is convincing evidence
that selection occurs. Finkesltein and Poterba (2004) obtain evidence of the following
selection patterns: First, those who buy back-loaded annuities (annuities where pay-
ments increase over time) are longer-lived (controlling for all observables) than other
annuitants, which is consistent with the fact that an annuitant with a longer life ex-
pectancy is more likely to be alive in later years when the back-loaded annuity pays
out more than the ﬂat annuity. Second, those who buy annuities making payments to
the estate are shorter-lived than other annuitants, which is consistent with the fact that
the possibility of payments to a short-lived annuitant.

Conclusions
The efﬁciency of competitive equilibrium is based on the assumption of symmetric
information (or the very strong requirement of perfect information). This chapter has
explored some of the consequences of relaxing this assumption. The basic points are
that asymmetric information leads to inefﬁciency and that the inefﬁciency can take a
number of different forms.
Under certain circumstances appropriate government intervention can make every-
one better off, even though the government does not have better information than the
private sector. The role of the government may also be limited by restrictions on its
information. Welfare and public policy implications of the two main forms of informa-
tion asymmetries are not the same, and it has been an empirical challenge to distinguish
between adverse selection and moral hazard. Health insurance is a good illustration of
the problems that arise and is characterized by extensive public intervention.

is fair insurance?

Should the government allow insurance companies to use genetic testing to better assess the
health status of their applicants? Would this genetic testing help or hurt those who are in bad
health? Would it exacerbate or mitigate the problem of adverse selection in the health insur-
ance market? Would it increase or decrease the number of people without health insurance?
Would it be a good thing?

Are the following statements true or false?

Part III: Departures from Efﬁciency
a. An insurance company must be concerned about the possibility that someone will buy ﬁre
insurance on a building and then set ﬁre to it. This is an example of moral hazard.
b. A life insurance company must be concerned about the possibility that the people who
buy life insurance may tend to be less healthy than those who do not. This is an example of
adverse selection.
c. In a market where there is separating equilibrium, different types of agents make different
choices of actions.
d. Moral hazard refers to the effect of an insurance policy on the incentives of individuals
to exercise care.
e. Adverse selection refers to how the magnitude of the insurance premium affects the types
of individuals that buy insurance.
10.4
Consider each of the following situations involving moral hazard. In each case identify
the principal (uninformed party) and the agent (informed party) and explain why there is
asymmetric information. How does the action described for each situation mitigate the moral
hazard problem?
a. Car insurance companies offer discounts to customers who install anti-theft and speed-
monitoring devices in their cars.
b. The International Monetary Fund conditions lending to developing countries upon the
adoption of a structural adjustment plan.
c. Firms compensate top executives with options to buy company stock at a given price in
the future.
d. Landlords require tenants to pay security deposits.
10.5
Despite the negative stereotype of “women drivers,” women under age of 25 are, on average,
noticeably better drivers than men under 25. Consequently insurance companies have been
willing to offer young women insurance with a discount of 60 percent over what they charge
young men. Similar discrimination applies on the life insurance market given that women
are expected to live longer. Sex-based discrimination for auto and life insurance is extremely
controversial. Many people have argued that sex-based rates constitute unfair discrimination.
After all, some men live longer than some women, and there are some men who are better
drivers than some women. In response, several US states have laws mandating “unisex”
insurance ratings.
a. What are the likely effects of such interference with the market forces?
b. Should the government allow insurance companies to base life insurance rates on sex?
What are the risks for women and for men who were paying very different rates? Who gains
and who loses?
c. Should insurance companies be allowed to base automobile insurance rates on sex, age,
and marital status? What are the consequences of having some groups paying much less than
they would if rates were based on actuarial differences in accident rates across sexes and
ages?
10.6
Consider a community of individuals that have different probabilities of falling ill. Individuals
of type H have a probability of falling ill of pH = 0.6. These individuals form 3

population. Individual of type L, the remaining 1
4 of the population, have a probability of
falling ill of pL = 0.2. Any individual who is ill suffers an income loss of 200.
a. Assume there is symmetric information. What is the actuarially fair premium for the each
group to insure againt illness? What level of coverage will each individual request if offered
insurance at the actuarially fair premium?
b. Assume that there is asymmetric information and ﬁrms cannot distinguish between the
types. The same insurance contract must be offered to all individuals. If the contract is to
earn an expected proﬁt of zero, what premium must be charged?
c. Is it possible for a ﬁrm to offer an alternative contract that is proﬁtable when the contract
in part b is available?

Discuss the argument that paying for human blood has the effect of lowering its average
quality because people who are driven by the proﬁt motive to provide blood are more likely
to be drug addicts, alcoholics, and have serious infectious diseases than are voluntary donors.
10.8
In California many insurance companies charge different rates depending on what part of the
city you live in. Their rationale is that risk factors like theft, vandalism, and trafﬁc congestion
vary greatly from one place to the other. The result is that people who live close to each other,
but in adjacent zip codes, may end up paying very different insurance premia.
a. What would happen to an insurance company that decided to sell insurance at the same
price to all drivers with the same driving records no matter what part of the city they live in?
b. What would happen if the government decides to outlaw geographic rate differentials,
given that the government cannot force private insurance companies to provide insurance
against their will?
10.9
Georgie has a labor income equal to 100. With probability p = 0.25, she will have an accident
during the year and suffer an income loss equal of 60. With probability p = 0.75, she will
have no accident. Georgie decides to purchase insurance contract to cover the loss of income
if she has an accident.
a. What is the actuarially fair premium for the insurance? What level of coverage will Georgie
buy?
Georgie loves extreme sports and fast driving. If insured, she will drive faster and try more
extreme activities. This increases her risk of accident. Let the risk be given by p = 1 −L
80,
where L is the uninsured income loss.
b. Will the contract in part a break even? If the insurance company knows Georgie’s behavior
(the function p = 1 −L
80), what contract will it offer? If the insurance company does not
know her behavior, what contract will break even?

The local government has hired someone to undertake a public project. If the project fails, it
will lose $20,000. If it succeeds, the project will earn $100,000. The employee can choose to
“work” or to “shirk.” If she shirks, the project will fail for sure. If she works, the project will
succeed half of the time but will still fail half of the time. The employee’s utility is $10,000
lower if she works than if she shirks. In addition the employee could earn $10,000 in another
job (where she would shirk). The government is choosing whether to pay the employee a

340

ﬂat wage of $20,000 (no matter how the project turns out) or performance-related pay under
which the employee earns 0 if the project fails and $40,000 if it succeeds.
a. Assuming that both parties are risk neutral, which compensation scheme should the
government use?
b. Do you see any problem with the performance-related pay scheme when the employee is
risk averse?

Use the signaling model presented in section 10.6 to construct an example in which a govern-
ment unaware of workers’ productivities can improve the welfare of everyone compared to
the (best) separating equilibrium by means of a cross-subsidization policy but not by banning
signaling.
10.13
A ﬁrm hires two kinds of workers, alphas and betas. One can’t tell a beta from an alpha by
looking at her, but an alpha will produce $3,000 worth of output per month and a beta will
produce $2,500 worth of output in a month. The ﬁrm decides to distinguish alphas from betas
by making them pass an examination. For each question that they get right on the exam,
alphas have to spend half an hour studying and betas have to spend one hour. A worker will
be paid $3,000 if she gets at least 40 answers right and $2,500 otherwise. For either type, an
hour of studying is as bad as giving up $20 income. What is the equilibrium of this scheme?
10.14
Consider a loan market to ﬁnance investment projects.All projects cost 1.Any project is either
good (with probability ρ) or bad (with probability 1−ρ). Only investors know whether their
project is good or bad. A good project yields proﬁts of π > 0 with probability Pg and no
proﬁt with probability 1 −Pg. A bad project makes proﬁts of π with a lower probability Pb
(with Pb < Pg) and no proﬁt with a higher probability 1 −Pb. Banks are competitive and
risk neutral, which implies that banks offer loan contracts making expected proﬁts of zero.
A loan contract speciﬁes a repayment R that is supposed to be repaid to the bank only if the
project makes proﬁt; otherwise, the investor defaults on her loan contract. The opportunity
cost of funds to the bank is r > 0. Suppose
Pg −(1 + r) > 0 > Pb −(1 + r).
a. Find the equilibrium level of R and the set of projects ﬁnanced. How does this depend on
Pg, Pb, ρ, π, and r?
b. Now suppose that the investor can signal the quality of her project by self-ﬁnancing a
fraction of the project. The opportunity cost of funds to the investor is s (with s > r implying
a costly signal). Describe the investor’s payoff as a function of the type of her project, the
loan repayment R and her self-ﬁnancing rate. Derive the indifference curve for each type of
investor in the (s, R) space. Show that the single-crossing property holds.
c. What is the best separating equilibrium of the signaling game where the investor ﬁrst
chooses s and banks then respond by a repayment schedule R(s)? How does the self-ﬁnancing
rate of good projects change with small changes of Pg, Pb, ρ, π, and r?
d. Compare this (best) separating equilibrium with part a.

(Akerlof) Consider the following market for used cars. There are many sellers of used cars.
Each sellers has exactly one used car to sell and is characterized by the quality of the used
car he wishes to sell. Let θ, 0 ≤θ ≤1, index the quality of a used car, and suppose that θ

341
Chapter 10: Asymmetric Information
is uniformly distributed on the interval [0, 1]. If a seller of type θ sells his car at price p, his
utility is us(p, θ). With no sale his utility is 0. Buyers receive utility θ −p if they buy a car
of quality θ at price p, and receive utility 0 if they do not purchase. The quality of the car is
only known to sellers, and there are enough cars to supply all potential buyers.
a. Explain why the competitive equilibrium outcome under asymmetric information requires
that the average quality of cars that are put for sale conditional on price is just equal to price,
E(θ| p) = p. Describe the equilibrium outcome in words. In particular, describe which cars
are traded in equilibrium.
b. Show that if us(p, θ) = p −θ
2 , then every price 0 < p ≤1
2 is an equilibrium price.
c. Find the equilibrium price when us(p, θ) = p −

θ.
d. How many equilibrium prices are there when us(p, θ) = p −θ3?
e. Which (if any) of the preceding outcomes are Pareto-efﬁcient? Describe Pareto improve-
ments whenever possible.

It is known that some fraction d of all new cars are defective. Defective cars cannot be
identiﬁed as such except by those who own them. Each consumer is risk neutral and values
a nondefective car at $16,000. New cars sell for $14,000 each, and used ones for $2,000. If
cars do not depreciate physically with use, what is the proportion d of defective new cars?
10.17
In the preceding question, assume that new cars sell for $18,000 and used cars sell for $2,000.
If there is no depreciation and risk-neutral consumers know that 20 percent of all new cars
are defective, how much do the consumers value a nondefective car?
10.18
There are two types of jobs in the economy, good and bad, and two types of workers, qualiﬁed
and unqualiﬁed. The population consists of 60 percent qualiﬁed and 40 percent unqualiﬁed.
In a bad job, either type of worker produces the same 10 units of output. In a good job, a
qualiﬁed worker produces 100 and an unqualiﬁed worker produces 0. There are numerous
job openings of each type, and companies must pay for each type of job what they expect the
appointee to produce. The worker’s type is unknown before hiring, but the qualiﬁed workers
can signal their type (e.g., by getting educated or some other means). The cost of signaling
to level s for a qualiﬁed worker is s2
2 and for an unqualiﬁed worker is s2. The signaling costs
are measured in the same units as output, and s must be an integer (e.g., number of years of
education).
a. What is the minimum level of s that will achieve separation?
b. Suppose that the signal is no longer available. Which kinds of job will be ﬁlled by which
types of workers, and at what wages? Who gains and who loses?

a. Let ai denote the value of annuities bought by individual i and qi the return on annuities.

The design of the health care system involves issues of information at several points. The
potential users (patients) are better informed about their own state of health and lifestyle than
insurance companies. The health providers (doctors and hospitals) know more about what
patients need than do either the patients themselves or the insurance companies. Providers
also know more about their own skills and efforts. Insurance companies have statistical
information about outcomes of treatments and surgical procedures from past records. The
drug companies know more about the efﬁcacy of drugs than do others. As is usual, the parties
have different interests, so they do not have a natural inclination to share their information
fully or accurately with others.
a. From this perspective, consider the relative merits of the following payments schemes:
i. A fee for service versus capitation fees to doctors.
ii. Comprehensive premiums per year versus payment for each visit for patients.
b. Which payments schemes are likely to be most beneﬁcial to the patients and which to the
providers?
c. What are the relative merits of private insurance compared to coverage of costs from
general tax revenues?

Voting
11.1
Introduction
Voting is the most commonly employed method of resolving a diversity of views or
eliciting expressions of preference. It is used to determine the outcome of elections from
local to supra-national level. Within organizations, voting determines who is elected
to committees, and it governs the decision-making of those committees. Voting is a
universal tool that is encountered in all spheres of life. The prevalence of voting, its use
in electing governments, and its use by those governments elected to reach decisions,
is the basis for the considerable interest in the properties of voting.
The natural question to ask of voting is whether it is a good method of making
decisions. There are two major properties to look for in a good method. First is the
success or failure of the method in achieving a clear-cut decision. Second is the issue of
whether voting always produces an outcome that is efﬁcient. Voting would be of limited
value if it frequently left the choice of outcome unresolved or led to a choice that was
clearly inferior to other alternatives. Whether voting satisﬁes these properties is shown
to be somewhat dependent on the precise method of voting adopted. Ordinary majority
voting is very familiar, but it is only one among a number of ways of voting. Several of
these methods of voting will be introduced and analyzed alongside the standard form
of majority voting.
11.2
Stability
Voting is an example of collective choice—the process by which a group (or collective)
reaches a decision. A major issue of collective choice is stability. By stability, we mean
the tendency of the decision-making process to eventually reach a settled conclusion,
and not to keep jumping around between alternatives. We begin this chapter by a
simple illustration of the central fact that when you have a large group of people, with
conﬂicting preferences, stability in matching preferences is not guaranteed.
The example involves three married couples living as neighbors on a remote island.
Initially the couples are comprised of Alil and Alice, Bob and Beth, and Carl and
Carol. We assume that each husband has his own preference list of the women as
potential wives and each wife has a list of preferences among husbands, each ranking
partners from best to worst. We also make the assumption that the top preference for

any given wife may or may not be her own husband, and similarly for the men. To
avoid untenable frustrations developing, the island society introduces a rule that if two
people prefer each other to their existing partners, they can re-form as a new couple.
For example, if Alil prefers Beth to his own wife, Alice, and Beth prefers Alil to her
own husband, Bob, then Alil can join Beth, leaving Bob and Alice to console each
other. (It is forbidden on this island to live alone or to form a couple with someone of
the same sex.)
Now consider the lists of preferences for the participants given in table 11.1. It
follows from these preferences that Beth will join Alil (she prefers him to Bob, and
Alil prefers her to Alice), then she will continue her ascension to Carl (who prefers her
to Carol, while he is her ﬁrst choice). By then Alice has been left with Bob, her worst
choice, so she will go to Carl, and ﬁnally back to Alil, her favorite. In every case the
leaving male is also improving his own position. But now the end result is that this
round of spouse trading leaves us back exactly with the initial situation, so the cycle
can begin again, and go on forever. The attempt to prevent frustration has lead to an
unstable society.
In the example a situation was shown where stability could not be achieved. One
argument for wanting stability is that it describes a settled outcome in which a ﬁnal
decision has been reached without further renegotiation. If the process of changing
position is costly, as it would be in our example, then stability would be beneﬁcial. It
can also be argued that there are circumstances where stability is not desirable. Consider
the extreme case where each man is married to his ﬁrst choice but each husband is at the
bottom of his wife’s preference list. This would be a stable outcome because no man
would be interested in switching and no wife would be able to switch either because
she would ﬁnd no man who prefers her. So the society is stable but not necessarily at
a desirable state, since the stability is forcing some of the participants to remain with
unwanted choices.

Impossibility
Determining the preferences of an individual is just a matter of accepting that an indi-
vidual’s judgment cannot be open to dispute. In contrast, determining the preferences
of a group of people is not a simple matter. And that is what social choice theory (in-
cluding voting as one particular method) is all about. Social choice takes a given set of
individual preferences and tries to aggregate them into a social preference.
The central result of the theory of social choice, Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem,
says that there is no way to devise a collective decision-making process that satisﬁes a
few commonsense requirements and works in all circumstances. If there are only two
options, majority voting works just ﬁne, but with more than two we can get into trouble.
Despite all the talk about the “will of the people,” it is not easy—in fact the theorem
proves it impossible—to always determine what that will is. This is the remarkable fact
of Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem.
Before presenting the theorem, a taste of it can be obtained with the simplest case of
three voters with the (conﬂicting) rankings over three options shown in table 11.2. Every
voter has transitive preferences over the three options. For example, voter 1 prefers a
to b to c, and therefore a to c. As individuals, the voters are entirely self-consistent in
their preferences.
Now suppose that we use majority rule to select one of these options. We see that
two out of three voters prefer a to b, while two out of three prefer b to c, and two out of
three prefer c to a. At the collective level there is a cycle in preference and no decision
is possible. We say that such collective preferences are intransitive, meaning that the
preference for a over b and for b over c does not imply that a is preferred to c. As
the example shows, intransitivity of group preferences can arise even when individ-
ual preferences are transitive. This generation of social intransitivity from individual
transitivity is called the Condorcet paradox.

Part IV: Political Economy
The general problem addressed by Arrow in 1951 was to seek a way of aggregating
individual rankings over options into a collective ranking. In doing so, difﬁculties
such as the Condorcet paradox had to be avoided. Arrow’s approach was to start
from a set of requirements that a collective ranking must satisfy and then consider
if any ranking could be found that met them all. These conditions are now listed and
explained.
Condition I (Independence of irrelevant alternatives)
Adding new options should
not affect the initial ranking of the old options, so the collective ranking over the old
options should be unchanged.
For example, suppose that a group prefers option A to option C, and the new option
B is introduced. Wherever it ﬁts into each individual’s ranking, condition I requires
that the group preference should not switch to C over A. They may like or dislike the
new option B, but their relative preferences for other options should not change. If
this condition were not imposed on collective decision-making, any decision could be
invalidated by bringing in new irrelevant (inferior) options. Since it is always possible
to add new options, no decision would ever be made.
Condition N (Nondictatorship)
The collective preference should not be determined
by the preferences of one individual.
This is the weakest equity requirement. Having a dictatorship as a collective deci-
sion process may solve transitivity problems, but it is manifestly unfair to the other
individuals. Any conception of democracy aspires to some form of equity among all
the voters.
Condition P (Pareto criterion)
If everybody agrees on the ranking of all the possible
options, so should the group; the collective ranking should coincide with the common
individual ranking.
The Pareto condition requires that unanimity should prevail where it arises. It is
hardly possible to argue with this condition.
Condition U (Unrestricted domain)
The collective choice method should accommo-
date any possible individual ranking of options.

349
Chapter 11: Voting
This is the requirement that the collective choice method should work in all circum-
stances so that the method is not constructed in such a way as to rule out (arbitrarily),
or fail to work on, some possible individual rankings of alternatives.
Condition T (Transitivity)
If the group prefers A to B and B to C, then the group
cannot prefer C to A.
This is merely a consistency requirement that ensures that a choice can always be
made from any set of alternatives. The Condorcet paradox shows that majority voting
fails to meet this condition and can lead to cycles in collective preference.
That is it, and one can hardly disagree with any of these requirements. Each one seems
highly reasonable taken individually. Yet the remarkable result that Arrow discovered
is that there is no way to devise a collective choice method that satisﬁes them all
simultaneously.
Theorem 11.1 (Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem)
When choosing among more than
two options, there exists no collective decision-making process that satisﬁes the
conditions I, N, P, U, T.
The proof is slightly, rather than very, complicated and is quite formal. We will not
reproduce it here. The intuition underlying the proof is clear enough and follows this
reasoning:
1. The unrestricted domain condition allows for preferences such that no option is
unanimously preferred.
2. The independence of irrelevant alternatives forces the social ranking over any two
options to be based exclusively on the individual preferences over those two options
only.
3. From the Condorcet paradox we know that a cycle can emerge from three successive
pairwise comparisons.
4. The transitivity requirement forces a choice among the three options.
5. The only method for deciding must give one individual all the power, thus con-
tradicting the nondictatorship requirement.
The implication of Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem is that any search for a “perfect”
method of collective decision-making is doomed to failure. Whatever process is de-
vised, a situation can be constructed in which it will fail to deliver an outcome that

350
Part IV: Political Economy
satisﬁes one or more of the conditions I, N, P, U, T. As a consequence all collective
decision-making must make the most of imperfect decision rules.
11.4
Majority Rule
In any situation involving only two options, majority rule simply requires that the
option with the majority of votes is chosen. Unless unanimity is possible, asking that
the few give way to the many is a very natural alternative to dictatorship. The process
of majority voting is now placed into context and its implications determined.
11.4.1
May’s Theorem
Nondictatorship is a very weak interpretation of the principles of democracy. A widely
held view is that democracy should treat all the voters in the same way. This symmetry
requirement is called Anonymity. It requires that permuting the names of any two
individuals does not change the group preference. Thus Anonymity implies that there
cannot be any dictator. Another natural symmetry requirement is that the collective
decision-making process should treat all possible options alike. No apparent bias in
favor of one option should be introduced. This symmetric treatment of the various
options is called Neutrality.
Now a fundamental result due to May is that majority rule is the obvious way
to implement these principles of democracy (Anonymity and Neutrality) in social
decision-making when only two options are considered at a time. The theorem as-
serts that majority rule is the unique way of doing so if the conditions of Decisiveness
(i.e., the social decision rule must pick a winner) and Positive Responsiveness (i.e.,
increasing the vote for the winning option should not lead to the declaration of another
option the winner) are also imposed.
Theorem 11.2 (May’s theorem)
When choosing among only two options, there is
only one collective decision-making process that satisﬁes the requirements of Ano-
nymity, Neutrality, Decisiveness, and Positive Responsiveness. This process is majority
rule.
Simple majority rule is the best social choice procedure if we consider only two
options at a time. Doing so is not at all unusual in the real world. For instance, when
a vote is called in a legislative assembly, there are usually only two possible options:

351
Chapter 11: Voting
to approve or to reject some speciﬁc proposal that is on the ﬂoor. Also, in a situation of
two-party political competition, voters again face a binary choice. Therefore interest
in other procedures arises only when there are more than two options to consider.
11.4.2
Condorcet Winner
When there are only two options, majority rule is a simple and compelling method for
social choice. When there are more than two options to be considered at any time, we
can still apply the principle of majority voting by using binary agendas that allow us to
reduce the problem of choosing among many options to a sequence of votes over two
alternatives at a time.
Forexample, onesimplebinaryagendaforchoosingamongthethreeoptions {a, b, c}
in the Condorcet paradox is as follows. First, there is a vote on a against b. Then,
the winner of this ﬁrst vote is opposed to c. The winner of this second vote is the
chosen option. The most famous pairwise voting method is the Condorcet method. This
consists of a complete round-robin of majority votes, opposing each option against all
of the others. The option that defeats all others in pairwise majority voting is called a
Condorcet winner, after Condorcet suggested that such an option should be declared
the winner. That is, using the symbol ≻to denote majority preference, a Condorcet
winner is an option x such that x ≻y for every other option y in the set of possible
options X.
The problem is that the existence of a Condorcet winner requires very special con-
ﬁgurations of individual preferences. For instance, with the preferences given in the
Condorcet paradox, there is no Condorcet winner. So a natural question to ask is under
what conditions a Condorcet winner does exist.
11.4.3
Median Voter Theorems
When the policy space is one-dimensional, sufﬁcient (but not necessary) conditions
for the existence of a Condorcet winner are given by the Median Voter Theorems.
One version of these theorems refers to single-peaked preferences, while the other
version refers to single-crossing preferences. The two conditions of single-peaked and
single-crossing preferences are logically independent, but both conditions give the
same conclusion that the median position is a Condorcet winner.
For an example of single-peaked preferences, consider ﬁgure 11.1 depicting a pop-
ulation of consumers who are located at equally spaced positions along a straight road.

Location of households
A bus stop is to be located somewhere on this road. It is assumed that all consumers
prefer the stop to be located as close as possible to their own homes. If the location
of the bus stop is to be determined by majority voting (taking pairwise comparisons
again), which location will be chosen?
When there is an odd number of houseowners, the answer to this question is clear-
cut. Given any pair of alternatives, a household will vote for that which is closest to
its location. The location that is the closest choice for the largest number of voters will
receive a majority of votes.
Now consider a voting process in which votes are taken over every possible pair of
alternatives. This is very much in the form of a thought process rather than a practical
suggestion, since there must be many rounds of voting and the process will rapidly
becomes impractical if there are many alternatives. Putting this difﬁculty aside, it can
easily be seen that this process will lead to the central outcome being the chosen alter-
native. This location wins all votes and is the Condorcet winner. Expressed differently,
the location preferred by the median voter (i.e., the voter in the center) will be chosen.
At least half the population will always vote for this.
This result is the basis of the Median Voter Theorem. When there is an even num-
ber of voters, there is no median voter but the two locations closest to the center
will both beat any other locations in pairwise comparisons. They will tie when they
are directly compared. The chosen location must therefore lie somewhere between
them.
The essential feature that lies behind the reasoning of the example is that each
consumer has single-peaked preferences, and that the decision is one-dimensional.
Preferences are termed single-peaked when there is a single preferred option. Figure
11.2b illustrates preferences that satisfy this condition, whereas those in ﬁgure 11.2a
are not single-peaked. In the bus stop example each consumer most prefers a loca-
tion close to home and ranks the others according to the how close they are to the
ideal. Such preference looks exactly like those in ﬁgure 11.2b. The choice variable is
one-dimensional because it relates to locations along a line.
The ﬁrst general form of the Median Voter Theorem can be stated as follows:

Theorem 11.3 (Median Voter Theorem I: Single-peaked version)
Suppose that there
is an odd number of voters and that the policy space is one-dimensional (so that
the options can be put in a transitive order). If the voters have single-peaked pref-
erences, then the median of the distribution of voters’ preferred options is a Condorcet
winner.
The idea of median voting has also been applied to the analysis of politics. Instead
of considering the line in ﬁgure 11.1 as a geographical identity, view it as a repre-
sentation of the political spectrum running from left to right. The houseowners then
becomes voters and their locations represent political preferences. Let there be two
parties who can choose their location on the line. A location in this sense represents
the manifesto on which they stand. Where will the parties choose to locate? Assume
as above that the voters always vote for the party nearest to their location. Now ﬁx the
location of one party at any point other than the center and consider the choice of the
other. Clearly, if the second party locates next to the ﬁrst party on the side containing
more than half the electorate, it will win a majority of the vote. Realizing this, the ﬁrst
party would not be content with its location. It follows that the only possible equilib-
rium set of locations for the parties is to be side by side at the center of the political
spectrum.
This agglomeration at the center is called Hotelling’s principle of minimal differenti-
ation and has been inﬂuential in political modeling. The reasoning underlying it can be
observed in the move of the Democrats in the United States and the Labor party in the

354
Part IV: Political Economy
United Kingdom to the right in order to crowd out the Republicans and Conservatives
respectively. The result also shows how ideas developed in economics can have useful
applications elsewhere.
Although a powerful result, the Median Voter Theorem does have signiﬁcant draw-
backs. The ﬁrst is that the literal application of the theorem requires that there be an
odd number of voters. This condition ensures that there is a majority in favor of the
median. When there is an even number of voters, there will be a tie in voting over all
locations between the two central voters. The theorem is then silent on which of these
locations will eventually be chosen. In this case, though, there is a median tendency.
The second, and most signiﬁcant drawback, is that the Median Voter Theorem is appli-
cable only when the decision over which voting is taking place has a single dimension.
This point will be investigated in the next section. Before doing that, let us consider
the single-crossing version of the Median Voter Theorem.
The single-crossing version of the Median Voter Theorem assumes not only that the
policy space is transitively ordered, say from left to right (and thus one-dimensional),
but also that the voters can be transitively ordered, say from left to right in the political
spectrum. The interpretation is that voters at the left prefer left options more than
voters at the right. This second assumption is called the single-crossing property of
preferences. Formally,
Deﬁnition 11.1 (Single-crossing property)
For any two voters i and j such that i < j
(voter i is to the left of voter j), and for any two options x and y such that x < y (x is
to the left of y),
(i) if uj(x)> uj(y), then ui(x)> ui(y), and (ii) if ui(y)> ui(x), then uj(y)>uj(x).
Themedianvoterischaracterizedasthemedianindividualonthelefttorightordering
of voters, so that half the voters are to the left of the median voter and the other half is
to the right. Therefore, according to the single-crossing property, for any two options
x and y, with x < y, if the median voter prefers x, then all the voters to the left also
prefer x, and if the median voter prefers y, then all the voters to the right also prefer y.
So there is always a majority of voters who agree with the median voter, and the option
preferred by the median voter is a Condorcet winner.
Theorem 11.4 (Median Voter Theorem II: Single-crossing version)
Suppose that
there is an odd number of voters and that the policy space is one-dimensional (so
that the options can be put in a transitive order). If the preferences of the set of voters
satisfy the single-crossing property, then the preferred option of the median voter is a
Condorcet winner.

Single-crossing without single-peakedness
Single-crossing and single-peakedness are different conditions on preferences. But
both give us the same result that the median voter’s preferred option is a Condorcet
winner. However, there is a subtle difference. With the single-peakedness property, we
refertothemedianofthevoters’preferredoptions, butwiththesingle-crossingproperty,
we refer to the preferred option of the median voter. Notice that single-crossing and
single-peakedness are logically independent as the example in ﬁgure 11.3 illustrates.
The options are ranked left to right along the horizontal axis, and the individual 3 is to
the left of 2 who is to the left of 1. It can be checked that single-crossing holds for any
pair of options but single-peakedness does not hold for individual 2. So one property
may fail to hold when the other is satisﬁed.
An attractive aspect of the Median Voter Theorem is that it does not depend on
the intensity of preferences, and thus no voters have an incentive to misrepresent their
preferences. This implies that honest, or sincere, voting is the best strategy for everyone.
Indeed, for a voter to the left of the median, misrepresenting preference more to the left
does not change the median and therefore the ﬁnal outcome, whereas misrepresenting
preferences more to the right either does nothing or moves the ﬁnal outcome further
away from his preferred outcome. Following the same reasoning, a voter to the right
of the median has no incentive to misrepresent his preferences either way. Last, the
median gets his most-preferred outcome and thus cannot beneﬁt from misrepresenting
his preferences.
Having seen how the Median Voter Theorem leads to a clearly predicted outcome,
we can now inquire whether this outcome is efﬁcient. The chosen outcome reﬂects the

356
Part IV: Political Economy
preferences of the median voter, so the efﬁcient choice will only be made if this is the
most preferred alternative for the median voter. Obviously there is no reason why this
should be the case. Therefore the Median Voter Theorem will not, in general, produce
an efﬁcient choice. In addition, without knowing the precise details, it is not possible to
predict whether majority voting will lead, via the Median Voter Theorem, to a choice
that lies to the left or to the right of the efﬁcient choice.
A further problem with the Median Voter Theorem is its limited applicability. It
always works when policy choices can be reduced to one dimension but only works in
restricted circumstances where there is more than one dimension. We now demonstrate
this point.
11.4.4
Multidimensional Voting
The problem of choosing the location of the bus stop was one-dimensional. A second
dimension could be introduced into this example by extending the vote to determine
both the location of the bus stop and the time at which the bus is to arrive. The im-
portant observation for majority voting is that when this extension is made there is no
longer any implication that single-peaked preferences will lead to a transitive ranking
of alternatives.
This ﬁnding can be illustrated by considering the indifference curves of a consumer
over the two-dimensional space of location and time. To do this, consider location as
the horizontal axis and time as the vertical axis with the origin at the far left of the street
and midnight respectively. The meaning of single-peaked preferences in this situation
is that a consumer has a most-preferred location and any move in a straight line away
from this must lead to a continuous decrease in utility. This is illustrated in ﬁgure 11.4
where xi denotes the most preferred location of i, and the oval around this point is one
of the consumer’s indifference curves.
Using this machinery, it is now possible to show that the Median Voter Theorem
does not apply and majority voting fails to generate a transitive outcome. The three
voters, denoted 1, 2, and 3, have preferred locations x1, x2, and x3. Assume that the
voting is to decide which of these three locations is to be chosen (this is not necessary
for the argument, as will become clear, but it does simplify it). The rankings of the
three consumers of these alternatives in table 11.3 are consistent with the preferences
represented by the ovals in ﬁgure 11.4. Contrasting these to table 11.2, we can see imme-
diately that these are exactly the rankings that generate an intransitive social ordering
through majority voting. Consequently, even though preferences are single-peaked,

the social ordering is intransitive and the Median Voter Theorem fails. Hence the the-
orem does not extend beyond one-dimensional choice problems. It is worth noting
that if voting were carried out on each dimension separately, then voter 1 would be
the median voter on the location dimension and voter 2 would be the median voter
on the time dimension. So the time voting outcome will be given by the projection
of x2 on the vertical axis and the location voting outcome will be given by the pro-
jection of x1on the horizontal axis. The problem with this item-by-item voting is that
it can generate, for some preferences, an inefﬁcient voting outcome. This is the case
when the chosen point lies outside the triangle formed by the voters’blisspoints x1, x2,
and x3.

Part IV: Political Economy
11.4.5
Agenda Manipulation
In a situation where there is no Condorcet winner, the door is opened to agenda manipu-
lation. This is because changing the agenda, meaning the order in which the votes over
pairs of alternatives are taken, can change the voting outcome. Thus the agenda-setter
may have substantial power to inﬂuence the voting outcome. To determine the degree
of the agenda-setter’s power, we must ﬁnd the set of outcomes that can be achieved
through agenda manipulation.
To see how agenda-setting can be effective, suppose that there are three voters with
preferences as in the Condorcet paradox (described in table 11.2). Then there is a
majority (voters 1 and 2) who prefer a over b, there is a majority (voters 2 and 3) who
prefer c over a, and there is a majority (voters 1 and 3) who prefer b over c. Given
these voters’ preferences, what will be the outcome of different binary agendas? The
answer is that when voters vote sincerely, then it is possible to set the agenda so that
any of the three options can be the ultimate winner. For example, to obtain option a
as the ﬁnal outcome, it sufﬁces to ﬁrst oppose b against c ( knowing that b will defeat
c) and then at the second stage to oppose the winner b against a ( knowing that a will
defeat b). Similarly, to get b as the ﬁnal outcome, it sufﬁces to oppose a against c at the
ﬁrst stage (given that c will defeat a) and then the winner c against b (given that b will
defeat c). These observations show how the choice of agenda can affect the outcome.
This reasoning is based on the assumption that voters vote sincerely. However, the
voters may respond to agenda manipulation by misrepresenting their preferences. That
is, they may vote strategically. Voters can choose to vote for options that are not actually
their most-preferred options if they believe that such behavior in the earlier ballots can
affect the ﬁnal outcome in their favor. For example, if we ﬁrst oppose b against c, then
voter 2 may vote for c rather than b. This ensures that c goes on to oppose a. Option c
will win, an outcome preferred by voter 2 to the victory for a that emerges with sincere
voting. So voters may not vote for their preferred option in order to prevent their worst
option from winning. The question is then how strategic voting affects the set of options
that could be achieved by agenda manipulation. Such outcomes are called sophisticated
outcomes of binary agendas because voters anticipate what the ultimate result will be,
for a given agenda, and vote optimally in earlier stages.
A remarkable result, due to Miller (1980), is that strategic voting (relative to sincere
voting) does not alter the set of outcomes that can be achieved by agenda manipulation
when the agenda-setter can design any binary agendas, provided only that every option
must be included in the agenda. Miller called the set that can be achieved the top cycle.

Binary agenda
When there exists a Condorcet winner, the top cycle reduces to that single option.
With preferences as in the Condorcet paradox, the top cycle contains all three options
{a, b, c}. For example, option b can be obtained by the following agenda (different
from the agenda under sincere voting): at the ﬁrst stage, a is opposed to b, then the
winner is opposed to c. This binary agenda is represented in ﬁgure 11.5.
The agenda begins at the top, and at each stage the voters must vote with the effect
of moving down the agenda tree along the branch that will defeat the other with a
sophisticated majority vote. To resolve this binary agenda, sophisticated voters must
anticipate the outcome of the second stage and vote optimally in the ﬁrst stage. Either
the second stage involves c against a, and thus c will beat a, or the second stage
involves c against b, and thus b will beat c (as voters will vote sincerely in this last
stage). So the voters should anticipate that in the ﬁrst stage voting for a will in fact
lead to the ultimate outcome c, whereas voting for b will lead to the ultimate outcome
b (as displayed in parentheses). So, in voting for a in the ﬁrst stage, they vote in
effect for c, whereas voting for b in the ﬁrst stage effectively leads to the choice of b
as the ultimate outcome. Because b is preferred by a majority to c, it follows that a
majority of voters should vote for b at the ﬁrst stage (even though a majority prefers a
over b).
The problem with the top cycle is that it can contain options that are Pareto-
dominated. To see this, suppose that the preferences are as in the Condorcet paradox,
and add a fourth alternative d that falls just below c in every individual’s preference.
The resulting rankings are given in table 11.4. Note that there is a cycle: two out of
three prefer b to c, while two out of three prefer a to b, and two out of three prefer d
to a, and last all prefer c to d, making it a full circle. So d is included in the top cycle,
even though d is Pareto-dominated by c.

The situation can be even worse than this. An important theorem, due to McKelvey,
says that if there is no Condorcet winner, then the top cycle is very large and can even
coincide with the full set of alternatives. There are two implications of this result. First,
the agenda-setter can bring about any possible option as the ultimate voting outcome.
So the power of the agenda-setter may be substantial. Such dependence implies that the
outcome chosen by majority rule cannot be characterized, in general, as the expression
of the voters’ will. Second, the existence of a voting cycle makes the voting outcome
arbitrary and unpredictable, with very little normative appeal.
We know that the existence of a Condorcet winner requires very special conditions on
voters’preferences. In general, with preferences that do not have the single-peakedness
or single-crossing properties on a simple one-dimensional issue space, we should not
generally expect that a Condorcet winner exists. For example, Fishburn (1973) has
shown that when voters’ preferences are drawn randomly and independently from the
set of all possible preferences, the probability of a Condorcet winner existing tends to
zero as the number of possible options goes to inﬁnity.
Before embarking on the alternatives to majority rule, let us present some Condorcet-
consistent selection procedures; that is, procedures that select the Condorcet winner
as the single winner when it exists. The ﬁrst, due to Miller, is the uncovered set. An
option x is covered if there exists some other option y such that (1) y beats x (with a
majority of votes) and (2) y beats any option z that x can beat. If x is Pareto-dominated
by some option, then x must be covered. The uncovered set is the set of options that
are not covered. For the preferences such as in top cycle example above, d is covered
by c because d is below c in everyone’s ranking. Thus the uncovered set is a subset of
the top cycle.
If more restrictions are imposed on the agenda, then it is possible to reduce sub-
stantially the set of possible voting outcomes. One notable example is the successive-
elimination agenda according to which all options are put into an ordered list, and voters
are asked to eliminate the ﬁrst or second option, and thereafter the previous winner or

361
Chapter 11: Voting
the next option. The option surviving this successive elimination is the winner, and all
eliminations are resolved by sophisticated majority votes. The Bank’s set is the set of
options that can be achieved as (sophisticated) outcomes of the successive-elimination
agendas. It is a subset of the uncovered set.
11.5
Alternatives to Majority Rule
Even if one considers the principle of majority rule to be attractive, the failure to
select the Condorcet winner when one exists may be regarded as a serious weakness
of majority rule as a voting procedure. This is especially relevant because many of
the most popular alternatives to majority rule also do not always choose the Condorcet
winner when one does exist, although they always pick a winner even when a Condorcet
winner does not exist. This is the case for all the scoring rule methods, such as plurality
voting, approval voting, and Borda voting.
Each scoring rule method selects as a winner the option with the highest aggregate
score. The difference is in the score voters can give to each option. Under plurality
voting, voters give 1 point to their ﬁrst choice and 0 points to all other options. Thus
only information on each voter’s most preferred option is used. Under approval voting,
voters can give 1 point to more than one option, in fact to as many or as few options
as they want. Under Borda voting, voters give the highest possible score to their ﬁrst
choice, and then progressively lower scores to worse choices.
11.5.1
Borda Voting
Borda voting (or weighted voting) is a scoring rule. With n options, each voter’s
ﬁrst choice gets n points, the second choice gets n −1 points, and so forth, down to
a minimum of 1 point for the the worst choice. Then the scores are added up, and the
option with the highest score wins. The procedure is very simple, and almost always
picks a winner (even if there is no Condorcet winner). So a fair question is: Which
requirements of Arrow’s theorem does it violate?
Suppose that there are seven voters whose preferences over three options {a, b, c}
are as shown in table 11.5 (with numbers in parentheses representing the number of
voters). Thus three voters have a as their ﬁrst choice, b as their second, and c as their
third.
Clearly, there is no Condorcet winner: ﬁve out of the seven voters prefer a to b, and
ﬁve out of seven prefer b to c, and then four out of seven prefer c to a, which leads to

a voting cycle. Applying the Borda method as described above, it is easy to see that a
with three ﬁrst places, two second places, and two third places will be the Borda winner
with 15 points (while b gets 14 points and c gets 13 points). So we get the Borda ranking
a ≻b ≻c, where the symbol ≻denotes strict preference. But now let us introduce a
new option d. This becomes the ﬁrst choice of three voters but a majority prefer c, the
worst option under Borda rule, to the new alternative d. The new preference lists are
given in table 11.6.
If we compute the scores with the Borda method (now with points from one to four),
the election results are different: d will be the Borda winner with 22 points, c will be
second with 17 points, b will be third with 16 points, and a will be fourth with 15 points.
So the introduction of the new option d has reversed the Borda ranking between the
original alternatives to a ≺b ≺c. This reversal of the ranking shows that the Borda
rule violates the independence of irrelevant alternatives and should be unacceptable as
a voting procedure.
This example illustrates the importance of Arrow’s condition I. Without imposing
this requirement it would be easy to manipulate the voting outcome by adding or
removing irrelevant alternatives without any real chance of them winning the election
in order to alter the chance of real contenders winning.

11.5.2
Plurality Voting
Under plurality voting only the ﬁrst choice of each voter matters and is given one point.
Choices other than the ﬁrst do not count at all. These scores are added and the option
with the highest score is the plurality winner. Therefore the plurality winner is the
option that is ranked ﬁrst by the largest number of voters.
Consider the voters’ preferences over the three options given in table 11.7. Clearly,
a majority of voters rate c as worst option, but it also has a dedicated minority who
rate it best (four out of nine voters). Under plurality voting c is the winner, with four
ﬁrst-place votes, while b and a have three and two respectively. The example illustrates
the problem that the plurality rule fails to select the Condorcet winner, which in this
case is a (a beats both b and c with majority votes). The reason for this is that plurality
voting dispenses with all information other than about the ﬁrst choices.
11.5.3
Approval Voting
One problem with plurality rule is that voters don’t always have an incentive to vote
sincerely. Any rule that limits each voter to cast a vote for only one option forces the
voters to consider how likely it is that their ﬁrst choice will win the election. If the
ﬁrst-choice option is unlikely to win, the voters may instead vote for a second (or even
lower) choice to prevent the election of a worse option.
In response to this risk of misrepresentation of preferences (i.e., strategic voting),
Brams and Fishburn (1978) have proposed the approval voting procedure. They argue
that this procedure allows voters to express their true preferences. Under approval
voting voters may each vote (approve) for as many options as they like. Approving one
option does not exclude approving any other options. So there is no cost in voting for an
option that is unlikely to win. The winning option is the one that gathers the most votes.
This procedure is simpler than Borda rule because, instead of giving a score for all the
possible options, voters only need to separate the options they approve of from those

they do not. Approval voting also has the advantage over pairwise voting procedures
that voters need only vote once, instead of engaging in a repetition of binary votes (as
in the Condorcet method).
The problem with approval voting is that it may fail to pick the Condorcet winner
when one exists. Suppose that there are ﬁve voters with the preferences shown in
table 11.8. With pairwise majority voting, a beats both b and c with a majority of 3 and
4 votes out of 5 respectively, making a a Condorcet winner. Now consider approval
voting, and suppose that each voter gives his approval votes to the ﬁrst and second
choices on his list but not the bottom choice. Then b will be the winner with 5 approval
votes (everyone gives it an approval vote), a will be second with 4 approval votes (one
voter does not approve this option), and c will be third with 1 vote. So approval voting
fails to pick the Condorcet winner.
11.5.4
Runoff Voting
The runoff is a very common scheme used in many presidential and parliamentary elec-
tions. Under this scheme only ﬁrst-place votes are counted, and if there is no majority,
there is a second runoff election involving only the two strongest candidates. The pur-
pose of a runoff is to eliminate the least-preferred options. Runoff voting seems fair, and
it is very widely used. However, runoff has two drawbacks. First, it may fail to select a
Condorcet winner when it exists; second, it can violate positive responsiveness, which
is a fundamental principle of democracy. Let us consider these two problems in turn.
The failure to select a Condorcet winner is easily seen by considering the same set
of voters’ preferences as for the plurality voting example (table 11.7). Recall that in
this example, a is the Condorcet winner. In the ﬁrst round, c has 4 votes, b has 3 votes,
and a has 2 votes. So a is eliminated and the second runoff election is between b and
c. Supporters of the eliminated option, a, move to their second choice, b; that would
give b an additional two votes in the runoff, and a decisive victory over c (with 5 votes
against 4). So this runoff voting fails to select the Condorcet winner, a.

To illustrate the violation of positive responsiveness, consider the example in table
11.9, which is due to Brams (1994), with 4 options and 17 voters. There is no Condorcet
winner: a beats b, c beats a, and b beats c. Under runoff voting, the result of the ﬁrst
election is a tie between options a and b, with 6 votes each, while c is eliminated, with
only 5 votes. There is no majority, and a runoff is necessary. In the runoff between a
and b, the supporters of c move to their second choice, a, giving a an extra 5 votes and
and a decisive victory for a over b. This seems fair: c is the least-preferred option and
there is a majority of voters who prefer a over b.
Now suppose that preferences are changed so that option a attracts extra supporters
from the two voters in the last column who switch their ﬁrst choice from b to a. Then
a will lose! Indeed the effect of this switch in preferences is that b is now the option
eliminated in the ﬁrst election, and there is still no majority. Thus a runoff is necessary
between a and c. The disappointed supporters of b move to their second choice giving
5 more votes to c and the ultimate victory over a. The upshot is that by attracting more
supports, a can lose a runoff election that it would have won without the extra support.
11.6
The Paradox of Voting
The working assumption employed in analyzing voting so far has been that all voters
choose to cast their votes. It is natural to question whether this assumption is reason-
able. Although in some countries voting is a legal obligation, in others it is not. The
observation that many of the latter countries frequently experience low voter turnouts
in elections suggests that the assumption is unjustiﬁed.
Participation in voting almost always involve costs. There is the direct cost of trav-
eling to the point at which voting takes place, and there is also the cost of the time
employed. If the individuals involved in voting are rational utility-maximizers, then
they will only choose to vote if the expected beneﬁts of voting exceed the costs.
To understand the interaction of these costs and beneﬁts, consider an election that
involves two political parties. Denote the parties by 1 and 2. Party 1 delivers to the voter

an expected beneﬁt of E1 and party 2 a beneﬁt of E2. It is assumed that E1 > E2, so
the voter prefers party 1. Let B = E1 −E2 > 0 be the value of party 1 winning versus
losing. If the voter knows that party 1 will win the election, then he will choose not
to vote. This is because the voter gains no beneﬁt from doing so but still bears a cost.
Similarly voters will also not vote if they expect party 2 to win. In fact the rational voter
will only ever choose to vote if he expects that he can affect the outcome of the election.
Denoting the probability of breaking a tie occurring by P , then the expected beneﬁt of
voting is given by P B. The voting decision is now based on whether P B exceeds the
privatecostofvotingC. Intuitionsuggeststhattheprobabilityofbeingpivotaldecreases
with the size of the voting population and increases with the predicted closeness of the
election. This can be demonstrated formally by considering the following coin-toss
model of voting.
There is a population of potential voters of size N. Each of the voters chooses to cast
a vote with probability p (so they don’t vote with probability 1 −p). This randomness
in the decision to vote is the “coin-toss” aspect of the model. Contesting the election
are two political parties, which we will call party 1 and party 2. A proportion σ1 of the
population supports party 1, meaning that if this population did vote they would vote
for party 1. Similarly a proportion σ2 of the population supports party 2. It must be the
case that 0 ≤σ1 + σ2 ≤1. If σ1 + σ2 < 1, then some of the potential voters do not
support either political party and abstain from the election. The number of votes cast
for party 1 is denoted X1 and the number for party 2 by X2.
Now assume that the election is conducted. The question we want to answer is: What
is the probability that an additional voter can affect the outcome? An additional person
casting a vote can affect the outcome in two circumstances:
• If the vote had resulted in a tie with X1 = X2. The additional vote can then break
the tie in favor of the party they support.
• If the party the additional person supports was 1 vote short of a tie. The additional
vote will then lead to a tie.
Now assume that the additional voter supports party 1. (The argument is identical
if they support party 2.) The ﬁrst case arises when X1 = X2, so the additional vote
will break the tie in favor of party 1. The second case occurs if X1 = X2 −1, so the
additional vote will ensure a tie. The action in the event of a tie is now important. We
assume, as is the case in the United Kingdom, that a tie is broken by the toss of a fair
coin. Then when a tie occurs each party has a 50/50 chance of winning the vote.
Putting these points together, the probability of being pivotal can be calculated. If
the original vote resulted in a tie, the additional vote will lead to a clear victory. Without

original vote had concluded with party 1 having 1 less vote than party 2, the addition
of another vote for party 1 will lead from defeat to a tie. The tie is won by party 1 just

(11.3)
In an election with a small number of voters the beneﬁt does not have to be much higher
than the cost to make it worthwhile to vote.
The calculation of the probability can be generalized to determine the dependence
of P on the values of N, σ1, σ2, and p. This is illustrated in the following two ﬁgures.
Figure 11.7 displays the probability of being pivotal against the number of potential vot-
ersforthreevaluesofp giventhatσ1 = σ2 = 0.5. Wecaninterpretthevalueofp asbeing
the willingness to participate in the election. The ﬁgures show clearly how an increase in
the number of voters reduces the probability of being pivotal. Although the probability
tends to zero as N becomes very large, it is still signiﬁcantly above zero at N = 100.
Figure 11.8 conﬁrms the intuition that the probability of being pivotal is highest when
the population is evenly divided between the parties. If the population is more in favor
of party 2 (the case of σ1 = 0.25, σ2 = 0.75), then the probability of the additional
voter being pivotal in favor of party 1 falls to 0 very quickly. If the initial population
is evenly divided, the probability of a tie remains signiﬁcant for considerably larger
values of N.
The probability of a voter being pivotal can be approximated by a reasonably simple
formula if the number of potential voters, N, is large and the probability of each one

where π is used in its standard mathematical sense. From this equation can be observed
three results:
• The probability is a decreasing function of n. This follows from the facts that
2√σ1σ2 −σ1 −σ2 ≤0, so the power on the exponential is negative, and that n is
also in the denominator. Hence as the number of voters participating in the election
increases, the probability of being pivotal falls.
• For any given value of σ1, the probability increases the closer is σ2 to σ1. Hence the
probability of being pivotal is increased the more evenly divided is the support for the
parties.
• For a given value of n, the probability of being pivotal is at its maximum when
σ1 = σ2 = 1
2, and the expression for P simpliﬁes to P =
1
√
2πn. In this case the effect
of increasing n is clear.
The bottom line of this analysis is that the probability that someone’s vote will
change the outcome is essentially zero when the voting population is large enough.

a. All coefﬁcients are signiﬁcantly different from zero at the 1 percent level.
So, if voting is costly, the cost–beneﬁt model should imply almost no participation.
The small probability of a large change is not enough to cover the cost of voting. Each
person’s vote is like a small voice in a very large crowd.
Table 11.10 presents the results of an empirical analysis of voter turnout to test the
basic implications of the pivotal-voter theory (i.e., that voting should depend on the
probability of a tie). It uses a linear regression over aggregate state-by-state data for 11
US presidential elections (1948–1988) to estimate the empirical correlation between the
participation rate and the strategic variables (population size and electoral closeness).
The analysis also reveals the other main variables relevant for participation. As the
table shows, there is strong empirical support for the pivotal-voter argument: a smaller
population and a closer election are correlated with higher participation. It also reveals
that black participation is 48 percent lower, that new residents are 1.2 percent less likely
to vote, and that rain on the election day decreases participation by 3.4 percent.
The paradox of voting raises serious questions about why so many people actually
vote. Potential explanations for voting could include mistaken beliefs about the chance
of affecting the outcome or feelings of social obligation. After all, every democratic
society encourages its citizens to take civic responsibilities seriously and to participate
actively in public decisions. Even if the act of voting is unlikely to promote self-interest,
citizens feel they have a duty to vote.And this is exactly the important point made by the
cost–beneﬁt model of voting. Indeed economists are suspicious about trying to explain
voting only by the civic responsibility argument. This is because the duty model cannot
explain what the cost–beneﬁt model can, namely that many people do not vote and that
turnout is higher when the election is expected to be close.

11.7
The “Alabama” Paradox
TheAlabama paradox is associated with the apportionment problem. Many democratic
societies require representatives to the parliament to be apportioned among the states
or regions according to their respective population shares. Such a rule for proportional
representation apportionment arises in the EU context where representation in European
institutions is based on the population shares of member states. At the level of political
parties, there is also the proportional representation assignment of seats to different
parties based on their respective vote shares. For instance, with the party “list system”
in Belgium, electors vote for the list of candidates provided by each party. Then the
number of candidates selected from each list is determined by the share of the vote a
party receives. The selection is made according to the ordering of the candidates on the
list from top to the bottom.
In all these forms of apportionment the solutions may involve fractions, but the
number of representatives has to be an integer. How can these fractions be handled?
With only two parties, rounding off will do the job. But rounding off loses simplicity
once there are more than two parties, and it can produce an unexpected shift in power.
To illustrate, suppose that 25 seats are to be allocated among three political parties (or
states) based on their voting ( population) shares as given in table 11.11. The exact
apportionment for a party is obtained by allocating the 25 seats in proportion of the
vote shares. However, such a scheme requires that the three parties should share one
seat (hardly feasible!). The obvious solution is to allocate the contested seat to the party
with the largest fractional part. This solution seems reasonable and was proposed by
the American statesman Alexander Hamilton (despite the strong opposition of Thomas
Jefferson). It was then used for a long period of time in the United States. Applying
this solution to our problem gives the contested seat to the small Center party (with a
fractional part of 0.5 against 0.25 for the two other parties).

Part IV: Political Economy
Now what is the problem? Recall the runoff voting problem that more support for
a candidate can make this candidate lose the election. A similar paradox arises with
Hamilton’s apportionment scheme: increasing the number of seats available can remove
seats from some parties. And it did happen in practice: when the size of the US House
of Representatives grew, some states lost representation. The ﬁrst to lose seats was
Alabama (hence the name of Alabama paradox). To see this paradox with our simple
example, suppose that one extra seat has to be allocated bringing the total number of
seats to 26. Recalculating the Hamilton apportionment accordingly, it follows that the
small party loses out by one seat, which implies a 25 percent loss of its representation.
The large parties have beneﬁted from this expansion in the number of seats. It is
unfair that one party loses one seat when more seats become available. The explanation
for this paradox is that larger parties have their fractional part quickly jumping to the
top of the list when extra seat becomes available.
11.8
Political Competition
The theory of political competition addresses the question of how political parties
choose the policies they present to the electorate. It might be thought that parties choose
policies solely on the basis of political philosophy. This view ignores the incentives
that parties have to announce policies that make them electable, even if the policies are
not exactly in accord with stated philosophy. The models we now describe show how
these trade-off between electability and political philosophy are resolved.
11.8.1
Downsian Model
The seminal model of political competition is the Downsian model. Anthony Downs
(1957) assumed two-party competition without uncertainty about voter preferences
and with the central assumption that “parties formulate policies in order to win elec-
tions, rather than win elections in order to formulate policies” (Downs 1957, p. 28).
The Downsian model suggests that political parties choose and create their policies to
secure the most votes as opposed to following party ideology. When there are only two
parties the Downsian model, in which parties are only interested in winning elections,
predicts that parties will converge to the Condorcet winner (the option preferred by a
majority to any other feasible option) if it exists.
In an earlier contribution Harold Hotelling (1929) had already shown how the me-
dian voter preference would emerge as the outcome of two-party competition. In

373
Chapter 11: Voting
the Hotelling model voters had political opinions represented by a point on a one-
dimensional ideology line measured from left to right. Voters had a preference for
proximity in the sense that they would vote for the party proposing the policy (also
represented by a point on the ideology line) closest to their own position. The Hotelling–
Downs model follows this tradition and assumes single-peaked preferences. It also
makes numerous other assumptions such as a unidimensional policy, a symmetric and
unimodal distribution of voter preferences, no voting abstention, and no uncertainty
over the outcome of voting.
As already noted, the existence of a Condorcet winner requires unidimensional policy
and well-behaved preferences (single-peaked or single crossing). But, more important,
real world observations suggest that parties do not always converge to a common policy.
The model is therefore not in keeping with policy divergence (or political polarization)
as may sometimes be observed in electoral competition. To ﬁt this observation, the
model has been adapted to account for candidates with policy preferences. When can-
didates have policy preferences, their payoff depends on the policy they implement,
not just on being elected. Indeed we could reasonably argue that most parties are not
only interested in winning elections but are also policy-motivated (if not, what would
be the meaning of party ideology, and the cleavage between “left” and “right”?). How-
ever, making the change to candidates with policy preferences does not sufﬁce to affect
the main result: in a two-party election both candidates will still converge to the mid-
dle in an effort to attract the median voter, no matter the extent of disagreement on
the preferred policy between candidates. The reason is simply that party ideology is
useless if the candidate cannot secure election. So, by deviating from the median vote,
the candidate loses the election and thus the opportunity to implement policy. A further
change to the model, to include parties that are uncertain about the result of the elec-
tion, can obtain policy divergence. We now add these two features into the standard
Hotelling–Downs model to demonstrate policy divergence.
11.8.2
Policy Divergence
Consider a two-party model with two candidates, A and B, displaying their policy
preference. Candidate j’s ideal policy is τj, where 0 ≤τj ≤1, for j = A, B. Suppose
that τA = t (with t < 1
2) and that τB = 1 −t. Candidate j has preferences over policy
choices, q, given by
u(q; τj) = −(q −τj)2.
(11.5)

374
Part IV: Political Economy
This utility function reﬂects preferences for proximity, so a candidate prefers to choose
a policy that is closer to their own preferred position. Voters have similar preferences
over policy but with the ideal policy denoted by θ, 0 ≤θ ≤1. That is, the voter with
preference θ has the (single-peaked) utility over policy q given by
u(q; θ) = −(q −θ)2.
(11.6)
We also include uncertainty of candidates over voter preferences. Candidates believe
that the ideal policy of the median voter, θm, is uniformly distributed on the interval
1
2 ± △with 0 ≤△≤1
2 −t. If the two candidates choose policies qA and qB, with
qA < qB, then the voter who is indifferent between the parties is deﬁned by u(qA; θ∗) =
u(qB; θ∗). Solving this equation for θ∗gives
θ∗(qA, qB) = qA + qB
2
.
(11.7)
Candidate A wins the election if the preference of the median voter is less than the
preference value for the indifferent voter. This occurs when θm < θ∗(qA, qB). Assume

Candidates obtain a rent from ofﬁce of r > 0 if they win the election and 0 otherwise.
Assume that r < 2(1−2t) to ensure that the desire to win the election is not so strong
that it dominates the preference for policy.
The timing of events is as follows. Each candidate proposes their policy. Then each
voter votes for the candidate whose policy he prefers (i.e., that is closest to his ideal
policy). The candidate with the most votes is elected and implements the announced
policy. A pair of policies (q∗

Result 2The extent to which candidates depart from the median preference is increasing
in voter uncertainty  and decreasing in the rent for ofﬁce r.
Result 3 Without uncertainty the condition r < 2(1 −2t) cannot be satisﬁed and the
Downsian model predicts policy convergence to the median q∗
A = 1 −q∗
B = 1
2.
These results show that policies can remain divergent, though there is a tendency
toward the median. This is a consequence of the uncertainty. If this is removed, the
result will be the simple Hotelling outcome of policy location at the median.

Part IV: Political Economy
11.8.3
Multidimensional Competition
The model of political competition can be extended to permit a multidimensional policy
space. This is a much more compelling setting since it allows candidates to state their
positions on a range of issues.
There are two candidates j = {A, B} who are only motivated by winning the election
(i.e., there is no policy motivation). The policy space, Q, is multidimensional (Q ⊂
Rm), and a chosen policy is a vector q located in Q. There are n voters indexed
i = 1, . . . , n, with voter i having utility function ui.The candidates simultaneously
choose their policies, qj, and each voter votes for the candidate he prefers given the
chosen policies. The candidate with the most votes wins the election and implements
his announced policy.
Let s(q, q′), where 0 ≤s(q, q′) ≤1, be the share of voters who prefer policy q to
policy q′. Using this notation, we obtain the probability that candidate A wins as

s(q∗, q) > 1
2 for all q ̸= q∗. The central proposition for the model is:
Proposition 11.5
A policy pair (q∗
A, q∗
B) is an equilibrium if and only it coincides
with the Condorcet winner: q∗
A = q∗
B = q∗
The implication of the proposition is that there can be no equilibrium if there is no
Condorcet winner. We have already seen that there are situations where a Condorcet
winner does not exist. The nonexistence of a Condorcet winner is in fact a general
feature unless we restrict our attention to single-peaked preferences (or single-crossing
preferences) and one-dimensional policies.
The classical example without a Condorcet winner is the “divide the dollar game”
in which N = 3, Q = {qi : 	 qi = 1}, and ui(q) = qi. In this game a single dollar is
divided among 3 players. Observe that no matter how the dollar is divided among the
three participants it is always possible to gain a majority in favor of taxing one partic-
ipant and transferring that income to the other two. In other words, no transfer policy
q = (q1, q2, q3) can be a Condorcet winner. For instance, the policy q′ = (0, q2 +
q1
2 , q3 + q1
2 ) is preferred by participants 2 and 3 to policy q. But then policy

377
Chapter 11: Voting
q′′ = ( q′

2 , q′

2 , 0) is preferred to policy q′ by participants 1 and 2. And so it is
possible to cycle forever by taking income from one participant and giving it to the
other two.
11.8.4
“Swing Voter” Politics
The standard solution to ﬁx the problem of there being no Condorcet winner is to
consider voter uncertainty so that voting becomes probabilistic. We now provide an
illustration with a model of distributive politics.
There are n voters indexed i = 1, . . . , n with voter i having an endowment of income
ωi. A policy is a list of transfers t = (t1, . . . , tn), where ti is the transfer given to voter
i. The set of feasible policies is T = {t : 	 ti = 0 and ωi + ti ≥0 ∀i}. That is, the
transfers must sum to 0 and the transfer from i cannot exceed the income of i. There
are two candidates A and B who are only motivated by winning the election (i.e., this
is a pure Downsian model with no policy motivation for the candidates).
Each candidate j chooses a policy tj ∈T. The utility of voter i if candidate j wins
is ui(ωi + tj
i ) + δj
i , where ui is the utility of income (with u′′
i < 0 < u′
i) and δj
i is
the nonpecuniary beneﬁt derived from candidate j being in ofﬁce. Voter i votes for
candidate A if
ui(ωi + tA
i ) −ui(ωi + tB
i ) > δB
i −δA
i ,
(11.17)
where δB
i −δA
i is a random variable which is not observable by the candidates. The
value of δB
i −δA
i is distributed according to the cumulative distribution function Fi :
R →[0, 1] with density fi > 0. Using the cumulative distribution function, we write
the probability that voter i votes for candidate A as
πi(tA, tB) = Fi(ui(ωi + tA
i ) −ui(ωi + tB
i )).
(11.18)
A pair of policies (tA, tB) is an equilibrium if (1) tA maximizes

tB, and (2) tB maximizes

(11.22)
Thus tA
i = tB
i
for all i because, otherwise, the constant ratio condition cannot be
satisﬁed. Therefore the equilibrium policy choice is tA = tB = t∗with
fi(0)u′
i(wi + t∗
i ) = λ.
(11.23)
Two results follow from these calculations.
Result 1 Suppose that voters have different utility functions ui but the same dis-
tribution function: fi(0) = f for all i. Then
u′
i(wi + t∗
i ) =
λ
f (0),
(11.24)
so the equilibrium policy is equivalent to the utilitarian policy of maximizing
	
i ui(ωi +ti). In this case electoral competition is equivalent to imposing a utilitarian
social welfare function.
Result 2 Suppose that voters have identical utility functions, so that ui = u, but
different distribution functions: fi(0) ̸= fk(0) for i ̸= k. Then
u′(wi + t∗
i ) =
λ
fi(0),
(11.25)
and in equilibrium the marginal utility of income decreases as fi increases. The in-
terpretation is that the more volatile voters (high fi(0)) will be given greater transfers
because they have a lower marginal utility of income in equilibrium. This leads to the
observation that swing voters receive greater transfers!
The outcome of political competition is that candidates bid to buy the votes of swing
voters. The existence of an equilibrium requires sufﬁcient concavity of the utility of
income (a decreasing marginal utility of income) and sufﬁcient uncertainty in voters
preferences so that when trading off one dollar from one voter to another, the change
in the support from the involved voters will be smooth enough.

Citizen-Candidate Model
In the Downsian model, candidates have no policy preferences, and thus they can
credibly adopt whatever policy will win the election. The Downsian model was then
extended to include policy preference. Candidates could trade-off policy preferences
against the necessity of winning the election. When there is some voter uncertainty, the
extended model can generate policy divergence, which is the relevant outcome from
an empirical perspective. However, the model still makes two strong assumptions.
First, it assumes that candidates can credibly commit to implement policies that differ
from their most preferred policy. Second, the number of candidates is assumed to
be ﬁxed. The model in fact assumes just two candidates competing for election, and
this number is exogenously given with no theoretical justiﬁcation. The only possible
argument for this assumption is the empirical prevalence of two candidates in electoral
competition (the so-called Duverger law). The citizen-candidate approach attempts to
ﬁll this gap by determining the number of candidates as part of the process of political
competition.
In the citizen-candidate approach the number of candidates is endogenous. Every
citizen in the society is both a voter and a potential candidate for ofﬁce. Running for
ofﬁce is costly, but the elected candidate can choose the policy that is implemented.
Each candidate is restricted to make only a credible policy announcement, so they
cannot announce that they plan to implement a policy that differs from the candidate’s
preferred policy. This restriction can be justiﬁed by the assumption that all citizens
know the preferred policies of all other citizens.
The citizen-candidate model is analyzed as a three-stage game. In stage 1, each cit-
izen decides whether or not to run for election. When running for election, there is
a sunk cost c > 0. In stage 2, citizens vote among the self-declared candidates. They
may vote sincerely for the candidate they prefer (no matter how likely this candi-
date is to win), or they may vote strategically for the candidate more likely to win
among the candidates they prefer. In stage 3, the candidate with the most votes (adopt-
ing the plurality voting rule) is elected and implements his preferred policy. In the
event of a tie, the winner is decided among the tied candidates by the toss of a (fair)
coin.
The game is solved by backward induction. In stage 3, the elected candidate chooses
his preferred policy. In stage 2, citizens rationally anticipates that the winner will
adopt his preferred policy, and so voters can vote for candidates according to their
own preferences. With sincere voting (the Osborne–Slivinski model), they will vote
for the self-declared candidate closest to their own preference. With strategic voting

380
Part IV: Political Economy
(the Besley–Coate model), they vote for the candidate more likely to win that is closest
to their own preferences. In stage 1, the candidates anticipate perfectly how citizens
will vote in the second stage given any set of candidates, and so they decide whether
or not to run for election.
Deﬁnition 11.6
A political equilibrium is a set of candidates such that after perfectly
anticipating voting behavior, each candidate is better off running for election, given
that the other self-declared candidates have chosen to stand, and every citizen who is
not a candidate is better off not running for election.
With this political competition model, the existence of equilibrium is not an issue
(even if there is no Condorcet winner). Rather, the model generates a multiplicity of
equilibria, which poses a problem for prediction. To illustrate, multiplicity of equi-
libria is what happens when the cost of running is sufﬁciently small. The utility of
candidate i with preferred policy xi is −c if elected and −
((xi −xj
(( −c if candidate
j is elected and implements policy xj. Each candidate maximizes his expected utility
where randomization is over the set of self-declared candidates to determine the win-
ner. Then, it can be shown, a one-candidate equilibrium exists. Indeed, if the cost of
running is sufﬁciently small, then the entering candidate must be a Condorcet winner.
Conversely, if a Condorcet winner exists, then there is a c sufﬁciently low that there
is an equilibrium in which the Condorcet winner runs unopposed. At the same time
the existence of a political equilibrium with two candidates with preferred policies x∗
1
and x∗
2 is quite general. In this case, x∗
1 ̸= x∗
2, but the position of the two candidates
is symmetric around the median, so both candidates attract the same number of votes
and are equally likely to win. They cannot be too close to the median, for otherwise a
successful entry is possible to either side. Their positions cannot be too far away from
the median either, for otherwise a candidate between the two candidates could enter
and win.
There may also exist equilibrium with three or more candidates. In a three-candidate
equilibrium there are two possibilities. Either, each candidate gets exactly 1
3 of the
vote or the two extreme candidates receive the same number of votes, and a moderate
candidate enters, though he surely loses. The motivation of the moderate candidate is
that if he does not enter the race, the extremist whom he likes less wins with certainty.
By entering, the moderate steals more votes from the extremist who is on the other side
of the median than from the extremist who is one the same side. In other words, the
moderate candidate is a spoiler.

Conclusions
Voting is one of the most common methods used to make collective decisions. Despite
its practical popularity, it is not without its shortcomings. The theory of voting that we
have described carefully catalogs the strengths and weaknesses of voting procedures.
The major result is due toArrow who pointed out the impossibility of ﬁnding the perfect
voting system. Although there are many alternative systems of voting, none can always
deliver in every circumstance.
Voting is important, but we should never forget its limitations. When discussing the
various alternative voting schemes (Borda rule, approval voting, runoff voting, and
plurality voting), we mentioned their respective drawbacks in terms of the violation of
some of the conditions of Arrow’s theorem. However, such violations are inevitable
given the content of the Impossibility Theorem. Thus violation of one condition does
not rule out the use of a particular voting scheme. Whatever scheme we choose will
have some problem associated with it.
The initial models of political competition assumed that the number of candidates
is given and focused on the choice of policy platform by candidates. The policies
proposed converge to the median of voters’ preferences if candidates care only about
winning. Limited divergence of policies occurs when candidates trade some probability
of winning for being able to implement a policy closer to their own preference if they
win. The citizen-candidate model takes the analysis one step further by endogenizing
the set of candidates. The consequence is that the model has a multiplicity of equilibria
so that its predictive power is limited.

(Ferejohn) There are an inﬁnite number of time periods indexed by t = 0, 1, . . . , ∞. There is
a set of identical politicians and a single representative voter. At the end of each period there
is an election opposing the incumbent to a challenger. The challenger is randomly drawn. An
incumbent who is voted out cannot run again for election. In any period, t, the incumbent
observes (privately) the realisation of a random productivity shock θt ∈

and exerts
effort et ∈R+. The random productivity shock is distributed according to a smooth and
increasing CDF F(θ) with density f (θ) > 0 for all θ. When in ofﬁce the politician receives
a per-period payoff of
r −c(et),
where r > 0 and the cost of effort c(et) is increasing and strictly convex with c(0). When not
in ofﬁce, a politician recieves payoff of 0. The voter’s payoff is increasing in the incumbent
performance as

Rent-Seeking
12.1
Introduction
The United States National Lobbyist Directory records there to be over 40,000 state-
registered lobbyists and a further 4,000 federal government lobbyists registered in
Washington. Some estimates put the total number, including those who are on other
registers or are unregistered, as high as 100,000. Although the number of lobbyists in
the United States dwarfs those elsewhere, there are large numbers of lobbyists in all
major capitals. These lobbyists are not engaged in productive activity. Instead, their
role is to seek favorable government treatment for the organizations that employ them.
Viewed from the US perspective, the country has at least 40,000 (presumably skilled)
individuals who are contributing no net value to the economy but are merely attempting
to inﬂuence government policy and shift the direction of income ﬂow.
The behavior that the lobbyists are engaged in has been given the name of rent-
seeking in the economic literature. Loosely speaking, rent-seeking is the act of trying
to seize an income ﬂow rather than create an income ﬂow. What troubles economists
about rent-seeking is that it uses valuable resources unproductively and can push the
government into inefﬁcient decisions. This places the economy inside its production
possibility frontier and implies that efﬁciency improvements will be possible. As such,
rent-seeking can be viewed as a potential cause of economic inefﬁciency.
The chapter will ﬁrst consider the nature and deﬁnition of rent-seeking. It will then
proceed to the analysis of a simple game that demonstrates the essence of rent-seeking.
This game generates the fundamental results on the consequences of rent-seeking and
forms the basis on which the later analysis is developed. The insights from the game are
then applied to rent-seeking in the context of monopoly. The basic point made there is
that the standard measure of monopoly welfare loss understates the true loss to society
if rent-seeking behavior is present. This partial equilibrium analysis of monopoly is
then extended to a general equilibrium setting. Following this, the emphasis turns to
how and why rents are created. Government policy is analyzed and the relationship
between lobbying and economic welfare is characterized in detail. The reasons why a
government might allow itself to be swayed by lobbyists are then discussed. Finally
possible policies for containing rent-seeking are considered.

388
Part IV: Political Economy
12.2
Deﬁnitions
Rent-seeking has received a number of different deﬁnitions in the literature. These vary
only in detail, particularly, in whether the resources used in rent-seeking are directly
wasted and in whether the term can be applied only to rents created by government. It
is not the purpose here to catalog these deﬁnitions but instead to motivate the concept
of rent-seeking by example and to draw out the common strands of the deﬁnitions.
The ideas that lie behind rent-seeking can be seen by considering the following two
situations:
• A ﬁrm is engaged in research intended to develop a new product. If the research is
successful, the product will be unique, and the ﬁrm will have a monopoly position, and
extract some rent from this, until rival products are introduced.
• A ﬁrm has introduced a new product to the home market. A similar product is manu-
factured overseas. The ﬁrm hires lawyers to lobby the government to prevent imports
of the overseas product. If it is successful, it will enjoy a monopoly position from which
it will earn rents.
What is the difference between these two situations? Both will give the ﬁrm a
monopoly position, at least in the short run, from which it can earn monopoly rents.
The ﬁrst, though, would be seen by many economists as something to be praised,
but the second as something to be condemned. In fact the fundamental difference is
that the ﬁrst case, with the ﬁrm expending resources to develop a new product, will lead
to monopoly rent only if the product is successful and valued by consumers. Hence the
resources used in research may ultimately lead to an increase in economic welfare. In
contrast, the resources used in the second case are reducing economic welfare. If the
lawyers are successful, consumers will be denied a choice between products, and the
lack of competition will mean that they face higher prices. Their welfare is reduced
and some of their income, via the higher prices, is diverted to the monopolist. There is
also (implicitly) a transfer from the overseas producers to the monopolist. Some of the
monopoly rents are transferred to the lawyers via their fees (we will clarify how much
in section 12.3). In short, although the research and the lawyers are both directed to
attaining a monopoly position, in the ﬁrst case research potentially increases economic
welfare, but in the second the lawyers reduce it.
These comments now allow us to distinguish between two concepts:
• Proﬁt-seeking is the expenditure of resources to create a proﬁtable position that
is ultimately beneﬁcial to society. Proﬁt-seeking, as exempliﬁed by the example of

389
Chapter 12: Rent-Seeking
research, is what drives progress in the economy and is the motivating force behind
competition.
• Rent-seeking is the expenditure of resources to create a proﬁtable opportunity that
is ultimately damaging to society. Rent-seeking, as exempliﬁed by the use of lawyers,
hinders the economy and limits competition.
There are some other points that can be drawn out of these deﬁnitions. Notice that
the scientists and engineers employed in research are being productive. If their work is
successful, then new products will emerge that raise the economy’s output. In contrast,
the lawyers engaged in lobbying the government are doing nothing productive. Their
activity does not raise output. At best, it simply redistributes what there already is,
and generally it reduces it. Furthermore output would be higher if they were usefully
employed in a productive capacity rather than working as lawyers. In this respect rent-
seeking always reduces total output, since the resources engaged in rent-seeking can
be expected to have alternative productive uses.
It can be inferred from this discussion that rent-seeking can take many forms. All
lobbying of government for beneﬁcial treatment, be it protection from competition or
the payment of subsidies, is rent-seeking. Expenditure on advertising is rent-seeking
and so is arguing for tariffs to protect infant industries. These activities are rife in most
economies, so rent-seeking is a widespread and important issue.
One of the factors that will feature strongly in the discussion below is the level of
resources wasted in the lobbying process. At ﬁrst sight there appears to be a clear
distinction between the time a lobbyist uses talking to a politician and a bribe passed to
a politician. The time is simply lost to the economy—it could have been used in some
productive capacity but has not. This is a resource wasted. In contrast, the bribe is just
a transfer of resources. Beyond the minimal costs needed to deliver the bribe, there
appear to be no other resource costs. Hence it is tempting to conclude that lobbying
time has a resource cost whereas bribes do not. Thus, if rent-seeking is undertaken
entirely by bribes, it appears to have no resource cost.
Before reaching this conclusion, it is necessary to take a further step back. Consider
the position of politicians receiving bribes. How did they achieve their position of
authority? Clearly, resources would have been expended to obtain election. If potential
politicians believed they would receive bribes once elected, they would be willing to
expend more resources to become politicians—they are in fact rent-seeking themselves.
Much of the resources used in seeking election will simply be a cost to the economy
with no net output resulting from them. Through this process a bribe, which is just a
transfer, actually becomes transformed further down the line into a resource loss caused

390
Part IV: Political Economy
by rent-seeking. These arguments suggest that caution is required in judging between
lobby costs that seem to be transfers and those that are clearly resource costs.
So far the discussion has concentrated on rent-seeking. The economic literature has
also dealt with the very closely related concept of directly unproductive activities.
The distinction between the two is not always that clear, and many economists use
them interchangeably. If there is a precise distinction, it is in the fact that directly
unproductive activities are by deﬁnition a waste of resources whereas the activity of
rent-seeking may not always involve activities that waste resources. The focus below
will be placed on rent-seeking, though almost all of what is said could be rephrased in
terms of directly unproductive activities.
12.3
Rent-Seeking Games
This section considers several variants of a simple game that is designed to capture
the essential aspects of rent-seeking. From the analysis emerge several important con-
clusions that will form the basis of more directly economic applications in the follow-
ing sections. The game may appear at ﬁrst sight to be extreme, but on reﬂection, its
interpretation in terms of rent-seeking will become clear.
The basic structure of the game is as follows: Consider the offer of a prize of $10,000.
Competitors enter the game by simultaneously placing a sum of money on a table and
setting it alight. The prize is awarded to the competitor that burns the most money.
Assuming that the competitors are all identical and risk-neutral, how much money will
each one burn? This question will be answered when there is either a ﬁxed number of
competitors or the number of competitors is endogenously determined through free-
entry into the competition.
Before conducting the analysis, it is worth detailing how this game relates to rent-
seeking. The prize to be won is the rent—think of this as the proﬁt that will accrue if
awarded a monopoly in the supply of a product. The money that is burned represents the
resources used in lobbying for the award of the monopoly. Instead of burning money,
it could be fees paid to a lobby company for the provision of their services. The game
can then be seen as representing a number of companies each wishing to be granted
the monopoly and employing lobbyists to make their case. We consider two different
games. In the deterministic game, the prize is awarded to the ﬁrm that spends most on
lobbying. In the probabilistic game, the chance of obtaining the prize is an increasing
function of one’s share in the total spending on lobbying, so spending the most does
not necessarily secure a win.

12.3.1
Deterministic Game
A game of this form is solved by constructing its equilibrium. In this case we look for
the Nash equilibrium, which occurs when each competitor’s action is optimal given
the actions of all other competitors. Consequently at a Nash equilibrium no variation in
one competitor’s choice can be beneﬁcial for that competitor. It is this latter property
that allows potential equilibria to be tested.
Say initially that there are two competitors for the prize. To apply the Nash equi-
librium argument, the method is to ﬁx the strategy choice of one competitor and
to consider what the remaining competitor will do. Strategies for the game can be of two
types. There are pure strategies that involve the choice of a single quantity of money to
burn. There are also mixed strategies where the competitor uses a randomizing device
to select its optimal strategy. The beneﬁt of randomizing is that if one player engages in
any determinate behavior, the rival can take advantage of it. The only sensible thing for
each to do is to mix its action randomly to act in an unpredictable way for its rival. For
instance, labeling six possible strategies from 1 to 6 and then using the roll of a die to
choose which one to play is a mixed strategy. The central component of ﬁnding a mixed
strategy equilibrium is to determine the mixing rule described by the probabilities as-
signed to each pure strategy. The argument will ﬁrst show that there can be no pure strat-
egy equilibrium for the game. The mixed strategy equilibrium will then be constructed.
To show that there can be no pure strategy equilibrium, let competitor 1 burn an
amount B∗. Then, if competitor 2 burns B∗+ε, this competitor will win the contest and
receive the prize of value V . The same argument applies for any value of B∗< V and
any positive value of ε, no matter how small. Since competitor 1 has lost the contest,
burning B∗cannot be an equilibrium choice: competitor 1 will wish to burn slightly
more than B∗+ ε. By this reasoning, no amount of burning less than V can be an
equilibrium. The only way a competitor can prevent this “leapfrogging” argument is
by burning exactly V . The other competitor must then also burn V .
However, each competitor burning V is still not an equilibrium. If both competitors
burn V , then each has an equal chance of winning. This chance of winning is 1
2, so
their expected payoff, EP, is equal to the expected value of the prize minus the money
burned,
EP = 1
2V −V = −1
2V < 0.
(12.1)
Clearly, given that the other burns V , a competitor would be better off to burn 0 and
make an expected payoff of 0 rather than burn V and make an expected loss of −V
2 .

392
Part IV: Political Economy
So the strategies of both burning V are not an equilibrium. The conclusion of this
reasoning is that the game has no equilibrium in pure strategies. Therefore, to ﬁnd an
equilibrium, it becomes necessary to look for one in mixed strategies.
The calculation of the mixed strategy for the game is easily motivated. It is ﬁrst
noted that each player can obtain a payoff of at least 0 by burning nothing. Therefore
the equilibrium strategy must yield a payoff of at least 0. No player can ever burn a
negative amount of money, nor is there any point in burning more than V . Hence the
strategy must assign positive probability only to amounts in the range 0 to V .
It turns out that the equilibrium strategy is to assign the same probability to all
amounts in the range 0 to V . This probability, denoted f(B), must then be given by
f(B) = 1
V . Given that the other competitor also plays this mixed strategy, the proba-
bility of winning when burning an amount B is the probability that the other competitor
burns less than B. This can be calculated as F(B) = B
V . Burning B then gives an
expected payoff of
EP =
B
V

V −B = 0.
(12.2)
Therefore, whatever amount the random device suggests should be played, the ex-
pected payoff from that choice will be zero. In total, the mixed strategies used in this
equilibrium give both players an expected payoff of zero.
In the context of rent-seeking, the important quantity is the total sum of money
burned, since this can be interpreted as the value wasted. The mixed strategy makes
each value between 0 and V equally likely so the expected burning for each player
is V
2 . Adding these together, the total amount burnt is V —which is exactly equal to
the value of the prize. This conclusions forms the basis of the important result that the
effort put into rent-seeking will be exactly equal to the rent to be won.
The argument can now be extended to any number of players. With three players
the strategy of giving the same probability to each value between 0 and V is not the
equilibrium. To see this, observe that with this mixed strategy the average amount
burned remains at V
2 , but the probability of winning with three players is reduced to 1
3.
The expected payoff is therefore
EP =
1
3

V −V
2 = −V
6 ,
(12.3)
so an expected loss is made. This strategy gives too much weight to higher levels of
burning now that there are three players. Consequently the optimal strategy must give

393
Chapter 12: Rent-Seeking
less weight to higher values of burning so that the level of expected burning must match
the expected winnings.
The probability distribution for the mixed strategy equilibrium when there are n play-
ers can be found as follows. Let the probability of beating one of the other competitors
when B is burned be F(B). There are n −1 other competitors, so the probability of
beating them all is [F(B)]n−1. The expected payoff in equilibrium must be zero, so
[F(B)]n−1 V = B for any value of B between 0 and V . Solving this equation for F(B)
gives the equilibrium probability distribution as
F(B) =
B
V
1/(n−1)
.
(12.4)
This distribution has the property that the probability applied to higher levels of B falls
relative to that for lower levels as n increases. It can also be seen that when n = 2, it
gives the solution found earlier.
What is important for the issue of rent-seeking is the expected amount burned by each
competitor. Given that the expected payoff in equilibrium is zero and that everyone is
equally likely to win V with probability 1
n, the expected amount burnt by each com-
petitor is
EB = V
n .
(12.5)
By this result the expected amount burned by all the competitors is nEB = V , which
again is exactly equal to the prize being competed for. This ﬁnding is summarized as a
theorem.
Theorem 12.1 (Complete Dissipation Theorem)
If there are two or more competitors
in a deterministic rent-seeking game, the total expected value of resources expended
by the competitors in seeking a prize of V is exactly V .
The interpretation of this theorem is that between them the set of competitors will
burn (in expected terms) a sum of money exactly equal to the value of the prize. The
theorem is just a restatement of the fact that the expected payoff from the game is
zero. The theorem has been very inﬂuential in the analysis of rent-seeking. Originally
demonstrated in the context of monopoly (we will look at its application in this context
later), thetheoremprovidestheconclusionthatfromasocialperspectivethereisnothing
gained from the existence of the prize. Instead, all the possible beneﬁts of the prize

394
Part IV: Political Economy
are wasted through the burning of money. In the circumstances where it is applicable,
the ﬁnding of complete dissipation provides an exact answer to the question of what
quantity of resources is expended in rent-seeking.
It is important to note before proceeding that the theorem holds whatever the value
of n (provided it is at least 2). Early analyses of rent-seeking concluded that rents would
be completely dissipated only if there were large numbers of competitors for the rent.
This conclusion was founded on standard arguments that competition between many
would drive the return down to zero. Prior to the proof of the Complete Dissipation
Theorem it had been suspected that this would not be the case with only a small number
of competitors and that some rent would be undissipated. However, the theorem proves
that this reasoning is false and that even with only two competitors attempting to win
the prize, rents are completely dissipated.
12.3.2
Probabilistic Game
The key feature of the Complete Dissipation Theorem is that it takes only a slight
advantage over one’s competitors to obtain a sure win. This is the situation where the
rent-seeking contest takes the form of a race or an auction with maximal competition.
However, in many cases there is inevitably uncertainty in rent-seeking, so higher effort
increases the probability of obtaining the prize but does not ensure a win. A natural
applicationispoliticallobbyingwherelobbyingexpendituresinvolverealresourcesthat
seek to inﬂuence public decisions. Even if a lobby can increase its chance of success by
spendingmore, itcannotobtainasurewinbysimplyspendingmorethanitscompetitors.
We now show that such uncertainty will reduce the equilibrium rent-seeking efforts,
preventing full dissipation of the rent.
Consider modifying the payoff function to let the probability of anyone obtaining
the prize be equal to their share of the total rent-seeking expenditures of all contestants,
EPi =

Bi
Bi + [n −1]B−i

V −Bi,
(12.6)
where [n −1]B−i is the total effort of the other contestants. So the expected payoff
of contestant i is the probability of obtaining the prize, which is their spending as a
proportion of the total amount spent in the competition, times the value of the rent, V ,
minus their own spending.
A Nash equilibrium in this game is an expenditure level for each contestant such
that no one would want to alter his expenditure given that of the other contestants.

395
Chapter 12: Rent-Seeking
Because all contestants are identical, we should expect a symmetric Nash equilibrium
in which rent-seeking activities are the same for all and everyone is equally likely to win
the prize. To ﬁnd this Nash equilibrium, we proceed in two steps. First, we derive the
optimal response of contestant i as a function of the total efforts of the other contestants.
Second, we use the symmetry property to obtain the Nash equilibrium.
To ﬁnd player i’s best response when the others are choosing B−i, we must take the
derivative of player i’s expected payoff and set it equal to zero (this is the ﬁrst-order
condition). To facilitate the derivative, express the probability of winning as a power
function in the expected payoff,
EPi = Bi[Bi + [n −1]B−i]−1 V −Bi.
(12.7)
Using the product rule for the derivative of the ﬁrst term (the derivative of the ﬁrst
function times the second, plus the ﬁrst function times the derivative of the second),
we have the ﬁrst-order condition
[Bi + [n −1]B−i]−1 V −Bi[Bi + [n −1]B−i]−2 V −1 = 0.
(12.8)
Next we use the fact that in a symmetric equilibrium Bi = B−i = B. Making this
substitution in the ﬁrst-order condition gives
[B + [n −1]B]−1 V −B[B + [n −1]B]−2 V −1 = 0,
(12.9)
or
[nB]−1 V −B[nB]−2 V = 1.
(12.10)
Finally, multiplying both sides by n2B, we obtain
nV −V = n2B.
(12.11)
Hence the equilibrium level of rent-seeking expenditure is
B = n −1
n2
V,
(12.12)
and the total expenditure of all contestants in equilibrium is
nB = n −1
n
V.
(12.13)
Thus the fraction of the rent that is dissipated is n−1
n < 1, which is an increasing
function of the number of contestants. With two contestants only one-half of the rent

396
Part IV: Political Economy
is dissipated in a Nash equilibrium, and the fraction increases to one as the number
of contestants gets large. In equilibrium each contestant is equally likely to obtain the
prize (with probability 1
n), and using the equilibrium value of B, their expected payoff
is EP =

V −B = V
n2 .
Theorem 12.2
(Partial Dissipation Theorem)
If there are two or more competitors
in a probabilistic rent-seeking game, the total expected value of resources expended by
the competitors in seeking a prize of V is a fraction n−1
n
of the prize value V, and is
increasing with the number of competitors.
It follows that the total costs of rent-seeking activity are signiﬁcant, and are greater
than one-half of the rent value in all cases. Notice that the rate of rent dissipation
is independent of the value of the rent. It is also worth mentioning that in the Nash
equilibrium contestants play a pure strategy and do not randomize as in the previous
deterministic rent-seeking game. This is because the probability of obtaining the rent is a
continuous function of the person’s own rent-seeking activity. Finally, in equilibrium,
no single person spends more on rent-seeking than the prize is worth, but the total
expenditure on rent-seeking activities may dissipate a substantial fraction of the prize
value. This destruction of value is often innocuous because the contestants participate
willingly expecting to gain. However, as in any competition where the winner takes
all, there is only one winner who may earn large proﬁts but many losers who bear the
full cost of the destruction of value.
12.3.3
Free-Entry
Beginning with a ﬁxed number of competitors does not capture the idea of a potential
pool of competitors who may opt to enter the competition if there is a rent to be obtained.
It is therefore of interest to consider what the equilibrium will be if there is free-entry
into the competition. In the context of the game, free-entry means that competitors
enter to bid for the prize until there is no expected beneﬁt from further entry. This
has the immediate implication that the expected payoff has to be driven to zero in any
free-entry equilibrium.
How can the game be solved with free-entry? The analysis of the deterministic game
showed that the expected payoff of each competitor is zero in the mixed strategy equi-
librium. From this it follows that once at least two players have entered the competition,
the expected payoff is zero. The free-entry equilibrium concept is therefore compatible

397
Chapter 12: Rent-Seeking
with any number of competitors greater than or equal to two, and all competitors who
enter play the mixed strategy.
There is an important distinction between this equilibrium and the one considered for
ﬁxed numbers. In the former case it was assumed (but without being explicitly stated)
that all competitors played the same strategy and only such symmetric equilibria were
considered. If this is applied to the free-entry case, it means that the entire (unlimited)
set of potential competitors must enter the game and play the mixed strategy given
by (12.4) as n →∞. An alternative to this cumbersome equilibrium is to consider an
asymmetric equilibrium in which different competitors play different strategies. An
asymmetric equilibrium of the game is for some competitors to choose not to enter
while some (at least 2) enter and play the mixed strategy in (12.4). All competitors
(both those who enter and those who do not) have an expected payoff of 0. The other
important feature of the both the symmetric and asymmetric free-entry equilibria is that
there is again complete dissipation of the rent. This ﬁnding is less surprising in this
case than it is with no-entry, since the entry could be expected to reduce the net social
value of the competition to zero.
In the probabilistic game contestants get a positive expected payoff from their rent-
seeking activities of V
n . Such a gain from rent-seeking will attract new contestants until
the rent value is fully dissipated, that is, n →∞and V
n →0. So free-entry will make
the two games equivalent with full dissipation of the rent.
12.3.4
Risk Aversion
The analysis so far has relied on the assumption that competitors for the prize care
only about the expected amount of money with which they will leave the contest.
This is a consequence of the assumption that they are risk neutral and hence indif-
ferent about accepting a fair gamble. Although risk neutrality may be appropriate in
some circumstances, such as for governments and large ﬁrms that can diversify risk,
it is not usually felt to correctly describe the behavior of individual consumers. It is
therefore worth reﬂecting on how the results are modiﬁed by the incorporation of risk
aversion.
The ﬁrst effect of risk aversion is that the expected monetary gain from entering the
contest must be positive in order for a competitor to take part—this is the compensation
required to induce the risk-averse competitors to take on risk. In terms of the deter-
ministic game with a mixed strategy equilibrium, for a given number of competitors
this means that less probability must be given to high levels of money burning and
more to lower levels. However, the expected utility gain of the contest will be zero,

398
Part IV: Political Economy
since competition will bid away any excess utility. In contrast to the outcome with risk
neutrality, there will not be complete dissipation of the rent. This is a consequence of
the expected monetary gain being positive, which implies that something must be left to
be captured. With risk aversion the resources expended on rent-seeking will be strictly
less than the value of the rent. But note carefully that this does not say that society has
beneﬁted. Since the expected utility gain of each competitor is zero, the availability of
the rent still does not raise society’s welfare.
The same reasoning applies to the probabilistic game with more risk-averse individ-
uals tending to expend less on rent-seeking activities. As a result a lower fraction of
the rent will be dissipated. The effect of free-entry will be to drive the expected utility
gain of each contender to zero.
12.3.5
Conclusions
This section has analyzed a simple game that can be interpreted as modeling the most
basic of rent-seeking situations. The burning of money captures the use of resources in
lobbying and the fact that these resources are not used productively. The fundamental
conclusion is that when competitors are risk neutral, competition leads to the complete
dissipation of the rent. This applies no matter how many competitors there are (provided
there are at least two) and whether or not the number of competitors is ﬁxed or variable.
This fundamental conclusion of the rent-seeking literature shows that the existence of
a rent does not beneﬁt society, since resources (possibly equal in value to that rent)
will be exhausted in capturing it. This conclusion has to be slightly modiﬁed with
risk aversion. In this case there is less expenditure on rent-seeking and thus less rent
dissipation. However, the expected utility gain of the competition is zero. In welfare
terms, society does not beneﬁt from the rent.
12.4
Social Cost of Monopoly
Monopoly is one of the causes of economic inefﬁciency. A monopolist restricts output
below the competitive level in order to raise price and earn monopoly proﬁts. This
causes some consumer surplus to be turned into proﬁt and some to become deadweight
loss. Standard economic analysis views this deadweight loss to be the cost of monopoly
power. The application of rent-seeking concepts suggests that the cost may actually be
much greater.

Monopoly deadweight loss
Consider ﬁgure 12.1. This depicts a monopoly producing with constant marginal cost
c and no ﬁxed costs. Its average revenue is denoted AR and marginal revenue MR.
The monopoly price and output are pm and ym respectively, while the competitive
output would be yc. Monopoly proﬁt is the rectangle π, and deadweight loss the
triangle d. In a static situation the deadweight loss d is the standard measure of the
cost of monopoly. (The emphasis on “static” is necessary here because there may
be dynamic gains through innovation from the monopoly that offset the deadweight
loss.)
How can the introduction of rent-seeking change this view of the cost of monopoly?
There are two scenarios in which it can do so. First, the monopoly position could have
been created by the government. An example would be the government deciding that
an airline route can be served only by a single carrier. If airlines must then compete
in lobbying for the right to ﬂy this route the situation is just like the money-burning
competition of section 12.3. The rent-seeking here comes from the bidders for the
monopoly position. Another example is the allocation in the late 1980s by the US
Federal Communications Commission of regional cell phone licenses. The lure of
extremely high potential proﬁts was strong enough to attract many contenders. There
were about 320,000 contestants competing for 643 licenses. Hazlett and Michaels
(1993)estimatedthetotalcostofallapplications(duetothetechnicalexpertiserequired)
to be about $400 million. Each winner earned very large proﬁts well in excess of their
application costs. However, the costs incurred by others were lost, and the total cost of

400
Part IV: Political Economy
the allocation of licenses was estimated to be about 40 percent of the market value of
the license. Second, the monopoly may be already in existence but in a position where
it has to defend itself from potential competitors. Such defense could involve lawyers
or an effective lobbying presence attempting to prevent the production of similar goods
using copyright or patent law, or it could mean advertising to stiﬂe competition. It could
even mean direct action to intimidate potential competitors.
Whichever case applies, the implications are the same. The value of having the
monopoly position is given by the area π. If there are a number of potential monopolists
bidding for the monopoly, then the analysis of money-burning can be applied to show
that if they are risk neutral, the entire value will be dissipated in lobbying.Alternatively,
if an incumbent monopolist is defending their position, they will expend resources up
to value π to do so. In both cases the costs of rent-seeking will be π.
Combining these rent-seeking costs with the standard deadweight loss of monopoly,
the conclusion of the rent-seeking approach is that the total cost of the monopoly to
society is at least d and may be as high as π + d. What determines the total cost is the
nature of the rent-seeking activity. We can conclude that resources of value π will be
expended but not how much is actually wasted. As the discussion of section 12.2 noted,
some of the costs may be transfer payments (or, more simply, bribes) to ofﬁcials. These
are not directly social costs but, again referring to section 12.2, may become so if they
induce rent-seeking in obtaining ofﬁcial positions. In contrast, if all the rent-seeking
costs are expended on unproductive activities, such as time spent lobbying, then the
total social cost of the monopoly is exactly π + d.
These results demonstrate one of the most basic insights of the rent-seeking literature:
the social costs of monopoly may be very much greater than measurement through
deadweight loss would suggest. To see the extent of the difference that this can make,
reconsider the measurements of welfare loss given in chapter 9. Harberger, using just the
deadweight loss d, calculated the cost of monopolization in US manufacturing industry
for the period 1924 to 1928 as equal to 0.08 percent of national income. In contrast,
the 1978 calculations by Cowling and Mueller followed the rent-seeking approach and
included the cost of advertising in the measure of welfare loss. Their analysis of US
industry concluded that welfare loss was between 4 and 13 percent of gross corporate
product. The difference between these measures reﬂects the additional loss through
rent-seeking.
This discussion of monopoly has shown that rent-seeking does have important impli-
cations. In particular, it strongly alters our assessment of the social costs of monopoly
and shows that the standard deadweight loss measure seriously understates the true
loss. This conclusion does not apply just to monopoly. Rent-seeking has the same

401
Chapter 12: Rent-Seeking
effect when applied to any distortionary government policy. This includes regulation,
tariffs, taxes, and spending. It also shows that the net costs of a distortionary policy
may be much higher than an analysis of benevolent government suggests. Attempts at
quantifying the size of these effects show that they can be very dramatic.
12.5
Equilibrium Effects
The discussion of monopoly welfare loss in the previous section is an example of partial
equilibrium analysis. It considered the monopolist in isolation and did not consider any
potential spillovers into related markets nor the consequences of rent-seeking for the
economy as a whole. This section will go some way toward remedying these omissions.
The analysis here will be graphical; an algebraic development of similar arguments will
be given in section 12.6.1.
Consider an economy that produces two goods and has a ﬁxed supply of labor. The
production possibility frontier depicting the possible combinations of output of the
two goods is denoted by ppf in ﬁgure 12.2. The competitive equilibrium prices ratio
pc = p1
p2 determines the gradient of the line tangent to the ppf at point a. This will be
the equilibrium for the competitive economy in the absence of lobbying.
The form of lobbying that we consider is for the monopolization of industry 1. If this
lobbying is successful, it will have two effects. The ﬁrst effect will be to change the rela-
tive prices in the economy. The second will be to use some labor in the lobbying process
that could be used productively elsewhere. The consequences of these effects will now
be traced on the production possibility diagram. Let the monopoly price for good 1 be
given by pm
1 and the monopoly price ratio be denoted by pm = pm
1
p2 . Since pm > pc, the
monopoly price line will be steeper than the competitive price line. This change in the
relative prices will move the economy from point a to point b around the initial produc-
tion possibility frontier (see ﬁgure 12.2). Evaluated at the competitive prices, the value
of output has fallen (point b lies below the extension of the competitive price line).
The consequence of accounting for the labor used in lobbying is derived by observ-
ing that the labor of lobbyists produces neither good 1 nor good 2 but is effectively
lost to the economy. This loss of labor reduces the potential output of the economy.
Hence the production possibility frontier with lobbying must lie inside that with-
out lobbying. This is shown in ﬁgure 12.3 where the production possibility frontier
with lobbying is denoted ppf L. With the monopoly price line the equilibrium with
both monopoly and lobbying will be at point c in ﬁgure 12.3. The outcome in ﬁgure
12.3 shows that the move to monopoly pricing shifts the equilibrium around the frontier

and lobbying shifts the frontier inward. The value at competitive prices of output at a
is higher than at b, and the value at b is higher than at c. Hence successful lobbying
has reduced the value of output by altering the price ratio and by causing an inward
move of the production possibility frontier. At the aggregate level this is damaging for
the economy. At the micro level there will be a transfer of income to the owners of
the monopoly and the lobbyists, and away from the consumers, so the outcome is not
necessarily bad for all individuals.
A further comparison that can be made is between the equilibrium with unsuccessful
lobbying where the resource cost of lobbying is incurred but the prices remain at the
competitive level (point d in ﬁgure 12.4) and monopoly with no lobbying (point b). As
panels a and b of ﬁgure 12.4 show, either outcome b or d could have the highest value
of output when computed using the competitive prices. From this it can be concluded
that there may be situations (as shown in ﬁgure 12.4b) where it is better to concede
to the threat of lobbying and allow the monopoly (without the lobbying taking place)
rather than refuse to concede to the lobby.
This section has extended the partial equilibrium analysis of lobbying to a general
equilibrium setting to illustrate the combined effects of the distortions generated by
successful lobbying and the waste of the resources used in the lobbying process. The
switch from the competitive to the monopoly price reduces the value of output. Includ-
ing lobbying moves the production possibility frontier inward. Moving the equilibrium
onto this new frontier can lower the value of output even further.

12.6
Government Policy
Rent-seeking may be important for the study of private-sector monopoly, but most
proponents of rent-seeking would see its application to government as being far more
signiﬁcant. Much analysis of policy choice views the government as benevolent and
trying to make the best choices it can. The rent-seeking model of government is very
different. This takes the view of the government as a creator of rents and those involved
in government as seeking rent wherever possible. Chapter 5 touched on some of these
issues in the discussion of bureaucracy, but that discussion can be extended much
further.
There are two channels through which the government is connected with rent-
seeking:
• Lobbying
We began this chapter by noting that the United States may have up to
100,000 professional lobbyists. These lobbyists attempt to change government policy
in favor of the interests that employ them. If the lobbyists are successful, rents are
created.
• Bureaucrats and politicians
Bureaucrats and politicians in government are able to
create rents through their policy choices. These rents can be “sold” to the parties that
beneﬁt. Selling rents generates income for the seller and gives an incentive for careers
to be made in politics and bureaucracy.
These two channels of rent-seeking are now discussed in turn.
12.6.1
Lobbying
The discussion so far has frequently referred to lobbying but without going into great
detail about its economic effects. Section 12.4 showed graphically how the use of labor
in lobbying shifted the production possibility frontier inward, but a graphical analysis
of that kind could not provide an insight into the size of the effects. The purpose now is
to analyze an example that can quantify the potential size of the economic loss resulting
from the use of labor in lobbying.
Many of the implications of lobbying can be found by analyzing the use of productive
labor to lobby for a tariff. The effect of a tariff is to make imports more expensive, so
allowing the home ﬁrm to charge a higher price and earn greater proﬁts. The potentially
higher proﬁt gives an incentive for lobbying. For example, the owners of textile ﬁrms
will beneﬁt from a lobby-induced tariff on imported clothing.Also the US steel industry

405
Chapter 12: Rent-Seeking
is a well-organized group and has long been active in encouraging tariffs on competing
imports. The resources used for lobbying have a social value (equal to their productivity
elsewhere in the economy), so the lobbying is not without cost. The calculations below
will reveal the extent of this cost.
Consider a small economy in which two consumption goods are produced. In the
absence of tariffs, the world prices of these commodities are both equal to 1, and
the assumption that the economy is small means that it treats these prices as ﬁxed.
Some output is consumed and some is exported. A quantity ¯ℓof labor is supplied
inelastically by consumers. This is divided between production of the two goods and
lobbying. Good 2 is produced with constant returns to scale, and one unit of labor
produces one unit of output. This implies that the wage rate, w, must equal 1 (if it were
higher, the ﬁrms would make a loss producing good 2; if it were lower, their proﬁt
would be unlimited since the price is ﬁxed at the world level).
The cost function for the ﬁrm producing good 1 is assumed to be C (y1) = 1
2 [y1]2,
where y1 is output. With a tariff τ, which may be zero, the price of good 1 on the
domestic market becomes 1 + τ. Assume that all of the output of the ﬁrm is sold on
the domestic market. Then the proﬁt level of the ﬁrm is
π1(τ) = y1[1 + τ] −1
2y2
1.
(12.14)
Proﬁt is maximized at output level
y1 = 1 + τ.
(12.15)
It can be seen from (12.15) that the output of good 1 is increasing in the value of the
tariff. The monopolist therefore produces a higher output if it succeeds in obtaining
tariff protection. The level of proﬁt that results from this output is given by
π1(τ) = 1
2[1 + τ]2 ,
(12.16)
so proﬁt increases as the square of the tariff. This indicates the beneﬁts that are obtained
from protection.
Equilibrium on the labor market requires that labor supply must equal the use of
labor in the production of good 1, ℓ1, plus that used in the production of good 2, ℓ2,
plus that used for lobbying, ℓL. Hence ¯ℓ= ℓ1 +ℓ2 +ℓL. The labor demand from ﬁrm 1
is ℓ1 = 1
2 [1 + τ]2. To determine the labor used in lobbying, the Complete Dissipation
Theorem of section 12.3 is applied. That is, it is assumed that resources are used in
lobbying up to the point at which the extra proﬁt they generate is exactly equal to the

406
Part IV: Political Economy
resource cost. Without lobbying, proﬁt is π1(0). After a successful lobby with a tariff
implemented, it becomes π1(τ). The value of labor that the ﬁrm will devote to lobbying
is therefore
ℓL = π1(τ) −π1 (0) = 1
2

2τ + τ 2
.
(12.17)
Hence the value of labor wasted in lobbying is increasing as the square of the tariff.
Finally, since the production of each unit of good 2 requires one unit of labor, the output
of good 2 equals the labor input into the production of that good, so ℓ2 = y2 or
y2 = ¯ℓ−1
2

1 + 4τ + 2τ 2
.
(12.18)
This shows that the output of good 2 is decreasing as the square of the tariff.
From these observations it can be judged that the rent-seeking is damaging the
economy, since the production of good 2 falls at a faster rate than the production of
good 1 increases. One method for quantifying the effect of this process is to determine
the value of national output at world prices. World prices are used since these are the
true measure of value. Doing this gives
y1 + y2 = ¯ℓ−1
2

2τ 2 + 2τ −1

.
(12.19)
Hence national income is reduced at the rate of the tariff squared. The conclusion in
(12.19) shows just how damaging rent-seeking can be. The possible availability of a
tariff causes resources to be devoted to lobbying. These resources are withdrawn from
the production of good 2 and national income, evaluated at world prices, declines.
12.6.2
Rent Creation
The analysis so far has focused primarily on the effects of rent-seeking in the presence
of preexisting rents. We now turn to study the other side of the issue: the motives for
the deliberate creation of rents. Such rent-creation is important because the existence
of a rent implies a distortion in the economy. Hence the economic cost of a created rent
is the total of the rent-seeking costs plus the cost of the economic distortion. This is the
sum of deadweight loss plus proﬁt identiﬁed in the section 12.4.
To be in a position to create rents requires the power to make policy decisions.
In most political systems this authority is formally vested in politicians. Assuming
that they are solely responsible for decision-making would, though, be shortsighted.

407
Chapter 12: Rent-Seeking
Politicians are advised and informed by bureaucrats. Many of the responsibilities for
formulating policy options and for clarifying the vague policy notions of politicians are
undertaken by bureaucrats. By carefully limiting the policies suggested or by choosing
their advice carefully, a bureaucrat may well be able to wield implicit political power.
It therefore cannot be judged in advance whether it is the politicians or the bureaucrats
who actually make policy decisions. This does not matter unduly. For the purpose of
the analysis, all that is necessary is that there is someone in a position to make decisions
that can create rents, be it a politician or a bureaucrat. When the arguments apply to
both politicians and bureaucrats, the generic term “policy maker” will be adopted.
How are rents created? To see this most clearly, consider an initial position where
there is a uniform rate of corporation tax applicable to all industries. A rent can then be
created by making it known that sufﬁcient lobbying will be met by a reduction in the
rate of tax. For instance, if the oil sector were to expend resources on lobbying, then
it would be made a special case and permitted a lower corporation tax. The arguments
already applied several times show that the oil sector will be willing to lobby up to a
value equal to the beneﬁt of the tax reduction. The creation of a monopoly airline route
mentioned in section 12.4 is another example of rent-creation.
The reason for the rent-creation can now be made clear. By ensuring that the nature
of the lobbying is in a form that they ﬁnd beneﬁcial, the policy maker will personally
gain. Such beneﬁts could take many forms, ranging from meals to gifts through to
actual bribes in the form of cash payments. Contributions to campaign funds are an
especially helpful form of lobbying for politicians, as are lucrative appointments after
a term of ofﬁce is completed. All of these forms of lobbying are observed to greater or
lesser degrees in political systems across the world.
It has already been noted that this rent-creation leads to the economic costs of the
associated rent-seeking. There are also further costs. Since there are rents to be gained
from being a politician or a bureaucrat (the returns from the lobbying), there will be
excessive resources devoted to securing these positions. Political ofﬁce will be highly
sought after with too many candidates spending too much money in seeking election.
Bureaucratic positions will be valued far in excess of the contribution that bureaucrats
make to economic welfare. Basically, if politicians or bureaucrats can earn rents, then
this will generate its own rent-seeking as these positions are competed for. In short,
the ability to create rents has cumulative effects throughout the system. The Complete
Dissipation Theorem can again be applied here: in expected terms these rents are
dissipated. It is important to bear in mind that the winner of the rent does gain: the
politician who is elected or the bureaucrat who secures their position will personally
beneﬁt from the rent. Losses arise for those who competed but failed to win.

408
Part IV: Political Economy
Two further effects arise. First, there will be an excessive number of distortions in-
troduced into the economy. Distortions will be created until there is no further potential
for the decision maker to extract additional beneﬁts from lobbyists. Second, there will
be an excessive number of changes in policy. Decision makers will constantly seek new
methods of creating rents and this will involve policy being continually revised. One
simple way for a new policy maker to obtain rents is to make tax rates uniform with a
broad base on appointment, and then gradually auction off exemptions throughout the
term of ofﬁce. The broader the chosen base, the greater the number of exemptions that
can be sold.
12.6.3
Conclusions
The discussion of this section has presented a very negative view of government and
economic policy-making. The rent-seeking perspective argues that decisions are not
made for reasons of economic efﬁciency but on the basis of how much can be earned
for making them. As a result the economy is damaged by inefﬁcient and distortionary
policies. In addition resources are wasted in the process of rent-seeking. Both lobbying
and attempting to obtain decision-making positions waste resources. When these are
combined, the damage to the economy is signiﬁcant. It suggests that political power is
sought after not as an end in itself but simply as a means to access rent.
12.7
Informative Lobbying
The discussion so far has presented a picture of lobbyists as a group who contribute
nothing to the economy and are just a source of welfare loss. To provide some balance,
it is important to note that circumstances can arise where lobbyists do make a positive
contribution. Lobbyists may be able to beneﬁt the economy if they, or the interest
groups they represent, have superior information about the policy environment than
the policy maker. By transmitting this information to the policy maker, they can assist
in the choice of a better policy.
Several issues arise in this process of information transmission. To provide a simple
description of these, assume that a policy has to be chosen for the next economic period.
At the time the policy has to be chosen, the policy maker is uncertain about the future
economic environment. This uncertainty is modeled by assuming that the environment
can be described by one of several alternative “states of the world.” Here a state of the
world is a summary of all relevant economic information. The policy maker knows

409
Chapter 12: Rent-Seeking
that different states of the world require different policy choices to be made, but they
do not know the future state of the world. Without additional information, the policy
maker would have to base policy choice upon some prior beliefs about the probability
of alternative states of the world. Unfortunately, if the chosen policy is not correct for
the state of the world that is realized, welfare will not be maximized.
Now assume that there is a lobbyist who knows which state of the world will occur.
It seems that if the lobbyist were just to report this information to the policy maker, then
the correct policy would be chosen and welfare maximized. But this misses the most
important point: the objectives of the lobbyist. If the lobbyist had the same preferences
as the policy maker, there would be no problem. The policy maker would accept the
information that was offered knowing that the lobbyist was pursuing the same ends.
In contrast, if lobbyists have different preferences, then they may have an incentive
to reveal false information about the future state of the world with the intention of
distorting policy in a direction that they ﬁnd beneﬁcial. Therefore the policy maker
faces the problem of determining when the information they receive from lobbyists is
credible and correct, and when it represents a distortion of the truth.
To see how these issues are resolved, consider a model where there are only two
possible values for the future state of the world. Let these values be denoted θh and θℓ
with θℓ< θh, where we term θh the “high state” and θℓis the “low state.” The policy
maker seeks to maximize a social welfare function that depends on the state of the
world and the policy choice, π. Suppose that this objective function takes the form
W(π, θ) = −[π −θ]2,
(12.20)
which implies that welfare loss is minimized when the policy choice is adapted to the
state of the world. If the policy maker had perfect information, then when the state was
known to be high, a high policy level πh = θH would be chosen. In contrast, when the
state was known to be low, a low policy level πℓ= θℓwould be chosen. Now assume
that the policy maker is uninformed about the state of the world and initially regards
the two states as equally likely. In this case the policy maker will choose a policy based
on the expected state of the world, so
πe = θℓ+ θh
2
.
(12.21)
That is, the policy maker sets the policy equal to the expected value of θ.
Now we introduce a lobbyist who knows what the state of the world will be. The
welfare of the lobbyist also depends on the policy level and the state of the world.
However, the lobbyist does not share the same view as the policy maker about the ideal

410
Part IV: Political Economy
policy level in each state. We assume that the ideal policy for the lobbyist exceeds the
ideal policy of the policy maker by an amount  in both states of the world. We can refer
to such a difference in the ideal policy as the extent of the disagreement between the
policy maker and the lobbyist. Such a lack of agreement can be obtained by adopting
preferences for the lobbyist given by
U(π, θ) = −[π −θ −]2 .
(12.22)
To ﬁnd the conditions under which the lobbyist can credibly transmit information
about the state of the world, we must investigate the incentives the lobbyist has to
truthfully report the state of the world. The lobbyist can only report either θh or θℓ, and
if he is trusted by the policy maker, the policy choice will be, respectively, πh or πℓ.
If the true state is θh the lobbyist has no incentive to misreport the information. Indeed
the lobbyist has a bias toward a high policy level; misreporting the state as being low
would lead to a policy πℓ, which is worse than the lobbyist’s ideal policy of πh + 
when the state is high. In contrast, if the state is θℓ, the lobbyist has a potential incentive
to misreport because a truthful report, if trusted by the policy maker, leads to a policy
level πℓthat is below the ideal policy of the lobbyist πℓ+ . The lobbyist may prefer
to claim that the state is high to exploit the trust and obtain policy πh instead of πℓ.
However, it may be that πh is too large for the lobbyist when the state is θℓ, in which
case the lobbyist will report truthfully. The latter is the case where πℓis closer to the
ideal policy of the lobbyist in the low state than πh, which occurs if the following
inequality is satisﬁed:
[θℓ+ ] −θℓ≤θh −[θℓ+ ].
(12.23)
This inequality reduces to
 ≤θh −θℓ
2
.
(12.24)
This condition says that policy maker can expect the lobbyist to truthfully report the
state of the world if the extent of the disagreement is not too large. The equilibrium
that results is fully revealing because the lobbyist can credibly transmit information
about the state of the world. Lobbying is then informative and desirable for the society.
If, in contrast, the inequality above is not satisﬁed, the extent of the disagreement is
too large for the policy maker to expect truthful reporting when the state is low. The
lobbyist’s report lacks credibility because the policy maker knows that the lobbyist
prefers reporting the high state no matter what the true state happens to be. The report

411
Chapter 12: Rent-Seeking
is then uninformative, and the policy maker will rightly ignore it. So the policy maker
sets the policy equal to the expected value πe = θℓ+θh
2
. This policy choice is subop-
timal for society because it is too large when the state is low and too small when the
state is high. Note that the lobbyist is also worse off with the uninformative outcome
because the policy choice πe is smaller than their ideal policy πh +  when the state
is high.
The problem of securing credibility is magniﬁed when there are more than two
states of the world. As the number of possible states increases, honest information
revelation becomes ever more difﬁcult to obtain. This is easily demonstrated. For
a lobbyist to credibly report the true state,  must be smaller than one-half of the
distance between any two adjacent states—this is the content of (12.24). With n states,
θ1 < . . . < θi < . . . < θn, the conditions for truth-telling are for all i = 1, . . . , n −1,
 ≤θi+1 −θi
2
.
(12.25)
Evidently, as the number of states grows, intermediate states are added, and this reduces
the distance between any two states. Eventually the states become too close to each
other for the lobbyist to be able to credibly communicate the true state, even if  is
small. Full revelation is then impossible. What can the lobbyist do in such a situation?
The answer is to reveal partial information, as pointed out by Crawford and Sobel
(1982).
Suppose that the states are partitioned into two intervals, L = (θ1, . . . , θi) and
H = (θi+1, . . . , θn). Then the lobbyist can report the interval in which the true state
falls, instead of reporting the precise state—we term this partial revelation. If he reports
L, then it means that θ1 ≤θ ≤θi. If all states are equally likely and equally spaced,
then a trusty policy maker sets the policy equal to the expected value on this interval
π(L) = θ1+θi
2
. Similarly the report H induces a policy choice π(H) = θi+1+θn
2
. The
question is whether the lobbyist has any incentive to lie.
Among the states in the interval L, the greatest temptation to lie (by reporting H) is
when the true state is close to θi: if the lobbyist does not want to claim H when θ = θi,
then he will not wish to do so when θ < θi, since this would push the policy choice
further away from his ideal policy. Hence we can restrict attention to the incentive to
report truthfully L when the true state is θi. Truthful reporting induces policy π(L)
and misreporting induces policy π(H). The lobbyist will report truthfully if the former
policy is closer than the latter to his ideal policy θi +  given the true state θi. This is
the case if

412
Part IV: Political Economy
[θi + ] −π(L) ≤π(H) −[θi + ] ,
(12.26)
which reduces to
θi +  ≤π(H) + π(L)
2
.
(12.27)
Now suppose that θ actually is in H. We must check the incentive of the lobbyist to
truthfully report H instead of L. The temptation to misreport is highest when the true
state is close to θi+1. In such a case, to sustain truthful reporting, it is required that the
lobbyist induce a policy π(H) that is closer to the ideal policy θi+1 + than the policy
that would be induced by misreporting π(L). That is,
[θi+1 + ] −π(L) ≥π(H) −[θi+1 + ],
(12.28)
which reduces to
θi+1 +  ≥π(H) + π(L)
2
.
(12.29)
Combining the two incentive constraints (12.27) and (12.29), truth-telling requires that
π(H) + π(L)
2
−θi+1 ≤ ≤π(H) + π(L)
2
−θi.
(12.30)
This condition puts both a lower bound and an upper bound on the extent of the dis-
agreement for the lobbyist to be able to communicate credibly partial information about
the state to the policy maker.
The outcome of this analysis is that lobbyists can raise welfare if they are able to
credibly report information to the policy maker. Unfortunately, this argument is limited
by the potential incentive to report false information when there is divergence between
the preferences of the lobbyist and the preferences of the policy maker. With a limited
number of states, credible correct transmission can be sustained if the divergence is not
too great. However, as the number of states of the world increases, credible transmission
cannot be sustained if there is any divergence at all in preferences. In this latter case,
though, it is possible to have partial information credibly released—again, provided that
the divergence is limited. In conclusion, informed lobbyists can be beneﬁcial through
the advice they can offer a policy maker, but this can be undermined by their incentives
to reveal false information.

12.8
Controlling Rent-Seeking
Much has been made of the economic cost of rent-seeking. These insights are interesting
(and also depressing for those who may believe in benevolent government) but are of
little value unless they suggest methods of controlling the phenomenon. This section
gathers together a number of proposals that have been made in this respect. There are
two channels through which rent-seeking can be controlled. The ﬁrst channel is to limit
the efforts that can be put into rent-seeking. The second is to restrict the process of
rent-creation.
Beginning with the latter, rent-creation relies on the unequal treatment of economic
agents. For instance, the creation of a monopoly is based on one economic agent being
given the right to operate in the market and all other agents being denied. Equally, offer-
ing a tax concession for one industry treats the agents in that industry more favorably
than those outside. Consequently a ﬁrst step in controlling rent-seeking is to disal-
low policies that discriminate among economic agents. Restricting the policy maker to
the implementation of nondiscriminatory policies would eliminate the creation of tax
breaks for special interests or the imposition of tariffs on particular imports. If restricted
in this way, the decision maker cannot auction off rents—if all parties gain, none has
the incentive to pay.
The drawback of a rule preventing discrimination is that it is sometimes economically
efﬁcient to discriminate. For example, the theory of optimal commodity taxation (see
chapter 15) describes circumstances where it is efﬁcient for necessities to be taxed
more heavily than luxuries. This would not be possible with nondiscrimination because
the industries producing necessities would have grounds for complaint. Similarly the
theory of income taxation (see chapter 16) ﬁnds that, in general, it is optimal to have a
marginal rate of income tax that is not uniform. If implemented, the taxpayers facing
a higher marginal rate would have ground for alleging discrimination. Hence a non-
discrimination ruling would result in uniform commodity and income taxes. These
would not usually be efﬁcient, so there would be a trade-off between economic losses
through restrictions on feasible policy choices and losses through rent-seeking. It is not
unlikely that the latter will outweigh the former.
There are other ways in which the process of rent-seeking can be lessened, but all
of these are weaker than a nondiscrimination rule. These primarily focus on ensuring
that the policy-making process is as transparent as possible. Among them would be
policies such as limiting campaign budgets, insisting on the revelation of names of
donors, requiring registration of lobbyists, regulating and limiting gifts, and reviewing

414
Part IV: Political Economy
bureaucratic decisions. Policing can be improved to lessen the use of bribes. Unlike
nondiscrimination, none of these policies has any economic implications other than
their direct effect on rent-seeking.
12.9
Conclusions
Lobbyists are very numerous in number; they are also engaged in an activity that is
not productive. The theory of rent-seeking provides an explanation for this apparent
paradox and looks at the consequences for the economy. The fundamental insight of
the literature is the Complete Dissipation Theorem: competition for a rent will result in
resources being expended up until the expected gain of society from the existence of the
rent is zero. If competitors for the rent are risk-neutral, this implies that the resources
used in rent-seeking are exactly equal in value to the size of the rent. The application
of these rent-seeking ideas show that the losses caused by distortions are potentially
much larger than the standard measure of deadweight loss.
The other aspect of rent-seeking is that economic policy makers have an incentive
to create distortions. They do this in order to receive beneﬁts from the resulting rent-
seeking. This leads to a perspective of policy driven not by what is good for the economy
but by what the policy maker can get out of it and of a politics corrupted by self-interest.
If this view is the correct description of the policy-making process, the response should
be to limit the discretion for policy makers. Last, lobbying can be desirable when the
lobbyists have better information about a policy-relevant variable than the policy maker.
The question is then how the lobbyists can credibly communicate this information when
there is some disagreement about the ideal policy choice.

(Coate and Morris 1995) This exercise is about rent-seeking in politics. The Tullock model
develops the common idea that rent-seeking leads to inefﬁciency. In terms of policy-making,
it is less clear that rent-seeking will lead to inefﬁcient policy simply because the policy maker
is maximizing his own utility (and the one of some special interest group). Surely any policy
change will reduce the welfare of the policy maker (and that of the interest group), so the
policy cannot be inefﬁcient in the Pareto sense. However, Tullock argued that politicians
would use disguised transfer mechanisms that are inefﬁcient relative to cash transfers.Could
you elaborate on this idea to demonstrate that excessive pork-barrel spending could reﬂect
inefﬁcient forms of redistribution to special interest groups?

Consider the informative lobbying model with only two states of nature θl < θh. It was
shown in the chapter that truth-telling by the lobbyist requires some upper bound on the
extent of the disagreement  > 0 (positive bias) between the lobbyist and the policy maker.
The upper bound was given by half the distance between the two possible states, that is,
 ≤θl−θh

. Now suppose that a second lobbyist can be consulted by the policy maker. This
second lobbyist knows the true state (i.e., both lobbyists have the same information). But she
has opposite preference to the other lobbyist, namely a negative bias in policy choice −.
So under state θi she prefers policy θi −, whereas the other lobbyist prefers θi + . Each
lobbyist reports independently either the low state or the high state.

Introduction
On April 17, 1975, the Khmer Rouge seized power in Cambodia. Pol Pot began to
implement his vision of Year Zero in which all inequalities—of class, money, educa-
tion, and religion—would be eliminated. Driven by their desire to achieve what they
perceived as the social optimum, the Khmer Rouge attempted to engineer a return to
a peasant economy. In the process they slaughtered an estimated two million people,
approximately one-quarter of Cambodia’s population. The actions of the Khmer Rouge
are an extreme example of the pursuit of equality and the willingness to accept an im-
mense loss in order to achieve it. In normal circumstances governments impose a limit
on the cost they are willing to pay for an improvement in equality.
When it comes to the efﬁciency/equity trade-off the Second Theorem of Welfare
Economics has very strong policy implications. These were touched on in chapter 2
but were not developed in detail at that point. This was because the primary value of
the theorem is what it says about issues of distribution. To fully appreciate the Second
Theorem, it is necessary to view it from an equity perspective and to assess it in the
light of its distributional implications.
This chapter will begin by investigating the implications of the Second Theorem
for economic policy. This is undertaken on the premise that a social planner is able
to make judgments between different allocations of utility. The concept of an optimal
allocation is developed and the Second Theorem is employed to show how this can
be achieved. Once this analysis has been accomplished, questions are raised about the
applicability of lump-sum taxes and the value of Pareto-efﬁciency as a criterion for
social decision-making. This provides a basis for re-assessing the interpretation of the
First Theorem of Welfare Economics.
The major deﬁciency of Pareto-efﬁciency is identiﬁed as its inability to trade utility
gains for one consumer against losses for another. This is important since most policy
changes will involve some people gaining while other people lose. To proceed further,
the informational basis for making welfare comparisons has to be addressed. We de-
scribe different forms of utility and different degrees of comparability of utility among
consumers. These concepts are then related to Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem and the
potential for constructing a social welfare function.

13.2
Social Optimality
The importance of the Second Theorem of Welfare Economics for policy analysis is
very easily explained. In designing economic policy, a policy maker will always aim
to achieve a Pareto-efﬁcient allocation. If an allocation that was not Pareto-efﬁcient
was selected, then it would be possible to raise the welfare of at least one consumer
without harming any other. It is hard to imagine why any policy maker would want
to leave such gains unexploited. If it is presumed that this argument is correct, the set
of allocations from which a policy maker will choose reduces to the Pareto-efﬁcient
allocations.
Suppose that a particular Pareto-efﬁcient allocation has been selected as the pol-
icy maker’s preferred outcome. The Second Theorem shows that this allocation can
be achieved by making the economy competitive and providing each consumer with
the level of income needed to purchase the consumption bundle assigned to him in the
chosen allocation. The consumers will then trade, and the chosen equilibrium will
emerge as the competitive equilibrium. This is the process of decentralization. In
achieving the decentralization of the allocation, only two policy tools are employed:
the encouragement of competition and a set of lump-sum taxes to ensure that each
consumer has the required income. If this approach could be applied in practice, then
economic policy analysis would reduce to the formulation of a set of rules that guarantee
competition and the calculation and redistribution of the lump-sum taxes. The subject
matter of public economics, and economic policy, in general, would then be closed.
Looking at this process in detail, the ﬁrst point that arises is the question of selecting
themostpreferredallocation. Thereareanumberofwaystoimaginethisbeingdone.An
obvious one would be to consider voting, either over the alternative allocations directly
or else for the election of a body (a “government”), to make the choice.Alternatively, the
consumers could agree for it to be chosen at random or else they might hold unanimous
views, perhaps via conceptions of fairness, about what the outcome should be. The
method that is considered here is to assume that there is a social planner (which could
be the elected government). This planner forms social preferences over the alternative
allocations by taking into account the utility levels of the consumers. The most preferred
allocation according to the social preferences is the one that is chosen.
To see how this method functions, consider the set of Pareto-efﬁcient allocations
described by the contract curve in the left-hand part of ﬁgure 13.1. Each point on
the contract curve is associated with an indifference curve for consumer 1 and an
indifference curve for consumer 2. These indifference curves correspond to a pair of

for the two consumers. As the move is made from the southwest
corner of the Edgeworth box to the northeast corner, the utility of consumer 1 rises and
that of 2 falls. These utility levels can be plotted by observing that each pair of utility
levels on the contract curve can be represented as a point in utility space. The loci
formed by these points is usually called the utility possibility frontier. This is shown in
the right-hand panel of ﬁgure 13.1 where the utility values corresponding to the points
a, b, and c are plotted. Points such as a and b lie on the frontier: they are Pareto-
efﬁcient, so it is not possible to raise both consumers’ utilities simultaneously. Point c
is off the contract curve and is inefﬁcient according to the Pareto criterion. It therefore
lies inside the utility possibility frontier.
The utility possibility frontier describes the Pareto-efﬁcient options from which the
social planner will choose. It is now necessary to describe how the choice is made. To do
this, it is assumed that the social planner measures the welfare of society by aggregating
the individual consumers’welfare levels. Given the pair of welfare levels

U1, U2
, the
function determining the aggregate level of welfare is denoted by W

U1, U2
. This is
termed a Bergson–Samuelson social welfare function. Basically, given individual levels
of happiness, it imputes a social level of happiness. Embodied within it are the equity
considerations of the planner. Two examples of social welfare functions are the utili-
tarian W = U1 + U2 and the Rawlsian (or maxi-min) W = min

U1, U2
. The social
indifference curves for these welfare functions are illustrated in ﬁgure 13.2, alongside
those for an “intermediate” social welfare function. These curves show combinations
of the two consumers’ utilities that give a constant level of social welfare. The view
on equity taken by the social planner translates into their willingness to trade off the

utility of one consumer against the utility of the other. This determines the shape of the
indifference curves. From the shape of the indifference curves it can be seen that the
utilitarian and Rawlsian social welfare functions represent two extremes. The utility of
one consumer can be substituted perfectly for that of another with the utilitarian social
welfare function, but no substitution is possible for the Rawlsian. The intermediate
case allows imperfect substitution.
Given the welfare function, the social planner considers the attainable allocations of
utility described by the contract curve and chooses the one that provides the highest level
of social welfare. Indifference curves of the welfare function can be drawn as in ﬁgure
13.3. The social planner then selects the outcome that achieves the highest indifference
curve. This optimal point on the utility possibility locus, denoted by point o, can then
be traced back to an allocation in the Edgeworth box. This allocation represents the
socially optimal division of resources for the economy given the preferences captured
by the social welfare function. If these preferences were to change, so would the optimal
allocation.
Having chosen the socially optimal allocation, the reasoning of the Second Theorem
is applied. Lump-sum taxes are imposed to ensure that the incomes of the consumers
are sufﬁcient to allow them to purchase their allocation conforming to point o. Com-
petitive economic trading then takes place. The chosen socially optimal allocation
is achieved through trade as the equilibrium of the competitive economy. This pro-
cess is called decentralization because the allocation is achieved as a consequence of
individuals making optimizing decisions rather than the social planner imposing the
allocation.

Social optimality
The decentralization argument shows that the use of the Second Theorem allows
the economy to achieve the outcome most preferred by its social planner. Given the
economy’s limited initial stock of resources, the socially optimal allocation reaches the
best trade-off between efﬁciency and equity as measured by the social welfare function.
In this way the application of the Second Theorem can be said to solve the economic
problem, since the issues of both efﬁciency and equity are resolved to the greatest
extent possible and there is no better outcome attainable. Clearly, if this reasoning
is applicable, all that a policy maker has to do is choose the allocation, implement
the required lump-sum taxes, and ensure that the economy is competitive. No further
policy or action is required. Once the incomes are set, the economy will take itself to
the optimal outcome.
13.3
Lump-Sum Taxes
The role of lump-sum taxes has been made very explicit in describing the application
of the Second Theorem. In the economic environment envisaged, lump-sum taxes are
the only tool of policy that is required beyond an active competition policy. To justify
the use of policies other than lump-sum taxes, it must be established that such taxes are
either not feasible or else are restricted in the way in which they can be employed. This
is the purpose of the next two sections. The results described are important in their own
right, but they also provide important insights into the design of other forms of taxation.

428
Part V: Equity and Distribution
In order for a tax to be lump sum, the consumer on whom the tax is levied must not
be able to affect the size of the tax by changing their behavior. Most tax instruments
encountered in practice are not lump sum. Income taxes cannot be lump sum by this
deﬁnitionbecauseaconsumercanworkmoreorlesshardandvaryincomeinresponseto
the tax. Similarly commodity taxes cannot be lump sum because consumption patterns
can be changed. Estate duties are lump sum at the point at which they are levied (since,
by deﬁnition, the person on which they are levied is dead and unable to choose any
other action) but can be affected by changes in behavior prior to death (e.g., by making
gifts earlier in life).
There are some taxes, though, that are close to being lump sum. For example, taxing
every consumer some ﬁxed amount imposes a lump-sum tax. Setting aside minor
details, this was effectively the case of the UK Poll Tax levied in the late 1980s as
a source of ﬁnance for local government. This tax was unsuccessful for two reasons.
First, taxpayers could avoid paying the tax by ensuring that their names did not appear
on any ofﬁcial registers. Usually this was achieved by moving house and not making
any ofﬁcial declaration of the new address. It appears large numbers of taxpayers did
this (unofﬁcial ﬁgures put the number as high as 1 million). This “disappearance” is
a change in behavior that reduces the tax burden. Second, the theoretical efﬁciency of
lump-sum taxes rests partly on the fact that their imposition is costless, though this
was far from the case with the Poll Tax. As it turned out, the difﬁculty of actually
collecting and maintaining information on the residential addresses of all households
made the imposition of a uniform lump-sum tax prohibitively expensive. The mobility
of taxpayers proved to be much greater than had been expected. Therefore, although
the structure of lump-sum taxes makes them appear deceptively simple to collect, this
may not be the case in practice, since the tax base (people) is highly mobile and keen
to evade. Consequently, in practice, even a uniform lump-sum tax has proved difﬁcult
and costly to administer.
However, the costs of collection are only part of the issue. The primary policy concern
is the possibility of employing optimal lump-sum taxes. Optimal here means a tax that
is chosen, via application of the Second Theorem, to achieve the income distribution
necessary to decentralize the chosen allocation of the social planner. The optimal lump-
sum tax system is unlikely to be a uniform tax on each consumer. This is because the
role of the lump-sum taxes is fundamentally redistributive, so the taxes will be highly
differentiated across consumers. Since even uniform lump-sum taxes are implemented
with difﬁculty, the use of differentiated taxes presents even greater problems.
The extent of these problems can be seen by considering the information needed to
calculate the taxes. First, the social planner must be able to construct the contract curve

429
Chapter 13: Optimality and Comparability
of Pareto-efﬁcient allocations so that the social optimum can be selected. Second, the
planner needs to predict the equilibrium that will emerge for all possible income levels
so that the incomes needed to decentralize the chosen allocation can be determined.
Both of these steps require knowledge of the consumers’preferences. Finally the social
planner must also know the value of each consumer’s endowment in order to calcu-
late their incomes before taxes and hence the lump-sum taxes that must be imposed.
The fundamental difﬁculty is that these economic characteristics, preferences and en-
dowments, are private information. As such they are known only to the individual
consumers and are not directly observed by the social planner. The characteristics may
be partly revealed through market choices, but these choices can be changed if the
consumers perceive any link with taxation. The fact that lump-sum taxes are levied on
private information is the fundamental difﬁculty that hinders their use.
Some characteristics of the consumers are public information, or at least can be
directly observed. Lump-sum taxes can then be levied on these characteristics. For
example, it may be possible to differentiate lump-sum taxes according to characteristics
of the consumers such as sex, age, or eye color. However, these characteristics are
not those that are directly economically relevant as they convey neither preference
information nor relate to the value of the endowment. Although we could differentiate
taxes on this basis, there is no reason why we should want to do so.
This returns us to the problem of private information. Since the relevant charac-
teristics such as ability are not observable, the social planner must either rely on
consumers honestly reporting their characteristics or infer them from the observed
economic choices of consumers. If the planner relies on the observation of choices,
there is invariably scope for consumers to change their market behavior, which then
implies that the taxes cannot be lump sum. When reports are the sole source of informa-
tion, unobserved characteristics cannot form a basis for taxation unless the tax scheme
is such that individuals are faced with incentives to report truthfully.
As an example of the interaction between taxes and reporting, consider the following.
Let the quality of a consumer’s endowment of labor be determined by their IQ level.
Given a competitive market for labor, the value of the endowment is then related to
IQ. Assume that there are no economically relevant variables other than IQ, so that
any set of optimal lump-sum taxes must be levied on IQ. If the level of lump-sum
tax was inversely related to IQ and if all households had to complete IQ tests, then the
tax system would not be cheated because the incentive would always be to maximize the
score on the test. In this case the lump-sum taxes are said to be incentive compatible,
meaning that they give incentives to behave honestly. In contrast, if the taxes were
positively related to IQ, a testing procedure could easily be manipulated by the high-IQ

430
Part V: Equity and Distribution
consumers who would intentionally choose to perform poorly. If such a system were
put into place, the mean level of tested IQ would be expected to fall considerably. This
indicates the potential for misrevelation of characteristics, and the system would not be
incentive compatible. Clearly, if a high-IQ results in higher earnings and, ultimately,
greater utility, a redistributive policy would require the use of lump-sum taxes that
increased with IQ. The tax policy would not be incentive compatible. As the next
section shows, such problems will always be present in any attempt to base lump-sum
taxes on unobservable characteristics.
13.4
Impossibility of Lump-Sum Taxes
Imagine that each individual in a society can be described by a list of personal at-
tributes upon which the society wishes to condition taxes and transfers (e.g. tastes,
needs, talents, and endowments). Individuals are also identiﬁed by their names and
possibly other publicly observable attributes (e.g., eye color), which are not judged to
be relevant attributes for taxation. The list of personal attributes associated to every
agent is not publicly known but is the private information of each individual. This
implies that the lump-sum taxes the government would like to implement must rely
on information about personal attributes which individuals must either report or reveal
indirectly through their actions.
Lump-sum taxes are incentive incompatible when at least one individual, who un-
derstands how the information that is reported will be used, chooses to report falsely.
We have already argued that there can be incentive problems in implementing opti-
mal lump-sum taxes. What we now wish to demonstrate is that these problems are
fundamental ones and will always afﬂict any attempt to implement optimal lump-sum
taxes. In brief, the argument will show that optimal lump-sum taxes cannot be incentive
compatible. This does not mean that lump-sum taxes cannot be used—for instance, all
individuals could be taxed the same amount—but only that the existence of private
information places limits on the extent to which taxes can be differentiated before in-
centives for the false revelation of information come into play. These issues are ﬁrst
illustrated for a particular example and then a general result is provided.
Before describing the general result a good illustration of the failure of incentive
compatibility is provided in the following example due to Mirrlees. Assume that indi-
viduals can have one of two levels of ability: either low or high. The low ability level
is denoted by sl and the high ability level by sh with sl < sh. For simplicity, suppose
the number with high ability is equal to the number with low. The two types have

431
Chapter 13: Optimality and Comparability
the same preferences over consumption, x, and labor, ℓas represented by the utility
function U(x, ℓ) = u(x) −v(ℓ). It is assumed that the marginal utility of consumption
is decreasing in x and the marginal disutility of labor is increasing in ℓ.
To determine the optimal lump-sum taxes, suppose that the government can observe
the ability of each individual and impose taxes that are conditioned upon ability. Let
the tax on an individual of ability level i be Ti > 0 (or a subsidy if Ti < 0). The budget
constraint of a type i is
xi = siℓi −Ti,
(13.1)
where earnings are siℓi. Given the lump-sum taxes, each type chooses labor supply to
maximize utility subject to this budget constraint. The choice of labor supply equates
the marginal utility of additional consumption to the disutility of labor
si

∂xi
−∂v

= 0.
(13.2)
This provides a labor-supply function ℓi = ℓi(Ti).
Now suppose that the government is utilitarian and chooses the lump-sum taxes to
maximize the sum of utilities. Then the optimal lump-sum taxes solve
max

u(siℓi (Ti) −Ti) −v(ℓi(Ti)),

subject to government budget balance, which requires
Th + Tl = 0,
(13.4)
since there are an equal number of the two types. This budget constraint can be used
to substitute for Tl in (13.3). Differentiating the resulting expression with respect to
the tax Th and using the ﬁrst-order condition (13.2) for the choice of labor supply, the
optimal lump-sum taxes are characterized by the condition
∂u
∂xh
= ∂u
∂xl
.
(13.5)
Since the marginal utility of consumption is decreasing in xi, the optimality condition
(13.5) implies that there is equality of consumption for the two types, xh = xl. When
this conclusion is combined with (13.2) and the fact that sl < sh, it follows that

432
Part V: Equity and Distribution
Under the assumption of an increasing marginal disutility of labor, this inequality shows
that the optimal lump-sum taxes should induce the outcome ℓh > ℓl, so the more able
work harder than the less able. The motivation for this outcome is that working the
high-ability type harder is the most efﬁcient way to raise the level of total income for
the society which can then be redistributed using the lump-sum taxes. Thus the high-
ability type works harder than the low-ability type but only gets to consume the same.
Therefore, the high-ability type is left with a lower utility level than the low-ability
type after redistribution.
Now suppose that the government can observe incomes but cannot observe the ability
of each individual. Assume that it still attempts to implement the optimal lump-sum
taxes. The taxes are obviously not incentive compatible because, if the high–ability
type understand the outcome, they can always choose to earn as little as the low–
ability type. Doing so then qualiﬁes the high–ability type for the redistribution aimed
at the low-ability type. This will provide them with a higher utility level than if they
did not act strategically. The optimal lump-sum taxes cannot then be implemented with
private information.
Who would work hard if the government stood ready to tax away the resulting
income? Optimal (utilitarian) lump-sum redistribution makes the more able individuals
worse off because it requires them to work harder but does not reward them with
additional consumption. In this context it is proﬁtable for the more able individuals
to make themselves seem incapable. Many people believe there is something unfair
about inequality that arises from the fact that some people are born with superior innate
ability or similar advantage over others. But many people also think it morally right
that one should be able to keep some of the fruits of one’s own effort. This example
may have been simple but its message is far-reaching. The Soviet Union and other
communist economies have shown us that it is impossible to generate wealth without
simultaneously offering adequate material incentives. Incentive constraints inevitably
limit the scope for redistribution.
This example is now shown to reﬂect a general principle concerning the incentive
compatibility of optimal lump-sum taxes. We state the formal version of this result
for a “large economy,” which is an economy where the actions of an individual are
insigniﬁcant relative to the economy as a whole. In other words, there is a continuum of
different agents, which is the mathematical form of the idealized competitive economy
with a very large number of small agents with no market power. The theorem shows
that optimal lump-sum taxation is never incentive compatible.

433
Chapter 13: Optimality and Comparability
Theorem 13.1 (Hammond)
In a large economy, redistribution through optimal lump-
sum taxes is always incentive incompatible.
The logic behind this theorem is surprisingly simple. A system of optimal lump-
sum taxes is used to engineer a distribution of endowments that will decentralize the
ﬁrst-best allocation. The endowments after redistribution must be based on the agents’
characteristics (recall that in the analysis of the SecondTheorem the taxes were based on
knowledge of endowments and preferences), so assume the endowment of an agent with
characteristics θi is given by ei = e (θi). For those characteristics that are not publicly
observable, the government must rely on an announcement of the values by the agents.
Assume, for simplicity, that none of the characteristics can be observed. Then the
incentive exists for each agent to announce the set of characteristics that maximize the
value of the endowment at the equilibrium prices p. This is illustrated in ﬁgure 13.4
where θ1 and θ2 are two potential announcements, with related endowments e (θ1) and
e (θ2), and θ∗is the announcement that maximizes pe (θ). The announcement of θ∗
leads to the highest budget constraint from among the set of possible announcements
and, by giving the agent maximum choice, allows the highest level of utility to be
attained. Consequently all agents will announce θ∗and the optimal lump-sum taxes
are not incentive compatible.
The main points of the argument can now be summarized. To implement the Second
Theorem as a practical policy tool, it is necessary to employ optimal lump-sum taxes.
Such taxes are unlikely to be available in practice or to satisfy all the criteria required

of them. The taxes may be costly to collect and the characteristics on which they
need to be based may not be observable. When characteristics are not observable,
the relationship between taxes and characteristics can give consumers the incentive to
make false revelations. It is therefore best to treat the Second Theorem as being of
considerable theoretical interest but of very limited practical relevance. The theorem
shows us what could be possible, not what is possible.
Lump-sum taxes can achieve the optimal allocation of resources provided all infor-
mation is public. If some of the characteristics that are relevant for taxation are private
information, then the optimal lump-sum taxes are not incentive compatible. Informa-
tion limitations therefore place a limit on the extent to which redistribution can be
undertaken using lump-sum taxation. It is the impracticality of lump-sum taxation that
provides the motive for studying the properties of other tax instruments. The income
taxes and commodity taxes that are analyzed in chapters 16 and 15 are second-best so-
lutions and are used because the ﬁrst-best solution, lump-sum taxation, is not available.
Lump-sum taxes are used as a benchmark from which to judge the relative success of
these alternative instruments. Lump-sum taxes also help clarify what it is that we are
really trying to tax.
13.5
Redistribution In-Kind
The lump-sum taxes we have been discussing are a very immediate form of redistribu-
tion. In practice, there are numerous widely used methods of redistribution that do not
directly involve taxation. Governments frequently provide goods such as education or
health services at less than their cost, which may be viewed as a redistributional policy.
One may expect that a cash transfer of the same value would have more redistributional
power than such in-kind transfer programs. This is mistaken. There are three reasons
why transfers in-kind may be superior to the cash transfers achieved through standard
tax-transfer programs.
Onereasonispolitical. Politicalconsiderationsdictatethatmanygovernmentsensure
that the provision of programs like education, pension, and basic health insurance
is universal. Without this feature the programs would not have the political support
required to be adopted or continued. For instance, public pensions and health care
would be far more vulnerable politically if they were targeted to the poor and not
available to others. Redistribution through cash would be even more vulnerable. It
should be noted that because a government program is universal, it does not follow
that there is no redistribution. First, if the program is ﬁnanced by proportional income

435
Chapter 13: Optimality and Comparability
taxation, the rich will contribute more to its ﬁnance than the poor. Second, even if
everyone contributes the same to the program, it is possible that the rich will not use
the publicly provided good to the same extent as the poor. Consider, for example, a
program of public provision of basic health care that is available to everyone for free
and ﬁnanced by a uniform tax on all households. Assume that there exists a private
health care alternative with higher quality than the public system but only available at
a cost. Since the rich can afford the higher quality, they will use the private health care,
even though free public health care is available. These rich households still pay their
contribution to the public program, and thus the poor households derive a net beneﬁt
from this cross-subsidization.
Another reason for preferring in-kind redistribution is self-selection. What ultimately
limits redistribution is that it will eventually become advantageous for higher ability
people to earn lower incomes by expending less effort and thereby paying the level
of taxes (or receiving the transfers) intended for the lower ability groups. The self-
selection argument is that anything that makes it less attractive for people to mimic those
with lesser ability will extend the limit to redistribution. The use of in-kind transfers
can obtain a given degree of redistribution more efﬁciently because of differences in
preferences among different income groups. Consider two individuals who differ not
only in their ability but also in their health status. Suppose that lesser ability means also
poorer health, so the less able spend relatively more on health. Then both income and
health expenditures act as a signal of ability. It follows that the limits to redistribution
can be relaxed if transfers are made partly in the form of provision of health care (or
equivalently with full subsidization of health expenditures). The reason is simply that
the more able individual (with less tendency to become ill) is less likely to claim in-kind
beneﬁts in the form of health care provision than he would be to claim cash beneﬁts. To
take another example, suppose that the government is considering redistribution either
in cash or in the form of low-quality housing. All households, needy or not, would like
thecashtransfer. However, fewnon-needyhouseholdswouldwanttoliveinlow-quality
housing as they can afford better housing. Thus self-selection occurs, and the non-needy
drop out of the housing program, which is taken up only by the needy. In short, transfers
in-kind invite people to self-select in a way that reveals their neediness. When need
is correlated with income-earning ability, then in-kind transfers can relax incentive
and selection constraints, thereby improving the government’s ability to redistribute
income.
A third reason is the idea of time consistency that we introduced in chapter 3. Here
the argument for in-kind transfers relies on the inability of government to commit to its
future actions. Unlike the argument of Strotz (1956) on government time inconsistency,

436
Part V: Equity and Distribution
this does not arise from a change in government objective over time (e.g., because of
elections) nor from the fact that the government is not welfaristic or rational. The time-
consistency problem arises from a perfectly rational government that fully respects
individualpreferencesbutthatdoesnothavethepowertocommittoitspolicyinthelong
run. The time-consistency problem is obvious with regard to pensions. To the extent that
households expect governments to provide some basic pension to those with too little
savings, their incentive to save for retirement consumption and provide for themselves
is reduced. Anticipating this, the government may prefer to provide public pensions.
A related time-consistency problem can explain why transfer programs, such as social
security, education, and job training are in-kind. If a welfaristic government cannot
commit not to come to the rescue of those in need in the future, potential recipients
will have little reason to invest in their education or to undertake job training because
the government will help them out anyway. Again, the government can improve both
economic efﬁciency and redistribution by making education and job training available
at less than their cost, rather than making cash transfers of equivalent value.
13.6
Aspects of Pareto-Efﬁciency
The analysis of lump-sum taxation has raised questions about the practical value of
the Second Theorem of Welfare Economics. Although the theorem shows how an
optimal allocation can be decentralized, the means to achieve the decentralization may
be absent. If the use of lump-sum taxes is restricted, the government must resort to
alternative policy instruments. All alternative instruments will be distortionary and
will not achieve the ﬁrst-best.
These criticisms do not extend to the First Theorem of Welfare Economics, which
states only that a competitive equilibrium is Pareto-efﬁcient. Consequently the First
Theorem implies no policy intervention, so it is safe from the restrictions on lump-
sum taxes. However, at the heart of the First Theorem is the use of Pareto-efﬁciency
as a method for judging the success of an economic allocation. The value of the First
Theorem can only be judged once a deeper understanding of Pareto-efﬁciency has been
developed.
The Pareto criterion was introduced into economics by the Italian economist Vilfredo
Pareto at the beginning of the twentieth century. This was a period of reassessment in
economics during which the concept of utility as a measurable entity was rejected.
Alongside this rejection of measurability, the ability to compare utility levels be-
tween consumers also had to be rejected. Pareto-efﬁciency was therefore constructed

437
Chapter 13: Optimality and Comparability
explicitly to allow comparisons of allocations without the need to make any interper-
sonal comparisons of utility. As will be seen, this avoidance of interpersonal compar-
isons is both its strength and its main weakness.
To assess Pareto-efﬁciency, it is helpful to develop the concept in three stages. The
ﬁrst stage deﬁnes the idea of making a Pareto improvement when moving from one
allocation to another. From this can be constructed the Pareto preference order that
judges whether one allocation is preferred to another. The ﬁnal stage is to use Pareto
preference to ﬁnd the most preferred states, which are then deﬁned as Pareto-efﬁcient.
Reviewing each of these steps allows us to assess the meaning and value of the concept.
Consider a move from economic state s1 to state s2. This is deﬁned as a Pareto
improvement if it makes some consumers strictly better off and none worse off. If there
are H consumers, this deﬁnition can be stated formally by saying a Pareto improvement
is made in going from s1 to s2 if
Uh (s2) > Uh (s1)
for at least one consumer, h,
(13.7)
and
Uh (s2) ≥Uh (s1)
for all consumers h = 1, . . . , H.
(13.8)
The idea of a Pareto improvement can be used to construct a preference order over
economic states. If a Pareto improvement is made in moving from s1 to s2, then state
s2 is deﬁned as being Pareto-preferred to state s1. This concept of Pareto preference
deﬁnes one state as preferred to another if all consumers are at least as well off in
that state and some are strictly better off. It is important to note that this stage of the
construction has converted the set of individual preferences of the consumers into social
preferences over the states.
The ﬁnal stage is to deﬁne Pareto-efﬁciency. The earlier deﬁnition can be re-phrased
as saying that an economic state is Pareto-efﬁcient if there is no state that is Pareto-
preferred to it. That is, no move can be made from that state to another that achieves
a Pareto improvement. From this perspective, we can view Pareto-efﬁcient states as
being the “best” relative to the Pareto preference order. The discussion now turns to
assessing the usefulness of Pareto preference in selecting an optimal state from a set of
alternatives. By analyzing a number of examples, several deﬁciencies of the concepts
will become apparent.
The simplest allocation problem is to divide a ﬁxed quantity of a single commodity
between two consumers. Let the commodity be a cake, and assume that both consumers
prefer more cake to less. The ﬁrst observation is that no cake should be wasted—it is

438
Part V: Equity and Distribution
always a Pareto improvement to move from a state where some is wasted to one with
the wasted cake given to one, or both, of the consumers. The second observation is that
any allocation in which no cake is wasted is Pareto-efﬁcient. To see this, start with any
division of the cake between the two consumers. Any alternative allocation must give
more to one consumer and less to the other; therefore, since one must lose some cake,
no change can be a Pareto improvement.
From this simple example two deﬁciencies of Pareto-efﬁciency can be inferred. First,
since no improvement can be made on an allocation where none is wasted, extreme
allocations such as giving all of the cake to one consumer are Pareto-efﬁcient. This
shows that even though an allocation is Pareto-efﬁcient, there is no implication that it
need be good in terms of equity. This illustrates quite clearly that Pareto-efﬁciency is
not concerned with equity. The cake example also illustrates a second point: there can
be a multiplicity of Pareto-efﬁcient allocations. This was shown in the cake example
by the fact that every nonwasteful allocation is Pareto-efﬁcient. This multiplicity of
efﬁcient allocations limits the value of Pareto-efﬁciency as a tool for making allocative
decisions. For the cake example, Pareto-efﬁciency gives no guidance whatsoever in
deciding how the cake should be shared, other than showing that none should be thrown
away. In brief, Pareto-efﬁciency fails to solve even this simplest of allocation problems.
The points made in the cake division example are also relevant to allocations within
a two-consumer exchange economy. The contract curve in ﬁgure 13.5 shows the set
of Pareto-efﬁcient allocations, and there is generally an inﬁnite number of these. Once
again the Pareto preference ordering does not select a unique optimal outcome. In
addition the competitive equilibrium may be as the one illustrated in the bottom left
corner of the box. This has the property of being Pareto-efﬁcient, but it is highly
inequitable and may not ﬁnd much favor using other criteria for judging optimality.

Incompleteness of Pareto ranking
Another failing of the Pareto preference ordering is that it is not always able to
compare alternative states. In formal terms, it does not provide a complete ordering
of states. This is illustrated in ﬁgure 13.6 where the allocations s1 and s2 cannot be
compared, although both can be compared to s3 (s3 is Pareto-preferred to both s1 and
s2). When faced with a choice between s1 and s2, the Pareto preference order is silent
about which should be chosen. It should be noted that this incomparability is not the
same as indifference. If the preference order were indifferent between two states, then
they are judged as equally good. Incomparability means the pair of states simply cannot
be ranked.
The basic mechanism at work behind this example is that the Pareto preference order
can only rank alternative states if there are only gainers or only losers as the move is
made between the states. If some gain and some lose, as in the choice between s1 and
s2 in ﬁgure 13.6, then the preference order is of no value. Such gains and losses are
invariably a feature of policy choices and much of policy analysis consists of weighing
up the gains and losses. In this respect Pareto-efﬁciency is insufﬁcient as a basis for
policy choice.
To summarize these arguments, Pareto-efﬁciency does not embody any concept of
justice, and highly inequitable allocations can be efﬁcient under the criterion. In many
situations there are very many Pareto-efﬁcient allocations, in which case the criterion
provides little guidance for policy choice. Finally Pareto-efﬁciency may not provide a
complete ordering of states, so some states will be incomparable under the criterion.
The source of all these failing is that the Pareto criterion avoids weighing gains against
losses, but it is just such judgments that have to be made in most allocation decisions.
To make a choice of allocation, the evaluation of the gains and losses has to be faced
directly.

13.7
Social Welfare Functions
The social welfare function was employed in section 13.2 to introduce the concept of a
socially optimal allocation. At that point it was simply described as a means by which
different allocations of utility between consumers could be socially ranked. What was
not done was to provide a convincing description of where such a ranking could come
from or of how it could be constructed. Three alternative interpretations will now be
given, each of which provides a different perspective on the social welfare function.
The ﬁrst possibility is that the social welfare function captures the distributive pref-
erences of a central planner or dictator. Under this interpretation there can be two
meanings of the individual utilities that enter the function. One is that they are the
planner’s perception of the utility achieved by each consumer at their level of con-
sumption. This provides a consistent interpretation of the social welfare function, but
problems arise in its relation to the underlying model. To see why this is so, recall that
the Edgeworth box and the contract curve within it were based on the actual preferences
of the consumers. There is then a potential inconsistency between this construction and
the evaluation using the planner’s preferences. For example, what is Pareto-efﬁcient
under the true preferences may not be one under the planner’s (it need not even be an
equilibrium).
The alternative meaning of the utilities is that they are the actual utilities of the
consumers. This leads directly into the central difﬁculty faced in the concept of social
welfare. In order to evaluate all allocations of utility it must be possible to determine
the social value of an increase in one consumer’s utility against the loss in another’s.
This is only possible if the utilities are comparable across the consumers. More will be
said about this below.
The second interpretation of the social welfare function is that it captures some
ethical objective that society should be pursuing. Here the social welfare function is
determined by what is viewed as the just objective of society. There are two major
examples of this. The utilitarian philosophy of aiming to achieve the greatest good for
society as a whole translates into a social welfare function that is the sum of individual
utilities. In this formulation only the total sum of utilities counts, so it does not matter
how utility is distributed among consumers in the society. Alternatively, the Rawlsian
philosophy of caring only for the worst-off member of society leads to a level of social
welfare determined entirely by the minimum level of utility in that society. With this
objective the distribution of utility is of paramount importance. Gains in utility achieved
by anyone other than the worst-off consumer do not improve social welfare.

441
Chapter 13: Optimality and Comparability
Although this approach to the social welfare function is internally consistent, it is
still not entirely satisfactory. The utilitarian approach requires that the utilities of the
consumers be added in order to arrive at the total sum of social welfare. The Rawlsian
approach necessitates the utility levels being compared in order to ﬁnd the lowest.
The nature of the utility comparability is different for the two approaches (being able
to add utilities is different to being able to compare), but both rely on some form of
comparability. This again leads directly into the issue of utility comparisons.
The ﬁnal view that can be taken of the social welfare function is that it takes the
preferences of the individual consumers (represented by their utilities) and aggregates
these into a social preference. This aggregation process would be expected to obey
certain rules; for instance, if all consumers prefer one state to another, it should be the
case that the social preference also prefers the same state. The structure of the social
welfare function then emerges as a consequence of the rules the aggregation must
obey.
Although this arrives at the same outcome as the other two interpretations, it does
so by a distinctly different process. In this case it is the set of rules for aggregation
that are foremost rather than the form of social welfare. That is, the philosophy here
would be that if the aggregation rules are judged as satisfactory, then society should
accept the social welfare function that emerges from their application, whatever its
form. An example of aggregating preferences is the rule of majority voting (despite
the failings already identiﬁed in chapter 11), since the minority must accept what the
majority chooses.
The consequences of constructing a social welfare function by following this argu-
ment are of fundamental importance in the theory of welfare economics. In fact doing so
leads straight back intoArrow’s Impossibility Theorem, which was described in chapter
11. The next section is dedicated to interpreting the theorem and its implications in this
new setting.
13.8
Arrow’s Theorem
Although they appear very distinct in nature, both majority voting and the Pareto
criterion are examples of procedures for aggregating individual preferences into a social
preference. It has been shown that neither is perfect. The Pareto preference order
can be incomplete and unable to rank some of the alternatives. Majority voting
always leads to a complete social preference order, but this may not be transitive. What
Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem has shown is that such failings are not speciﬁc to these

442
Part V: Equity and Distribution
aggregation procedures. All methods of aggregation will fail to meet one or more of its
conditions, so the Impossibility Theorem identiﬁes a fundamental problem at the heart
of generating social preferences from individual preferences.
The conditions ofArrow’s theorem were stated in terms of the rankings induced by in-
dividual preferences. However, since individual preferences can usually be represented
by a utility function, the theorem also applies to the aggregation of individual utility
functions into a social welfare function. The implication behind applying the theorem
is that a social welfare function does not exist that can aggregate individual utilities
without conﬂicting with one, or more, of the conditions I.N.P.U.T . This means that
whatever social welfare function is proposed, there will be some set of utility functions
for which it conﬂicts with at least one of the conditions. In other words, no ideal social
welfare function can be found. No matter how sophisticated the aggregation mechanism
is, it cannot overcome this theorem.
Since the publication of Arrow’s theorem there has been a great deal of research
attempting to ﬁnd a way out of the dead end into which it leads. One approach that has
been tried is to consider alternative sets of aggregation rules. For instance, transitivity of
the social preference ordering can be relaxed to quasi-transitivity (only strict preference
is transitive) or weaker versions of condition I and condition P can be used. Most such
changes just lead to further impossibility theorems for these different sets of rules.
Modifying the rules does not therefore really seem to be the way forward out of the
impossibility.
What is at the heart of the impossibility is the limited information contained in
individual utility functions. Effectively all that is known is the individuals’ rankings
of the alternatives—which is best, which is worst, and how they line up in between.
What the rankings do not give is any strength of feeling either between alternatives for
a given individual or across individuals for a given option. Such strength of feeling is
an essential art of any attempt to make social decisions. Consider, for instance, a group
of people choosing where to dine. In this situation a strong preference in one direction
(“I really don’t want to eat ﬁsh”) usually counts for more than a mild preference (“I
don’t really mind, but I would prefer ﬁsh”). Arrow’s theorem rules out any information
of this kind.
Using information on how strongly individuals feel about the alternatives can be
successful in choosing where to dine. It is interesting that the strength of preference
comparisons can be used in informal situations, but this does not demonstrate that it
can be incorporated within a scientiﬁc theory of social preferences. This issue is now
addressed in detail.

443
Chapter 13: Optimality and Comparability
13.9
Interpersonal Comparability
Earlier in this chapter it was noted that Pareto-efﬁciency was originally proposed be-
cause it provided a means by which it was possible to compare alternative allocations
without requiring interpersonal comparisons of welfare. It is also from this avoidance
of comparability that the failures of Pareto-efﬁciency emerge. This point is at the core
of the Impossibility Theorem. To proceed further, this section ﬁrst reviews the devel-
opment of utility theory in order to provide a context and then describes alternative
degrees of utility comparability.
Nineteenth-century economists viewed utility, the level of happiness of an individual,
as something that was potentially measurable. Advances in psychology were expected
to deliver the machinery for conducting the actual measurement. If utility were measur-
able, it follows naturally that it would be comparable among individuals. This ability to
measure utility, combined with the philosophy that society should aim for the greatest
good, came to provide the underpinnings of utilitarianism. The measurability of utility
permitted social welfare to be expressed by the sum of individual utilities. Ranking
states by the value of this sum then gave a means of aggregating individual preferences
that satisﬁed all of the conditions of the impossibility theorem except for the infor-
mation content. If the envisaged degree of measurability could be achieved, then the
restrictions of the impossibility theorem are overcome.
This concept of measurable and comparable utility began to be dispelled in the early
twentieth century. There were two grounds for this rejection. First, no means of mea-
suring utility had been discovered, and it was becoming clear that the earlier hopes
would not be realized. Second, advances in economic theory showed that there was
no need to have measurable utility in order to construct a coherent theory of consumer
choice. In fact the entire theory of the consumer could be derived by specifying only the
consumer’s preference ordering. The role of utility then became strictly secondary—it
could be invoked to give a convenient function to represent preferences if necessary
but was otherwise redundant. Since utility had no deeper meaning attached to it, any
increasing monotonic transformation of a utility function representing a set of pref-
erences would also be an equally valid utility function. Utility was simply an ordinal
concept, with no natural zero or units of measurement. By the very construction of util-
ity, comparability between different consumers’ utilities was a meaningless concept.
This situation therefore left no scientiﬁc basis on which to justify the comparability of
different consumer’s utility levels.

444
Part V: Equity and Distribution
This perspective on utility, and the consequent elimination of utility comparisons
among consumers, created the need to develop concepts for social comparisons, such
as Pareto-efﬁciency, that were free of interpersonal comparisons. However, the weak-
nesses of these criteria soon became obvious. The analytical trend since the 1960s has
been to explore the consequences of re-admitting interpersonal comparability into the
analysis. The procedure adopted is basically to assume that comparisons are possible.
This permits the derivation of results from which interpretations can be obtained. These
are hoped to provide some general insights into policy that can be applied, even though
utility is not actually comparable in the way assumed.
There are even some economists who would argue that comparisons are possible.
One basis for this is the claim that all consumers have very similar underlying pref-
erence orderings. All prefer to have more income to less, and consumers with equal
incomes make very similar divisions of expenditures between alternative groups of
commodities. For example, expenditure on food is similar, even though the actual
foodstuffs purchased may be very different. In modeling such consumers, it is possible
to assert that they all have the same utility function guiding their choices. This makes
their utilities directly comparable.
So far comparability has been used as a catch-all phrase for being able to draw
some contrast between the utility levels of consumers. In fact many different degrees
of comparability can be envisaged. For instance, the claim that one household has a
higher level of utility than another requires rather less comparability than claiming it
has 15 percent more utility. Different degrees of comparability have implications for the
way in which individual utilities can be aggregated into a social preference ordering.
The starting point for discussing comparability is to deﬁne the two major forms of
utility. The ﬁrst is ordinal utility, which is the familiar concept from consumer theory.
Essentially an ordinal utility function is no more than just a numbering of a consumer’s
indifference curves, with the numbering chosen so that higher indifference curves have
higher utility numbers. These numbers can be subjected to any form of transformation
without altering their meaning, provided that the transformation leaves the ranking
of the numbers unchanged—higher indifference curves must still have larger utility
numbers attached. Because they can be so freely transformed, there is no meaning to
differences in utility levels between two situations for a single consumer except which
of the two provides the higher utility.
The second form of utility is cardinal utility. Cardinal utility imposes restrictions be-
yond those of ordinal utility. With cardinal utility one can only transform utility numbers
by multiplying by a constant and then adding a constant, so an initial utility function
U becomes the transformed utility ˜U = a + bU, where a and b are the constants. Any

445
Chapter 13: Optimality and Comparability
other form of transformation will affect the meaning of a cardinal utility function. The
typical place where cardinal utility is found is in the economics of uncertainty, since
an expected utility function is cardinal. This cardinality is a consequence of the fact
that an expected utility function must provide a consistent ranking for different prob-
ability distributions of the outcomes. (A noneconomic example of a cardinal scale is
temperature. It is possible to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit by multiplying by 9
5 and
adding 32. The converse transformation from Fahrenheit to Celsius is to multiply by 5
9
and subtract 32.) With these deﬁnitions it now becomes possible to talk in detail about
comparability and noncomparability.
Noncomparability can arise with both ordinal and cardinal utility. What noncompa-
rability means is that we can apply different transformations to different consumers’
utilities. To express this in formal terms, let U1 be the utility function of consumer 1
and U2 the utility function of consumer 2. Then noncomparability arises if the trans-
formation f 1 can be applied to U1 and a different transformation f 2 to U2, with no
relationship between f 1 and f 2. Why is this noncomparable? The reasoning is that
by suitably choosing f 1 and f 2, it is always possible to start with one ranking of the
initial utilities and to arrive at a different ranking of the transformed utilities. The utility
information therefore does not provide sufﬁcient information to make a comparison of
the two utility levels.
Comparability exists when the transformations that can be applied to the utility
functions are restricted. With ordinal utility there is only one possible degree of compa-
rability. This occurs when the ordinal utilities for different consumers can be subjected
only to the same transformation. The implication of this is that the transformation pre-
serves the ranking of utilities among different consumers. So, if one consumer has a
higher utility than another before the transformation, the same consumer will have a
higher utility after the transformation. Letting this transformation be denoted by f ,
then if U1 ≥U2, it must be the case that f

U1
≥f

U2
. This form of comparability
is called ordinal level comparability.
If the underlying utility functions are cardinal, there are two forms of comparability
that are worth discussing. The ﬁrst form of comparability is to assume that the constant
multiplying of utility in the transformation must be the same for all consumers, but the
constant that is added can differ. Hence for two consumers the transformed utilities are
˜U1 = a1 + bU1 and ˜U2 = a2 + bU2, so the constant b is the same for both. This is
called cardinal unit comparability. The implication of this transformation is that it now
becomes meaningful to talk about the effect of changes in utility, meaning that gains to
one consumer can be measured against losses to another—and whether the gain exceeds
the loss is not affected by the transformation. The second degree of comparability for

446
Part V: Equity and Distribution
cardinal utility is to further restrict the constant a in the transformation to be the same
for both consumers. For all consumers the transformed utility becomes 
Uh = a +bUh.
It is now possible for both changes in utility and levels of utility to be compared. This
form of comparability is called cardinal full comparability.
The next step is to explore the implications of these comparabilities for the con-
struction of social welfare functions. It will be shown that each form of comparability
implies different permissible social welfare functions.
13.10
Comparability and Social Welfare
The discussion of Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem showed that the failure to success-
fully generate a social preference ordering from a set of individual preference orderings
was the result of limited information. The information content of an individual’s pref-
erence order involves nothing more than knowing how they rank the alternatives. A
preference order does not convey any information on the strength of preferences or
allow comparison of utility levels across consumers. When more information is avail-
able, it becomes possible to ﬁnd social preference orderings that satisfy the conditions
I, N, P, U, T. Such information can be introduced by building social preferences on
individual utility functions that allow for comparability.
What this section shows is that for each form of comparability there is a speciﬁca-
tion of social welfare function that is consistent with the information content of the
comparable utilities. To explain what is meant by consistent, recall that comparability
is described by a set of permissible transformations of utility. A social welfare func-
tion is consistent if it ranks the set of alternative social states in the same way for
all permissible transformations of the utility functions. Since increasing the degree of
comparability reduces the number of permissible transformations, it has the effect of
increasing the set of consistent social welfare functions.

allocations A and B, the social welfare function is consistent with the transformation
(and hence the form of comparability) if W(A) ≥W(B) implies ˜W(A) ≥˜W(B). In
words, if A generates higher social welfare than B for the basic utilities, it will also do
so for the transformed utilities.

To demonstrate these points, assume there are two consumers with the basic utility
functions U1 = [x]1/2 [y]1/2 and U2 = x + y, where x and y are the consumption
levels of the two goods. Further assume that there are two allocations A and B with the
consumption levels, and the resulting utilities, as shown in table 13.1.
The ﬁrst point to establish is that it is possible to ﬁnd a social welfare function that
is consistent with ordinal level comparability but none that is consistent with ordinal
noncomparability. What level comparability allows is the ranking of consumers by
utility level (think of placing the consumers in a line with the lowest utility level ﬁrst).
Aposition in this line (e.g., the ﬁrst, or the tenth, or the nth) can be chosen, and the level
of utility of the consumer in that position used as the measure of social welfare. This
process generates a positional social welfare function. The best known example is the
Rawlsian social welfare function, W = min

Uh
, which judges social welfare by the
minimum level of utility in the population.An alternative that shows other positions can
be employed (though not one that is often used) is to measure social welfare measure
by the maximum level of utility, W = max

Uh
.
That such positional welfare functions are consistent with ordinal level comparabil-
ity but not with ordinal noncomparability is shown in table 13.2 using the allocations A
and B introduced above. For the social welfare function W = min

Uh
, the welfare
level in allocation A is 5 and that in allocation B is 4. Therefore allocation A is judged
superior using the basic utilities.An example of a pair of transformations that satisfy or-
dinal noncomparability are ˜U1 = f 1
U1
= 3U1 and ˜U2 = f 2
U2
= 2U2. The lev-
els of utility and resulting social welfare are displayed in the upper part of table 13.2. The
table shows that the preferred allocation is now B, so the transformation has changed
the preferred social outcome. With ordinal level comparability, the transformations
f 1
U1
and f 2
U2
must be the same. For example, let the transformation be given
by ˜Uh = f

Uh
=

Uh2. The values of the transformed utilities in the lower part
of the table conﬁrm that allocation A is preferred—as it was with the basic utili-
ties. The positional social welfare function is therefore consistent with ordinal level
comparability.

Although cardinal utility is often viewed as stronger concept than ordinal utility,
cardinality alone does not permit the construction of a consistent social welfare func-
tion. Recalling that transformations of the form f h = ah + bhUh can be applied with
noncomparability, it can be seen that even positional welfare functions will not be con-
sistent, since ah can always be chosen to change the social ranking generated by the
transformed utilities compared to that generated by the basic utilities. In contrast, if
utility satisﬁes cardinal unit comparability, it is possible to use social welfare functions
of the form
W =
H

h=1
αhUh,
(13.9)
where the αh are constants. To demonstrate this, and to show that social welfare function
is not consistent with cardinal noncomparability, assume that α1 = 2 and α2 = 1. Then,
under the basic utility functions, the social welfare levels in the two allocations are
W(A) = 2 × 6 + 5 = 17 and W(B) = 2 × 4 + 7 = 15, so allocation A is preferred.
The upper part of table 13.3 displays two transformations satisfying noncomparability
and the implied value of social welfare. This shows that allocation B will be preferred
with the transformed utility. Therefore the social welfare function is not consistent
with the transformations. With cardinal unit comparability, the transformations are
restricted to have a common value for bh, so ˜Uh = ah+bUh. Two such transformations
are selected, and the resulting utility levels are given in the lower part of the table.
Calculation of the social welfare shows the preferred allocation to be A as it was with
the basic utilities. Therefore with cardinal level comparability, social welfare functions

of the form (13.9) are consistent and provide a social ranking that is invariant for the
permissible transformations.
With cardinal full comparability the transformations must satisfy ˜Uh = a + bUh.
One interesting example of the forms of social welfare function that are consistent with
such transformations is
W = ¯U + γ min

Uh −¯U

,
¯U =
	H
h=1 Uh
H
,
(13.10)
where γ is a parameter that can be chosen. This form of social welfare function
is especially interesting because it is the utilitarian social welfare function when
γ = 0 and Rawlsian when γ = 1. To show that this function is not consistent for
cardinal unit comparability, assume γ = 1
2. For the basic utilities it follows for al-
location A that ¯U = 6+5
2 = 5.5 and for allocation B,
¯U = 4+7
2 = 5.55. The social
welfare levels are then W = 5.5+ 1
2 min{6 −5.5, 5 −5.5} = 5.25 for allocation A and
W = 5.5+ 1
2 min{4 −5.5, 7 −5.5} = 4.75 for allocation B. The social welfare function
would select allocation A. The upper part of table 13.4 displays the welfare levels for
two transformations that satisfy cardinal level comparability. With these transformed
utilities the welfare function would select allocation B, so the social welfare function
is not valid for these transformations. The lower part of the table displays a trans-
formation that satisﬁes cardinal full comparability. For this transformation the social
welfare function selects allocation A for both the basic and the transformed utilities.
This demonstrates the consistency.
These calculations have demonstrated that if we can compare utility levels among
consumers, then a consistent social welfare function can be constructed. The resulting

social welfare function must agree with the information content in the utilities, so
each form of comparability leads to a different consistent social welfare function.
As the information increases, so does the range of consistent social welfare functions.
Expressed differently, for each of the cases of comparability the problem of aggregating
individual preferences leads to a well-deﬁned form of social welfare function. All these
social welfare functions will generate a social preference ordering that completely ranks
the alternative states. They are obviously stronger in content than majority voting or
Pareto-efﬁciency. The drawback is that they are reliant on stronger utility information
that may simply not exist.
13.11
Conclusions
This chapter has cast a critical eye over the efﬁciency theorems of chapter 2. Although
these theorems are important for providing a basic framework in which to think about
policy, they are not an end in their own right. This perspective is based on the limited
practical applicability of the lump-sum transfers needed to support the decentralization
in the Second Theorem and the weakness of Pareto-efﬁciency as a method of judging
among economic states.
Although at ﬁrst sight the theorems apparently have very strong policy implica-
tions, they become weakened when placed under critical scrutiny. But they are not
without value. Much of the subject matter of public economics takes as its starting
point the practical shortcomings of these theorems and attempts to ﬁnd a way for-
ward to something that is applicable. A knowledge of what could be achieved if the

451
Chapter 13: Optimality and Comparability
optimal lump-sum transfers were available provides a means of assessing the success
of what can be achieved and shows ways in which improvements in policy can be
made.
The other aspect involved in the Second Theorem is the selection of the optimal
allocation to be decentralized. This choice requires a social welfare function that can
be used to judge different allocations of utility among consumers. Such a social welfare
function can only be constructed if the consumers’utilities are comparable. The chapter
described several different forms of comparability and of the social welfare functions
that are consistent with them.

The purpose of this exercise is to illustrate the potential conﬂict between personal liberty and
the Pareto principle (ﬁrst studied by Sen). Assume there is a copy of Lady Chatterley’s Lover
available to be read by two persons, A and B. There are three possible options: (a) A reads
the book and B does not; (b) B reads the book and A does not; (c) neither reads the book.
The preference ordering of A (the prude) is c ≻A a ≻A b and the preference ordering of
B (the lascivious) is a ≻B b ≻B c. Hence c is the worst option for one and the best option
for the other; while both prefer a to b. Deﬁne the personal liberty rule as allowing everyone
to choose freely on personal matters (like the color of one’s own hair) with society as a whole
accepting the choice, no matter what others think.
a. Apply the personal liberty rule to the example to derive social preferences b ≻c and
c ≻a.
b. Show that by the Pareto principle we must have a social preference cycle a ≻b ≻c ≻.
c. Suppose that liberalism is constrained by the requirement that the prude A decides to
respect B’s preferences such that A’s preference for c over b is ignored. Similarly for B,
only his preference for b over c is relevant but not his preference for a over c. What are the
modiﬁed preference orderings of each person? Show that it leads to acyclic (transitive) social
preference.
d. The second possibility to solve the paradox is to suppose that each is willing to respect
the other’s choice. Thus A respects B’s preference for b over c and B respects A’s preference
for c over a. What are the modiﬁed preference orderings of each person? Show that it leads
to acyclic social preference. What is then the best social outcome?

Inequality and Poverty
14.1
Introduction
A social welfare function permits the evaluation of economic policies that cause re-
distribution among consumers—a task that Pareto-efﬁciency can never accomplish.
Although the concept of a social welfare function is a simple one, previous chapters
have identiﬁed numerous difﬁculties on the path between individual utility and ag-
gregate social welfare. The essence of these difﬁculties is that if the individual utility
function corresponds with what is theoretically acceptable, then its information content
is too limited for social decision-making.
The motivation for employing a social welfare function was to be able to address
issues of equity as well as issues of efﬁciency. Fortunately a social welfare function is
not the only way to do this, and as this chapter will show, we can construct measures
of the economic situation that relate to equity and that are based on observable and
measurable information. This provides a set of tools that can be, and frequently are,
applied in economic policy analysis. They may not meet some of the requirements
of the ideal social welfare function, but they have the distinct advantage of being
practically implementable.
Inequality and poverty provide two alternative perspectives on the equity of the
income distribution. Inequality of income means that some households have higher
incomes than others—which is a basic source for an inequity in welfare. Poverty exists
when some households are too poor to achieve an acceptable standard of living. An
inequality measure is a means of assigning a single number to the observed income
distribution that reﬂects its degree of inequality. A poverty measure achieves the same
for poverty. Although measures of inequality and poverty are not directly social welfare
functions, the chapter will reveal the closeness of the link between the measures and
welfare.
The starting point of the chapter is a discussion of income. There are two aspects
to this: the deﬁnition of income and the comparison of income across families with
different compositions. In a setting of certainty, income is a clearly deﬁned concept.
When there is uncertainty, differences can arise between ex ante and ex post deﬁnitions.
Given this, we look at alternative deﬁnitions and relate these to the treatment of income
for tax purposes. If two households differ in their composition (e.g., one household is
a single person and the other is a family of four), a direct comparison of their income

458
Part V: Equity and Distribution
levels will reveal little about the standard of living they achieve. Instead, the incomes
must be adjusted to take account of composition and then compared. The tool used to
make the adjustment is an equivalence scale. We review the use of equivalence scales
and some of the issues that they raise.
Having arrived at a set of correctly deﬁned income levels that have been adjusted for
family composition using an equivalence scale, it becomes possible to evaluate inequal-
ity and poverty.Anumber of the commonly used measures of each of these concepts are
discussed and their properties investigated. Importantly, the link is drawn between mea-
sures of inequality and the welfare assumptions that are implicit within them. This leads
into the idea of making the welfare assumptions explicit and building the measure up
from these assumptions. To measure poverty, it is necessary to determine who is “poor,”
which is achieved by choosing a level of income as the poverty line and labeling as poor
all those who fall below it. As well as discussing measures of poverty, we also review
issues concerning the deﬁnition of the poverty line and the very concept of poverty.
Although the aim of this chapter is to move away from utility concepts toward
practical tools, it is signiﬁcant that we keep returning to utility in the assessment and
improvement of the tools. In attempting to reﬁne, for example, an equivalence scale or
a measure of inequality, it is found that it is necessary to comprehend the utility basis of
the measure. Despite intentionally starting in a direction away from utility, the theory
returns us back to utility on every occasion.
14.2
Measuring Income
What is income? The obvious answer is that it is the additional resources a consumer
receives over a given period of time. The reference to a time period is important here,
since income is a ﬂow, so the period over which measurement takes place must be
speciﬁed. Certainly evaluating the receipt of resources is the basis of the deﬁnition
used in the assessment of income for tax purposes. This deﬁnition works in a practical
setting but only in a backward-looking sense. What an economist needs in order to
understand behavior, especially when choices are made in advance of income being
received, is a forward-looking measure of income. If the ﬂow of income is certain, then
there is no distinction between backward- and forward-looking measures. It is when
income is uncertain that differences emerge.
The relevance of this issue is that both inequality and poverty measures use income
data as their basic input. The resulting measures will only be as accurate as the data that
are employed to evaluate them. The data will be accurate when information is carefully

459
Chapter 14: Inequality and Poverty
collected and a consistent deﬁnition is used of what is to be measured. To evaluate the
level of inequality or poverty, a necessary ﬁrst step is to resolve the issues surrounding
the deﬁnition of income.
The classic backward-looking deﬁnition of income was provided by Henry C. Simons
in 1938. This deﬁnition is “Personal income may be deﬁned as the algebraic sum of
(1) the market value of rights exercised in consumption and (2) the change in the value
of the store of property rights between the beginning and end of the period in question.”
The essential feature of this deﬁnition is that it makes an attempt to be inclusive so as
to incorporate all income regardless of the source.
Although income deﬁnitions for tax purposes also adopt the backward-looking view-
point, they do not precisely satisfy the Simons’s deﬁnition. The divergence arises
through the practical difﬁculties of assessing some sources of income especially those
arising from capital gains. According to the Simons’s deﬁnition, the increase in the
value of capital assets should be classed as income. However, if the assets are not liqui-
dated, the capital gain will not be realized during the period in question and will not be
received as an income ﬂow. For this reason capital gains are taxed only on realization.
In the converse situation when capital losses are made, most tax codes place limits on
the extent to which they can be offset against income.
We have so far worked with the natural deﬁnition of income as the ﬂow of additional
resources. To proceed further, it becomes more helpful to adopt a different perspective
and to view the level of income by the beneﬁts it can deliver. Since income is the means
to achieve consumption, the ﬂow of income during a ﬁxed time period can be measured
as the value of consumption that can be undertaken, while leaving the household with
the same stock of wealth at the end of the period as it had at the start of the period. The
beneﬁt of this perspective is that it extends naturally to situations where the income ﬂow
is uncertain. Building on it, in 1939 John R. Hicks provided what is generally taken as
the standard deﬁnition of income with uncertainty. This deﬁnition states that “income
is the maximum value which a man can consume during a week and still expect to be
as well-off at the end of the week as he was at the beginning.”
This deﬁnition can clearly cope with uncertainty, since it operates in expectational
terms. But this advantage is also its major shortcoming when a move is made toward
applications. Expectations may be ill-deﬁned or even irrational, so evaluation of the
expected income ﬂow may be unreasonably high or low. A literal application of
the deﬁnition would not count windfall gains, such as unexpected gifts or lottery wins,
as income because they are not expected despite such gains clearly raising the potential
level of consumption. For these reasons the Hicks deﬁnition of income is informative
but not perfect.

460
Part V: Equity and Distribution
These alternative deﬁnitions of income have highlighted the distinctions between ex
ante and ex post measures. Assessments of income for tax purposes use the backward-
looking viewpoint and measure income as all relevant payments received over the
measurement period. Practical issues limit the extent to which some sources of income
can be included, so the deﬁnition of income in tax codes does not precisely satisfy
any of the formal deﬁnitions. This observation just reﬂects the fact that there is no
unambiguously perfect deﬁnition of income.
14.3
Equivalence Scales
The fact that households differ in size and age distribution means that welfare levels
cannot be judged just by looking at their income levels. A household of one adult with
no children needs less income to achieve a given level of welfare than a household with
two adults and one child. In the words of the economist William M. “Terence” Gorman,
“When you have a wife and a baby, a penny bun costs threepence.” A larger household
obviously needs more income to achieve a given level of utility, but the question is
how much more income? Equivalence scales are the economist’s way of answering
this question and provide the means of adjusting measured incomes into comparable
quantities.
Differences among households arise in the number of adults and the number and
ages of dependants. These are called demographic variables. The general problem in
designing equivalence scales is to achieve the adjustment of observed income to take
account of demographic differences in household composition. Several ways exist to
do this, and these are now discussed.
The ﬁrst approach to equivalence scales is based on the concept of minimum needs.
A bundle of goods and services that is seen as representing the minimum needs for the
household is identiﬁed. The exact bundle will differ among households of varying size,
butittypicallyinvolvesonlyverybasiccommodities. Thecostofthisbundleforfamilies
with different compositions is then calculated and the ratio of these costs for different
families provides the equivalence scale. The ﬁrst application of this approach was by
Seebohm Rowntree in 1901 in his pioneering study of poverty. The bundle of goods
employed was just a minimum acceptable quantity of food, rent, and a small allowance
for “household sundries.” The equivalence scale was constructed by assigning the
expenditure for a two-adult household with no children the index of 100 and measuring
costs for all other household compositions relative to this. The scale obtained from
expenditures calculated by Rowntree is given in the ﬁrst column of table 14.1. The

.gov/hhes/poverty/threshld/thresh03.html).
interpretation of these ﬁgures is that the minimum needs of a couple with one child cost
24 percent more than for a couple with no children.
A similar approach was taken by William Beveridge in his 1942 construction of the
expenditure requirements that provided the foundation for the introduction of social
assistance in the United Kingdom. In addition to the goods in the bundle of Rowntree,
Beveridge added fuel, light, and a margin for “inefﬁciency” in purchasing. Also the
cost assigned to children increased with their age. The values of the Beveridge scale in
the second column of table 14.1 are for children in the 5 to 10 age group.
The ﬁnal column of the table is generated from the income levels that are judged
to represent poverty in the United States for families with different compositions. The
original construction of these poverty levels was undertaken by Mollie Orshansky in
1963. The method she used was to evaluate the cost of food for each family composition
using the 1961 Economy Food Plan. Next it was observed that if expenditure on food,
F, constituted a proportion θ of the family’s budget, then total needs would be

1
θ

F.
For a family of two, 1
θ was taken as 3.7, and for a family of three or more, 1
θ was 3. The
exception to this process was to evaluate the cost for a single person as 80 percent of
that of a couple. The minimum expenditures obtained have been continually updated,
and the third column of the table gives the equivalence scale implied by the poverty
line used in 2003.
Table 14.1 shows that these equivalence scales all assume that there are returns to
scale in household size so that, for example, a family of two adults does not require
twice the income of a single person. Observe also that the US poverty scale is rela-
tively generous for a single person compared to the other two scales. The fact that the

462
Part V: Equity and Distribution
single-person value was constructed in a different way from the other values for the
poverty scale (as a ﬁxed percentage of that for a couple rather than as a multiple of
food costs) has long been regarded as a contentious issue. Furthermore only for the
Beveridge scale is the cost of additional children constant. The fact that the cost of
children is nonmonotonic for the poverty scale is a further point of contention.
There are three major shortcomings of this method of computing equivalence scales.
First, by focusing on the cost of meeting a minimum set of needs, they are inappro-
priate for applying to incomes above the minimum level. Second, they are dependent
on an assessment of what constitutes minimum needs—and this can be contentious.
Most important, the scales do not take into account the process of optimization by
the households. The consequence of optimization is that as income rises, substitution
between goods can take place, and the same relativities need no longer apply. Alterna-
tive methods of constructing equivalence scales that aim to overcome these difﬁculties
are now considered.
In a similar way to the Orshansky construction of the US poverty scale, the Ernst
Engel approach to equivalence scales is based on the hypothesis that the welfare of a
household can be measured by the proportion of its income that is spent on food. This is
a consequence of Engel’s law, which asserts that the share of food in expenditure falls as
income rises. If this is accepted, equivalence scales can be constructed for households
of different compositions by calculating the income levels at which their expenditure
share on food is equal. This is illustrated in ﬁgure 14.1 in which the expenditure share
on food, as a function of income, is shown for two households with family compositions
d1 and d2. For example, d1 may refer to a couple and d2 to a couple with one child.
Incomes M1 and M2 lead to the same expenditure share, s, and so are equivalent for
the Engel method. The equivalence scale is then formed from the ratio M2
M1 .
Although Engel’s law may be empirically true, it does not necessarily provide a
basis for making welfare comparisons, since it leaves unexplored the link between
household composition and food expenditure. In fact there is ground for believing
that the Engel method overestimates the cost of additional children because a child
is largely a food-consuming addition to a household. If this is correct, a household
compensated sufﬁciently to restore the share of food in its expenditure to its original
level after the addition of a child would have been overcompensated with respect to
other commodities. The approach of Engel has been extended to the more general iso-
prop method in which the expenditure shares of a basket of goods, rather than simply
food, becomes the basis for the construction of scales. However, considering a basket
of goods does not overcome the basic shortcomings of the Engel method.

Construction of Engel scale
Afurther alternative is to select for attention a set of goods that are consumed only by
adults, termed “adult goods,” and such that the expenditure on them can be treated as
a measure of welfare. Typical examples of such goods that have been used in practice
are tobacco and alcohol. If these goods have the property that changes in household
composition only affect their demand via an income effect (so changes in household
composition do not cause substitution between commodities), then the extra income
required to keep their consumption constant when household composition changes
can be used to construct an equivalence scale. The use of adult goods to construct an
equivalence scale is illustrated in ﬁgure 14.2. On the basis that they generate the same
level of demand, ¯x, as family composition changes, the income levels M1 and M2
can be classed as equivalent, and the equivalence scale can be constructed from their
ratio.
There are also a number of difﬁculties with this approach. It rests on the hypotheses
that consumption of adult goods accurately reﬂects welfare and that household com-
position affects the demand for these goods only via an income effect. Furthermore the
ratio of M1 to M2 will depend on the level of demand chosen for the comparison except
in the special case where the demand curves are straight lines through the origin. The
ratios may also vary for different goods. This leads into a further problem of forming
some average ratio out of the ratios for the individual goods.

All of the methods described so far have attempted to derive the equivalence scale
from an observable proxy for welfare. A general approach that can, in principal, over-
come the problems identiﬁed in the previous methods is illustrated in ﬁgure 14.3.
To understand this ﬁgure, assume that there are just two goods available. The outer
indifference curve represents the consumption levels of these two goods necessary
for a family of composition d2 to obtain welfare level U∗, and the inner indifference
curve the consumption requirements for a family with composition d1 to obtain the
same utility. The extent to which the budget line has to be shifted outward to reach
the higher curve determines the extra income required to compensate for the change
in family structure. This construction incorporates both the potential change in prefer-
ences as family composition changes and the process of optimization subject to budget
constraint by the households.
To formalize this process, let the household have preferences described by the utility
function U(x1, x2; d), where xi is the level of consumption of good i and d denotes
information on family composition. For example, d will describe the number of adults,
the number and ages of children, and any other relevant information. The consumption
plan needed to attain a given utility level, U, at least cost is the solution to

U (x1, x2; d) ≥U∗.

. The equivalence scale is derived by
computing their ratio. The important point obtained by presenting the construction in
this way is the observation that the equivalence scale will generally depend on the level
of utility at which the comparison is made. If it does, there can be no single equivalence
scale that works at all levels of utility.
The construction of an equivalence scale from preferences makes two further issues
apparent. First, the minimum needs and budget share approaches do not take account
of how changes in family structure may shift the indifference map. For instance, the
pleasure of having children may raise the utility obtained from any given consumption
plan. With the utility approach it then becomes cheaper to attain each indifference curve,
so the value of the equivalence scale falls as family size increases. This conclusion,
of course, conﬂicts with the basic sense that it is more expensive to support a larger
family.

466
Part V: Equity and Distribution
The second problem centers around the use of a household utility function. Many
economists would argue that a household utility function cannot exist; instead, they
would observe that households are composed of individuals with individual prefer-
ences. Under the latter interpretation, the construction of a household utility function
suffers from the difﬁculties of preference aggregation identiﬁed by Arrow’s Impossi-
bility Theorem. Among the solutions to this problem now being investigated is to look
within the functioning of the household and to model its decisions as the outcome of
an efﬁcient resource allocation process.
14.4
Inequality Measurement
Inequality is a concept that has immediate intuitive implications. The existence of
inequality is easily perceived: differences in living standards between the rich and
poor are only too obvious both across countries and, sometimes to a surprising extent,
within countries. The obsession of the media with wealth and celebrity provides a
constant reminder of just how rich the rich can be. An increase in inequality can also
be understood at a basic level. If the rich become richer, and the poor become poorer,
then inequality must have increased.
The substantive economic questions about inequality arise when we try to move
beyond these generalizations to construct a quantitative measure of inequality. Without
a quantitative measure it is not possible to provide a precise answer to questions about
inequality. Forexample, ameasureisrequiredtodeterminewhichofarangeofcountries
has the greatest level of inequality and to determine whether inequality has risen or
fallen over time.
What an inequality measure must do is to take data on the distribution of income and
generate asingle number thatcaptures the inequality in thatdistribution.Aﬁrstapproach
to constructing such a measure is to adopt a standard statistical index. We describe the
most signiﬁcant of these indexes. Looking at the statistical measures reveals that there
are properties, particularly how the measure is affected by transfers of income between
households, that we may wish an inequality measure to possess. These properties can
also be used to assess the acceptability of alternative measures. It is also shown that
implicit within a statistical measure are a set of welfare implications. Rather than just
accept these implications, the alternative approach is explored of making the welfare
assumptions explicit and building the inequality measure on them.

467
Chapter 14: Inequality and Poverty
14.4.1
The Setting
The intention of an inequality measure is to assign a single number to an income
distribution that represents the degree of inequality. This section sets out the notation
employed for the basic information that is input into the measure and deﬁnes precisely
what is meant by a measure.
We assume that there are H households and label these h = 1, . . . , H. The labeling
of the households is chosen so that the lower is the label, the lower is the household’s
income. The incomes, Mh, then form an increasing sequence with
M1 ≤M2 ≤M3 ≤. . . ≤MH.
(14.3)
The list {M1, . . . , MH} is the income distribution whose inequality we wish to measure.
Given the income distribution, the mean level of income, μ, is deﬁned by
μ = 1
H
H

h=1
Mh.
(14.4)
The purpose of an inequality measure is to assign a single number to the distribution
{M1, . . . , MH}. Let I(M1, . . . , MH) be an inequality measure. Then income dis-
tributions { ˜M1, . . . , ˜MH} has greater inequality than distribution { ˆM1, . . . , ˆMH} if
I( ˜M1, . . . , ˜MH) > I( ˆM1, . . . , ˆMH). Typically the inequality measure is constructed
so that a value of 0 represents complete equality (the position where all incomes are
equal) and a value of 1 represents maximum inequality (all income is received by just
one household).
The issues that arise in inequality measurement are encapsulated in determining
the form that the function I(M1, . . . , MH) should take. We now investigate some
alternative forms and explore their implications.
14.4.2
Statistical Measures
Under the heading of “statistical” fall inequality measures that are derived from the
general statistical literature. That is, the measures have been constructed to charac-
terize the distribution of a set of numbers without thought of any explicit economic
application or motivation. Even so, the discussion will later show that these statistical
measures make implicit economic value judgments. Accepting any one of these mea-
sures as the “correct” way to measure inequality means the acceptance of these implicit

468
Part V: Equity and Distribution
assumptions. The measures that follow are presented in approximate order of sophisti-
cation. Each is constructed to take a value between 0 and 1, with a value of 0 occurring
when all households have identical income levels.
Probably the simplest conceivable measure, the range calculates inequality as being
the difference between the highest and lowest incomes expressed as a proportion of
total income. As such, it is a very simple measure to compute. The deﬁnition of the
range, R, is
R = MH −M1
Hμ
.
(14.5)
The division by Hμ in (14.5) is a normalization that ensures the index is independent
of the scale of incomes (or the units of measurement of income). Any index that has
this property of independence is called a relative index.
Asanexampleoftheuseoftherange, considertheincomedistribution{1, 3, 6, 9, 11}.
For this distribution μ = 6 and
R = 11 −1
5 × 6 = 0.3333.
(14.6)
The failure of the range to take account of the intermediate part of the distribution
can be illustrated by taking income from the second household in the example and
giving it to the fourth to generate new income distribution {1, 1, 6, 11, 11}. This new
distribution appears to be more unequal than the ﬁrst, yet the value of the range remains
at R = 0.3333.
Giventhesimplicityofitsdeﬁnition, itisnotsurprisingthattherangehasdeﬁciencies.
Most important, the range takes no account of the dispersion of the income distribution
between the highest and the lowest incomes. Consequently it is not sensitive to any
features of the income distribution between these extremes. For instance, an income
distribution with most of the households receiving close to the maximum income would
be judged just as unequal as one in which most received the lowest income. An ideal
measure should possess more sensitivity to the value of intermediate incomes than the
range.
The relative mean deviation, D, takes account of the deviation of each income
level from the mean so that it is dependent on intermediate incomes. It does this by
calculating the absolute value of the deviation of each income level from the mean and
then summing. This summation process gives equal weight to deviations both above
and below the mean and implies that D is linear in the size of deviations. Formally, D
is deﬁned by

469
Chapter 14: Inequality and Poverty
D =
	H
h=1
((μ −Mh((
2 [H −1] μ
.
(14.7)
The division by 2 [H −1] μ again ensures that D takes values between 0 and 1.
The advantage of the relative mean deviation over the range is that it takes ac-
count of the entire income distribution and not just the end points. Taking the example
used for the range, the inequality in the distribution {1, 3, 6, 9, 11} as measured by
D is
D = |−5| + |−3| + |0| + |3| + |5|
2 × 4 × 6
= 0.3333,
(14.8)
and the inequality of {1, 1, 6, 11, 11} is
D = |−5| + |−5| + |0| + |5| + |5|
2 × 4 × 6
= 0.4167.
(14.9)
Unlike the range, the relative mean deviation measures the second distribution as having
more inequality. Due to the division by 2 [H −1] μ it is easily seen that D = 1 with
the maximum inequality distribution {0, 0, 0, 0, 30} where all income is received by
just one household.
Although it does take account of the entire distribution of income, the linearity of
D has the implication that it is insensitive to transfers from richer to poorer house-
holds when the households involved in the transfer remain on the same side of the
mean income level. To see an example of this, assume that the mean income level is
μ = $20,000. Now take two households with incomes $25,000 and $100,000. Trans-
ferring $4,000 from the poorer of these two households to the richer, so that the income
levels become $21,000 and $104,000, does not change the value of D—one term in
the summation rises by $4,000 and the other falls by $4,000. (Notice that if the two
households were on different sides of the mean, then a similar transfer would raise two
terms in the summation by $4,000 and increase inequality.) The fact that D can be
insensitive to transfers seems unsatisfactory, since it is natural to expect that a transfer
from a poorer household to a richer one should raise inequality.
This line of reasoning is enshrined in the Pigou–Dalton Principle of Transfers, which
is a central concept in the theory of inequality measurement. The basis of this principle
is precisely the requirement that any transfer from a poor household to a rich one must
increase inequality regardless of where the two households are located in the income
distribution.

470
Part V: Equity and Distribution
Deﬁnition 14.1 (Pigou–Dalton Principle of Transfers)
The inequality index must
decrease if there is a transfer of income from a richer household to a poorer household
that preserves the ranking of the two households in the income distribution and leaves
total income unchanged.
Any inequality measure that satisﬁes this principle is said to be sensitive to transfers.
ThePigou–DaltonPrincipleisgenerallyviewedasafeaturethatanyacceptablemeasure
of inequality should possess and is therefore expected in an inequality measure. Neither
the range nor the relative mean deviation satisfy this principle.
The reason why D is not sensitive to transfers is its linearity in deviations from
the mean. The removal of the linearity provides the motivation for considering the
coefﬁcient of variation, which is deﬁned using the sum of squared deviations. The
procedure of forming the square places more weight on incomes that are further away
from the mean and so introduces a sensitivity to transfers. The coefﬁcient of variation,
C, is deﬁned by
C =
σ
μ [H −1]1/2 ,
(14.10)
where σ 2 =
	H
h=1


is the variance of the income distribution, so σ is its standard
deviation. The division by μ [H −1]1/2 ensures the C lies between 0 and 1. For the
income distribution {1, 3, 6, 9, 11}, σ 2 = [−5]2+[−3]2+[0]2+[3]2+[5]2

= 13.6, so
C = [13.6]1/2
6 [4]1/2 = 0.3073,
(14.11)
and for {1, 1, 6, 11, 11}, σ 2 = 20.0, giving
C = [20]1/2
6 [4]1/2 = 0.3727.
(14.12)
To see that the coefﬁcient of variation satisﬁes the Pigou–Dalton Principle, consider
a transfer of an amount of income dε from household i to household j, with the house-
holds chosen so that Mi < Mj. Then
dC
dε =

μ [H −1]1/2
dσ
dε =
Mj −Mi
σHμ [H −1]1/2 > 0,
(14.13)
so the transfer from the poorer household to the richer household decreases measured
inequality as required by the Pigou–Dalton Principle. It should be noted that the value of

471
Chapter 14: Inequality and Poverty
the change in C depends on the difference between the incomes of the two households.
This has the consequence that a transfer of $100 of income from a household with an
income of $1,000,100 to one with an income of $999,900 produces the same change
in C as a transfer of $100 between households with incomes $1,100 and $900. Most
interpretations of equity would suggest that the latter transfer should be of greater
consequencefortheindexbecauseitinvolvestwohouseholdsofrelativelylowincomes.
This reasoning suggests that satisfaction of the Pigou–Dalton Principle may not be a
sufﬁcient requirement for an inequality measure; the manner in which the measure
satisﬁes it may also matter.
Before moving on to further inequality measures, it is worth describing the Lorenz
curve. The Lorenz curve is a helpful graphical device for presenting a summary
representation of an income distribution, and it has played an important role in the
measurement of inequality. Although not strictly an inequality measure as deﬁned
above, Lorenz curves are considered because of their use in illustrating inequality and
the central role they play in the motivation of other inequality indexes.
The Lorenz curve is constructed by arranging the population in order of increasing
income and then graphing the proportion of income going to each proportion of the
population. The graph of the Lorenz curve therefore has the proportion of population on
the horizontal axis and the proportion of income on the vertical axis. If all households
in the population had identical incomes the Lorenz curve would then be the diagonal
line connecting the points (0, 0) and (1, 1). If there is any degree of inequality, the
ordering in which the households are taken ensures that the Lorenz curve lies below
the diagonal since, for example, the poorest half of the population must have less than
half the total income.
To see how the Lorenz curve is plotted, consider a population of 10 with income
distribution {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. The total quantity of income is 55, so the ﬁrst
household (which represents 10 percent of the population) receives 1
55 × 100 percent
of the total income. This is the ﬁrst point plotted in the lower left corner of ﬁgure 13.4.
Taking the two lowest income households (which are 20 percent of the population), we
have their combined income as 3
55 ×100 percent of the total.Adding the third household
awards 30 percent of the population 6
55 × 100 percent of total income. Proceeding in
this way, we plot the ten points in the ﬁgure. Joining them gives the Lorenz curve. In
summary, the larger the population, the smoother is this curve.

In the left-hand panel, the Lorenz curve for income distribution B lies entirely outside
that for income distribution A. In such a case distribution B unambiguously has more
inequality than A. One way to see this is to observe that distribution B can be obtained
from distribution A by transferring income from poor households to rich households.
Applying the Pigou–Dalton Principle, we see that this raises inequality. If the Lorenz
curves representing the distributions A and B cross, it is not possible to obtain an un-
ambiguous conclusion by the Lorenz curve alone. The Lorenz curve therefore provides
only a partial ranking of income distributions. Despite this limitation the Lorenz curve
is still a popular tool in applied economics, since it presents very convenient and easily
interpreted visual summary of an income distribution.
The next measure, the Gini, has been the subject of extensive attention in discussions
of inequality measurement and has been much used in applied economics. The Gini,
G, can be expressed by considering all possible pairs of incomes and out of each
pair selecting the minimum income level. Summing the minimum income levels and

It should be noted that in the construction of this measure, each level of income is
compared to itself as well as all other income levels. For example, if there are three
income levels {3, 5, 10}, the value of the Gini is
G = 1 −

Relating Gini to Lorenz
This second form of the Gini makes its computation simpler but hides the construction
behind the measure.
The Gini also satisﬁes the Pigou–Dalton Principle. This can be seen by considering a
transfer of income of size  > 0 from household i to household j, with the households
chosen so that Mj > Mi. From the ranking of incomes this implies j > i. Then
G =
2
H 2μ (j −i)  > 0,
(14.17)
as required. In the case of the Gini, the effect of the transfer of income on the measure
depends only on the locations of i and j in the income distribution. For example, a
transfer from the household at position i = 1 to the household at position j = 11
counts as much as one from position i = 151 to position j = 161. It might be expected
that an inequality should be more sensitive to transfers between households low in the
income distribution.
There is an important relationship between the Gini and the Lorenz curve. As shown
in ﬁgure 14.6, the Gini is equal to the area between the Lorenz curve and the line
of equality as a proportion of the area of the triangle beneath the line of equality.
As the area of the triangle is 1
2, the Gini is twice the area between the Lorenz curve
and the equality line. This deﬁnition makes it clear that the Gini, in common with R,
C, and D, can be used to rank distributions when the Lorenz curves cross, since the
relevant area is always well deﬁned. All these measures provide a stronger ranking of
income distributions than the Lorenz curve; hence they must each impose additional
restrictions that allow a comparison to be made between distributions even when their
Lorenz curves cross.

Chapter 14: Inequality and Poverty
A ﬁnal statistical measure that displays a different form of sensitivity to transfers is
the Theil entropy measure. This measure is drawn from information theory and is used
in that context to measure the average information content of a system of information.
The deﬁnition of the Theil entropy measure, T , is given by

(14.19)
so the entropy measure also satisﬁes the Pigou–Dalton Principle. For the Theil en-
tropy measure, the change is dependent on the relative incomes of the two households
involved in the transfer. This provides an alternative form of sensitivity to transfers.
14.4.3
Inequality and Welfare
The analysis of the statistical measures of inequality has made reference to “acceptable”
criteria for a measure to possess. One of these was made explicit in the Pigou–Dalton
Principle, while other criteria relating to additional desirable sensitivity properties have
been implicit in the discussion. To be able to say that something is acceptable or not
implies that there is some notion of distributive justice or social welfare underlying the
judgment. It is then interesting to consider the relationship between inequality measures
and welfare.
The ﬁrst issue to address is the extent to which income distributions can be ranked
in terms of welfare with minimal restrictions imposed on the social welfare function.
To investigate this, let the level of social welfare be determined by the function W =
W

M1, . . . , MH
. It is assumed that this social welfare function is symmetric and
concave. Symmetry means that the level of welfare is unaffected by changing the
ordering of the households. This is just a requirement that all households are treated
equally. Concavity ensures that the indifference curves of the welfare function have

476
Part V: Equity and Distribution
the standard shape with mixtures preferred to extremes. This assumption imposes a
concern for equity on the welfare function.
The critical theorem relating the ranking of income distributions to social welfare is
now given.
Theorem 14.2 (Atkinson)
Consider two distributions of income with the same mean.
If the Lorenz curves for these distributions do not cross, every symmetric and concave
social welfare function will assign a higher level of welfare to the distribution whose
Lorenz curve is closest to the main diagonal.
The proof of this theorem is very straightforward. Since the welfare function is
symmetric and concave, it follows that ∂W
∂Mi ≥∂W
∂Mj if Mi < Mj. Hence the marginal
social welfare of income is greater for a household lower in the income distribution. If
the two Lorenz curves do not cross, the income distribution represented by the inner
one (that closest to the main diagonal) can be obtained from that of the outer one by
transferring income from richer to poorer households. Since the marginal social welfare
of income to the poorer households is never less than that from richer, this transfer must
raise welfare as measured by any symmetric and concave social welfare function.
The converse of this theorem is that if the Lorenz curves for two distributions cross,
then two symmetric and concave social welfare functions can be found that will rank
the two distributions differently. This is because the income distributions of two Lorenz
curves that cross are not related by simple transfers from rich to poor. So, if the Lorenz
curves do cross, the income distributions cannot be unambiguously ranked without
specifying the social welfare function.
Taken together, the theorem and its converse show that the Lorenz curve provides
the most complete ranking of income distributions that is possible without our mak-
ing assumptions on the form of the social welfare function other than symmetry and
concavity. To achieve a complete ranking when the Lorenz curves cross requires re-
strictions to be placed on the structure of the social welfare function. In addition any
measure of inequality is necessarily stronger than the Lorenz curve because it generates
a complete ranking of distributions. This is true of all the statistical measures, which is
why it can be argued that they all carry implicit welfare judgments.
This argument can be taken a stage further. It is in fact possible to construct the
social welfare function that is implied by an inequality measure. To see how this can be
done, consider the Gini. Assume that the total amount of income available is constant.
Any redistribution of this that leaves the Gini unchanged must leave the implied level
of welfare unchanged. A redistribution of income will not affect the Gini if the term

477
Chapter 14: Inequality and Poverty
M2
M1
Figure 14.7
Gini social welfare
[2H −1] M1 + . . . + MH
remains constant. The welfare function must thus be a
function of this expression. Furthermore the Gini is deﬁned to be independent of the
total level of income, but a welfare function will increase if total income rises and
distribution is unaffected. This can be incorporated by not dividing through by the
mean level of income. Putting these arguments together, the welfare function implied
by the Gini is given by
WG (M) =
1
H 2

[2H −1]M1 + [2H −3]M2 + . . . + MH
.
(14.20)
The form of WG(M) is interesting, since it shows that the Gini implies a social welfare
function that is linear in incomes. It also shows a clear structure of increasing welfare
weights for lower income consumers. The welfare function further has indifference
curves that are straight lines above and below the line of equal incomes but kinked on
this line. This is illustrated in ﬁgure 14.7.
In the same way a welfare function can be constructed for all the statistical measures.
Therefore acceptance of the measure is acceptance of the implied welfare function. As
shown by the linear social indifference curves and increasing welfare weights for the
Gini social welfare function, the implied welfare functions can have a very restrictive
form. We do not need to merely accept such welfare restrictions. The fact that each
inequalitymeasureimpliesasocialwelfarefunctionsuggeststhattherelationshipcanbe
inverted to move from a social welfare function to an inequality measure. By assuming

478
Part V: Equity and Distribution
a social welfare function at the outset, it is possible to make welfare judgments explicit
and, by deriving the inequality measure from the social welfare function, to ensure that
these judgments are incorporated in the inequality measure.
To implement this approach, assume that the social welfare function is utilitarian
with
W =
H

h=1
U

Mh
.
(14.21)
The household utility of income function, U(M), is taken to satisfy the conditions that
U′(M) > 0 and U′′(M) < 0. The utility function U(M) can either be the households’
true cardinal utility function or be chosen by the policy analyst as in the evaluation
of the utility of income to each household. In this second interpretation, since social
welfare is obtained by summing the individual utilities, the importance given to equity
can be captured in the choice of U(M). This is because increasing the concavity of the
utility function places a relatively higher weight on low incomes in the social welfare
function.
A measure of inequality can be constructed from the social welfare function by
deﬁning MEDE as the solution to
H

h=1
U

Mh
= HU(MEDE).
(14.22)
MEDE is called the equally distributed equivalent income and is the level of income that,
if given to all households, would generate the same level of social welfare as the initial
income distribution. Using MEDE, the Atkinson measure of inequality is deﬁned by
A = 1 −MEDE
μ
.
(14.23)
For the case of two households the construction of MEDE is illustrated in ﬁgure 14.8.
The initial income distribution is given by {M1, M2}, and this determines the relevant
indifference curve of the social welfare function. MEDE is found by moving around
this indifference curve to the 45 degree line where the two households’ incomes are
equal. The ﬁgure makes clear that because of the concavity of the social indifference
curve, MEDE is less than the mean income, μ. This fact guarantees that 0 ≤A ≤1.
Furthermore, for a given level of mean income, a more diverse income distribution will
achieve a lower social indifference curve and be equivalent to a lower MEDE.

Equally distributed equivalent income
The ﬂexibility in this measure lies in the freedom of choice of the household utility
of income function. Given the assumption of a utilitarian social welfare function, it
is the household utility that determines the importance attached to inequality by the
measure. One commonly used form of utility function is
U(M) = M1−ε
1 −ε ,
ε ̸= 1,
(14.24)
which allows the welfare judgments of the policy analyst to be contained in the chosen
value of the parameter ε. The value of ε determines the degree of concavity of the utility
function: it becomes more concave as ε increases. An increase in concavity raises the
relative importance of low incomes because it causes the marginal utility of income to
decline at a faster rate. The utility function is isoelastic, and concave if ε ≥0. When
ε = 1, U(M) = log(M), and when ε = 0, U(M) = M.
TheAtkinson measure can be illustrated using the example of the income distribution
{1, 3, 6, 9, 11}. If ε = 1
2 the household utility function is U = 2M1/2 so the level of
social welfare is
W = 2 × 11/2 + 2 × 31/2 + 2 × 61/2 + 2 × 91/2 + 2 × 111/2 = 22.996.
(14.25)
The equally distributed equivalent income then solves

so MEDE = 5.2882. This gives the value of the Atkinson measure as

14.4.4
An Application
As has been noted in the discussion, inequality measures are frequently used in practical
policy analysis. Table 14.2 summarizes the results of an OECD study into the change
in inequality over time in a wide range of countries. This is undertaken by calculating
inequality at two points in time and determining the percentage change in the measure.
Inequalityiscalculatedforincomepriortotaxesandtransfers, andforincomeaftertaxes
and transfers. The difference between the inequality levels in these two situations gives
an insight into the extent to which the tax and transfer system succeeds in redistributing
income.
Looking at the results, in all cases inequality is smaller after taxes and transfers
than before, so the tax systems in the countries studied are redistributive. For instance,
in Denmark inequality is 0.0420 when measured by Gini before taxes and transfers
but only 0.0217 after. The second general message of the results is that inequality has
tended to rise in these countries—only in three cases has it been reduced, and in every
case this is after taxes and transfers.
It is also interesting to look at the rankings of inequality and changes in inequality
under the different measures. If there is general agreement for different measures,
then we can be reassured that the choice of measure is not too critical for what we
observe. For the level of inequality all four measures are in agreement for both the
before-tax and after-tax cases except for the SCV (squared coefﬁcient of variation),
which reverses the after-taxes and transfers ranking of Denmark and Sweden, and the
Atkinson, which reverses the before-taxes and transfers ranking of Denmark and the
United States. For these four measures there is a considerable degree of consistency
in the rankings. Taking the majority opinion, observe that before taxes and transfers
the ranking (with the highest level of inequality ﬁrst) is Italy, Sweden, United States,
Denmark, and Japan. After the operation of taxes and transfers this ranking becomes
Italy, United States, Japan, Sweden, and Denmark. This change in rankings is evidence
of the highly redistributive tax and transfer systems operated in the Nordic countries.
The rankings for the change in inequality are not quite as consistent across the four
measures, but there is still considerable agreement. The majority order for the before

taxes and transfers case (with the greatest increase in inequality ﬁrst) is Italy, Sweden,
Japan, United States, and Denmark. The Atkinson measure places Japan at the top and
reverses Denmark and the United States. For the after-taxes and transfers ranking, the
Gini and theAtkinson measures produce the same ranking, but the SCV places Sweden
above the United States and Japan. But what is clear is the general agreement on an
increase in inequality.
The review of this application has shown that the different measure can produce a
fairly consistent picture about ranking by inequality, about the changes in inequality,
and on the effect of taxes and transfers. Despite the differences emphasized in the
analysis of the measures, when put into practice in this way, the differences need not
lead to widespread disagreement among the measures. In fact a fairly harmonious
picture can emerge.
14.5
Poverty
The essential feature of poverty is the possession of fewer resources than are required
to achieve an acceptable standard of living. What constitutes poverty can be understood
in the same intuitive way as what constitutes inequality, but similar issues about the
correct measure arise again once we attempt to provide a quantiﬁcation. This section

482
Part V: Equity and Distribution
ﬁrst discusses concepts of poverty and the poverty line, and then proceeds to review a
number of common poverty measures.
14.5.1
Poverty and the Poverty Line
Beforemeasuringpoverty, itisﬁrstnecessarytodeﬁneit. Itisobviousthatpovertyrefers
to a situation involving a lack of income and a consequent low level of consumption and
welfare. What is not so clear is the standard against which the level of income should
be judged. Two possibilities arise in this context: an absolute conception of poverty
and a relative one. The distinction between these has implications for changes in the
level of poverty over time and the success of policy in alleviating poverty.
The concept of absolute poverty assumes that there is some ﬁxed minimum level
of consumption (and hence of income) that constitutes poverty and is independent
of time or place. Such a minimum level of consumption can be a diet that is just
sufﬁcient to maintain health and limited housing and clothing. Under the concept of
absolute poverty, if the incomes of all households rise, there will eventually be no
poverty. Although a concept of absolute poverty was probably implicit in early studies
of poverty, such as that of Rowntree in 1901, the appropriateness of absolute poverty
has since generally been rejected. In its place has been adopted the notion of relative
poverty.
Relative poverty is not a recent concept. Even in 1776 Adam Smith was deﬁning
poverty as the lack of necessities, where necessities are deﬁned as “what ever the
custom of the country renders it indecent for creditable people, even of the lowest
order, to be without.” This deﬁnition makes it clear that relative poverty is deﬁned in
terms of the standards of a given society at a given time and that the level that represents
poverty rises as does the income of that society. Operating under a relative standard,
it becomes much more difﬁcult to eliminate poverty. Relative poverty has also been
deﬁned in terms of the ability to “participate” in society. Poverty then arises whenever
a household possesses insufﬁcient resources to allow it to participate in the customary
activities of its society.
The starting point for the measurement of poverty is to set a poverty line that separates
those viewed as living in poverty from those who are not. Of course, this poverty line
applies to the incomes levels after application of an equivalence scale. Whether poverty
is viewed as absolute or relative matters little for setting a poverty line at any particular
point in time (though advocates of an absolute poverty concept may choose to set it
lower). Where the distinction matters is whether and how the poverty line is adjusted
overtime. Ifanabsolutepovertystandardwereadopted, thentherewouldbenorevision.

483
Chapter 14: Inequality and Poverty
Conversely, with relative poverty the level of the line would rise or fall in line with
average incomes.
In practice, poverty lines have often been determined by following the minimum
needs approach that was discussed in connection with equivalence scales. As noted in
section 14.3, this is the case with the US poverty line that was ﬁxed in 1963 and has
since been updated annually. As the package of minimum needs has not changed, the
underlying concept is that of an absolute poverty measure. In the United Kingdom the
poverty line has been taken as the level of income that is 120 or 140 percent of the min-
imum supplementary beneﬁt level. As this level of beneﬁt is determined by minimum
needs, a minimum needs poverty line is implied. In addition beneﬁts have risen with
increases in average income, so causing the poverty line to rise. The UK poverty line
thus represents the use of a relative concept of poverty.
The assumption that there is a precise switch between poverty and nonpoverty as
the poverty line is crossed is very strong. It is much more natural for there to be a
gradual move out of poverty as income increases. The precision of the poverty line
may also lead to difﬁculty in determining where it should lie if the level of poverty is
critically dependent on the precise choice. Both of these difﬁculties can be overcome
by observing that often it is not the precise level of poverty that matters but changes in
the level of poverty over time and across countries. In these instances the poverty value
is not too important but only the rankings. This suggest the procedure of calculating
poverty for a range of poverty lines. If poverty is higher today for all poverty lines
than it was yesterday, then it seems unambiguous that poverty has risen. In this sense
the poverty line may not actually be of critical importance for the uses to poverty
measurement is often put. An application illustrating this argument is given below.
14.5.2
Poverty Measures
The poverty line is now taken as given, and we proceed to discuss alternative measures
of poverty. The basic issue in this discussion is how best to combine two pieces of
information (how many households are poor, and how poor they are) into a single
quantitative measure of poverty. By describing a number of measures, the discussion
will draw out the properties that are desirable for a poverty measure to possess.
Throughout the discussion the poverty line is denoted by the income level z such that
a household with an income level below or equal to z is classed as living in poverty.
For a household with income Mh the income gap measures how far their income is
below the poverty line. Denoting the income gap for household h by gh, it follows that
gh = z −Mh. Given the poverty line z and an income distribution {M1, . . . , MH},

484
Part V: Equity and Distribution
where M1 ≤M2 ≤. . . ≤MH, the number of households in poverty is denoted by q.
The value of q is deﬁned by the facts that the income of household q is on or below
the poverty line, so Mq ≤z, but that of the next household is above Mq+1 > z.
The simplest measure of poverty is the head-count ratio, which determines the extent
of poverty by counting the number of households whose incomes are not above the
poverty line. Expressing the number as a proportion of the population, the head-count
ratio is deﬁned by
E = q
H .
(14.28)
This measure of poverty was ﬁrst used by Rowntree in 1901 and has been employed in
many subsequent studies. The major advantage of the head-count ratio is its simplicity
of calculation.
The head-count ratio is clearly limited because it is not affected by how far below the
poverty line the households are. For example, with a poverty line of z = 10 the income
distributions {1, 1, 20, 40, 50} and {9, 9, 20, 40, 50} would both have a headcount ratio
of E = 2
5. Apolicy maker may well see these income distributions differently, since the
income required to alleviate poverty in the second case (2 units) is much less then that
required for the ﬁrst (18 units). The head-count ratio is also not affected by any transfer
of income from a poor household to one that is richer if both households remain on
the same side of the poverty line. Even worse, observe that if we change the second
distribution to {7, 11, 20, 40, 50} the head-count ratio falls to E = 1
5, so a regressive
transfer has actually reduced the head-count ratio. This will happen whenever a transfer
takes the income of the recipient of the transfer above the poverty line.
Only one of the two pieces of information on poverty are used in the head count. A
measure that uses only information on how far below the poverty line are the incomes
of the poor households is the aggregate poverty gap. This is deﬁned as the simple sum
of the income gaps of the households that are in poverty. Recalling that it is the ﬁrst q
households that are in poverty, the aggregate poverty gap is
V =
q

h=1
gh.
(14.29)
The interpretation of this measure is that it is the additional income for the poor that is
required to eliminate poverty. It provides some information but is limited by the fact that
it is not sensitive to changes in the number in poverty. In addition the aggregate poverty
gap gives equal weight to all income shortfalls regardless of how far they are from the

485
Chapter 14: Inequality and Poverty
poverty line. It is therefore insensitive to transfers unless the transfer takes one of the
households out of poverty. To see this latter point, for the poverty line of z = 10 the
income distributions {5, 5, 20, 40, 50} and {1, 9, 20, 40, 50} have an aggregate poverty
gap of V = 10. The distribution between the poor is somewhat different in the two
cases.
One direct extension of the aggregate poverty gap is to adjust the measure by taking
into account the number in poverty. The income gap ratio does this by calculating
the aggregate poverty gap and then dividing by the number in poverty. Finally the
value obtained is divided by the value of the poverty line, z, to obtain a measure whose
value falls between 0 (the absence of poverty) and 1 (all households in poverty have
no income):
I = 1
z
	q
h=1 gh
q
.
(14.30)
For the income distribution {1, 9, 20, 40, 50}, the income gap ratio when z = 10 is
I = 1
10
9 + 1
2
= 0.5.
(14.31)
However, when this income distribution changes to {1, 10, 20, 40, 50}, so that only one
household is now in poverty, the measure becomes
I = 1
10
9
1 = 0.9.
(14.32)
This example reveals that the income gap ratio has the unfortunate property of being
able to report increased poverty when the income of a household crosses the poverty
line and the number in poverty is reduced.
These observations suggest that it is necessary to reﬂect more carefully on the prop-
erties that a poverty measure should possess. In 1976 Amartya K. Sen suggested that a
poverty measure should have the following properties:
• Transfers of income between households above the poverty line should not affect the
amount of poverty.
• If a household below the poverty line becomes worse off, poverty should increase.
• The poverty measure should be anonymous, meaning it should not depend on who
is poor.
• A regressive transfer among the poor should raise poverty.

486
Part V: Equity and Distribution
Thesearepropertiesthathavealreadybeenhighlightedbythediscussion. Twofurther
properties were also proposed:
• The weight given to a household should depend on their ranking among the poor,
meaning more weight should be given to those furthest below the poverty line.
• The measure should reduce to the headcount if all the poor have the same level of
income.
One poverty measure that satisﬁes all of these conditions is the Sen measure

head-count ratio), a measure of the shortfall in income (the income gap ratio), and a
measure of the distribution of income among the poor (the Gini). Applying the Sen
measure to the income distribution {1, 9, 20, 40, 50}, when z = 10, we have E = 2
5 and
I = 0.5. The Gini is calculated for the distribution of income of the poor {1, 9}, so

In contrast, for the distribution {1, 10, 20, 40, 50} that was judged worse using the

which is simply the head-count ratio and records a lower level of poverty.
There is a further desirable property that leads into an alternative and important
class of poverty measures. Consider a population that can be broken down into distinct
subgroups. For instance, imagine dividing the population into rural and urban dwellers.
The property we want is for the measure to be able to assign a poverty level for each of
the groups and to aggregate these group poverty levels into a single level for the total
society. Further we will also want the aggregate measure to increase if poverty rises in
one of the subgroups and does not fall in any of the others. So, if rural poverty rises while
urban poverty remains the same, aggregate poverty must rise. Any poverty measures
that satisﬁes this condition are termed subgroup consistent.

Chapter 14: Inequality and Poverty
Before introducing a form of measure that is subgroup consistent, it is worth provid-
ing additional discussion of the effect of transfers. The measures discussed so far have
all had the property that the effect of a transfer has been independent of the income
levels of the loser and gainer (except when the transfer was between households on
different sides of the poverty line or changed the number in poverty). In the same way as
in inequality measurement, where we argued for magnifying the effect of deviations far
from the mean, we can argue that the effect of a transfer in poverty measurement should
be dependent on the incomes of those involved in the transfer. For example, a transfer
away from the lowest income household should have more effect on measured poverty
than a transfer away from a household close to the poverty line. A poverty measure
will satisfy this sensitivity to transfers if the increase in measured poverty caused by a
transfer of income from a poor household to a poor household with a higher income is
smaller, the larger is the income of the lowest income household.
Let the total population remain at H. Assume that this population can be divided into
Ŵ separate subgroups. Let gγ
h be the income gap of a poor member of subgroup γ and
qγ be the number of poor in that subgroup. Using this notation, a poverty measure that
satisﬁes the property of subgroup consistency is the Foster–Greer–Thorbecke (FGT)
class, given by

to transfers, while the effect of a transfer for P1 is independent of the incomes of the
households involved. For higher values of α the FGT measure satisﬁes sensitivity to
transfers, and more weight is placed on the income gaps of lower income households.

Two Applications
The use of these poverty measures is now illustrated by reviewing two applications.
The ﬁrst application, taken from Foster, Greer, and Thorbecke (1984), shows how
subgroup consistency can give additional insight into the sources of poverty. The second
application is extracted from an OECD working paper and illustrates how a range of
poverty lines can be used as a check on consistency. It also reveals that there can be a
good degree of agreement between different measures of poverty.
Table 14.3 reports an application of the FGT measure. The data are from a household
survey in Nairobi and groups the population according to their length of residence in
Nairobi. The measure used is the P2 measure, so α = 2.As already discussed, the use of
the FGT measure allows the contribution of each group to total poverty to be identiﬁed.
For example, those living in Nairobi between 6 and 10 years have a level of poverty
of 0.0343 and contribute 12.1 percent to total poverty—this is also the percentage by
which total poverty would fall if this group were all raised above the poverty line.
The division into groups also allows identiﬁcation of where the major contribution to
poverty arises. In this case the major contribution is made by those in the 21 to 70
group. Although the actual poverty level in this group is low, the number of households
in this group causes them to have a major effect on poverty.
The second application is reported in table 14.4. This OECD analysis studies the
change in poverty over (approximately) a ten-year period from the mid-1980s to the

mid-1990s. The numbers given are therefore the percentage change in the measure and
not the value of the measure. What the results show is that the direction of change in
poverty as measured by the head-count ratio is not sensitive to the choice of the poverty
line—the only inconsistency is the value forAustralia with the poverty line as 40 percent
of median income. In detail, there has been a decrease in poverty inAustralia, Belgium,
and the United States but an increase in Germany, Japan, and Sweden. The results in
the three central columns report the calculations for three different poverty measures.
These show that the Sen measure and the head count are always in agreement about the
direction of change. This is not true of the income gap, which disagrees with the other
two for Australia and the United States.

Unequal Opportunities
The main focus of the literature on equality of opportunity is on separating sources of
inequality of outcomes that are morally acceptable from those that are morally unac-
ceptable. In the seminal book of Roemer, Equality of Opportunity (1998), it is shown
that some inequality of outcomes is morally acceptable. Unequal outcomes that are a
consequence of factors for which individuals are judged to be responsible—referred to
as effort—are morally acceptable and should not be compensated for. Only inequality
that is outside the realm of individual choice—referred to as circumstances—should
be compensated for. Typical examples of circumstances that may affect individual out-
comes are family background and individual attributes such as race, gender, and place
of birth. To explore these ideas, it is ﬁrst necessary to deﬁne equality of opportunity.

490
Part V: Equity and Distribution
14.6.1
Deﬁning Equality of Opportunity
When are opportunities equal? The central idea is to observe how the opportunity sets
of people vary with their family background, race, gender, and so on. Equality of oppor-
tunity is achieved when no particular set of circumstances is preferred to another set of
circumstances by all individuals. Given that people facing similar circumstances may
produce different outcomes, the problem amounts to the comparison of distributions
of outcomes, conditional on circumstances.
Consider a situation where individuals are allowed to choose their circumstances,
s—which we refer to as their type—before they know their level of effort. Equality
of opportunity prevails between circumstances s and s′ if s is not preferred to s′ by
all individuals, and vice versa. In other words, people do not unanimously order the
opportunity sets s and s′. The opportunity set of an individual can be represented by
the conditional distribution function F(x|s) denoting the probability of producing an
outcome less than or equal to x for given type s. For example, this could describe the
distribution of educational attainments for pupils of low-income families (say type s)
compared to pupils from high-income families (say type s′).
Under the (weak) assumption that preferences satisfy the criteria of ﬁrst-order
stochastic dominance (FSD) and second-order stochastic dominance (SSD), stochastic
dominance tests can be used to rank conditional distribution functions. Formal deﬁni-
tions of ﬁrst-order stochastic dominance (FSD) and second-order stochastic dominance
(SSD) are given in, respectively, (14.39) and (14.40). Suppose inequality of opportu-
nity where circumstance s is preferred to circumstance s′ by all individuals. Inequality
of opportunity deﬁned as ﬁrst-order stochastic dominance between s and s′ means that
the distribution of outcome x conditional on s is for all x below the distribution of x
conditional on circumstance s′:
s ⪰FSD s′
iff
F(x|s) ≤F(x|s′),
∀x ∈ℜ+.
(14.39)
However, it can easily be shown that this is a very weak deﬁnition of equality of
opportunity. Indeed suppose a situation where the outcome distribution of type s always
dominates the outcome distribution of type s′, except at the top (possibly, when they
exert maximal effort). Under the deﬁnition of ﬁrst-order stochastic dominance, equality
of opportunity is not rejected in this case. But it is unfair because type s′ must exert
maximal effort to get a chance to outperform type s.
Second-order stochastic dominance provides extra restrictions. Under second-order
stochastic dominance, equality of opportunity prevails when the expected value derived
from distribution F(y|s) is not greater than the one derived from F(y|s′):

491
Chapter 14: Inequality and Poverty
s ⪰SSD s′ iff
 x
0
F(y|s)dy ≤
 x
0
F(y|s′)dy, ∀x ∈ℜ+.
(14.40)
14.6.2
Measuring Equality of Opportunity
Econometric stochastic dominance techniques can be used to test FSD and SSD of
conditional distributions. In relation to classical measure of inequality, we can also
estimate inequality of opportunity with a Gini-type index. This index is based on the
equivalence between SSD and Lorenz dominance. The Gini opportunity (GO) index
with k types is deﬁned as
GO(x) = 1
μ
k

i=1

j>i
pipj(μj(1 −Gj) −μi(1 −Gi)),
(14.41)
where μ is the mean of the population, μk the mean of group k, pk the population
weight of group k, and G the Gini coefﬁcient. The GO index computes the sum of all
pairwise differences of the opportunity sets of all types, where the opportunity sets are
deﬁned as twice the area under the generalized Lorenz curve, μs(1 −Gs), for type
s. The GO index is in the interval [0, 1]. A value of 0 indicates perfect equality of
opportunity.
14.6.3
Equal-Opportunity Policy
How does the theory of equal opportunity translate into policy? The distinctive fea-
ture of the equal-opportunity policy, compared to classical welfare policy, is that it
is a nonwelfarist policy. Welfarism is the view that only the set of vectors of out-
come (welfare) possibilities matters for choosing public policy. To be precise, if we
represent individual preferences over social alternatives by utility functions, then the
choice of a social alternative should depend only on the information that is recover-
able from the utility possibilities sets. In this sense, welfarism is a consequentialist
view.
The equal-opportunity approach says that one cannot judge the goodness of a social
outcome by knowing only the distribution of outcomes; one must also know how
hard people tried in order to evaluate that goodness. To put it differently, one must
know the role of effort in achievement to pass judgment on the goodness of a public
policy. From this perspective income taxation may not be the instrument of choice to
equalize opportunities for income (as recommended by the tax principle): one naturally

492
Part V: Equity and Distribution
thinks of using educational ﬁnance policy as a method for compensating children from
disadvantaged families.
To illustrate, there is a large difference between an equal-resource policy, which
invests the same amount in all children, and an equal-opportunity policy, which invests
in children so as to compensate for different social circumstances. The United States,
with its system of locally ﬁnanced public education, is in most places less equitable
even than the equal resource policy would be: that is, usually more is invested in the
public education of advantaged children than of disadvantaged children. Most of the
afﬁrmative action policies are grounded in an equal-opportunity approach.
14.7
Intergenerational Inequality
Social mobility occurs when different generations of a family have differing social
status. Formally, social mobility refers to a lack of correlation between the educational
attainments and earnings of parents and those of their children. To what extent is low
educational attainment and consequent poverty transmitted by parents to their children?
How can this be measured? And how can it be explained?
14.7.1
Measuring Issues
There are basically two sets of measures of the transmission of income and education
across generations. The ﬁrst set relates the earnings of parents to those of children, or
the education of parents to that of children. Both the correlation and elasticities of these
variables between parents and children give a basic measure of the intergenerational
transmission of income and education. The difference between correlations and elastic-
ities reﬂects differences in the variance of income/education for parents’and children’s
generations. The correlation is always between 0 and 1, but the elasticity can be greater
than 1 if there is an increase in inequality across generations. The complement to the
correlation (1−correlation) is a measure of intergenerational mobility.
The central issues are to measure permanent income by averaging over a sufﬁcient
number of years (to accommodate temporary shocks and lifetime income progression)
and to compare the income of the parents to that of children at the same point in their
life cycle. As a matter of illustration, Nicoletti and Ermisch (2007) obtain income
elasticites for the United States of around 0.5 to 0.6, and for the United Kingdom
of around 0.3. Elasticities for the Nordic countries are always lower than 0.3. The
comparison across countries and over time of these elasticities requires the use of

493
Chapter 14: Inequality and Poverty
the same estimation methods, same deﬁnitions, and the same sample selection rule.
There are also interesting nonlinearities in the elasticities. Bratsberg et al. (2007) ﬁnd
strong nonlinearities in the Nordic countries but not in the United States or the United
Kingdom. For example, in Denmark the elasticities are 0.06 at the bottom of the
income distribution and 0.31 at the top of the distribution. They suggest that this
nonlinearity is related to the strong public education systems that exist in the Nordic
countries.
The second set of measures use transition matrices to estimate mobility at each point
in the distribution. Transition matrices enable us to compare the mobility across the full
distribution rather than just around the mean. Jantti et al. (2006) split the distribution
into quintiles and study mobility across quintiles. They ﬁnd that more than 40 percent of
sons in the United States who are born to fathers in the lowest quintile are in the lowest
quintile themselves. Mobility from the lowest quintile is found to be much higher in
Nordic countries. They ﬁnd that much of the difference in mobility rates between the
United States and the Nordic countries are in fact attributable to difference in the tails
of the income distributions. Mobility across the middle three quintiles is very similar
across all countries.
Some authors deﬁne upward mobility as the probability that a child’s percentile rank
in the distribution of children exceeds the father’s percentile rank in the distribution
of fathers. In this case more weight is placed on small moves in position compared to
the quintile or quartiles approach. It has been shown that this distinction matters as the
degree of upward mobility of blacks in the United States is similar to that of whites
when the ﬁner mobility metric is used.
14.7.2
Causal Mechanisms
Understanding the determinants of intergenerational correlations is crucial for the de-
velopment of appropriate public policy. Without uncovering the driving forces behind
intergenerational transmission, it is impossible to ﬁgure out how to promote changes.
This is, of course, a very difﬁcult task, as it is often the case that any particular
parental attribute (e.g., as education or earnings) is correlated with a variety of parental
nonobservable characteristics.
Nature and Nurture
Strong earnings and educational correlations among siblings reveal the importance of
shared genetic and environmental factors, but they are not very helpful for pinning
down causal mechanisms. Bjorklund et al. (2005) make use of correlations across

494
Part V: Equity and Distribution
identical twins, fraternal twins, full siblings, half siblings, and adopted siblings, when
they are both raised together to distinguish between nature and nurture. They show that
genetics are more important than shared environment. Surprisingly, the identical twin
correlation is only 0.36.
We must interpret this decomposition between nature and nurture with great prudence
because it is possible that twins are treated differently by parents and, more important,
because with assortative mating people tend to marry people with similar characteristics
and so likely share genetic characteristics. It is just as likely there is positive interaction
between environmental and genetic factors that complicates the separation of the effects
of the two. Also twins are hardly representative of the population.
Using a sample of adopted children in Wisconsin, Plug (2004) ﬁnds a regression
coefﬁcient of about 0.28 on adoptive mother’s education. However, the interpretation
of this is not clear because adoption is not random and may result in positive selection
whereby high-ability adoptees end up in more educated families. Overall, this literature
on twins’, siblings’, and adoptees’ correlations suggest that both environmental and
genetic factors are important. Even so, we cannot be sure which factors matter most.
Taken as a whole, the ﬁndings in the literature are very inconsistent. Some studies ﬁnd
the effect of fathers to be more important, other studies ﬁnd the effects of mothers to
be more important.
School System
It has been shown that the school system matters.Astandard argument is based on credit
constraints. Solon(2004)presentsabasicmodelinwhichfamiliesarecreditconstrained
and must reduce current consumption to invest in human capital. If there are no credit
constraints, and thus parents can borrow from their children’s future earnings, each
family will optimally invest in the human capital of their children (assuming perfect
altruism). The optimality conditions will recommend investing more in high-ability
children, and so we should expect intergenerational transmission of inequality only
if child ability and parental earnings are correlated. If there are credit constraints,
however, poor families cannot invest optimally in their children’s human capital. As a
result a higher income level means an increase human capital investment.
The model also predicts that the intergenerational elasticity is increasing in the ge-
netic transmission of ability and the rate of return on human capital investment, but it
is decreasing with the public investment in education. The implication is that the low
elasticites in the Nordic countries could be explained either by low returns on training
investment (the compressed earnings distributions) or the public education system that

495
Chapter 14: Inequality and Poverty
tends to equalize educational opportunities for children. Suggestive evidence is con-
tained in Ichino et al. (2009) who report a negative correlation of −0.54 between public
expenditure on education and intergenerational income elasticities. The correlation is
even stronger with public expenditure on primary education.
Attitudes and Social Behaviors
What do parents transmit to their children? Other social scientists have claimed that
attitudes matter more than the socioeconomic status of the family. This is particularly
relevant for low-income groups and minorities. Indeed Cunha and Heckman (2008)
survey a large number of studies that show that nonpecuniary factors (psychic costs,
motivations, etc.) play a major role in explaining why minorities and persons from
low-income families do not attend college even though it is ﬁnancially proﬁtable to do
so. Because returns to schooling are lower for people less likely to attend college, these
groups may “rationally” choose to underinvest in education. Obviously economists
have much to learn from other social scientists to better grasp the nonpecunairy factors
that shape future economic and educational attainments.
Segregation
Segregation is important for understanding the dynamics of group inequality. Members
of different groups with identical distributions of cognitive abilities will invest dif-
ferently in the education of their children when the segregation is sufﬁciently great.
Furthermore the relationship between group equality and social segregation can exhibit
a discontinuity if there exists a critical level of segregation such that convergence to
group equality occurs if and only if segregation lies below this threshold. Hence a small
increase in social integration, if it takes the economy across the threshold, may have
large effects on long-run group inequality, while a large increase in integration that
does not cross the threshold may have no persistent effect. This suggests that economic
inequality across social groups might arise endogenously under certain conditions,
without preexisting discrimination or group differences in ability or wealth.
Dynamic systems with positive feedback can exhibit multiple types of self-reinforced
behavior at the group level. Positive feedback means that while there is tendency for
members of a group to make similar decisions, such feedback does not say which is
generally made. The implication of positive feedback is that different groups with iden-
tical characteristics can eventually adopt different norms of behaviors. This is certainly
a fruitful direction of investigation but a suitable method of empirical testing is not
obvious. Indeed there is no agreement in the literature on how to measure segregation

496
Part V: Equity and Distribution
(with nearly 20 different indexes of segregation representing different concepts such
as evenness, exposure, concentration, centralization, and clustering), and as a result it
is hardly possible to verify whether segregation is a leading cause of racial and social
differences on economic outcomes.
14.8
Conclusions
The need to quantify is driven by the aim of making precise comparisons. What eco-
nomic analysis contributes is an understanding of the bridge between intuitive concepts
of inequality and poverty, and speciﬁc measures of these phenomena. Analysis can re-
veal the implications of alternative measures and provide principles that a good measure
should satisfy.
The ﬁrst problem we challenged in this chapter was the comparison of incomes
between households of different compositions. It is clearly more expensive to support
a large family than a small family, but exactly how much more expensive is more
difﬁcult to determine. Equivalence scales were introduced as the analytical tool to solve
this problem. These scales were initially based on the cost of achieving a minimum
standard of living. Although simple, such an approach does not easily generalize to
higher income levels, nor does it take much account of economic optimization. In
principle, equivalence scales could be built directly from utility functions, but to do
so, issues must be addressed of how the preferences of the individual members of a
household are aggregated into a household preference order.
Inequality occurs when some households have a higher income (after the incomes
have been equivalized for household composition) than others. The Lorenz curve
provides a graphical device for contrasting income distributions. Some income distri-
butions can be ranked directly by the Lorenz curve, in which case there is no ambiguity
about which has more inequality, but not all distributions can be. Inequality measures
provide a quantitative assessment of inequality by imposing restrictions beyond those
incorporated in the Lorenz curve. The chapter investigated the properties of a number of
measures of inequality. Of particular importance was the observation that all inequal-
ity measures embody implicit welfare judgments. Given this, the Atkinson measure
is constructed on the basis that the welfare judgments should be made explicit and
the inequality measure constructed on these judgments. In principle, alternative mea-
sures can generate different rankings of income distributions, but in practice, as the
application showed, they can yield very consistent rankings.

497
Chapter 14: Inequality and Poverty
In many ways the measurement of poverty raises similar issues to those of inequality.
The additional feature of poverty is the necessity to determine whether households can
be classed as living in poverty. The poverty line, which provides the division between
the two groups, plays a central role in poverty measurement. Where and how to locate
this poverty line is important, but more fundamental is how it should be adjusted
over time. At stake here is the key question of whether poverty should be viewed in
absolute or relative terms. The practice in developed countries is to use relative poverty.
The chapter reviewed a number of poverty measures from the head-count ratio to the
Foster–Greer–Thorbecke measure. These measures are also distinguished by a range
of sensitivity properties. The applications showed how they could be used and that the
different measures could provide a consistent picture of the development of poverty
despite their different conceptual bases.
The chapter has revealed how economic analysis is able to provide insights into what
we are assuming when we employ a particular inequality or poverty measure. It has also
revealed how we can think about the process of improving our measures. Inequality
and poverty are signiﬁcant issues, and better measurement is a necessary starting point
for better policy.

TAXATION

Commodity Taxation
15.1
Introduction
Commodity taxes are levied on transactions involving the purchase of goods. The
necessity for keeping accounts ensures that such transactions are generally public in-
formation. This makes them a good target for taxation. The drawback, however, is that
commodity taxation distorts consumer choices and causes inefﬁciency. Some striking
historical examples can be found in the United Kingdom where there have been win-
dow taxes and hearth taxes. The window tax was introduced in 1696 in the reign of
William III and lasted until 1851. The tax was paid on any house with more than six
windows (increased to eight in 1825), which gave an incentive to brick up any win-
dows in excess of the allowable six. Even today, old houses can be found with windows
still bricked up. The hearth tax was levied between 1662 and 1689 at the rate of two
shillings (two days’ wages for a ploughman) per annum on each hearth in a building.
This induced people to brick up their chimneys and shiver through the winter. In the
marketplace, commodity taxes drive a wedge between the price producers receive and
the price consumers pay. This leads to inefﬁciency and reduces the attainable level of
welfare compared to what could be achieved using lump-sum taxes. This is the price
that has to be paid for implementable taxation.
The effects of commodity taxes are quite easily understood—the imposition of a tax
raises the price of a good. On the consumer side of the market, the standard analysis of
income and substitution effects predicts what will happen to demand. For producers,
the tax is a cost increase, and they respond accordingly. What is more interesting is
the choice of the best set of taxes for the government. There are several interesting
settings for this question. The simplest version can be described as follows. There is a
given level of government revenue to be raised that must be ﬁnanced solely by taxes on
commodities. How must the taxes be set so as to minimize the cost to society of raising
the required revenue? This is the Ramsey problem of efﬁcient taxation, ﬁrst addressed
in the 1920s. The insights its study gives are still at the heart of the understanding of
setting optimal commodity taxes. More general problems introduce equity issues in
addition to those of efﬁciency.
The chapter begins by discussing the deadweight loss that is caused by the introduc-
tion of a commodity tax.Adiagrammatic analysis of optimal commodity taxation is then
presented. This diagram is also used to demonstrate the Diamond–Mirrlees Production
Efﬁciency result. Following this, the Ramsey rule is derived and an interpretation of

506
Part VI: Taxation
this is provided. The extension to many consumers is then made and the resolution of
the equity–efﬁciency trade-off is emphasized. This is followed by a review of some
numerical calculations of optimal taxes based on empirical data.
15.2
Deadweight Loss
Lump-sum taxation was described as the perfect tax instrument because it does not
cause any distortions. The absence of distortions is due to the fact that a lump-sum tax
is deﬁned by the condition that no change in behavior can affect the level of the tax.
Commodity taxation does not satisfy this deﬁnition. It is always possible to change a
consumption plan if commodity taxation is introduced. Demand can shift from goods
subject to high taxes to goods with low taxes, and total consumption can be reduced by
earning less or saving more. It is these changes at the margin, which we call substitution
effects, that are the tax-induced distortions.
The introduction of a commodity tax raises tax revenue but causes consumer wel-
fare to be reduced. The deadweight loss of the tax is the extent to which the reduction
in welfare exceeds the revenue raised. This concept is illustrated in ﬁgure 15.1. Before
the tax is introduced, the price of the good is p and the quantity consumed is X0. At
this price the level of consumer surplus is given by the triangle abc. A speciﬁc tax
of amount t is then levied on the good, so the price rises to q = p + t and quan-
tity consumed falls to X1. This fall in consumption together with the price increase

reduces consumer surplus to aef . The tax raises revenue equal to tX1, which is given
by the area cdef . The part of the original consumer surplus that is not turned into tax
revenue is the deadweight loss, DWL, given by the triangle bde.
It is possible to provide a simple expression that approximates the deadweight loss.
The triangle bde is equal to 1
2tdX, where dX is the change in demand X0 −X1. This
formula could be used directly, but it is unusual to have knowledge of the level of
demand before and after the tax is imposed. Accepting this, it is possible to provide
an alternative form for the formula. This can be done by noting that the elasticity of
demand is deﬁned by εd = p
X
dX
dp , so it implies that dX = εd X0
p dp. Substituting this
into deadweight loss gives
DWL = 1
2
(((εd((( X0
p t2,
(15.1)
since the change in price is dp = t. The measure in (15.1) is approximate because it
assumes that the elasticity is constant over the full change in price from p to q = p +t.
The formula for deadweight loss reveals two important observations. First, dead-
weight loss is proportional to the square of the tax rate. The deadweight loss will there-
fore rise rapidly as the tax rate is increased. Second, the deadweight loss is proportional
to the elasticity of demand. For a given tax change the deadweight loss will be larger
the more elastic is demand for the commodity.
An alternative perspective on commodity taxation is provided in ﬁgure 15.2. Point
a is the initial position in the absence of taxation. Now consider the contrast between a

lump-sum tax and a commodity tax on good 1 when the two tax instruments raise the
same level of revenue. In the ﬁgure the lump-sum tax is represented by the move from
point a to point b. The budget constraint shifts inward, but its gradient does not change.
Utility falls from U0 to U1. A commodity tax on good 1 increases the price of good 1
relative to the price of good 2 and causes the budget constraint to become steeper. At
point c the commodity tax raises the same level of revenue as the lump-sum tax. This is
because the value of consumption at c is the same as that at b, so the same amount must
have been taken off the consumer by the government in both cases. The commodity
tax causes utility to fall to U2, which is less than U1. The difference U1 −U2 is the
deadweight loss measured directly in utility terms.
Figure 15.2 illustrates two further points to which it is worth drawing attention.
Notice that commodity taxation produces the same utility level as a lump-sum tax that
would move the consumer to point d. This is clearly a larger lump-sum tax than that
which achieved point a. The difference in the size of the two lump-sum taxes provides a
monetary measure of the deadweight loss. The effect of the commodity tax can now be
broken down into two separate components. First, there is the move from the original
point a to point d. In line with the standard terminology of consumer theory, this is
called an income effect. Second, there is a substitution effect due to the increase in the
price of good 1 relative to good 2 represented by a move around an indifference curve.
This shifts the consumer’s choice from point d to point c.
This argument can be extended to show that it is the substitution effect that is respon-
sible for the deadweight loss. To do this, note that if the consumer’s indifference curves

509
Chapter 15: Commodity Taxation
are all L-shaped so that the two commodities are perfect complements, then there is no
substitution effect in demand—a relative price change with utility held constant just
pivots the budget constraint around the corner of the indifference curve. As shown in
ﬁgure 15.3, the lump-sum tax and the commodity tax result in exactly the same out-
come, so the deadweight loss of the commodity tax is zero. The initial position without
taxation is at a and both tax instruments lead to the ﬁnal equilibrium at b. Hence the
deadweight loss is caused by substitution between commodities.
15.3
Optimal Taxation
The purpose of optimal tax analysis is to ﬁnd the set of taxes that gives the highest
level of welfare while raising the revenue required by the government. The set of taxes
that do this are termed optimal. In determining these taxes, consumers must be left
free to choose their most preferred consumption plans at the resulting prices and ﬁrms
to continue to maximize proﬁts. The taxes must also lead to prices that equate supply
to demand. This section will consider the problem for the case of a single consumer.
This restriction ensures that only efﬁciency considerations arise. The more complex
problem involving equity, as well as efﬁciency, will be addressed in section 15.6.
To introduce a number of important aspects of commodity taxation in a simple way,
it is best to begin with a diagrammatic approach. Among the features that this makes
clear are the second-best nature of commodity taxes relative to lump-sum taxes. In
other words, the use of commodity taxes leads to a lower level of welfare compared to
the optimal set of lump-sum taxes. Despite this effect, the observability of transactions
makes commodity taxes feasible, whereas optimal lump-sum taxes are generally not,
for the reasons explored in chapter 13.
Consideratwo-goodeconomywithasingleconsumerandasingleﬁrm(theRobinson
Crusoe economy of chapter 2). One of the goods, labor, is used as an input (so it is
supplied by the consumer to the ﬁrm), and the output is sold by the ﬁrm to the consumer.
In ﬁgure 15.4 the horizontal axis measures labor use and the vertical axis output. The
ﬁrm’s production set, marked Y in the ﬁgure, is also the production set for the economy.
This is displaced from the origin by a distance R that equals the tax revenue requirement
of the government. The interpretation is that the government takes out of the economy
R units of labor for its own purposes. After the revenue requirement has been met, the
economy then has constant returns to scale in turning labor into output. The commodity
taxes have to be chosen to attain this level of revenue. Normalizing the wage rate to
1, the only output price for the ﬁrm that leads to zero proﬁt is shown by p. This is the
only level of proﬁt consistent with the assumption of competitive behavior, and p must

be the equilibrium price for the ﬁrm. Given this price, the ﬁrm is indifferent to where
it produces on the frontier of its production set.
Figure 15.5 shows the budget constraint and the preferences of the consumer. With
the wage rate of 1, the budget constraint for the consumer is constructed by setting the
consumer’s price for the output to q. The difference between q and p is the tax on the
consumption good. It should be noticed that labor is not taxed. As will become clear,
this is not a restriction on the set of possible taxes. With these prices the consumer’s
budget constraint can be written qx = ℓ, where x denotes units of the output and ℓunits
of labor. The important properties of this budget constraint are that it is upward sloping
and must pass through the origin. The preferences of the consumer are represented by
indifference curves. The form of these follows from noting that the supply of labor
causes the consumer disutility, so an increase in labor supply must be compensated
for by further consumption of output in order to keep utility constant. The indifference
curves are therefore downward sloping. Given these preferences, the optimal choice is
found by the tangency of the budget constraint and the highest attainable indifference
curve. Varying the price, q, faced by the consumer gives a series of budget constraints
whose slopes increase as q falls. Forming the locus of optimal choices determined
by these budget constraints traces out the consumer’s offer curve. Each point on this
offer curve can be associated with a budget constraint that runs through the origin and

511
Chapter 15: Commodity Taxation

an indifference curve tangential to that budget constraint. The interpretation given to
the offer curve is that the points on the curve are the only ones consistent with utility
maximization by the consumer in the absence of lump-sum taxation. It should also be
noted that the consumer’s utility rises as the move is made up the offer curve.
Figures 15.4 and 15.5 can be superimposed to represent the production and con-
sumption decisions simultaneously. This is done in ﬁgure 15.6, which can be used to
ﬁnd the optimal tax rate on the consumption good. The only points that are consistent
with choice by the consumer are those on the offer curve. The maximal level of utility
achievable on the offer curve is at the point where it intersects the production frontier.
Any level higher than this is not feasible. This optimum is denoted by point e, and here
the consumer is on indifference curve I0. At this optimum the difference between the
consumer price and the producer price for the output, t∗= q−p, is the optimal tax rate.
That is, it is the tax that ensures that the consumer chooses point e. By construction,
this tax rate must also ensure that the government raises its required revenue so that
t∗x∗= R, where x∗is the level of consumption at point e.
This discussion has shown how the optimal commodity tax is determined at the
highest point of the offer curve in the production set. This is the solution to the problem
of ﬁnding the optimal commodity taxes for this economy. The diagram also shows
why labor can remained untaxed without affecting the outcome. The choices of the

512
Part VI: Taxation
consumer and the ﬁrm are determined by the ratio of prices they face or the direction of
the price vector (which is orthogonal to the budget constraint). By changing the length
(but not the direction) of either p or q, one can introduce a tax on labor, but it does not
alter the fact that e is the optimum. This reasoning can be expressed by saying that the
zero tax on labor is a normalization, not a real restriction on the system.
Figure 15.6 also illustrates the second-best nature of commodity taxation relative to
lump-sum taxation. It can be seen that there are points above the indifference curve I0
(the best achievable by commodity taxation) that are preferred to e and that are also
productively feasible. The highest attainable indifference curve for the consumer given
the production set is I1 with utility maximized at point e∗. This point would be chosen
by the consumer if they faced a budget constraint that is coincident with the production
frontier. A budget constraint of this form would cross the horizontal axis to the left of
the origin and would have equation qx = ℓ−R, where R represents a lump-sum tax
equal to the revenue requirement. This lump-sum tax would decentralize the ﬁrst-best
outcome at e∗. Commodity taxation can only achieve the second-best at e.

Production Efﬁciency
The diagrammatic illustration of optimal taxation in the one-consumer economy also
shows another important result. This result, known as the Diamond–Mirrlees Pro-
duction Efﬁciency Lemma, states that the optimal commodity tax system should not
disrupt production efﬁciency. In other words, the optimum with commodity taxation
must be on the boundary of the production set and all distortions are focused on con-
sumer choice. This section provides a demonstration of the efﬁciency lemma and
discusses its implications.
Production efﬁciency occurs when an economy is maximizing the output attainable
from its given set of resources. This can only happen when the economy is on the
boundary of its production possibility set. Starting at a boundary point, no reallocation
of inputs among ﬁrms can increase the output of one good without reducing that of
another (compare this with the conditions for Pareto-efﬁciency in chapter 2). In the
special case where each ﬁrm employs some of all the available inputs, a necessary
condition for production efﬁciency is that the marginal rate of substitution (MRS)
between any two inputs be the same for all ﬁrms. Such a position of equality is attained,
in the absence of taxation, by the proﬁt maximization of ﬁrms in competitive markets.
Each ﬁrm sets the marginal rate of substitution equal to the ratio of factor prices, and
since factor prices are the same for all ﬁrms, this induces the necessary equality in the
MRSs. The same is true when there is taxation, provided that all ﬁrms face the same
after-tax prices for inputs, meaning inputs taxes are not differentiated among ﬁrms.
To see that the optimum with commodity taxation must be on the frontier of the
production set, consider the interior point f in ﬁgure 15.7. If the equilibrium were at
f , the consumer’s utility could be raised by reducing the use of the input while keeping
output constant. Since this is feasible, f cannot be an optimum. Since this reasoning
can be applied to any point that is interior to the production set, the optimum must be
on the boundary.
Although ﬁgure 15.7 was motivated by considering the input to be labor, a slight re-
interpretationcanintroduceintermediategoods.Assumethatthereareseveralindustries
and that each industry has a production process that uses one unit of labor to produce
one unit of an intermediate good. The intermediate goods are then combined by the
ﬁnal goods industry using a production process that has constant returns to scale. The
intermediate good production is displayed indirectly in ﬁgure 15.7 as the link between
the use of labor and the output of the ﬁnal good. The production efﬁciency argument

then follows directly as before and now implies that intermediate goods should not be
taxed, since this would violate the equalization of MRSs between ﬁrms.
The logic of the single-consumer economy can be adapted to show that the efﬁciency
lemma still holds when there are many consumers. What makes the result so obvious in
the single-consumer case is that a reduction in labor use or an increase in output raises
the consumer’s utility. With many consumers, such a change would have a similar effect
if all consumers supply labor or prefer to have more, rather than less, of the consumption
good. This will hold if there is some agreement in the tastes of the consumers. If this is
so, a direction of movement can be found from an interior point in the production set
to an exterior point that is unanimously welcomed. The optimum must then be on the
boundary.
In summary, the Diamond–Mirrlees Production Efﬁciency Lemma provides a per-
suasive argument for the nontaxation of intermediate goods and the nondifferentiation
of input taxes among ﬁrms. These are results of immediate practical importance, since
they provide a basic property that an optimal tax system must possess. As will become
clear, it is rather hard to make precise statements about the optimal levels of tax, but
what the efﬁciency lemma provides is a clear and simple statement about the structure
of taxation.

Chapter 15: Commodity Taxation
15.5
Tax Rules
The diagrammatic analysis has shown the general principle behind the determination of
the optimal taxes. What is not shown is how the tax burden is allocated across different
commodities. The optimal tax problem is to set the taxes on commodities to maximize
social welfare subject to raising a required level of revenue. This section looks at tax
rules that characterize the solution to this problem.
To derive the rules, it is ﬁrst necessary to precisely specify a model of the economy.
Let there be n goods, each produced with constant returns to scale by competitive ﬁrms.
Since the ﬁrms are competitive, the price of the commodity they sell must be equal to
the marginal cost of production. Under the assumption of constant returns, this marginal
cost is also independent of the scale of production. Labor is assumed to be the only
input into production.
With the wage rate as numéraire, these assumptions imply that the producer (or
before-tax) price of good i is determined by
pi = ci,
i = 1, . . . , n,
(15.2)
where ci denotes the number of units of labor required to produce good i. The consumer
(or after-tax) prices are equal to the before-tax prices plus the taxes. For good i the
consumer price qi is
qi = pi + ti,
i = 1, . . . , n.
(15.3)
Writing xi for the consumption level of good i, the tax rates on the n consumption goods
must be chosen to raise the required revenue. With the revenue requirement denoted
by R, the revenue constraint can be written as
R =
n

i=1
tixi.
(15.4)
In line with this numbering convention, labor is denoted as good 0, so x0 is the supply
of labor (labor is the untaxed good, so t0 = 0).
This completes the description of the economy. The simplifying feature is that the
assumption of constant returns to scale ﬁxes the producer prices via (15.2) so that
equilibrium prices are independent of the level of demand. Furthermore constant returns
also implies that whatever demand is forthcoming at these prices will be met by the
ﬁrms. If the budget constraints are satisﬁed (both government and consumer), any
demand will be backed by sufﬁcient labor supply to carry out the necessary production.

15.5.1
The Inverse Elasticity Rule
Figure 15.6 shows some of the features that the optimal set of commodity taxes will
have. What the single-good formulation cannot do is give any insight into how that tax
burden should be spread across different goods. For example, should all goods have
the same rate of tax or should taxes be related to the characteristics of the goods?
The ﬁrst tax rule considers a simpliﬁed situation that delivers a very precise answer
to this question. This answer, the inverse elasticity rule, provides a foundation for
proceeding to the more general case. The simplifying assumption is that the goods are
independent in demand so that there are no cross-price effects between the taxed goods.
This independence of demands is a strong assumption, so it is not surprising that a clear
result can be derived. The way the analysis works is to choose the optimal allocation
and infer the tax rates from this. This was the argument used in the diagram when the
intersection of the offer curve and the frontier of the production set was located and the
tax rate derived from the implied budget constraint.
Consider a consumer who buys the two taxed goods and supplies labor. The con-
sumer’s preferences are described by the utility function U (x0, x1, x2), and his budget
constraint is q1x1 + q2x2 = x0. The utility-maximizing consumption levels of the
two consumption goods are described by the ﬁrst-order conditions U′
i = αqi, i = 1, 2,
where U′
i is the marginal utility of good i and α is the marginal utility of income. The
choice of labor supply satisﬁes the ﬁrst-order condition U′
0 = −α.
With taxes t1 and t2 the government revenue constraint is R = t1x1 + t2x2. Since
producer and consumer prices are related by ti = qi −pi, this can be written as
q1x1 + q2x2 = R + p1x1 + p2x2.
(15.5)
The optimal tax rates are inferred from an optimization whereby the government
chooses the consumption levels to maximize the consumer’s utility while meeting the
revenue constraint. This problem is summarized by the constrained maximization
max
{x1,x2} L = U(x0, x1, x2) + λ [q1x1 + q2x2 −R −p1x1 −p2x2].
(15.6)
In this maximization the quantity of labor supply, x0, is determined endogenously by
x1 and x2 from the consumer’s budget constraint, x0 = q1x1 + q2x2.
The basic assumption that the demands are independent can be used to write the (in-
verse) demand function qi = qi (xi). Using these demand functions and the consumer’s
budget constraint to replace x0, we write the ﬁrst-order condition for the quantity of
good i:

(15.9)
Equation (15.9) is the inverse elasticity rule. This is interpreted by noting that α is
the marginal utility of another unit of income for the consumer and λ is the utility cost
of another unit of government revenue. Since taxes are distortionary, λ > α. Since εd
i
is negative, this makes the tax rate positive.
The inverse elasticity rule states that the proportional rate of tax on good i should
be inversely related to its price elasticity of demand. Furthermore the constant of
proportionality is the same for all goods. Recalling the discussion of the deadweight
loss of taxation, it can be seen that this places more of the tax burden on goods where the
deadweight loss is low. Its implication is clearly that necessities, which by deﬁnition
have low elasticities of demand, should be highly taxed. It is this latter aspect that
emphasizes the fact that the inverse elasticity rule describes an efﬁcient way to tax
commodities but not an equitable way. Placing relative high taxes on necessities will
result in lower income consumers bearing relatively more of the commodity tax burden
than high-income consumers.
15.5.2
The Ramsey Rule
The inverse elasticity rule is restricted by the fact that the demand for each good depends
only on the price of that good. This rules out all cross-price effects in demand, meaning
that the goods can be neither substitutes nor complements. When this restriction is
relaxed, a more general tax rule is derived. The general result is called the Ramsey
rule, and it is one of the oldest results in the theory of optimal taxation. It provides a
description of the optimal taxes for an economy with a single consumer and with no
equity considerations.

518
Part VI: Taxation
To derive the Ramsey rule, it is necessary to change from choosing the optimal
quantities to choosing the taxes. Assume that there are just two consumption goods in
order to simplify the notation, and let the demand function for good i be xi = xi (q)
where q = q1, q2. The fact that the prices of all the commodities enter this demand
function shows that the full range of interactions between the demands and prices
are allowed. Using these demand functions, the preferences of the consumer can be
written as
U = U(x0(q) , x1(q) , x2(q)).
(15.10)
The optimal commodity taxes are those that give the highest level of utility to the
consumer, while ensuring that the government reaches its revenue target of R > 0.
The government’s problem in choosing the tax rates can then be summarized by the
Lagrangean

This ﬁrst-order condition needs some manipulation to place it in the form we want. The
ﬁrst step is to note that the budget constraint of the consumer is
q1x1 (q) + q2x2 (q) = x0 (q).
(15.13)
Any change in price of good k must result in demands that still satisfy this constraint
so that

(15.14)
In addition the conditions for optimal consumer choice are U′

i = αqi.
Using these optimality conditions and (15.14), we rewrite the ﬁrst-order condition for
the optimal tax, (15.12), as

The next step in the derivation is to employ the Slutsky equation, which breaks the
change in demand into the income and substitution effects. The effect of an increase in
the price of good k upon the demand for good i is determined by the Slutsky equation as
∂xi

(15.17)

income). Substituting from (15.17) into (15.16) gives

The substitution effect of a change in the price of good i on the demand for good k is ex-

This symmetry property implies Ski = Sik, which can be used to rearrange (15.19) to

is a positive constant. Equation (15.20) is the Ram-
sey rule describing a system of optimal commodity taxes and an equation of this form
must hold for all goods, k = 1, . . . , n.
The optimal tax rule described by (15.20) can be used in two ways. If the details
of the economy are speciﬁed (the utility function and production parameters), then the
actual tax rates can be calculated. Naturally the precise values would be a function of the
structure chosen. Although this is the direction that heads toward practical application
of the theory (and more is said later), it is not the route that will be currently taken. The
seconduseoftheruleistoderivesomegeneralconclusionsaboutthedeterminantsoftax
rates. This is done by analyzing and understanding the different components of (15.20).
To proceed with this, the focus on the typical good k is maintained. Recall that a
substitution term measures the change in demand with utility held constant. Demand
deﬁned in this way is termed compensated demand. Now begin in an initial position
with no taxes. From this point the tax ti is the change in the tax rate on good i. Then tiSki
is a ﬁrst-order approximation to the change in compensated demand for good k due to
the introduction of the tax ti. If the taxes are small, this will be a good approximation
to the actual change. Extending this argument to take account of the full set of taxes, it
follows that 	2
i=1 tiSki is an approximation to the total change in compensated demand
for good k due to the introduction of the tax system from the initial no-tax position.
In employing this approximation, the Ramsey rule can be interpreted as saying that
the optimal tax system should be such that the compensated demand for each good is
reduced in the same proportion relative to the before-tax position. This is the standard
interpretation of the Ramsey rule.
The importance of this observation is reinforced when it is set against the alternative,
but incorrect, argument that the optimal tax system should raise the prices of all goods
by the same proportion in order to minimize the distortion caused by the tax system.
This is shown by the Ramsey rule to be false. What the Ramsey rule says is that it is
the distortion in terms of quantities, rather than prices, that should be minimized. Since
it is the level of consumption that actually determines utility, it is not surprising that
what happens to prices is secondary to what happens to quantities. Prices only matter
so far as they determine demands.
Although the actual tax rates are only implicit in the Ramsey rule, some general
comments can still be made. By the approximation interpretation, the rule suggests that
as the proportional reduction in compensated demand must be the same for all goods,
and those goods whose demand is unresponsive to price changes must bear higher taxes
in order to achieve the same reduction. Although broadly correct, this statement can

521
Chapter 15: Commodity Taxation
only be completely justiﬁed when all cross-price effects are accounted for. One simple
case that overcomes this difﬁculty is that in which there are no cross-price effects among
the taxed goods. This is the special case that led to the inverse elasticity rule.
Returning to the general case, goods that are unresponsive to price changes are
typically necessities such as food and housing. Consequently using the Ramsey rule
leads to a tax system that bears most heavily on necessities. In contrast, the lowest tax
rates would fall on luxuries. If put into practice, such a tax structure would involve low-
income consumers paying disproportionately larger fractions of their incomes in taxes
relative to high-income consumers. The inequitable nature of this is simply a reﬂection
of the single-consumer assumption: the optimization does not involve equity and the
solution reﬂects only efﬁciency criteria.
The single-consumer framework is not accurate as a description of reality, and it
leads to an outcome that is unacceptable on equity grounds. The value of the Ramsey
rule therefore arises primarily through the framework and method of analysis it intro-
duces. This can easily be generalized to more relevant settings. It shows how taxes
are determined by efﬁciency considerations and hence gives a baseline from which to
judge the effects of introducing equity.
15.6
Equity Considerations
The lack of equity in the tax structure determined by the Ramsey rule is inevitable
given its single-consumer basis. The introduction of further consumers who differ in
incomes and preferences makes it possible to see how equity can affect the conclusions.
Although the method that is now discussed can cope with any number of consumers,
it is sufﬁcient to consider just two. Restricting the number in this way has the merit of
making the analysis especially transparent.
Consider then an economy that consists of two consumers. Each consumer h, h = 1,
2, is described by their (indirect) utility function
Uh = Uh
xh
0 (q) , xh
1 (q) , xh
2 (q)

.
(15.21)
These utility functions may vary between the consumers. Labor remains the untaxed
numéraire, and all consumers supply only the single form of labor service.

where the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side is the total tax payment of consumer 1 and
the second term is the total tax payment of consumer 2. The government’s policy is
guided by a social welfare function that aggregates the individual consumers’ utilities.

(15.23)
Combining (15.22) and (15.23) into a Lagrangean expression (as in equation 15.11),
we have the ﬁrst-order condition for the choice of the tax on good k:

βh is formed as the product of the effect of an increase in consumer h’s utility on social
welfare and their marginal utility of income. It measures the increase in social welfare
that results from a marginal increase in the income of consumer h. Consequently βh is
termed the social marginal utility of income for consumer h. Employing the deﬁnition
of βh and the substitutions used to obtain the Ramsey rule, we write the ﬁrst-order

The tax structure that is described by (15.27) can be interpreted in the same way as the

initial position with no taxes. When a positive amount of revenue is to be raised (so that
R > 0),thelevelofdemandwillbereducedbythetaxsystem,sothistermwillbenegative.
The ﬁrst point to observe about the right-hand side is that unlike the Ramsey rule,
the proportional reduction in compensated demand is not the same for all goods. It is
therefore necessary to discuss the factors that inﬂuence the extent of the reduction, and
it is by doing this that the consequences of equity can be seen. The essential component
in this regard is the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side. The proportional reduction in
demand for good k will be smaller the larger is the value of β1

value of this will be large if a high βh is correlated with
xh

k . The meaning of this
is clear, since a consumer will have a high value of βh when their personal marginal
utility of income, αh, is large and when ∂W
∂Uh is also large so that the social planner
gives them a high weight in social welfare. If the social welfare function is concave,
both of these will be satisﬁed by low-utility consumers with low incomes. The term
xh
k
x1
k +x2
k will be large when good k is consumed primarily by consumer h. Putting these
points together, we have that the proportional reduction in the compensated demand
for a good will be smaller if it is consumed primarily by the poor consumer. This is the
natural reﬂection of equity considerations.
The second term on the right-hand side shows that the proportional reduction in de-
mand for good k will be smaller if its demand comes mainly from the consumer whose
tax payments change most as income changes. This term is related to the efﬁciency as-
pects of the tax system. If taxation were to be concentrated on goods consumed by those
whose tax payments fell rapidly with reductions in income, then increased taxation,
and consequently greater distortion, would be required to meet the revenue target.
This has shown how the introduction of equity modiﬁes the conclusions of the Ram-
sey rule. Rather than all goods having their compensated demand reduced in the same
proportion, equity results in the goods consumed primarily by the poor facing less of
a reduction. In simple terms, this should translate into lower rates of tax on the goods
consumed by the poor relative to those determined solely by efﬁciency. Equity therefore
succeeds in moderating the hard edge of the efﬁcient tax structure.
15.7
Applications
At this point in the discussion it should be recalled that the fundamental motive for
the analysis is to provide practical policy recommendations. The results that have been

524
Part VI: Taxation
derived do give some valuable insights: the need for production efﬁciency and the
non-uniformity of taxes being foremost among them. Accepting this, the analysis is
only of real merit if the tax rules are capable of being applied to data and the actual
values of the resulting optimal taxes calculated. The numerical studies that have been
undertaken represent the development of a technology for achieving this aim and also
provide further insights into the structure of taxation.
Referring back to (15.27), it can be seen that two basic pieces of information are
needed in order to calculate the tax rates. The ﬁrst is knowledge of the demand functions
oftheconsumers. Thisprovidesthelevelsofdemandxh
k andthedemandderivatives ∂xh
k
∂qi .
The second piece of information is the social marginal utilities of income, βh. Ideally
these should be calculated from a speciﬁed social welfare function and individual utility
functions for the consumers. The problem here is the same as that raised in previous
chapters: the construction of some meaningful utility concept. The difﬁculties are
further compounded in the present case by the requirement that the demand functions
also be consistent with the utility functions.
In practice, the difﬁculties are circumvented rather than solved. The approach that
has been adopted is ﬁrst to ignore the link between demand and utility and to impose a
procedure to obtain the social marginal utilities of income. The demand functions are
then estimated using standard econometric techniques. One common procedure is to
combine the utility function deﬁned by (14.24) with a utilitarian social welfare function.
Hence assume that the social welfare function is utilitarian (W = 	
h Uh) and that the
individual utility functions are isoelastic (Uh = K Mh1−ε
1−ε ). The social marginal utility
for h is then given by
βh = K

Mh−ε
.
(15.28)
The value of the parameter K can be ﬁxed by, for instance, setting the value of βh equal
to 1 for the lowest income consumer. With ε > 0 the social marginal utility declines
as income rises. It decreases faster as ε rises, so relatively more weight is given to
low-income consumers. This way the value of ε can be treated as a measure of the
concern for equity.
15.7.1
Reform
The ﬁrst application of the analysis is to consider marginal reforms of tax rates. By a
marginal reform it is meant a small change from the existing set of tax rates that moves

525
Chapter 15: Commodity Taxation
the system closer to optimality. This should be distinguished from an optimization of
tax rates that might imply a very signiﬁcant change from the initial set of taxes.
Marginal reforms are much easier to compute than optimal taxes, since it is only
necessary to evaluate effect of changes not of the whole move.An analogy can be drawn
withhill-climbing: toclimbhigher, youonlyneedtoknowwhichdirectionleadsupward
and do not need to know where the top is. Essentially studying marginal reforms reduces
the informational requirement.
Return to the analysis of the optimal taxes in the economy with two consumers. The

where Xi is the aggregate demand for good i. The marginal revenue beneﬁt of taxation
of good k is deﬁned as the extra revenue generated relative to the welfare change of a
marginal increase in a tax. This can be written as
MRBk = −
∂R
∂tk
∂W
∂tk
.
(15.31)
At the optimum all goods should have the same marginal revenue beneﬁt. If that was
not the case, taxes could be raised on those with a high marginal revenue beneﬁt and
reduced for those with a low value. This is exactly the process we can use to deduce
the direction of reform.
From the marginal revenue beneﬁt the economy of information can be clearly seen.
All that is needed to evaluate MRBk are the social marginal utilities, βh, the individual
commodity demands, xh
k , and the aggregate derivatives of demand ∂Xi
∂qk (or, equally, the
aggregate demand elasticities). The demands and the elasticities are easily obtainable
from data sets on consumer demands.
Table 15.1 displays the result of a calculation of the MRBk using Irish data for
ten commodity categories in 1987. Two different values of ε are given, with ε = 5
representing a greater concern for equity. The interpretation of these ﬁgures is that the

tax levied on the goods toward the top of the table should be raised and the tax should
be lowered on the goods at the bottom. Hence services should be more highly taxed
and the tax on tobacco should be reduced! The rankings are fairly consistent for both
values of ε; there is some movement, but no good moves very far. Therefore a reform
based on these data would be fairly robust to changes in the concern for equity.
15.7.2
Optimality
The most developed implementation of the optimal tax rule for an economy with many
consumers uses data from the Indian National Sample Survey. Deﬁning θ to be the
wage as a proportion of expenditure, a selection of these results are given in table
15.2 for ε = 2. The table shows that these tax rates achieve some redistribution, since
cereals and milk products, both basic foodstuffs, are subsidized. Such redistribution
results from the concern for equity embodied in a value of ε of 2. Interesting as they
are, these results are limited, as are other similar analyses, by the degree of commodity
aggregation that leads to the excessively general other nonfood category.
The same dataset has been used to analyze the redistributive impact of Indian com-
modity taxes. The redistributive impact is found by calculating the total payment of
commodity tax, T h, by consumer h relative to the expenditure, μh, of the consumer.
The net gain from the tax system for h is then deﬁned by −T h
μh . The consumer gains from
the tax system if −T h
μh is positive, since this implies that a net subsidy is being received.

the potential gains from the optimal system. The calculations for the existing Indian tax
system give the gains shown in table 15.3. The expenditure levels of Rs. 20 and Rs. 50

is given in table 15.4. For ε = 1 or more, it can be seen that the potential gains from
the tax system, relative to the outcome that would occur in the absence of taxation,
are substantial. This shows that with sufﬁcient weight given to equity considerations,
the optimal set of commodity taxes can effect signiﬁcant redistribution and that the
existing Indian tax system does not attain these gains.

This section has discussed a method for calculating the taxes implied by the optimal
tax rule. The only difﬁculty in doing this is the speciﬁcation of the social welfare
weights. To determine these, it is necessary to know both the private utility functions
and the social welfare function. In the absence of this information, a method for deriving
the weights is employed that can embody equity criteria in a ﬂexible way. Although
these weights are easily calculated, they are not entirely consistent with the other
components of the model. The numbers derived demonstrate clearly that when equity
is embodied in the optimization, commodity taxes can secure a signiﬁcant degree of
redistribution. This is very much in contrast to what occurs with efﬁciency alone.
15.8
Efﬁcient Taxation
The tax rules in the previous section have only considered the competitive case. When
there is imperfect competition, additional issues have to be taken into account. The
basic fact is that imperfectly competitive ﬁrms produce less than the efﬁcient output
level, so the equilibrium without intervention is not Pareto-efﬁcient. This gives a reason
to use commodity taxes to subsidize the output of imperfectly competitive ﬁrms relative
to that of competitive ﬁrms. However, the strength of this argument depends on the
degree of tax-shifting, as identiﬁed in chapter 9.
The issues involved in tax design can be understood by determining the direction
of welfare-improving tax reform starting from an initial position with no commodity
taxation. This is undertaken for an economy with a single consumer and a zero-revenue
requirement. The fact that no revenue is raised implies that the taxes are used merely
to correct for the distortion introduced by the imperfect competition. There are two
consumption goods, each produced using labor alone. Good 1 is produced with constant
returns to scale by a competitive industry with after-tax price q1 = p1 + t1. There is a
single household in the economy whose (indirect) utility function is
U = U (x0 (q1, q2) , x1 (q1, q2) , x2 (q1, q2)).
(15.32)

529
Chapter 15: Commodity Taxation
Tax revenue, R, is deﬁned by
R = t1x1 + t2x2.
(15.33)
Good 2 is produced by a monopolist who chooses its output to maximize proﬁt
π2 = [q2 −c −t2] x2 (q1, q2) ,
(15.34)
where c is the constant marginal cost. The proﬁt-maximizing price depends on the
tax, t2, and the price of good 1, q1. This relationship is denoted q2 = q2 (q1, t2). The
derivative ∂q2
∂t2 measures the rate of shifting of the tax. In the terminology of chapter
9, there is undershifting if ∂q2
∂t2 < 1 and overshifting if ∂q2
∂t2 > 1. The dependence of the
demand for good 2 on the price of good 1 is reﬂected in the proﬁt-maximizing price.
The derivative ∂q2
∂q1 is the cross-price effect of taxation. It can be positive or negative,
and since q1 = p1 + t1, it follows that ∂q2
∂q1 = ∂q2
∂t1 .
The tax reform problem searches for a pair of tax changes that raises welfare while
collecting zero revenue. The initial position is taken to be one where both commodity
taxes are zero initially, so the intention is to ﬁnd a pair of tax changes dt1, dt2, starting
from an initial position with t1 = t2 = 0, such that dU > 0 and dR = 0. The formulation
ensures that one of the taxes will be negative and the other positive. The aim is to
provide a simple characterization of the determination of the relative rates. It should be
noted that if both industries were competitive the initial equilibrium would be Pareto-
efﬁcient and the solution to the tax problem would have dt1 = dt2 = 0. So nonzero tax
rates will be a consequence of the distortion caused by the imperfect competition.
Totally differentiating the utility function and using the ﬁrst-order conditions for
consumer choice, the effect of the tax changes on utility is
dU = −αx1
∂q1
∂t1
dt1 −αx2
∂q2
∂t1
dt1 −αx2

(15.35)
where α is the consumer’s marginal utility of income. Totally differentiating the revenue
constraint and using the fact that the initial values of the taxes are t1 = t2 = 0 gives
dR = 0 = x1dt1 + x2dt2,
(15.36)
Solving (15.36) for dt1 and substituting into the derivative of utility determines the
utility change as dependent on dt2 alone:
dU =

Part VI: Taxation
It is condition (15.37) that provides the key to understanding the determination of the
relative tax rates. Since we wish to choose the tax change dt2 to ensure that dU > 0,
it follows that the sign of the tax change must be the same as the bracketed term in
(15.37). From this observation follows the conclusion that
x1



< 0 ⇒dt2 < 0.
(15.38)
From (15.38) the output of the imperfectly competitive industry should be subsidized
and the competitive industry taxed when ∂q2
∂t2 is large, so that overshifting is occurring
and ∂q2
∂t1 is negative. These are, of course, sufﬁcient conditions. In general, the greater the
degree of tax shifting, the more likely is subsidization. The explanation for this result is
that if ﬁrms overshift taxes, they will also do the same for any subsidy. Hence a negative
dt2 will be reﬂected by an even greater reduction in price. If ∂q2
∂t1 is also negative, the
tax on the competitive industry secures a further reduction in the price of good 2.
The conclusion of this analysis is that the rate of tax-shifting is important in the
determination of relative rates of taxation. Although the economy is simpliﬁed, it does
demonstrate that with imperfect competition commodity taxation can be motivated on
efﬁciency grounds alone to mitigate the inefﬁciency cost of market power.
15.9
Public Sector Pricing
The theory that was developed in the previous sections also has a second application.
This arises because there are close connections between the theory of commodity tax-
ation and that of choosing optimal public sector prices. Firms operated by the public
sector can be set the objective of choosing their pricing policy to maximize social wel-
fare subject to a revenue target. If the ﬁrms have increasing returns to scale, which
is often the reason they are operated by the public sector, then marginal cost pricing
will lead to a deﬁcit (because marginal cost is below the decreasing average cost). The
government will then want to ﬁnd the optimal deviation from marginal-cost pricing
that ensures that the ﬁrms break even.
For both commodity taxation and public sector pricing, the government is choosing
the set of consumer prices that maximizes welfare subject to a revenue constraint. Under
the commodity taxation interpretation, these prices are achieved by setting the level
of tax to be included in each consumer price, whereas with public sector pricing, the
prices are chosen directly. However, the choice of tax rate is equivalent to the choice
of consumer price.

531
Chapter 15: Commodity Taxation
In the context of public sector pricing, the optimal prices are generally known as
Ramsey prices. The constraint on the optimization with commodity taxation requires
the raising of a speciﬁed level of revenue. With public sector pricing this can be reinter-
preted as the need to raise a given level of revenue in excess of marginal cost. The tax
rates of the commodity taxation problem then translate into the markup over marginal
cost in the public sector pricing interpretation. The rules for optimal taxation derived
above then characterize the public sector prices.
15.10
Conclusions
This chapter has reviewed the determination of optimal commodity taxes. It has been
shown how an efﬁcient system places the burden of taxation primarily on necessities.
If implemented, such a system would be very damaging to low-income consumers.
When equity is introduced, this outcome is modiﬁed to reduce the extent to which
goods consumed primarily by those with low incomes are affected by the tax system.
These interpretations were borne out by the numerical calculations.

The purpose of this exercise is to contrast the incidence of a commodity tax under different
market structures. Consider an economy with identical households and identical ﬁrms. The
representative household receives labor income for its labor supply ℓand proﬁt income π
for its ownership of the ﬁrm. The utility function of the household is U = 2√x −ℓ. The
ﬁrm produces one unit of ﬁnal consumption good x with one unit of labor input. Labor is
the numéraire good: the price of labor is normalized to 1, and labor is the untaxed good.
The producer price is p and the consumer price is q = p + t, where t > 0 is the (speciﬁc)
commodity tax.

Consider an economy with two representative households (h = 1, 2) that supply labor ℓh to
the one representative ﬁrm and buy a consumption good xh. Labor supply is inelastic (with

The utility function is U = xh, and the ﬁrm produces one unit of x with one unit of labor.
Labor is the numéraire good with its price normalized to 1. The producer price of x is p. The
government can levy individualized commodity tax th on good x. Thus the consumer price

Income Taxation
16.1
Introduction
In 1799 an income tax was introduced for the ﬁrst time in the United Kingdom to pay
for the Napoleonic war. The tax was levied at a rate of 10 percent on income above £60
and survived until it was repealed in 1816 following major public opposition. Part of the
opposition was due to concerns about privacy, and this was reﬂected in the decision of
Parliament to pulp all documents relating to the income tax. The tax returned in 1842
as a temporary measure (imposed for three years with the possibility of a two-year
extension) to cover a major budget deﬁcit. It has remained in place ever since, although
it is still temporary and Parliament has to re-apply it every year.
The income tax has remained controversial. As the discussion of chapter 4 showed,
the taxation of income is a major source of government revenue. This fact, coupled
with the direct observation by taxpayers of income tax payments, explains why the
structure of income tax is the subject of much political discussion. The arguments that
are aired in such debate reﬂect the two main perspectives on income taxation. The
ﬁrst views the tax primarily as a disincentive to effort and enterprise. On this ground,
it follows that the rate of tax should be kept as low as possible in order to avoid
such discouragement. This is essentially the expression of an efﬁciency argument. The
competing perspective is that income taxation is well suited for the task of redistributing
income. Hence notions of equity require that high earners should pay proportionately
more tax on their incomes than low earners. The determination of the optimal structure
of income taxation involves the resolution of these contrasting views.
The chapter begins by conducting an analysis of the interaction between income tax-
ation and labor supply. Anumber of theoretical results are derived, and these are related
to the empirical evidence. This evidence makes clear the extent of the difference be-
tween the responses of male and female labor supply to taxation. A model that permits
the efﬁciency and equity aspects of taxation to be incorporated into the design of the
optimal tax is then described. Aseries of results characterizing properties of the optimal
tax function are derived using this model, and these properties are interpreted in terms
of practical policy recommendations. Calculations of the optimal tax rates that emerge
from the model are then reviewed. The chapter is completed by a discussion of political
economy aspects of income taxation.

Part VI: Taxation
16.2
Equity and Efﬁciency
There are two major issues involved in the taxation of income. The ﬁrst is the effect
of taxation on the supply of labor. Taxation alters the choices that consumers make by
affecting the trade-off between labor and leisure. In this respect a particularly important
question is whether an increase in the rate of tax necessarily reduces the supply of labor.
If this is the case, support would be provided for the argument that taxes should be kept
lowtomeettheneedsofefﬁciency. Boththeoreticalandempiricalresultsaddressingthis
question will be discussed. The second issue that has been studied is the determination
of the optimal level of income taxation. For reasons that will become clear, this is a
complex problem, since it can only be addressed in a model with a meaningful trade-off
between efﬁciency and equity. Having said this, the search for the right trade-off has
proved to be a fruitful avenue of investigation.
The essential idea we wish to convey in this chapter is that it is a major mistake to
design the income tax structure to meet equity motives without taking into account the
impact on work effort. To see why, consider the naïve solution of setting the marginal
tax rate at 100 percent for all incomes above some threshold level z◦and at a rate of
zero for all incomes below this threshold. We might expect that such a tax structure will
maximize the redistribution possible from the rich (those above the income threshold) to
the poor (those below). However, this conclusion is incorrect when taxpayers respond
to the tax structure. The conﬁscatory tax above the threshold removes the incentive to
earn more than z◦, and everyone previously above this level will choose to earn exactly
that amount of income. This sets a vicious circle in motion. The government must lower
the threshold, inducing everyone above the new level to lower their incomes again, and
so forth, until no one chooses to work and income is zero.
It therefore stands to reason that we must analyze the equity of the tax structure in
tandem with its effect on work incentives. The idea is to ﬁnd the tax schedule that
meets social objectives, as captured by the social welfare function (see chapter 13),
given the adjustment in work effort and labor market participation by taxpayers. Such
a tax scheme is said to be optimal conditional on the given objective. The results
need to be interpreted with caution, however, because they are very sensitive to
the distribution of abilities in the population and to the form of the utility function.
More important, they depend on the equity objective as built into the social welfare
function.
In this chapter we will only consider welfaristic equity criteria (of which the utilitar-
ian and Rawlsian social welfare functions are noteworthy examples). Hence, insofar as

539
Chapter 16: Income Taxation
the social objective is entirely based on individual welfare levels, we are not assessing
the tax structure on the basis of its capacity for either redressing inequality or eliminat-
ing poverty. Neither do we consider egalitarian social objectives like equal sacriﬁce or
equality of opportunities. There is indeed an interesting literature on “fair” income tax-
ation that examines the distribution of taxes that impose the same loss of utility on
everyone, either in absolute or relative terms. Such arguments are related to the ability-
to-pay principle according to which $1 of tax is less painful for a rich person than for
a poor person (due to the decreasing marginal value of income). This equal sacriﬁce
approach predicts that the resulting tax structure must be progressive (in the sense that
everyone sacriﬁces equally if they pay an increasing percentage of their income in tax
as their income rises). It was John Stuart Mill, in his Principles of Political Economy,
who ﬁrst pointed out this principle of equal sacriﬁce. He suggested that “Equality of
taxation, therefore as a maxim of politics, means equality of sacriﬁce. It means appor-
tioning the contribution of each person towards the expenses of government so that he
shall feel neither more nor less inconvenience from his share of the payment than every
other person experiences from his” (bk. V, ch. 2, p. 804).
16.3
Taxation and Labor Supply
The effect of income taxation on labor supply can be investigated using the standard
model of consumer choice. The analysis will begin with the general question of labor
supply and then move on to a series of speciﬁc analyses concerning the effect of varia-
tions in the tax system. The major insight this gives will be to highlight the importance
of competing income and substitution effects.
As is standard, it is assumed that the consumer has a given set of preferences over
allocations of consumption and leisure. The consumer also has a ﬁxed stock of time
available that can be divided between labor supply and time spent as leisure. The utility
function representing the preferences can then be deﬁned by
U = U(x, L −ℓ) = U(x, ℓ),
(16.1)
where L is the total time endowment, ℓis labor supply, and x is consumption. Conse-
quently leisure time is L−ℓ. Labor is assumed to be unpleasant for the worker, so utility
is reduced as more labor is supplied, implying that ∂U
∂ℓ< 0. Let each hour of labor earn
the wage rate w so that income, in the absence of taxation, is wℓ. Letting the (constant)
rate of tax be t, the budget constraint facing the consumer is px = [1 −t] wℓ, where
p is the price of the consumption good.

540
Part VI: Taxation
The choice problem is shown in panel a of 1ﬁgure 16.1, which graphs consumption
against leisure. The indifference curves and budget constraint are as standard for utility
maximization. The optimal choice is at the tangency of the budget constraint and the
highest attainable indifference curve. This results in consumption x∗and leisure L−ℓ∗.
There is an alternative way to write the utility function. Let the before-tax income
be denoted by z, so that z = wℓ. Since ℓ= z
w, utility can then be written in terms of
before-tax income as
U = U

x, z
w

.
(16.2)
These preferences can be depicted on a graph of before-tax income against consump-
tion. Expressed in terms of income, the budget constraint becomes px = [1 −t] z.
This is shown in panel b of ﬁgure 16.1. The optimal choice occurs at the point of
tangency between the highest attainable indifference curve and the budget constraint,
with consumption x∗and before-tax income z∗. The important feature of this alter-
native representation is that the budget constraint is not affected as w changes, so it
is the same whatever wage the consumer earns, but the indifference curves do change,
since it is z
w that enters the utility function. How they change is described below.
This standard model can now be used to understand the effects of variations in the
wage rate or tax rate. Consider the effect of an increase in the wage rate, which is
shown in panel a of ﬁgure 16.2 by the move to the higher budget line and the new

tangency at c. The move from a to c can be broken down into a substitution effect (a
to b) and an income effect (b to c). The direction of the substitution effect can always
be signed, since it is given by a move around the indifference curve. In contrast, the
income effect cannot be signed: it may be positive or negative. Consequently the net
effect is ambiguous: an increase in the wage rate can raise or lower labor supply. This
is the basic ambiguity that runs throughout the analysis of labor supply. The effect
of a wage increase when preferences are written as in (16.2) is shown in panel b of
ﬁgure 16.2. An increase in the wage rate means that less additional labor is required
to achieve any given increase in consumption. This change in the trade-off between
labor and consumption causes the indifference curve through a point to pivot round
and become ﬂatter. This ﬂattening of the indifference curves causes the optimal choice
to move along the budget constraint. The level of before-tax income will rise, but the
effect on hours worked is ambiguous.
The effect of a tax increase is now analyzed in the same way. In panel a of ﬁgure 16.3
the tax increase rotates the budget line down so that the optimal choice moves from
a to c. The substitution effect of the tax increase is the move around the indifference
curve from a to b and the income effect the move from b to c. Using the alternative
form of preferences an increase in the tax rate rotates the budget constraint in panel
b downward so that the chosen point moves from a to c. In neither diagram does the
change in tax rate affect the indifference curves.
It is also helpful to consider more complex tax systems using this approach. A
common feature of the income tax in many countries is that there is a threshold level of

income below which income is untaxed. This is shown in ﬁgures 16.4. The threshold
level of income is z∗so at wage rate w this arises at z∗
w hours of labor supply. The
economic importance of this threshold is that it puts a kink into the budget constraint.
If a set of consumers with differing preferences are considered, some may locate at
points such as a and pay no tax, and some may locate at points like c. However, it can
be expected that a number of consumers will cluster or “bunch” at the kink point b. The
observation that consumers will bunch at a kink point is a common feature and reﬂects

the fact that an extra unit of labor will receive net pay [1 −t]w, whereas the previous
unit received w. It is therefore helpful to distinguish between interior solutions, such
as a and c, and corner solutions such as b. The consumer at an interior solution will
respond to changes in the tax rate in the manner illustrated in ﬁgure 16.2. In contrast,
a consumer at a corner solution may well be left unaffected by a marginal tax change.
The consumer’s choice will only be affected if the change is sufﬁcient to allow the
attainment of a utility level higher than at the kink.
More generally, an income tax system may have a number of thresholds with the
marginal tax rate rising at each. Such a tax system appears as in ﬁgure 16.5. Again,
with preferences varying across consumers, the expectation is that there will tend to be
collections of consumers at each kink point.
The ﬁnal issue that is worth investigating in this framework is that of participation in
the labor force. The basic assumption so far has been that the worker can continuously
vary the number of working hours in order to arrive at the most preferred outcome. In
practice, it is often the case that either hours are ﬁxed or else there is a minimum that
must be undertaken with the possibility of more. Either case leads to a discontinuity
in the budget constraint at the point of minimum hours. The choice for the consumer
is then between undertaking no work and working at least the minimum. This is the
participation decision: whether or not to join the workforce.
The participation decision and its relation to taxation is shown in ﬁgure 16.6 where
ℓm denotes the minimum working time. The effect of an increase in taxation is to lower
the budget constraint. A consumer who was previously indifferent between working

and not (both points being on the same indifference curve) now strictly prefers not to
do so. At this margin there is no conﬂict between income and substitution effects. An
increase in taxation strictly reduces participation in the work force.
16.4
Empirical Evidence
The theoretical analysis of section 16.3 has identiﬁed the three major issues in the
study of labor supply. These are the potential conﬂict between income and substitution
effects that make it impossible to provide any clear-cut results for those consumers at an
interior solution, kinks in the budget constraint that make behavior insensitive to taxes,
and a participation decision that can be very sensitive to taxation. How important each
of these factors is in determining the actual level of labor supply can only be discovered
by reference to the empirical evidence.
Empirical evidence on labor supply and the effect of income taxes can be found in
both the results of surveys and in econometric estimates of labor supply functions. In
considering what evidence is useful, it is best to recall that the labor supply will be
insensitive to taxation if working hours are determined by the ﬁrm or by a union and
ﬁrm agreement. When this is the case, only the participation decision is of real inter-
est. The effect of taxation at interior solutions can only be judged when the evidence
relates to workers who have the freedom to vary their hours of labor. This is most com-
monly the position for those in self-employment rather than employment. For those in

545
Chapter 16: Income Taxation
employment, variations in hours can sometimes be achieved by undertaking overtime,
so this dimension of choice can be considered.
These comments also draw attention to the fact that the nature of labor supply may
well be different between males and females, especially married females. It still remains
a fact that males continue to be the dominant income earner in most families. This leaves
the married female as typically a secondary income earner, and for them there is often no
necessity to work. From this position it is the participation decision that is paramount.
In contrast, most males consider work to be a necessity, so the participation decision is
an irrelevance. It can therefore be expected that the labor supply of males and females
will show different degrees of sensitivity to taxation.
Surveys on labor supply have normally arrived at the conclusion that changes in
the tax rate have little effect on the labor-supply decision. For instance, a survey of
the disincentive effect of high tax rates on solicitors and accountants in the United
Kingdom, 63 percent of whom were subject to marginal tax rates above 50 percent,
concluded that as many of the respondents were working harder because of the tax
rates as were working less hard. Groups such as these are ideal candidates for study
for the reasons outlined above: they can be expected to have ﬂexibility in the choice of
working hours and should be well informed about the tax system. A similar conclusion
was also found in a survey of the effect of income taxation on the level of overtime
worked by a sample of weekly paid workers: little net effect of taxation on working
hours was found.
These results suggest the conclusion that labor supply does not vary signiﬁcantly with
the tax rate. If this were correct, the labor supply function would be approximately ver-
tical. In terms of the theoretical analysis the survey results point to an income effect
that almost entirely offsets the substitution effect. However, the discussion has al-
ready suggested that different groups in the population may have different reactions to
changes in the tax system. This issue is now investigated by considering evidence from
econometric analysis.
Table 16.1 presents some summary econometric estimates of labor-supply elas-
ticities. These are divided into those for married men, married women, and single
mothers. Each gives the overall elasticity and its breakdown into substitution and
income effects. Estimates for both the United Kingdom and the United States are
given.
Since the results in table 16.1 relate to the effect of a wage increase, theory would
predict that the substitution effect should be positive. This is what is found in all cases.
The income effect, which theoretically can be positive or negative, is found to be always
negative. Consequently the negativity offsets the substitution effect, sometimes more

546
Part VI: Taxation
than completely. While there are a range of estimates for each category, some general
observations can be made. The estimated elasticity for married men is the lowest
and is the only one that is ever estimated to be negative. This implies that the labor-
supply curve for married men is close to vertical and may even slope backward. One
explanation for this result could be that the working hours of this group are constrained
by collective agreements that leave little ﬂexibility for variation.
The labor-supply elasticity of single mothers is, on average, the largest of the three
sets. This result is probably a consequence of the participation effect. For single moth-
ers part-time work is an unattractive option, since this usually implies the loss of
state beneﬁts. Consequently labor supply becomes an all or nothing decision. Married
women represent the intermediate case. For them part-time work is quite common,
and this often opens the way to some degree of ﬂexibility in hours of work. As ex-
pected, these factors lead to a labor-supply elasticity greater than that of married men
but lower than that of single mothers.
Although the estimates vary widely within the groups, indicating some imprecision
in the estimates, some general conclusions can still be drawn. First, the elasticity of
labor supply is not uniform across the population of workers. It clearly varies among
the three groups identiﬁed in this discussion and probably varies within these groups.
Despite this variation, it is still apparent that the uncompensated labor-supply elasticity
for married men is small with estimates grouped around zero. In contrast, the elasticity
of women is higher and reﬂects the participation effect and the greater ﬂexibility they
have in the choice of hours.

16.5
Optimal Income Taxation
The analysis to this point has considered the positive question of how income taxation
affects labor supply. Having understood this, it is now possible to turn to the normative
question of how the income tax structure should be determined. This is by nature a
complex issue. As has already been noted, in practice, income tax systems generally
have a number of thresholds at which the marginal tax rate rises. An investigation
of the optimal system must at least be ﬂexible enough to consider such tax systems
without limiting the number of thresholds or the rates of tax at each. In fact it must do
more much than this. The model of income taxation introduced by Mirrlees (1971) has
several important attributes. First, there is an unequal distribution of income, so there
are equity motivations for taxation. Second, the income tax affects the labor supply
decisions of the consumers so that it has efﬁciency consequences. Third, in view of
the comments above, the structure is sufﬁciently ﬂexible that no prior restrictions are
placed on the optimal tax functions that may arise.
In the model all consumers have identical preferences but differ in their level of
skill in employment. The hourly wage received by each consumer is determined by
their level of skill. This combines with the labor-supply decision to determine income.
The economy is competitive, so the wage rate is also equal to the marginal product
of labor and ﬁrms price their output at marginal cost. A tax levied on skill would be
the ﬁrst-best policy as it would be a lump-sum tax on the unalterable characteristic
that differentiates consumers. But this ﬁrst-best is not feasible, since the level of skill
is assumed to be private information and so unobservable by the government. As the
discussion of chapter 13 showed, this makes it impossible to tax skill directly. Since
the government cannot observe a consumer’s skill level (which is essentially the initial
endowment of the consumer), it employs an income tax as a second-best policy. The
income tax function is chosen to maximize social welfare subject to it raising enough
revenue to meets the government’s requirements.
There are two commodities: a consumption good and labor. A consumer’s labor
supply is denoted by ℓand consumption by x. Each consumer is characterized by a
skill level s. The value of s measures the hourly output of the consumer, and since the
economy is competitive, it is equal to the wage rate. If a consumer of ability s supplies
ℓhours of labor, that consumer earns income of sℓbefore tax. Denote the income of
the consumer with skill s by z (s) = sℓ(s). The amount of tax paid on an income z is
given by T (z). This is the tax function that the analysis aims to determine. Equivalently,

548
Part VI: Taxation
denote the consumption function by c(z) so that a consumer who earns income z can
consume
x = c (z) = z −T (z) .
(16.3)
The relationship among income, the tax function, and consumption is depicted in
ﬁgure 16.7. In the absence of taxation, income would be equal to consumption and this
is depicted by the 45 degree line. Where the consumption function lies above the 45
degree line, the tax payment is negative. It is positive when the consumption function
is below the line. For example, the consumer earning ˆz in the ﬁgure pays an amount of
tax T

ˆz

and can consume ˆx. The gradient of the consumption function is equal to one
minus the marginal rate of tax.
All consumers have the same utility function (so that the possibility of workers
displaying different aversion to work is ruled out):
U = U

.
(16.4)
The indifference curves are dependent on the skill level of the consumer, since a high-
skill consumer takes less labor time to achieve a given level of income than a low-skill
consumer. This is reﬂected in the fact that at any income and consumption pair

ˆx, ˆz

the indifference curve of a high-skill consumer passing through that point is ﬂatter than
the indifference curve of a low-skill consumer. This single-crossing property is termed
agent monotonicity and is illustrated in ﬁgure 16.8.

Part VI: Taxation
An immediate consequence of agent monotonicity is that high-skill consumers will
never earn less income than low-skill. Generally, they will earn strictly more. This result
is shown in ﬁgure 16.9. It arises because at the point where the indifference curve of the
low-skill consumer is tangential to the consumption function (and so determines the
optimal choice for that consumer), the indifference curve of the high-skill consumer
is ﬂatter and so cannot be at a tangency. Recall that all consumers face the same tax
function and thus the same consumption function no matter what their skills are. The
optimal choice for the high-skill consumer therefore has to be to the right of a, which
implies a higher level of income.
The ﬁrst property of the optimal tax function relates to the maximum tax rate that
will be charged. If the consumption function slopes downward, as shown in ﬁgure
16.10, then the shape of the indifference curves ensures that no consumer will choose
to locate on the downward-sloping section. This part of the consumption function is
therefore redundant and can be replaced by the ﬂat-dashed section without altering
any of the consumers’ choices. Economically, along the downward-sloping section,
increased work effort is met with lower consumption. Hence there is no incentive to
work harder, and such points will not be chosen. Since c (z) = z−T (z), it follows that
c′ (z) = 1 −T ′ (z). The argument has shown that c′ (z) ≥0, which implies T ′ (z) ≤1,
so the marginal tax rate is less than 100 percent.
It is also possible to put a lower limit on the marginal tax rate. If the gradient of
the consumption function is greater than one, meaning c′ (z) > 1, then T ′ (z) < 0. A

Chapter 16: Income Taxation
negative tax rate represents a marginal subsidy to the tax payer from the tax system.
That is, the after-tax wage for additional work will be greater than the before-tax wage.
To demonstrate the logic behind this claim most clearly it is assumed that the social
welfare function is utilitarian and that there are only two types of consumers (low-
skill and high-skill), and equal numbers of the two types. Begin with the tax function
denoted c1 (z) in ﬁgure 16.11, which has gradient greater than one. Along this are
located a high-skill consumer at h1 and a low-skill consumer at l1.
The effect of moving to the new tax function c2 (z) where the gradient is equal to
one is now analyzed in two stages. In the ﬁrst stage the income levels of the consumers
are kept ﬁxed, but the consumption levels change to ˜xl and ˜xh. This is shown in ﬁgure
16.12. The position of c2 (z) is chosen so that the increase in consumption for the
low-skill is exactly matched by the decrease in consumption of the high-skill. Because
aggregate income and aggregate consumption have not changed, the budget position
of the government is unaffected. The change in consumption levels must raise welfare
because the marginal utility of consumption for the low-skill is higher than that for the
high-skill.
The second stage of the process is to allow the consumers to respond to the tax
function c2 (z) and relocate to utility-maximizing positions. The high-skill consumer
will choose {z2
h, x2
h} and the low-skill will choose {z1
h, x1

Allowing relocation

553
Chapter 16: Income Taxation
Being voluntary, the relocation must raise the utilities of both types of consumer. Fur-
thermore the relocations do not affect the budget position of the government, since they
are moves along a consumption function with a zero marginal rate of tax.
The fact that social welfare increases in stage 1 and then increases further in stage 2
ensures that consumption function c2(z) leads to a higher level of social welfare than
consumption function c1(z). The process has also ensured that government revenue is
unchanged. Consumption function c1(z) with a negative marginal rate of tax cannot
therefore be optimal. From this it follows that the marginal tax rate must be nonnegative
so that T ′(z) ≥0. It should be noted that this result does not restrict the average rate
of tax, T (z)
z , to be nonnegative. The average rate of tax is negative whenever the con-
sumption function is above the 45 degree line, and if the system is redistributive, this
will be the case at low incomes.
The ﬁnal result determines the marginal tax rate faced by the highest skill consumer.
Let the consumption function ABC in ﬁgure 16.14 be a candidate for optimality. It
is now shown that ABC cannot be optimal unless its gradient is one (so the marginal
rate of tax is zero) at point B where the highest skill consumer locates. To prove this
result, assume that the gradient is less than one (so the marginal tax rate is positive) at
point B. A better consumption function than ABC will now be constructed. To do this,
deﬁne ABD by following the old consumption function up to point B, and then let the
new section BD have gradient of one. The highest ability consumer will now relocate
to point b. Consequently the highest ability consumer is better off, but their actual tax
payment (the vertical distance from the consumption point to the 45 degree line) is

unchanged. So replacing ABC with ABD leaves aggregate tax revenue unchanged,
makes one person better off, and makes no one worse off. This must be an improvement
for society, so no consumption function, like ABC, that has the highest ability person
facing a positive marginal rate of tax can be optimal. In other words, the optimal tax
function must have a zero marginal rate of tax for the highest skill consumer.
This result is important for assessing the optimality of actual tax schedules. Those
observed, in practice, invariably have a marginal rate of tax that rises with income. This
leaves the highest income consumers facing the highest marginal tax rate rather than
a zero rate. Accordingly such tax systems cannot be optimal. The result also carries
implications for discussions about how progressive the income tax system should be.
A tax system displays marginal rate progressivity if the marginal rate of tax increases
with income. Since it has been shown that the marginal rate of tax should be zero at
the top of the income distribution, the optimal tax system cannot be a fully (marginal
rate) progressive one.
There has been considerable debate about this result due partly to its contrast with
what is observed in practice. There are several points that can be made in this respect.
The result is valid only for the highest skill consumer, and it makes no prediction about
the tax rate that will be faced by consumer with the second-highest skill. Therefore it
does not demonstrate that those close to the top of the skill range should face a tax
rate of zero or even close to zero. For them the tax rate may have to be signiﬁcantly
different from zero. If this is the case, observed tax systems may only be “wrong” at
the very top, which will not result in too great a divergence from optimality. The result
also relies on the fact that the highest skill person can be identiﬁed and the tax system
adjusted around her needs. Putting this into practice is clearly an impossible task. In
summary, the result is important in that it questions preconceptions about the structure
of taxes, but it has limited immediate policy relevance.
The results described in this section capture the general properties of an optimal
income tax system that can be derived within this framework. They have shown that
the marginal tax rate should be between zero and one and that the highest skill consumer
should face a zero marginal rate. Moreover they have established that the tax system
should not involve marginal rate progressivity everywhere. It is possible to derive
further results only by adding further speciﬁcation. The next section looks at two special
cases that give alternative routes for proceeding in this direction. However, even these
do not provide entirely transparent insights into the level of optimal tax rates. This can
only be done through the use of numerical results, and these are the subject matter of
section 16.7.

555
Chapter 16: Income Taxation
16.6
Two Specializations
To provide some more insight into the optimal income tax, two specializations of the
model are worth considering. These are noteworthy for the very clear view they give
into the trade-offs involved in setting the tax rate.
16.6.1
Quasi-Linearity
The ﬁrst specialization is to consider a special form of the utility function. It is assumed
in this section that utility is quasi-linear with respect to labor income,
U

x, z
s

= u(x) −z
s ,
(16.5)
so that the marginal disutility of labor ℓ= z
s is constant. The utility of consumption,
u (x), is increasing and concave (so u′ > 0 and u′′ < 0). For this utility function the
marginal rate of substitution between consumption and income is MRSx,z =
1
su′(x).
Since the marginal rate of substitution is decreasing in s, the gradient of the indifference
curve through any value of x falls as s rises. This makes the utility function consistent
with agent monotonicity.
We simplify further by assuming that there are just two consumers, one with a high
level of skill, sh, and the other with a low level, sl. It is assumed that sl < sh < 3sl (the
reason for this is explained later). With only two consumers the problem of choosing
the optimal tax (or consumption) function can be given the following formulation:
whatever consumption function is selected by the government, the fact that there are
only two consumers ensures that at most two locations on it will ever be chosen. For
example, in ﬁgure 16.15, al is the allocation chosen by the low-skill consumer and ah
the chosen allocation of the high-skill. Having observed this, it is apparent that selecting
the consumption function is equivalent to specifying the two allocations. The rest of the
consumption function can then be chosen to ensure that no point on it is better for the
consumers than the two chosen allocations. Essentially the consumption function just
needs to link the two points, while elsewhere remaining below the indifference curves
through the points. Following this reasoning reduces the choice of tax function to a
simple maximization problem involving the two locations.
A consumer will only choose the allocation intended for him if he prefers his own
location to that of the other consumer. In other words, the allocations must be incentive
compatible. Since the high-skill consumer can mimic the low-skill, but not vice versa,

Apair of allocations that satisfy the incentive compatibility constraint (16.6) are shown
in ﬁgure 16.16. The high-skill consumer is indifferent between the two allocations
(al and ah are on the same indifference curve for the high-skill) while the low-skill
consumer strictly prefers allocation al.

subject to the incentive compatibility constraint (16.6) and the resource constraint

(16.8)
The resource constraint makes the simplifying assumption that no revenue is to be raised
so that the tax system is purely redistributive. What is now shown is that the quasi-
linearity of utility allows this maximization problem to be considerably simpliﬁed. The
simpliﬁcation then permits an explicit solution to be given.

Given that (16.6) is an equality, it can be solved to write
zh = sh[u(xh) −u(xl)] + zl.
(16.9)
Combining this equation with the resource constraint and eliminating zh by using (16.9),
the income of the low-skill consumer can be written
zl = 1
2 [xl + xh −sh[u(xh) −u(xl)]] .
(16.10)
Using the resource constraint again gives the income of the high-skill consumer as
zh = 1
2 [xl + xh + sh[u(xh) −u(xl)]] .
(16.11)
These solutions for the income levels can then be substituted into the objective function

than zero so that the low-skill consumer has a positive social weight. Without this
assumption the analysis becomes more complex.)
Comparing (16.7) and (16.12) allows a new interpretation of the optimal tax prob-
lem. The construction undertaken has turned the maximization of the utilitarian social

558
Part VI: Taxation
welfare function subject to constraint into the maximization of a weighted welfare
function without constraint. The incentive compatibility and resource constraints have
been incorporated by placing a greater weight on the welfare of the high-skill consumer
(since βh > βl), which in turn ensures that their consumption level must be higher at
the optimum. From (16.10) and (16.11) this feeds back into a higher level of income
for the high-skill consumer. It can also be seen that as the skill difference between the
two consumers increases, so does the relative weight given to the high-skill.
Carrying out the optimization in (16.12), the consumption levels of the consumers
satisfy the ﬁrst-order conditions
βiu′(xi) −sl + sh
2slsh
= 0,
i = l, h,
(16.13)
so the consumption levels are proportional to the welfare weights. For the high-skill
consumer, substituting in the value of βh gives
u′(xh) = 1
sh
.
(16.14)
Consequently the marginal utility of the high-skill consumer is inversely proportional to
their skill level. With u′′ < 0 (decreasing marginal utility) this implies that consumption
is proportional to skill. Combining this result with the fact that MRSh
x,z =
1
su′(x), it
follows that at the optimum allocation MRSh
x,z = 1. The ﬁnding that the marginal rate
of substitution is unity shows that the high-skill consumer faces a zero marginal tax
rate. This is the no-distortion-at-the-top result we have already seen. For the low-skill
consumer
u′(xl) =
sl + sh
sh [3sl −sh],
(16.15)
and MRSl
x,z = sh[3sl−sh]
sl[sl+sh] < 1. These show that consumer l faces a positive marginal
rate of tax.
The use of quasi-linear utility allows the construction of an explicit solution to the
optimal income tax problem, which shows how the general ﬁndings of the previous
section translate into this special case. It is interesting to note the simple dependence
of consumption levels on the relative skills and the manner in which the constraints
become translated into a higher effective welfare weight for the high-skill consumer.
This shows that this consumer needs to be encouraged to supply more labor through
the reward of additional consumption.

Chapter 16: Income Taxation
16.6.2
Rawlsian Taxation
The second specialization restricts the form of the social welfare function. In chapter
13 we introduced the Rawlsian social welfare function, which represents a society that
is concerned only with the utility of the worst-off individual. The worst-off person is
typically at the bottom of the income distribution and his welfare depends on the extent
of redistribution. We now assume that tax revenue is entirely redistributed in the form
of lump-sum grants. Consequently, for a Rawlsian government, the optimal income tax
is simply that which maximizes the lump-sum grant or, equally, that which maximizes
the revenue extracted from taxpayers.
Given a tax schedule T (z), a consumer of skill level s makes the choice of income, z
(which is equivalent to choosing labor supply ℓ= z
s ) and consumption x to maximize
his utility subject to satisfying the budget constraint x = z −T (z). Let z = z(s)
denote the optimal income choice of type s (conditional on the tax function T ). It has
been seen that agent monotonicity implies that high-skill consumers never earn less
income than the low-skill. So z(s) is increasing in s and can be inverted to give the
increasing inverse function s = z−1(z) that represents the skill level s associated to
each income choice. Different tax schemes will induce different relationships between
skill and income from the same underlying distribution of skills.
Assume that skill levels are continuously distributed in the population according to
a cumulative distribution function F(s) (indicating the proportion of the population
below any skill level s) with associated density function f (s) > 0 (representing the
probabilityassociatedwithasmallintervalofthecontinuousskill). ThetaxschemeT (z)
induces the income distribution G(z) = F(z−1(z)) with density g(z) = f (z−1(z)).
Now we are in a position to derive the optimal income tax associated with a Rawl-
sian social welfare function following a simple method originally proposed by Piketty
(1997). The Rawlsian optimal tax structure maximizes tax revenue, so no alternative tax
structure must exist that can raise more revenue from the taxpayers given their optimal
labor supply response to that new tax structure. From the ﬁrst-order condition of the
revenue maximization problem, a small deviation from the optimal tax scheme must
have no effect on total tax revenue (and larger deviations must lower tax revenue). It
follows that a small change of the tax rate at any given income level z must not change
total revenue. Using this simple argument, we can derive the optimal tax structure.
Take income level z, and consider a small increase in the marginal tax rate at that
point of amount T ′. This change has two effects on tax revenue. First, holding labor
supply constant, it will increase the tax payment by amount zT ′ for all those taxpayers
with an income above or equal to the level, z, at which the higher marginal tax rate

560
Part VI: Taxation
applies. These taxpayers represent a proportion 1 −G(z) of the population. Therefore
the revenue gain from this marginal tax change is
[1 −G(z)] zT ′.
(16.16)
Obviously the labor supply is not ﬁxed, and it is expected to vary in response to a
change in the tax rate. Let εs denote the elasticity of labor supply with respect to the
net price of labor (the percentage change in labor supply in response to a 1 percent
reduction in the net price of labor). With perfect competition on the labor market, the
price of labor decreases by the amount of the tax rate (i.e., there is no shifting of the
tax burden to employers in the form of a higher gross wage). Now the marginal tax
rate increase T ′ at income level z induces a proportional reduction T ′
1−T ′ in the price
of labor. Those facing this marginal tax rate change will reduce their labor supply by
εs T ′
1−T ′ , inducing a reduction of their taxable income equal to zεs T ′
1−T ′ . They represent
a proportion g(z) of the population (since those with an income level above the level
at which higher marginal tax rate applies continue to face the same marginal tax rate).
Therefore the revenue loss associated with the incentive effect of the tax change is
[g(z)] T ′zεs
T ′
1 −T ′ .
(16.17)
The revenue-maximizing tax scheme (Rawlsian tax) is found by equating the revenue
loss to the revenue gain from a marginal tax change for every income level. This yields
[1 −G(z)] zT ′ = [g(z)] T ′zεs
T ′
1 −T ′ ,
(16.18)
and the Rawlsian tax structure is easily seen to be such that for all income level z,
T ′(z)
1 −T ′(z) = 1 −G(z)
εsg(z) .
(16.19)
This expression has the following interpretation. High marginal tax rates over some
middle-income interval [z, z + dz] mean that for those middle-income individuals, but
also for the upper-income individuals, the government is collecting more taxes. Alto-
gether, they represent a proportion 1 −G(z) that is decreasing with z and converging
to zero for the highest income level (hence the zero marginal tax rate at the top). The
cost of the high marginal tax rate over this interval is a greater distortion for those with
income in the range [z, z + dz]. The total distortion (and revenue loss) will be low,
however, if there are relatively few taxpayers in this interval (lowg(z)), or if those in
it have a relatively low labor supply elasticity (εs).

561
Chapter 16: Income Taxation
Interestingly, even though the redistributive motive is maximal under the Rawlsian
social welfare function, the optimal tax structure does not require marginal rate pro-
gressivity. Indeed we do not really know how the labor supply elasticity changes with
income. Suppose that it is constant. Next take the Pareto distribution of income, which
is supposed to be a good ﬁt to the empirical distribution of income. For the Pareto
distribution, the hazard rate
g(z)
1−G(z) is increasing almost everywhere. Therefore, from
the optimal tax structure given above, it follows that the marginal tax rate must de-
crease everywhere. Maximal redistribution is better achieved when the tax schedule is
regressive (concave) instead of progressive (convex).
16.7
Numerical Results
The standard analysis of optimal income taxation was introduced above, and a number
of results were derived that provide some characterization of the shape of the tax sched-
ule. The marginal rate was seen to be between zero and one, but as yet no idea was
developed, except for the upper end point, of how close it should be to either. Similarly,
although equity considerations are expected to raise the marginal rate, this was not
demonstrated formally nor was consideration given to how efﬁciency criteria, particu-
larly the effect of taxation on labor supply, affects the choice of tax schedule. Because of
the analytical complexity of the model, these questions are best addressed via numerical
analysis.
The numerical results (from Mirrlees 1971) are based on a social welfare function
that takes the form
W =
& S
0 −1
εe−εUf (s) ds,
ε > 0,
& S
0 Uf (s) ds,
ε = 0,
(16.20)
where S is the maximum level of skill in the population and 0 the lowest, and f (s) is
the density function for the skill distribution. The form of this social welfare function
permits variations in the degree of concern for equity by changes in ε. Higher values
of ε represent greater concern for equity, with ε = 0 representing the utilitarian case.
(This is an alternative speciﬁcation to that of equation 14.24). The individual utility
function is the Cobb–Douglas form
U = log(x) + log(1 −ℓ),
(16.21)
The skill distribution is lognormal with a standard deviation of 0.39. This value of the
standard deviation corresponds approximately to a typical value for the income

562
Part VI: Taxation
distribution. If the skill distribution matches the income distribution, then this is a
value of particular interest.
A selection of the numerical results obtained from this model are given in tables
16.2 and 16.3. In table 16.2, ε = 0, so this is the case of a utilitarian social welfare
function. Table 16.3 introduces equity considerations by using ε = 1. In both cases the
government revenue requirement is set at 10 percent of national income.
The ﬁrst fact to be noticed from these results is that the average rate of tax for low-
skill consumers is negative. These consumers are receiving an income supplement from
the government. This is in the nature of a negative income tax where incomes below a
chosen cutoff are supplemented by the government through the tax system. The average
rate of tax then increases with skill. The maximum average rate of tax is actually quite
small. The value of 34 percent in table 16.3 is not far out of line with the actual rate in
many countries.

It ﬁrst rises and then falls. The maximum rate is reached around the median of the skill
distribution. Except at the extremes of the skill distribution, there is not much variation
in the marginal tax rate. To a ﬁrst approximation, the optimal tax systems reported in
these tables have a basically constant marginal rate of tax so that the consumption
function is close to being a straight line. This is one of the most surprising conclusions
of the analysis of income taxation: the model allows nonconstancy in the marginal tax
rate, but this does not feature to a great degree in the optimal solution. Finally the zero
tax rate for the highest skill consumer is reﬂected in the fall of the marginal rate at high
skills, but this is not really signiﬁcant until close to the top of the skill distribution.
These results provide an interesting picture of the optimal income tax function. They
suggest that the tax function should subsidize low-skill consumers through a negative
income tax but should still face them with a high marginal rate of tax. The maximum
marginal rate of tax should not be at the top of the skill distribution but should occur
much lower. Generally, the marginal rate should be fairly constant.
16.8
Voting over a Flat Tax
Having identiﬁed the properties of the optimal tax structure, we now consider the tax
system that emerges from the political process. To do this, we consider people voting
over tax schedules that have some degree of redistribution. Because it is difﬁcult to
model voting on nonlinear tax schemes given the high dimensionality of the problem,
we will restrict attention to a linear tax structure as originally proposed by Romer
(1975). We specify the model further with quasi-linear preferences to avoid unnecessary
complications and to simplify the analysis of the voting equilibrium.
Assume, as before, that individuals differ only in their level of skill. We assume that
skills are distributed in the population according to a cumulative distribution function
F(s) that is known to everyone, with mean skill s and median sm. Individuals work
and consume. They also vote on a linear tax scheme that pays a lump-sum beneﬁt b to
each individual ﬁnanced by a proportional income tax at rate t. The individual utility
function has the quasi-linear form
u

(16.22)
and the individual budget constraint is
x = (1 −t)z + b.
(16.23)

564
Part VI: Taxation
It is easy to verify that in this simple model the optimal income choice of a consumer
with skill level s is
z(s) = [1 −t] s2.
(16.24)
The quasi-linear preferences imply that there is no income effect on the labor supply
(i.e., z(s)isindependentofthelump-sumbeneﬁtb). Thissimpliﬁestheexpressionofthe
tax distortion and makes the analysis of the voting equilibrium easier. Less surprisingly,
a higher tax rate induces taxpayers to work less and earn less income.
The lump-sum transfer b is constrained by the government budget balance condition
b = tE(z(s)) = t [1 −t] E(s2),
(16.25)
where E(·) is the mathematical expectation, and we used the optimal income choice
to derive the second equality. This constraint says that the lump-sum beneﬁt paid to
each individual must be equal to the expected tax payment tE(z(s)). This expression is
termed the Dupuit–Laffer curve and describes tax revenue as a function of the tax rate.
In this simple model the Dupuit–Laffer curve is bell-shaped with a peak at t = 1
2 and no
tax collected at the ends t = 0 and t = 1. We can now derive individual preferences over
tax schedules by substituting (16.23) and (16.24) into (16.22). After re-arrangement,
(indirect) utility can be written as
v(t, b, s) = b + 1
2 [1 −t]2 s2.
(16.26)
Taking the total differential of (16.26) gives
dv = db −[1 −t] s2dt,
(16.27)
so that along an indifference curve where dv = 0,
db
dt = [1 −t] s2.
(16.28)
It can be seen from this that for given t, the indifference curve becomes steeper in
(t, b) space as s increases. This monotonicity is a consequence of the single-crossing
property of the indifference curves. As we saw in chapter 11, the single-crossing prop-
erty is a sufﬁcient condition for the Median Voter Theorem to apply. It follows that there
is only one tax policy that can result from majority voting: it is the policy preferred
by the median voter (half of the voters are poorer than the median and prefer higher
tax rates, and the other half are richer and prefer lower tax rates). Letting tm be the

565
Chapter 16: Income Taxation
tax rate preferred by the median voter, we have tm implicitly deﬁned by the solution
to the ﬁrst-order condition for maximizing the median voter’s utility. We differentiate
(16.26) with respect to t, taking into account the government budget constraint (16.25)
to obtain
∂v
∂t = [1 −2t] E(s2) −[1 −t] s2.
(16.29)
Setting this expression equal to zero for the median skill level sm yields the tax rate
preferred by the median voter
tm = E(s2) −s2
m
2E(s2) −s2m
,
(16.30)
or, using the optimal income choice (16.24),
tm = E(z) −zm
2E(z) −zm
.
(16.31)
This simple model predicts that the political equilibrium tax rate is determined by
the position of the median voter in the income distribution. The greater the income
inequality, as measured by the distance between median and mean income, the higher is
the tax rate. If the median voter is relatively badly off, with income well below the mean
income, then equilibrium redistribution is large. In practice, the income distribution
has a median income below the mean income, so a majority of voters would favor
redistribution through proportional income taxation. More general utility functions
would also predict that the extent of this redistribution decreases with the elasticity of
labor supply.
16.9
Conclusions
This chapter introduced the issues surrounding the design of the income tax structure.
It was ﬁrst shown how income and substitution effects left the theoretical impact of a
tax increase on labor supply indeterminate. If the income effect is sufﬁciently strong,
it is possible for a tax increase to lead to more labor being supplied. The participation
decision was also discussed, and it was argued that taxation could be signiﬁcant in
affecting this choice.
The lack of theoretical predictions places great emphasis on empirical research for
determining the actual effects of taxation. The labor-supply responses of different

566
Part VI: Taxation
groups in the population to tax changes were discussed. The observations made were
borne out by the empirical results that showed a very small or negative elasticity of
supply for married men but a much large positive elasticity for single mothers. The
latter can be interpreted as a reﬂection of the participation decision.
A model that was able to incorporate the important issues of efﬁciency and equity in
income taxation was then introduced. Anumber of results were derived that capture the
general features of an optimal tax system. Notably, the marginal rate of tax facing the
highest skill person should be zero and the optimal tax rate is bounded between zero
and one. This model was specialized to quasi-linear utility and to a Rawlsian social
welfare function, and some further insights were obtained. The numerical simulation
results showed the marginal rate of tax to remain fairly constant while the average
rate of tax was negative for low-skill consumers. Finally the political economy of
taxation was presented by means of a simple model of voting over linear income tax
schedules.

Under the negative income tax all individuals are guaranteed a minimum standard of living
by being awarded a grant, and the grant is reduced as their earnings rise (though by less than
one for one). Alternatively, under wage subsidies, for each dollar of earnings up to some

level, the government pays each person a refundable tax credit for each dollar earned up to
that level. This tax credit is then phased out after reaching a maximum, so the credit goes to
zero for middle-income taxpayers.

b. Assume that the poverty line is ﬁxed at $20,000. Design a negative income tax to combat
poverty by choosing a basic grant level and an implicit tax rate at which this grant is reduced

are the efﬁciency and equity effects of choosing different grant levels and tax rates? How
will the program affect people with different incomes?
c. Now consider the possibility of using categorical welfare grants. Under categorical welfare
grants all individuals possessing certain characteristics are guaranteed a minimum standard

consumption and l is leisure. The mother can work up to 100 hours per month. Any of the
100 hours that are not worked are leisure hours. She earns a wage of $10 per hour and pays
no taxes. The consumption price is normalized to $1. To be able to work, she has to incur a
child care cost of $5 for every hour worked.
a. Suppose that there are no tax and welfare beneﬁts. How many hours will she work and what
will be her consumption level? Draw the graph depicting her budget set, with consumption
on the vertical axis and leisure on the horizontal axis.
b. Suppose that the government introduces a negative income tax (NIT) that guarantees an
income of $200 per month. The beneﬁt is taken away one for one as earnings increase. Draw
the new budget set. Compute the new number of hours worked and consumption level. Has
consumption increased and is the mother better off? Why or why not?
c. Now suppose the income guarantee is reduced by one-half to the amount of $100 per
month. What is the new number of hours worked and the consumption level? Compare with
your result in part b.
d. Consider again the income guarantee in part b of $200 per month, and suppose that the
government complements this beneﬁt by offering free child care. Draw the new budget set,

balance requires

Tax Evasion
17.1
Introduction
It is not unusual to be offered a discount for payment in cash. This is almost routine in
the employment of the services of builders, plumbers, and decorators. It is less frequent,
but still occurs, when major purchases are made in shops. While the expense of banking
checks and the commissions charged by credit card companies may explain some of
these discounts, the usual explanation is that payment in cash makes concealment of
the transaction much easier. Income that can be concealed need not be declared to the
tax authorities.
The same motivation can be provided for exaggeration in claims for expenses. By
converting income into expenses that are either exempt from tax or deductible from
tax, the total tax bill can be reduced. Second jobs are also a lucrative source of income
that can be concealed from the tax authorities. A tax return that reports no income, or at
least a very low level, is likely to attract more attention than one that declares earnings
from primary employment but fails to mention income from secondary employment.
In contrast to these observations on tax evasion, the analysis of taxation in the
previous chapters assumed that ﬁrms and consumers reported their taxable activities
honestly. Although acceptable for providing simpliﬁed insights into the underlying
issues, this assumption is patently unacceptable when confronted with reality. The
purpose of this chapter can be seen as the introduction of practical constraints on the
free choice of tax policy. Tax evasion, the intentional failure to declare taxable economic
activity, is pervasive in many economies as the evidence given in the following section
makes clear and is therefore a subject of practical as well as theoretical interest.
The chapter begins by considering how tax evasion can be measured. Evidence on the
extent of tax evasion in a range of countries is reviewed. The chapter then proceeds to try
to understand the factors involved in the decision to evade tax. Initially this decision is
represented as a choice under uncertainty. The analysis predicts the relationship among
the level of evasion, tax rates, and punishments. Within this framework the optimal
degree of auditing and of punishment is considered. Evidence that can be used to assess
the model’s predictions is then discussed. In the light of this, some extensions of the
basic model are considered. A game-theoretic approach to tax compliance is presented
where taxpayers and governments interact strategically. The last section emphasizes
the importance of social interaction on compliance decisions.

Part VI: Taxation
17.2
The Extent of Evasion
Tax evasion is illegal, so those engaging in it have every reason to seek to conceal what
they are doing. This introduces a fundamental difﬁculty into the measurement of tax
evasion. Even so, the fact that the available estimates show that evasion constitutes a
signiﬁcant part of total economic activity underlines the importance of measurement.
The lost revenue due to tax evasion also conﬁrms the value of developing a theory of
evasion that can be used to design a tax structure that minimizes evasion and ensures
that policy is optimal given that evasion occurs. Before proceeding, it is worth making
some distinctions. First, tax evasion is the failure to declare taxable activity. Tax evasion
should be distinguished from tax avoidance, which is the reorganization of economic
activity, possibly at some cost, to lower tax payment. Tax avoidance is legal, whereas
tax evasion is not. In practice, the distinction is not as clear-cut, since tax avoidance
schemes frequently need to be tested in court to clarify their legality. Second, the terms
black, shadow, or hidden economy refer to all economic activities for which payments
are made but are not ofﬁcially declared. Under these headings would be included
illegal activities, such as the drug trade, and unmeasured activity, such as agricultural
output by smallholders. Added to these would also be the legal, but undeclared, income
that constitutes tax evasion. Finally the unmeasured economy would be the shadow
economy plus activities such as do-it-yourself jobs that are economically valuable but
do not involve economic transaction.
This discussion reveals that there are several issues concerning how economic ac-
tivity should be divided between the regular economy and the shadow economy. For
instance, most systems of national accounts do not include criminal activity (Italy,
however, does make some adjustment for smuggling). In principle, the UN System of
National Accounts includes both legal and illegal activities, and it has been suggested
that criminal activity should be made explicit when the system is revised. Although this
chapter is primarily about tax evasion, an attempt at the measurement of tax evasion
may include some or all of the components of the shadow economy.
The essential problem involved in the measurement of tax evasion is that its illegality
provides an incentive for individuals to keep the activity hidden. Furthermore, by its
very nature, tax evasion does not appear in any ofﬁcial statistics. This implies that the
extent of tax evasion cannot be measured directly but must be inferred from economic
variables that can be observed.
A ﬁrst method for measuring tax evasion is to use survey evidence. This can be
employed either directly or indirectly as an input into an estimation procedure. The

575
Chapter 17: Tax Evasion
obvious difﬁculty with survey evidence is that respondents who are active in the hidden
economy have every incentive to conceal the truth. There are two ways in which the
problem of concealment can be circumvented. First, information collected for purposes
other than the measurement of tax evasion can be employed. One example of this is
the use that has been made of data from the Family Expenditure Survey in the United
Kingdom. This survey involves consumers recording their incomes and expenditures in
a diary. Participants have no reason to falsely record information. The relation between
income and expenditure can be derived from the respondents whose entire income is
obtained in employment that cannot escape tax. The expenditures recorded can then be
used to infer the income of those who do have an opportunity to evade. Although these
records are not surveys in the normal sense, studies of taxpayer compliance conducted
by revenue collection agencies, such as the Internal Revenue Service in the United
States, can be treated as survey evidence and have some claim to accuracy.
Thesecondgeneralmethodistoinfertheextentoftaxevasion, orthehiddeneconomy
generally, from the observation of other economic variables. This is done by determin-
ing total economic activity and then subtracting measured activity, which gives the
hidden economy. The direct input approach observes the use of an input to production
and from this predicts what output must be. An input that is often used for this pur-
pose is electricity, since this is universally employed and accurate statistics are kept
on energy consumption. The monetary approach employs the demand for cash to infer
the size of the hidden economy on the basis that transactions in the hidden economy
are ﬁnanced by cash rather than checks or credit cards. Given a relationship between
the quantity of cash and the level of economic activity, this allows estimation of the
hidden economy. What distinguishes alternative studies that fall under the heading of
monetary approaches is the method used to derive the total level of economic activity
from the observed use of cash. One way to do this is to assume that there was a base
year in which the hidden economy did not exist. The ratio of cash to total activity is then
ﬁxed by that year. This ratio allows observed cash use in other years to be compounded
up into total activity. An alternative has been to look at the actual use of banknotes. The
issuing authorities know the expected lifespan of a note (i.e., how many transactions
it can ﬁnance). Multiplying the number of notes used by the number of transactions
gives the total value of activity ﬁnanced.
Table 17.1 presents estimates of the size of the hidden economy for a range of
countries. These ﬁgures are based on a combination of the direct input (actually use of
electricity as a proxy for output) and money demand approaches. Further details can be
found in the source reference. The table clearly indicates that the hidden economy is a
signiﬁcant issue, especially in the developing and transition economies. Even for Japan

and Austria, which have the smallest estimated size of hidden economy, the percentage
ﬁgure is still signiﬁcant.
As already noted, these estimates are subject to error and must be treated with a
degree of caution. Having said this, there is a degree of consistency running through
them. They indicate that a value for the hidden economy of at least 10 percent is not an
unreasonable approximation. Therefore the undeclared economic activity is substantial
relative to total economic activity. Tax evasion is clearly an important phenomenon that
merits extensive investigation.
17.3
The Evasion Decision
The estimates of the hidden economy have revealed that tax evasion is a signiﬁcant part
of overall economic activity. We now turn to modeling the decision to evade in order
to understand how the decision is made and the factors that can affect that decision.
The simplest model of the evasion decision considers it to be just a gamble. If
taxpayers declare less than their true income (or overstate deductions), there is a chance
that they may do so without being detected. This leads to a clear beneﬁt over making
an honest declaration. However, there is also a chance that they may be caught. When
they are, a punishment is inﬂicted (usually a ﬁne but sometimes imprisonment) and
they are worse off than if they had been honest. In deciding how much to evade, the
taxpayer has to weigh up these gains and losses, taking account of the chance of being
caught and the level of the punishment.
A simple formal statement of this decision problem can be given as follows. Let the
taxpayer have an income level Y, which they know but is not known to the tax collector.
The income declared by the taxpayer, X, is taxed at a constant rate t. The amount of

577
Chapter 17: Tax Evasion
unreported income is Y −X ≥0 and the unpaid tax is t[Y −X]. If the taxpayer evades
without being caught, their income is given by Y nc = Y −tX. When the taxpayer is
caught evading, all income is taxed and a ﬁne at rate F is levied on the tax that has
been evaded. This gives an income level Y c = [1 −t] Y −Ft [Y −X]. If income is
understated, the probability of being caught is p.
Assume that the taxpayer derives utility U(Y) from an income Y. After making
declaration X, the income level Y c occurs with probability p and the income level Y nc
with probability 1 −p. In the face of such uncertainty the taxpayer should choose the
income declaration to maximize expected utility. Combining these facts, the declaration
X solves
max
{X} E [U(X)] = [1 −p] U

Y nc
+ pU

Y c
.
(17.1)
The solution to this choice problem can be derived graphically. To do this, observe
that there are two states of the world. In one state of the world, taxpayers are not caught
evading and have income Y nc. In the other state of the world, they are caught and have
income Y c. The expected utility function describes preferences over income levels in
these two states. The choice of a declaration X determines an income level in each state,
and by varying X, the taxpayer can trade off income between the two states. A high
value of X provides relatively more income in the state where the taxpayer is caught
evading and a low value of X relatively more where the taxpayer is not caught.
The details of this trade-off can be identiﬁed by considering the two extreme values of
X. When the maximum declaration is made so that X = Y, the taxpayer’s income will
be [1−t]Y in both states of the world. Alternatively, when the minimum declaration of
X = 0 is made, income will be [1−t(1+F)]Y if caught and Y if not. These two points
are illustrated in ﬁgure 17.1, which graphs income when not caught against income
when caught. The other options available to the consumer lie on the line joining X = 0
and X = Y; this is the opportunity set showing the achievable allocations of income
between the two states. From the utility function can be derived a set of indifference
curves—the points on an indifference curve being income levels in the two states that
give the same level of expected utility. Including the indifference curves of the utility
function completes the diagram and allows the taxpayer’s choice to be depicted. The
taxpayer whose preferences are shown in ﬁgure 17.1 chooses to locate at the point with
declaration X∗. This is an interior point with 0 < X∗< Y—some tax is evaded but some
income is declared.
Besides the interior location of ﬁgure 17.1 it is possible for corner solutions to arise.

his entire income, so X∗= Y. In contrast the consumer in panel b declares no income,
so X∗= 0.
The interesting question is what condition guarantees that evasion will occur rather
than the no-evasion corner solution with X = Y. Comparing the ﬁgures it can be seen
that evasion will occur if the indifference curve is steeper than the budget constraint
where it crosses the dashed 45 degree line. The condition that ensures that this occurs is
easily derived. Totally differentiating the expected utility function (17.1) at a constant
level of utility gives the slope of the indifference curve as
dY c
dY nc = −[1 −p] U
′(Y nc)
pU
′(Y c)
,
(17.2)
where U
′ (Y) is the marginal utility of income level Y. On the 45 degree line Y nc = Y c,
so the marginal utility of income is the same whether or not the tax evader is caught.
This implies that
Slope of indifference curve = −1 −p
p
.
(17.3)
What this expression suggests is that all the indifference curves have the same slope,
−[1−p]
p
, where they cross the 45 degree line. The slope of the budget constraint is
seen in ﬁgure 17.1 to be given by the ratio of the penalty Ft [Y −X] to the unpaid tax
t[Y −X]. Thus
Slope of budget constraint = −F.
(17.4)
Because of these features the indifference curve is steeper than the budget constraint
on the 45 degree line if 1−p
p
> F, or
p <
1
1 + F .
(17.5)
This result shows that evasion will arise if the probability of detection is too small
relative to the ﬁne rate.
Several points can be made about this condition for evasion. First, this is a trigger
condition that determines whether or not evasion will arise, but it does not say any-
thing about the extent of evasion. Second, the condition is dependent only on the ﬁne
rate and the probability of detection, so it applies for all taxpayers regardless of their
utility-of-income function U(Y). Consequently, if one taxpayer chooses to evade, all
taxpayers should evade. Third, this condition can be given some practical evaluation.
Typical punishments inﬂicted for tax evasion suggest that an acceptable magnitude for

580
Part VI: Taxation
F is between 0.5 and 1. In the United Kingdom, the Taxes Management Act speciﬁes
the maximum ﬁne as 100 percent of the tax lost, which implies the maximum value of
F = 1. This makes the ratio
1
1+F greater or equal to 1
2. Information on p is hard to
obtain, but a ﬁgure between 1 in a 100 or 1 in a 1,000 evaders being caught is probably
a fair estimate. Therefore p < 1
2 <
1
1+F , and the conclusion is reached that the model
predicts all taxpayers should be evading. In the United States, taxpayers who understate
their tax liabilities may be subjected to penalties at a rate between 20 to 75 percent of
the underreported taxes, depending on the gravity of the offence. The proportion of
all individual tax returns that are audited was 1.7 percent in 1997. This is clearly not
large enough to deter cheating, and everyone should be underreporting taxes. In fact the
Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program reveals that 40 percent of US taxpayers
underpaid their taxes. This is a sizable minority but not the widespread evasion the
theoretical model would predict. So taxpayers appear to be more honest than might be
expected.
The next step is to determine how the amount of tax evasion is affected by changes
in the model’s variables. There are four such variables that are of interest: the income
level Y, the tax rate t, the probability of detection p, and the ﬁne rate F. These effects
can be explored by using the ﬁgure depicting the choice of evasion level.
Take the probability of detection ﬁrst. The probability of detection does not affect
the opportunity set but does affect preferences. The effect of an increase in p is to make
the indifference curves ﬂatter where they cross the 45 degree line. As shown in ﬁgure
17.3, this moves the optimal choice closer to the point X = Y of honest declaration.
The amount of income declared rises, so an increase in the probability of detection
reduces the level of evasion. This is a clearly expected result, since an increase in
the likelihood of detection lowers the payoff from evading and makes evasion a less
attractive proposition.
A change in the ﬁne rate only affects income when the taxpayer is caught evading.
The consequence of an increase in F is that the budget constraint pivots round the
honest report point and becomes steeper. Since the indifference curve is unaffected by
the penalty change, the optimal choice must again move closer to the honest declaration
point. This is shown in ﬁgure 17.4 by the move from the initial choice of Xold when
the ﬁne rate is F to the choice Xnew when the ﬁne rate increases to ˆF. An increase in
the ﬁne rate therefore leads to a reduction in the level of tax evasion. This result, and
the previous result, show that the effects of the detection and punishment variables on
the level of evasion are unambiguous.
Now consider the effect of an increase in income from the initial level Y to a higher
level ˆY. This income increase causes the budget constraint to move outward.As already

noted, the slope of the budget constraint is equal to −F, which does not change with
income, so the shift is a parallel one. The optimal choice then moves from Xold to
Xnew in ﬁgure 17.5. How the evasion decision is affected depends on the degree of
absolute risk aversion, RA(Y) = −U′′(Y)
U′(Y) , of the utility function. What absolute risk
aversion measures is the willingness to engage in small bets of ﬁxed size. If RA(Y) is
constant as Y changes, the optimal choices will be on a locus parallel to the 45 degree
line. There is evidence, though, that in practice, RA(Y) decreases as income increases,
so wealthier individuals are more prone to engage in small bets, in the sense that the
odds demanded to participate diminish. This causes the locus of choices to bend away
from the 45 degree line, so that the amount of undeclared income rises as actual income
increases. This is the outcome shown in ﬁgure 17.5. Hence, with decreasing absolute
risk aversion, an increase in income increases tax evasion.
The ﬁnal variable to consider is the tax rate. An increase in the tax rate from t to ˆt
moves the budget constraint inwards. As can be seen in ﬁgure 17.6, the outcome is
not clear-cut. However, when absolute risk aversion is decreasing, the effect of the tax
increase is to reduce tax evasion. This ﬁnal result has received much discussion because
it is counter to what seems intuitive. A high tax rate is normally seen as providing a
motive for tax evasion, whereas the model predicts precisely the converse. Why the
result emerges is because the ﬁne paid by the consumer is determined by t times F.
An increase in the tax rate thus has the effect of raising the penalty. A tax rate increase
takes income away from the taxpayer when they are caught—the state in which they

have least income. It is through this mechanism that a higher tax rate can reduce
evasion.
This completes the analysis of the basic model of tax evasion. It has been shown
how the level of evasion is determined and how this is affected by the parameters of the
model. The next section turn to the issue of determining the optimal levels of auditing
and punishment when the behavior of taxpayers corresponds to the predictions of this
model. Some empirical and experimental evidence is then considered and used to assess
the predictions of the model.
17.4
Auditing and Punishment
The analysis of the tax evasion decision assumed that the probability of detection and
the rate of the ﬁne levied, when caught evading, were ﬁxed. This is a satisfactory
assumption from the perspective of the individual taxpayer. From the government’s
perspective, though, these are variables that can be chosen. The probability of detection
can be raised by the employment of additional tax inspectors, and the ﬁne can be
legislated or set by the courts. The purpose of this section is to analyze the issues
involved in the government’s decision.
It has already been shown that an increase in either p or F will reduce the amount
of undeclared income. The next step is to consider how p and F affect the level of

584
Part VI: Taxation
revenue raised by the government. Revenue in this context is deﬁned as taxes paid plus
the money received from ﬁnes. From a taxpayer with income Y, the expected value (it
is expected, since there is only a probability the taxpayer will be ﬁned) of the revenue
collected is
R = tX + p [1 + F] t [Y −X].
(17.6)
Differentiating with respect to p shows that the effect on revenue of an increase in the
probability of detection is
∂R
∂p = [1 + F] t [Y −X] + t [1 −p −pF] ∂X
∂p > 0,
(17.7)
whenever pF < 1 −p. Recall from (17.5) that if pF ≥1 −p, there is no evasion, so p
has no effect on revenue. Carrying out the differentiation for the ﬁne rate shows that if
pF < 1 −p
∂R
∂F = pt [Y −X] + t [1 −p −pF] ∂X
∂F > 0.
(17.8)
An increase in the ﬁne will therefore raise revenue if tax evasion is taking place. Again,
the ﬁne has no effect if pF ≥1 −p and there is no evasion. These expressions show
that if evasion is taking place, an increase in the probability of either detection or the
ﬁne will increase the revenue the government receives.
The choice problem of the government can now be addressed. It has already been
noted that an increase in the probability of detection can be achieved by the employment
of additional tax inspectors. Tax inspectors require payment; as a consequence an
increase in p is costly. In contrast, there is no cost involved in raising or lowering the
ﬁne. Effectively, increases in F are costless to produce. From these observations the
optimal policy can be determined.
Since p is costly and F is free, the interests of the government are best served
by reducing p close to zero while raising F toward inﬁnity. Serge Kolm has termed
this the policy of “hanging taxpayers with probability zero.” Expressed in words, the
government should put virtually no effort into attempting to catch tax evaders but should
severely punish those it apprehends. This is an extreme form of policy, and nothing like
it is observed in practice. Surprising as it is, it does follow from the logical application
of the model.
Numerous comments can be made about this conclusion. The ﬁrst begins with the
objective of the government. In previous chapters it was assumed that the govern-
ment is guided in its policy choice by a social welfare function. There will be clear

585
Chapter 17: Tax Evasion
differences between a policy designed to maximize revenue and one that maximizes
welfare. For instance, inﬂicting an inﬁnite ﬁne on a taxpayer caught evading will have
a signiﬁcantly detrimental effect on welfare. Even if the government does not pur-
sue welfare maximization, it may be constrained by political factors such as the need
to ensure re-election. A policy of severely punishing tax evaders may be politically
damaging especially if tax evasion is a widely established phenomenon.
One could think that such an argument is not relevant because, if the punishment
is large enough to deter cheating, it should not matter how dire it is. If fear keeps
everyone from cheating, the punishment never actually occurs and its cost is irrelevant.
The problem with this argument is that it ignores the risk of mistakes. The detection
process may go wrong, or the taxpayer can mistakenly understate taxable income. If
the punishment is as large as possible, even for small tax underpayments, then mistakes
will be very costly. To reduce the cost of mistakes, the punishment should be of the
smallest size required to deter cheating. Minimal deterrence accomplishes this purpose.
Afurther observation, and one where the consequences will be investigated in detail,
concerns the policy instruments under the government’s control. The view of the gov-
ernment so far is that it is a single entity that chooses the level of all its policy instruments
simultaneously. In practice, the government consists of many different departments and
agencies. When it comes to taxation and tax policy, a reasonable breakdown would be
to view the tax rate as set by central government as part of a general economic policy.
The probability of detection is controlled by a revenue service whose objective is the
maximization of revenue. Finally the punishment for tax evasion is set by the judiciary.
This breakdown shows why the probability and ﬁne may not be chosen in a cohesive
manner by a single authority. What it does not do is provide any argument for why the
ﬁne should not be set inﬁnitely high to deter evasion. An explanation can be found by
applying reasoning from the economics of crime. This would view tax evasion as just
another crime, and the punishment for it should ﬁt with the scheme of punishments for
other crimes. The construction of punishments relies on the argument that they should
provide incentives that lessen the overall level of crime. To see what this means, imagine
that crimes can be ranked from least harmful to most harmful. Naturally, if someone
is going to commit a crime, the authorities wish that they commit a less harmful one
rather than a more harmful one. If more harmful ones are also more rewarding (think
of robbing a bank while armed compared to merely attempting to snatch cash), then
a scheme of equal punishments will not provide any incentive for committing the less
harmful crime. What will provide the right incentive is for the more harmful crime to
also have heavier punishment. So the extent of punishment should be related to the
harmfulness of the crime: punishment should ﬁt the crime.

586
Part VI: Taxation
This framework has two implications. First of all, the punishment for tax evasion
will not be varied freely in order to maximize revenue. Instead, it will be set as part
of a general crime policy. The second implication is that the punishment will also be
quite modest, since tax evasion is not an especially harmful crime. Arguments such as
these are reﬂected in the fact that the ﬁne rate on evasion is quite low—a value between
1.5 and 2 would not be unrealistic. As already noted, the maximum ﬁne in the United
Kingdom is 100 percent of the unpaid tax, but the Inland Revenue may accept a lesser
ﬁne depending on the “size and gravity” of the offense.
Putting all of these arguments together suggests adopting a different perspective on
choosing the optimal probability of detection. With the tax rate set as a tool of economic
policy and the ﬁne set by the judiciary, the only instrument under the control of the
revenue service is the probability of detection.As already seen, an increase in this raises
revenue but only does so at a cost. The optimal probability is found when the marginal
gain in revenue just equals the marginal cost—and this could occur at a very low value
of the probability of detection.
17.5
Evidence on Evasion
The model of tax evasion has predicted the effect that changes in various parameters
will have on the level of tax evasion. In some cases, such as the effect of the probability
of detection and the ﬁne, these are unambiguous. In others, particularly the effect
of changes in the tax rate, the effects depend on the precise speciﬁcation of the tax
system and on assumptions concerning attitudes toward risk. These uncertainties make
it valuable to investigate further evidence to see how the ambiguities are resolved in
practice. The analysis of evidence also allows the investigation of the relevance of other
parameters, such as the source of income, and other hypotheses on tax evasion, such
as the importance of social interaction.
There have been two approaches taken in studying tax evasion. The ﬁrst was to
collect survey or interview data and use econometric analysis to provide a quantitative
determination of the relationships. The second was to use experiments to provide an
opportunity for designing the environment to permit the investigation of particular
hypotheses.
When income levels ascertained from interviews were contrasted to those given
on the tax returns of the same individuals, a steady decline of declared income as a
proportion of reported income appeared with income rises. This ﬁnding is in agreement
with the comparative statics analysis. Table 17.2 provides a sample of data to illustrate

this. Interviewees were placed in income intervals according to their responses to
interview questions. The information on their tax declaration was then used to determine
assessed income. The percentage is found by dividing the assessed income by the
midpoint of the income interval.
Econometrics and survey methods have been used to investigate the importance of
attitudes and social norms in the evasion decision. The study reported in table 17.3
shows that the propensity to evade taxation is reduced by an increased probability of
detection and an increase in age.An increase in income reduces the propensity to evade.
With respect to attitude and social variables, both an increase in the perceived inequity
of taxation and of the number of other tax evaders known to the individual make evasion
more likely. The extent of tax evasion is increased by attitude and social variables but
also by the experience of the taxpayer with previous tax audits. The social variables
are clearly important in the decision to evade tax.
As far as the effect of the tax rate is concerned, data from the US Internal Revenue
Services Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program survey of 1969 shows that tax
evasion increases as the marginal tax rates increases but is decreased when wages are a

588
Part VI: Taxation
signiﬁcant proportion of income. This result is supported by employing the difference
between income and expenditure ﬁgures in NationalAccounts as a measure of evasion.
In contrast, a study of Belgian data found precisely the converse conclusion, with tax
increases leading to lower evasion. Therefore these studies do not resolve the ambiguity
about the relation between marginal tax rates and tax evasion.
Turning now to experimental studies, tax evasion games have shown that evasion
increases with the tax rate and that evasion falls as the ﬁne is increased and the detection
probability reduced. Further results have shown that women evade more often than men
but evade lower amounts and that purchasers of lottery tickets, presumed to be less risk
averse, are no more likely to evade than nonpurchasers but evade greater amounts when
they do evade. Finally the very nature of the tax evasion decision has been tested by
running two sets of experiments. One was framed as a tax evasion decision and the other
as a simple gamble with the same risks and payoffs. For the tax evasion experiment
some taxpayers chose not to evade even when they would under the same conditions
with the gambling experiment. This suggests that tax evasion is not viewed as just a
gamble.
There are two important lessons to be drawn from this brief review of the empiri-
cal and experimental results. First, the theoretical predictions are generally supported
except for the effect of the tax rate. The latter remains uncertain with conﬂicting con-
clusions from the evidence. Second, it appears that tax evasion is more than the simple
gamble portrayed in the basic model. In addition to the basic element of risk, there are
social aspects to the evasion decision.
17.6
Effect of Honesty
The evidence discussed in the previous section has turned up a number of factors that
are not explained by the basic model of tax evasion. Foremost among these are that
some taxpayers choose not to evade even when they would accept an identical gamble
and that there are social aspects of the evasion decision. The purpose of this section is
to show how simple modiﬁcations to the model can incorporate these factors and can
change the conclusions concerning the effect of the tax rate.
The feature that distinguishes tax evasion from a simple gamble is that taxpayers
submitting incorrect returns feel varying degrees of anxiety and regret. To some, being
caught would represent a traumatic experience that would do immense damage to their
self-esteem. To others, it would be only a slight inconvenience. The innate belief in
honesty of some taxpayers is not captured by representing tax evasion as just a gamble

589
Chapter 17: Tax Evasion
nor are the nonmonetary costs of detection and punishment captured by preferences
deﬁned on income alone. The ﬁrst intention of this section is to incorporate these
features into the analysis and to study their consequences.
A preference for honesty can be introduced by writing the utility function as
U = U(Y) −χE,
(17.9)
where χ is the measure of the taxpayers honesty and, with E = Y −X the extent of
evasion, χE is the utility (or psychic) cost of deviating from complete honesty. To see
the consequence of introducing a psychic cost of evasion, suppose that taxpayers differ
in their value of χ but are identical in all other respects. Taxpayers with higher values
of χ will suffer from a greater utility reduction for any given level of evasion. In order
for them to evade, the utility gain from evasion must exceed the utility reduction. The
population is therefore separated into two parts: some taxpayers choosing not to evade
(those with high values of χ) and others who evade (those with low χ). It is tempting
to label taxpayers who do not evade as honest, but this is not really appropriate, since
they will evade if the beneﬁt is sufﬁciently great.
Let the value of χ that separates the evaders from the nonevaders be denoted ˆχ. A
change in any of the parameters of the model (p, F, and t) now has two effects. First, it
changes the beneﬁt from evasion, which alters the value of ˆχ. For instance, an increase
in the rate of tax raises the beneﬁt of evasion and increases ˆχ with the consequence that
more taxpayers evade. Second, the change in the parameter affects the evasion decision
of all existing tax evaders. Putting these effects together, it becomes possible for an
increase in the tax rate to lead to more evasion in the aggregate. This is in contrast to
the basic model where the tax rate increase would reduce evasion.
The discussion of the empirical evidence has drawn attention to the positive con-
nection between the number of tax evaders known to a taxpayer and the level of that
taxpayer’s own evasion. This observation suggests that the evasion decision is not made
in isolation by each taxpayer but is made with reference to the norms and behavior of
the general society of the taxpayer. Given the empirical signiﬁcance of such norms, the
second part of this section focuses on their implications.
Social norms have been incorporated into the model of the evasion decision in two
distinct ways. One approach is to introduce social norms as an additional element of
the utility cost to evasion. The additional utility cost is assumed to be an increasing
function of the proportion of taxpayers who do not evade. This formulation captures
the fact that more utility will be lost, in terms of reputation, the more out of step the
taxpayer is with the rest of society. The consequence of this modiﬁcation is to reinforce
the separation of the population into evaders and nonevaders.

590
Part VI: Taxation
An alternative approach is to explicitly impose a social norm on behavior. One such
social norm can be based on the notion of Kantian morality and, effectively, on having
individuals assess their fair contribution in tax payments toward the provision of public
goods. This calculation then provides an upper bound on the extent of tax evasion. To
calculate the actual degree of tax evasion, each taxpayer performs the expected utility
maximization calculation, as in (17.1), and evades whichever is the smaller out of this
quantity and the previously determined upper bound. This formulation is also able to
provide a positive relation between the tax rate and evaded tax for some range of taxes
and to divide the population into those who evade tax and those who do not.
The introduction of psychic costs and of social norms is capable of explaining some
of the empirically observed features of tax evasion that are not explained by the standard
expected utility maximization hypothesis. This is achieved by modifying the form of
preferences, but the basic nature of the approach is unchanged. The obvious difﬁculty
with these changes is that there is little to suggest precisely how social norms and utility
costs of dishonesty should be formalized.
17.7
Tax Compliance Game
An initial analysis of the choice of audit probability was undertaken in section 17.4. It
was argued there that the practical situation involves a revenue service that chooses the
probability to maximize total revenue, taking as given the tax rate and the punishment.
The choice of probability in this setting requires an analysis of the interaction between
the revenue service and the taxpayers. The revenue service reacts to the declarations
of taxpayers, and taxpayers make declarations on the basis of the expected detection
probability.
Such interaction is best analyzed by formalizing the structure of the game that is
being played between the revenue service and the taxpayers. The choice of a strategy
for the revenue service is the probability with which it chooses to audit any given
value of declaration. This probability need not be constant for declarations of different
values and is based on its perception of the behavior of taxpayers. For the taxpayers, a
strategy is a choice of declaration given the audit strategy of the revenue service. At a
Nash equilibrium of the game, the strategy choices must be mutually optimal: the audit
strategy must maximize the revenue collected, net of the costs of auditing, given the
declarations; the declaration must maximize utility given the audit strategy.
Even without specifying further details of the game, it is possible to make a general
observation: predictability in auditing cannot be an equilibrium strategy. First, no

The audit game
auditing at all cannot be optimal because it encourages maximal tax evasion. Second,
auditing of all declarations cannot be a solution either because no revenue service incurs
the cost of auditing where full enforcement induces everyone to comply. Finally, pre-
speciﬁed limits on the range of declarations to be audited are also ﬂawed. Taxpayers
tempted to underreport income will make sure to stay just outside the audit limit, and
those who cannot avoid being audited will choose to report truthfully. Exactly the
wrong set of taxpayers will be audited. This establishes that the equilibrium strategy
must involve randomization.
But how should the probability of audit depend on the information available on the
tax return? Since the incentive of a taxpayer is to understate income to reduce their
tax liabilities, it seems to require that the probability of an audit should be higher for
low-income reports. More precisely, the probability of an audit should be high for an
income report that is low compared to what one would expect from someone in that
taxpayer’s occupation or given the information on previous tax returns for that taxpayer.
This is what theory predicts and what is done in practice.
A simple version of the strategic interaction between the revenue service and a
taxpayer is depicted in ﬁgure 17.7. The taxpayer with true income Y can either evade
(reporting zero income) or not (truthful income report). By reporting truthfully, the
taxpayer pays tax T to the revenue service (with T < Y). The revenue service can either
audit the income report or not audit. An audit costs C for the revenue service to conduct
but provides irrefutable evidence as to whether the taxpayer has misreported income.
If the taxpayer is caught evading, he pays the tax due, T , plus a ﬁne F (where the
ﬁne includes the cost of auditing and a tax surcharge so that F > C). If the taxpayer is
not caught evading, then he pays no tax at all. The two players choose their strategies
simultaneously, which reﬂects the fact that the revenue service does not know whether

592
Part VI: Taxation
the taxpayer has chosen to evade when it decides whether to audit. To make the problem
interesting, we assume that C < T , so the cost of auditing is less than its potential gain,
which is to recover the tax due.
There is no pure strategy equilibrium in this tax compliance game. On the one hand,
if the revenue service does not audit, the agent strictly prefers evading, and therefore
the revenue service is better off auditing as T + F > C. On the other hand, if the
revenue service audits with certainty, the taxpayer prefers not to evade as T + F > T ,
which implies that the revenue service is better off not auditing. Therefore the revenue
must play a mixed strategy in equilibrium, with the audit strategy being random (i.e.,
unpredictable). Similarly for the taxpayer the evasion strategy must also be random.
Let e be the probability that the taxpayer evades, and p the probability of audit.
To obtain the equilibrium probabilities, we solve the conditions that the players must
be indifferent between their two pure strategies. For the government to be indifferent
between auditing and not auditing, it must be the case that the cost from auditing,
C, equals the expected gain in tax and ﬁne revenue, e[T + F]. For the taxpayer to be
indifferent between evading and not evading, the expected gain from evading, [1−p]T
equals the expected penalty pF. Hence in equilibrium the probability of evasion is
e∗=
C
T + F ,
(17.10)
and the probability of audit is
p∗=
T
T + F ,
(17.11)
where both e∗and p∗belong to the interval (0, 1) so that both evasion and audit
strategies are random.
The equilibrium probabilities are determined by the strategic interaction between the
taxpayer and the revenue service. For instance, the audit probability declines with
the ﬁne, although a higher ﬁne may be expected to make auditing more proﬁtable. The
reason is that a higher ﬁne discourages evasion, thus making auditing less proﬁtable.
Similarly evasion is less likely with a high tax because a higher tax induces the govern-
ment to audit more. Note that these results are obtained without specifying the details of
the ﬁne function, which could be either a lump-sum amount or something proportional
to evaded tax. Evasion is also more likely the more costly is auditing, since the revenue
service is willing to audit at a higher cost only if the taxpayer is more likely to have
evaded tax.

593
Chapter 17: Tax Evasion
The equilibrium payoffs of the players are
u∗= Y −T + e∗[T −p∗[T + F]],
(17.12)
for the taxpayer and
v∗= (1 −e∗)T + p∗[e∗[T + F] −C],
(17.13)
for the revenue service. Substituting into these payoffs the equilibrium probabilities of
evasion and audit gives
u∗= Y −T,
(17.14)
v∗= T −
C
T + F T.
(17.15)
Because the taxpayer is indifferent between evading and not evading, his equilibrium
payoff is equal to his truthful payoff Y −T . This means that the unpaid taxes and
the ﬁne cancel out in expected terms. Increasing the ﬁne does not affect the taxpayer.
However, a higher ﬁne increases the payoff of the revenue service, since it reduces the
amount of evasion. Hence increasing the penalty is Pareto-improving in this model.
The equilibrium payoffs also reﬂect the cost from evasion. Indeed, for any tax T paid
by the taxpayer, the revenue service effectively receives T −, where  =
C
T +F T
is the deadweight loss from evasion. Thus evasion involves a deadweight loss that is
increasing with the tax rate.
17.8
Behavioral Models
The analysis of the evasion decision based on the expected utility function produced
very clear and precise results. It provided a sufﬁcient condition for a taxpayer to conceal
someincomeanddeterminedtheresponseofthetaxpayertochangesinthekeyvariables
(f , p, t, and Y). It is rare for a model to provide such unambiguous conclusions.
Unfortunately, not all the results it produces are in agreement with the evidence.
When evaluated at the levels of audit probability and ﬁne rate the model predicts
that all taxpayers will engage in evasion whenever the opportunity arises. The extent of
evasion varies across countries, but there are many countries for which honest payment
of taxes is the predominant behavior. For these countries the model does not predict
the correct level of evasion. The model also predicts that the level of evasion falls
when the tax rate rises. This is a consequence of the ﬁne being a multiple of the tax

594
Part VI: Taxation
evaded so that the “effective” punishment is ftE, where E is the amount of evasion. The
effective punishment for a given amount of evasion increases as the tax rate increases
so discouraging evasion. Intuition suggests a high tax rate should provide an incentive
to evade, whereas the model predicts the opposite. The empirical and experimental
evidence on this point is mixed. This has not prevented a presumption developing in
the literature that the result is wrong, from which it follows that the model is inadequate
and must be improved.
The natural response to the perceived failings of the model is to consider the range of
alternative choice models proposed by behavioral economics. These alternative models
can be understood as relaxing the very restrictive assumptions of expected utility theory.
The behavioral models can be viewed as special cases of the general formulation of the
value function
V =
n

i=1
wi(p1, . . . , pn)v(xi),
(17.16)
where wi(p1, . . . , pn) are decision weights and v(xi) the payoff function. The inter-
pretation is that the decision maker (the taxpayer for an evasion decision) knows that
the true probabilities of the events are p1, . . . , pn. However, in their evaluation of
the alternatives they transform these probabilities into the decision weights. The usual
assumption in behavioral economics is that unlikely events are typically assigned a
decision weight greater than the probability. So, if the chance of auditing is small, it
is given much greater weight in the subjective assessment of the taxpayer. The logic
is of the kind “I know only 4 percent of people are audited but if I evade I will almost
certainly be audited.” A utility function, denoted U(xi), is a special case of a payoff
function that satisﬁes the additional assumptions U′ (·) > 0 and U′′ (·) < 0. Expected
utility ﬁts into this formulation with wi(p) = pi, and v(xi) = U(xi).
Rank dependent expected utility begins by ranking the outcomes from worst to best.
For tax evasion the worst outcome is Y c and the best outcome is Y n. It then as-
signs a weight ̟ (Y c) to the worst outcome and 1 −̟ (Y c) to the best outcome,
where it is assumed that ̟(0) = 0 and ̟(1) = 1. The value function can then be
written as
max
{E} V(E) = ̟ (p) U(Y c) + [1 −̟ (p)] U(Y n).
(17.17)
Furthermore it is assumed that the weighting function is inverse S-shaped (concave,
then convex). This has the effect of inﬂating low probabilities and deﬂating large

595
Chapter 17: Tax Evasion
probabilities. In practice, the probability of audit is low, so it is natural to take
̟ (p) > p. By comparing (17.17) to the expected utility function of the standard
model, we can see that the sufﬁcient condition for evasion to occur with rank de-
pendent expected utility is 1 −̟ (p) −̟ (p) f > 0. Since the weighting inﬂates the
probability of detection, this provides a stricter sufﬁcient condition, and so p must be
lower than in the standard model before evasion occurs.
It should be noted that although this formulation changes the prediction about the
extent of evasion, it does not change the comparative static effect of a change in the
tax rate, t. Given a probability, p, the change of variables 1 −̟ (p) ≡1 −q,
̟ (p) ≡q can be made, and the optimization becomes that of the standard model but
with p replaced by q. The qualitative properties of the comparative statics are therefore
unchanged.
Prospect Theory is based on three assumptions. First, payoffs are based on gains
and losses relative to a reference point. Second, the payoff function is concave in
gains but convex in losses. Third, the additional utility from a small gain is less then
the utility reduction from a small loss. Two issues arise in applying this theory to the
evasion decision. Since there is no natural reference point or functional form for the
payoff, there is considerable ﬂexibility within Prospect Theory for the representation
of the choice problem. The combination of concavity and convexity means that there
is often no interior solution for the choice problem so that the evasion choice is all-or-
nothing.
The latter point is now illustrated for a commonly used version of Prospect Theory.
The payoff function is assumed to take the power function form
v (z) =

zβ,
z ≥0,
−γ (−z)β ,
z < 0.
The effect of the parameter γ is to give the payoff function a kink at zero when γ ̸= 1.
It is usually assumed that γ > 1, which ensures that the utility fall from a small loss
is greater than the utility rise from a small gain. Assume that the reference level of
income, R, is income after the correct tax payment, so that R = Y[1 −t]. Then, if the
taxpayer is caught, the loss relative to the reference level is
Y c −R = −ft[Y −X].
(17.18)
If the taxpayer is not caught the gain is
Y n −R = t[Y −X].
(17.19)

Part VI: Taxation
Combining these assumptions determines the payoff function
V = p

−γ [ ft [Y −X]]β
+ [1 −p] [t [Y −X]]β .
(17.20)
Observe that this payoff function can be factored as
V = Eβ [1 −p] tβ −pγf βtβ
,
(17.21)
where the level of evasion is E = Y −X. It can be seen directly from (17.21)
that the optimal choice of evasion is E = Y if [1 −p] −pγf β > 0 but E = 0 if
[1 −p] −pγf β < 0. The choice of reference point and payoff function combines to
ensure that there will always be a corner solution (except for when [1 −p]−pγf β = 0,
in which case the taxpayer is indifferent about the value of E). The taxpayer either de-
clares honestly or declares nothing. The tax rate does not affect this decision, so the
model also predicts that changes in the tax rate will not affect the amount of evasion.
The central feature of Disappointment Theory is the comparison of the outcome
that is achieved with the outcomes that could have been achieved. When the realized
outcome is poor, an amount of disappointment reduces the payoff. This provides a
disincentive to undertake risky actions that may lead to poor outcomes. In the context
of tax evasion this will, ceteris paribus, reduce the chosen level of evasion. We now
consider whether the inclusion of disappointment modiﬁes the sufﬁcient condition for
evasion or the tax effect.
Let ˜Y(E) denote the random level of income after evading an amount E. ˜Y(E) is
equal to Y c with probability p and Y n with probability 1 −p. For Disappointment
Theory the payoff with an amount of evasion E is written as
V = E[U( ˜Y(E))] −E[D( ˜Y(E) −E[ ˜Y(E)])],
(17.22)
where D( ˜Y(E) −E[ ˜Y(E)]) is the disappointment function and the E the expecta-
tions operator. It is assumed that D( ˜Y(E) −E[ ˜Y(E)]) > 0 if ˜Y(E) < E[ ˜YY(E)] and
D( ˜Y(E) −E[ ˜Y(E)]) < 0 if ˜Y(E) > E[ ˜Y(E)]. The interpretation of (17.22) is that the
payoff is composed of two parts. The ﬁrst part arises from expected utility of income as
in the standard model. The second part subtracts the disappointment that arises. From
the deﬁnitions of Y n and Y c it follows that
E[ ˜Y(E)] = pYc + [1 −p] Y n = Y[1 −t] + [1 −p −pf ] tE.
(17.23)
If the taxpayer is audited, then income is Y c, which is less than E[ ˜Y(E)] = Y[1 −t] +
[1 −p −pf ]tE, so the disappointment is positive. Conversely, Y c > Y[1 −t] +
[1 −p −pf ] tE, so the disappointment is negative if the taxpayer is not caught.

597
Chapter 17: Tax Evasion
Substituting for ˜Y (E) (17.22) can be written
V = pU(Y [1 −t] −ftE) + [1 −p] U(Y [1 −t] + tE)
−pD(−[1 −p] [1 + f ] tE) −[1 −p] D(p [1 + f ] tE).
(17.24)
From the objective in (17.24) the necessary condition for evasion to occur is that
∂V
∂E |E=0 > 0.
(17.25)
Calculating the derivative gives
∂V
∂E = −pftU′
Y c
+ [1 −p] tU′
Y n
+ pD′(−[1 −p] [1 + f ] tE) [1 −p] [1 + f ] t
−[1 −p] D′ (p [1 + f ] tE) p [1 + f ] t.
(17.26)
It can be seen immediately that when E = 0, the third and fourth terms cancel. The
sufﬁcient condition for evasion to occur is then 1 −p −pf > 0, which is identical to
that for the standard model. In addition the payoff is dependent on tE, so the solution
for E will involve a term in 1
t . Hence, as t increases, E will fall. Therefore the model
does not provide a route to reversing the direction of the tax effect.
Ambiguity Theory applies when there is a lack of precise knowledge of the audit
probability so the taxpayer forms a second-order probability distribution over possible
audit probabilities. An increase in ambiguity means an increase in dispersion of this
probability distribution. Experimental evidence shows people are heterogeneous with
respect to preferences over ambiguity. This implies that the sufﬁcient condition for
evasion to occur will differ across taxpayers.
Ambiguity can be represented in the payoff by putting weight γ on the worst outcome,
λ on the best outcome, and [1 −λ −γ ] on the expected value given the belief, p, about
probability of audit. This gives the payoff
V = γ
min
{x1,...,xn} v(x) + λ
max
{x1,...,xn} v(x) + [1 −λ −γ ]
n

i=1
piv(xi).
(17.27)
The sum γ + λ represents the amount of perceived ambiguity and 1 −λ −γ is the
degree of conﬁdence in the belief p. Individuals can differ in their personal values of
γ and λ. Preferences with γ relatively large describe a pessimistic individual who is
concerned about what will happen if the very worst outcome arises: as γ tends to 1,
the preferences are entirely focused on the minimum possible payoff.

598
Part VI: Taxation
In the case of tax evasion there are only two outcomes: Y n and Y c, with Y c < Y n.
The payoff function for ambiguity then reduces to
V = γ v(Y c) + λv(Y n) + [1 −λ −γ ] 
pv(Y c) + [1 −p])v(sh)

= [γ + [1 −λ −γ ] p] v(Y c) + [λ + [1 −λ −γ ] [1 −p]] v(Y n)
(17.28)
The form of (17.28) reveals that in this context ambiguity is equivalent to a particular
weighting of the probabilities. As the degree of conﬁdence in the belief goes down
(1 −γ −λ →0), the weights tends to λ and γ . These are individual-speciﬁc attributes
and are not related to the objective probability, p. They are instead entirely determined
by the individual attitude toward ambiguity.
When the payoff function is a utility function (v(Y) = U(Y)), the implications
of the ambiguity model can be compared directly to the standard model. The suf-
ﬁcient condition for evasion to take place can be read directly from (17.28), since
the weighting replaces p in the standard model by γ + [1 −λ −γ ] p. Provided that
γ +[1 −λ −γ ] p > p, the sufﬁcient condition for evasion to take place will be stricter.
As far as the effect of the tax rate is concerned the ambiguity model does not change
the outcome if the payoff function is a utility. It only changes the weighting, so the
comparative statics of the tax rate remain the same.
The idea of more or less ambiguity is an interesting one for the tax compliance
decision because it raises important policy questions about the likely effect of making
auditing processes more or less transparent. It is possible that increasing ambiguity
by making policy less transparent will increase compliance. The model will also yield
a different necessary condition for evasion that will be individual-speciﬁc, and it can
predict higher levels of compliance than the standard model. It does not change the
direction of the tax effect.
The models discussed above have a variety of different implications for the evasion
decision. Most can affect the sufﬁcient condition for evasion. For the standard model
this condition is the same for all taxpayers because they all use the same objective
probability in the formation of expected utility. Behavioral models permit the weights
to vary between individuals. The weights can also differ from the true probability, so
the sufﬁcient condition can be stricter and reduce the predicted number of taxpayers
engaged in evasion. What these models cannot easily do is change the direction of the
tax effect. This comparative static result is a consequence of the ﬁne being determined
by the tax rate. As long as the payoffs depend on the product of t and E, an increase in
the tax rate will reduce the amount of evasion.

Chapter 17: Tax Evasion
17.9
Compliance and Social Interaction
It has been assumed so far that the decision by any taxpayer to comply with the tax law
is independent of what the other taxpayers are doing. This decision is based entirely on
the enforcement policy (penalty and auditing) and economic opportunities (tax rates
and income). In practice, however, we may expect that someone is more likely to break
the law when noncompliance is already widespread than when it is conﬁned to a small
segment of the population. This observation is supported by the evidence in table 17.3,
which shows that tax compliance is susceptible to social interaction.
The reasoning behind this social interaction can be motivated along the following
lines: the amount of stigma or guilt I feel if I do not comply may depend on what
others do and think. Whether they also underpay taxes may determine how I feel if I
do not comply. As we now show, this simple interdependence among taxpayers can
trigger a dynamic process that moves the economy toward either full compliance or no
compliance at all.
To see this, consider a set of taxpayers. Each taxpayer has to decide whether to evade
taxes. Fixing the enforcement parameters, the payoff from evading taxes depends on the
number of noncompliers. On the one hand, the payoff from noncompliance is increasing
with the number of noncompliers because then the chance of getting away with the act
of evasion increases. On the other hand, the payoff from compliance decreases with
the number of noncompliers. The reason can be that you suffer some resentment cost
from abiding with the law when so many are breaking the law. Therefore individuals
care about the overall compliance in the group when choosing to comply themselves.
It follows from this that the choice of tax evasion becomes more attractive when more
taxpayers make the same choice of breaking the law. Because of the way interactions
work, the choice of tax evasion becomes more attractive when more taxpayers make
the same choice of breaking the law. The aggregate compliance tendency is toward one
of the extremes: only the worst outcome of nobody complying or the best outcome of
full compliance are possible. This is illustrated in ﬁgure 17.8 depicting the payoff from
compliance and noncompliance (vertical axis) against the noncompliance rate in the
group (horizontal axis). At the intersection of the two payoff functions, taxpayers are
indifferent between compliance or noncompliance. Starting from this point, a small re-
duction in noncompliance will break the indifference in favor of compliance and trigger
a chain reaction toward increasing compliance. Alternatively, a small increase in non-
compliance triggers a chain reaction in the opposite direction making noncompliance
progressively more attractive.

Equilibrium compliance
In this situation, how do we encourage taxpayers to abide by the law when the
dynamic is pushing in the opposite direction? The solution is to get a critical mass
of individuals complying to reverse the dynamic. This requires a short but intense
audit policy backed by a harsh punishment in order to change the decisions of enough
taxpayers that the dynamics switch toward full compliance. When at this new full-
compliance equilibrium, it is possible to cut down on audit costs because compliance
is self-sustained by the large numbers of taxpayers who comply. It follows from this
simple argument that a moderate enforcement policy with few audits and light penalties
overalongperiodisineffective.Anotherinterestingimplicationofthismodelisthattwo
countries with similar enforcement policies can end up with very different compliance
rates. Social interaction can be a crucial explanation for the astoundingly high variance
of compliance rates across locations and over time that are much higher than can be
predicted by differences in local enforcement policies.

Conclusions
Tax evasion is an important and signiﬁcant phenomenon that affects both developed and
developing economies.Although there is residual uncertainty surrounding the accuracy
of measurements, even the most conservative estimates suggest the hidden economy
in the United Kingdom and United States to be at least 10 percent of the measured
economy. There are many countries where it is very much higher. The substantial size

601
Chapter 17: Tax Evasion
of the hidden economy, and the tax evasion that accompanies it, require understanding
so that the effects of policies that interact with it can be correctly forecast.
The predictions of the standard representation of tax evasion as a choice with risk
were derived and contrasted with empirical and experimental evidence. This showed
that although it is valuable as a starting point for a theory of evasion, the model did
not incorporate some key aspects of the evasion decision, notably the effects of a basic
wish to avoid dishonesty and the social interaction among taxpayers. The analysis was
then extended to incorporate both of these issues.

using sobriety checkpoints, crackdowns on speeding achieved through a greater announced

terize our notion of random crackdowns. First, they are arbitrary, in the sense that they subject
certain groups (identiﬁed by presence in a particular time or place, or by other observable
characteristics), which are not notably different from other groups in criminal propensities,
to higher intensity police monitoring. Second, they are publicized; that is, those who are sub-
jected to crackdowns are informed about them before they engage in criminal activity aimed
at particular neighborhoods. Discuss the potential costs and beneﬁts of a similar crackdown
policy to combat tax evasion. (Hint: You can also use behavioral arguments for nonrational
choices.)
17.18
(Crackdowns 2) To illustrate the main idea behind a crackdown policy, consider an example
where the tax enforcement agency seeks to minimize tax evasion subject to a ﬁxed budget
constraint. Consider a population of 100 taxpayers, half of whom would never evade taxes
and half of whom would evade taxes unless it is sufﬁciently likely that they will be audited.
A taxpayer’s propensity to evade tax is unobservable to the tax enforcement agency. The tax
enforcement budget is such that only 50 taxpayers can be audited.
a. Random audit: Suppose that taxpayers are audited at random, so that each taxpayer has a
probability 1
2 of being audited. Then what will be the compliance rate?
b. Crackdown audit: Suppose now that half of the taxpayers are selected based on observable
characteristics (e.g., eye color) known to be independent of the propensity to evade taxes (so
it is arbitrary). Nevertheless, suppose that all taxpayers in this group are audited and the rest
of the taxpayers are not audited. Overall, 50 taxpayers are audited as required by the budget
constraint. Then what will be the compliance rate? Compare with part a.
c. What objections would you make to this arbitrary crackdown tax enforcement?

Detection occurs with probability p.
a. Determine the optimal declaration and the resulting level of expected utility.
Now assume that taxpayers are offered a cutoff policy for audits: the policy is that no one

b. What is the optimal announcement under the cutoff rule?
c. Derive the condition that determines whether a taxpayer prefers the random audit policy

Consider the optimal audit strategy of a tax authority. All taxpayers have either a low income
YL or a high income YH , with YL < YH . They ﬁle a tax return, but the rich taxpayers

known, but a personal tax return can only be veriﬁed through an audit that costs c. There is
a constant tax rate on income t and a ﬁne consisting of a surcharge F on any underpaid tax.
The parameters c, t, and F are not chosen by the tax authority.
a. Suppose that the tax authority can pre-commit to its audit polity. What is the optimal audit

The Limits to Redistribution
18.1
Introduction
In this chapter we step back from the speciﬁc models used in chapters 15 and 16 in
order to consider taxation from a broader perspective. We have already stressed that the
role of taxation is to allow the government to achieve an allocation of resources that is
preferred to that which would arise in the absence of intervention. The mixed economy
approach we have adopted, by which is meant the combination of competitive trading
alongside intervention by the government, is not the only means of organizing economic
activity. Manyalternativesexist, suchasthecommandeconomywithdirectgovernment
resource allocation or economies based on workers’ cooperatives. The analysis we
describe contrasts the success of the mixed economy at delivering redistribution with
other forms of economic organization. It is quite remarkable that this highly abstract
analysis delivers clear and precise conclusions.
All forms of economy can be interpreted as allocation mechanisms: they provide a
mechanism for allocating the economy’s resources among competing uses. From this
viewpoint, the mixed-economy model of taxation on which we have focused represents
just one form of an allocation mechanism from among a very broad set of potential
allocation mechanisms. This line of reasoning leads to some important questions. For
instance, how effective is taxation in achieving the government’s aims? Expressed
differently, are there any allocation mechanisms that can achieve those aims better than
the mixed economy with taxation? If there are, what is the nature of these alternatives?
By considering the issue of the choice between allocation mechanisms, with the mixed
economy as one option among many, this chapter will provide clear answers to these
questions.
To provide the motivation for the approach we take, it is necessary to clarify some
basic issues. As we have noted many times already, government policy aims to resolve
the trade-off between efﬁciency and equity in a way that maximizes its objective func-
tion. Improving efﬁciency is uncontentious since it implies a Pareto improvement, and
therefore will be unanimously supported. In contrast, attaining equity aims implies re-
distribution, so there will be some consumers that lose from this (as others gain). Those
that stand to lose will have an incentive to take actions to reduce the loss. Such changes
in action provide limits on the amount of redistribution that can be undertaken. Different
allocation mechanisms will face different limits, so the effectiveness of taxation as an

608
Part VI: Taxation
allocation mechanism can be measured against its success in achieving redistribution.
More generally, it is possible to determine the limit to which redistribution can be
undertaken and to inquire whether taxation can achieve this limit.
The prime obstacle to redistribution is its deleterious effect on the incentive to create
wealth. A greater incentive to create and accumulate wealth could be linked with a
greater inequality of income. The cause of inequality can take either of two forms.
First, inequality can follow simply from luck. Some people are born with higher innate
talent than others—such talents are assigned as the outcome of the “genetic lottery.” In
addition, among those who start equal, fortune favors the endeavors of some more than
others. Many people may think it perfectly legitimate to tax away the economic beneﬁts
that arise from luck as a source of inequality. But the ability of the government to do so
depends on the possibility of it observing the innate talents and inducing their owner to
bring them to full fruition despite the knowledge that the resulting income will be taxed
away. For example, even if born with the talent to become a concert pianist, a person
might only choose to endure the hours of necessary practice if he can foresee future
beneﬁts from doing so. The second cause of inequality is the effort that is applied to
gain wealth, given the level of ability. Some people choose to work harder than others,
and allowing them to keep the fruits of their own effort seems legitimate. Put another
way, there can be little justiﬁcation for redistributing from those whose incomes are
high because of their efforts to those whose incomes are low solely because they choose
to supply little effort.
If the government could determine what part of inequality was due to differences
in effort and what part due to luck, these differences would present no problems for
redistribution. In such circumstances the tax system could be ﬁnely adjusted to elicit the
correct effort level from all consumers by imposing a harsh punishment for realizing
an income that is too low. In practice, effort is not observable and people can pretend
to work when they do not. A high income may result from hard work or be due to
chance (better natural talent), but without detailed information, the government cannot
infer which. Redressing inequality with respect to one dimension but not the other then
becomes a difﬁcult task. Higher innate talent must be judged, faute de mieux, indirectly
by income that depends on effort. Taxing income is then a blunt tool for attacking the
symptom but not the cause. There is as a result a conﬂict between the redistributive and
the incentive effects of the tax system that determines the scope for redistribution. The
resolution of this trade-off was the basis of the analysis of optimal income taxation in
chapter 16 and the requirement that a tax system has to be incentive-compatible.
The purpose of this chapter is to describe how incentive-compatibility, which is the
requirement that the allocation mechanism must be consistent with the incentives for

609
Chapter 18: Limits to Redistribution
the truthful revelation of information, places limits upon the ability of the government
to undertake redistribution. The fact that an optimal allocation mechanism will be
consistent with truth-telling is called the revelation principle. We will then explain why
taxation is typically the best mechanism, from among the set of incentive-compatible
mechanisms, for achieving redistribution. This conclusion is termed the tax principle.
This result is interesting given that the notion of taxing income directly was for a long
time rejected on the grounds that the collection of the necessary information would be
costly and constitute a risk of invasion of privacy. The United Kingdom did not adopt a
permanent income tax until the 1870s and the US Congress established the same form
of taxation in the 1890s. Even today, the use of income taxation is not widespread and
has a negligible role in many developing countries. While income tax is an important
instrument of redistribution, there are additional instruments that can be used. Among
them are commodity taxes tilted toward the poor. We will then describe under what
circumstances differential commodity taxation can usefully supplement the income tax
and expand the possibilities for redistribution. This is the issue of the tax mix.
18.2
Revelation Principle
Any economic system is essentially a general allocation mechanism that determines
the economic allocation for each possible economic environment. The economic allo-
cation includes the bundle of commodities that each consumer receives, the production
activities that are undertaken in the economy, and the public goods that are provided.
The economic environment is a speciﬁcation of each person’s exogenous characteristics
(their endowments, needs, tastes, talents, etc.) as well as the production possibilities.
The competitive economy is one form of allocation mechanism. In chapter 2 the
competitive economy was described by the preferences and endowments of consumers
and the ﬁrms’production technologies; this was the economic environment. Given this
information, resources were allocated via the competitive trading mechanism: taking
prices as given, each consumer chose demand to maximize utility, and each ﬁrm chose
output to maximize proﬁt. Prices were adjusted until supply and demand were equal,
and then trading took place to allocate commodities. We have also discussed some
alternative allocation mechanisms; two examples were the personalized pricing model
and the Clarke–Groves mechanism in chapter 6.
These allocation mechanisms have been judged by their success in allocating re-
sources. The First Theorem of Welfare Economics says that the competitive economy
is a successful allocation mechanism because it leads (under certain conditions) to a

610
Part VI: Taxation
Pareto-efﬁcient allocation. We have also seen the circumstances under which the com-
petitive economy fails to achieve efﬁciency, so government intervention can achieve
a Pareto improvement. But this is not the end of the story, since an allocation can be
efﬁcient and at the same time extremely unfair. The competitive economy is indeed
blind to injustice, and the allocation achieved by the mechanism can involve extreme
manifestations of inequity in the form of poverty and starvation.
In response to this problem, the Second Theorem of Welfare Economics says that
(under certain conditions) any Pareto-efﬁcient allocation can be reached through com-
petitive trading by means of lump-sum redistribution. Lump-sum redistribution does
not interfere with the working of the competitive market because it is based on the
unalterable characteristics of the economic agents. The problem is that the personal
characteristics relevant for redistribution need not be publicly observable (tastes, tal-
ents, needs, abilities, etc.). Therefore redistribution has to be based on information that
people choose to reveal. These issues were introduced in chapter 13.
The basis of a mechanism is that the agents in the economy make a report of in-
formation. This report could, for example, be a statement of their preferences (e.g.,
the valuation reported in the Clarke–Groves mechanism) or of their demands (e.g., in
the competitive economy). Alternatively, it could take the form of a direct statement
of their characteristics. Given these announcements, the mechanism determines the
economic allocation. For the Clarke–Groves mechanism, the allocation is a choice
to provide the public good or not and a set of side payments. In the competitive
economy the allocation is determined by the market equilibrium given the announced
demands.
Adesirable economic allocation is deﬁned as an achievable allocation that maximizes
a social choice function. For example, a utilitarian social choice function will select the
allocation that maximizes the sum of utilities. The implementation problem is to design
the allocation mechanism so that it produces a desirable economic allocation, even
when agents attempt to manipulate it to their advantage. Manipulation means reporting
false characteristics in order to obtain an advantage—in chapter 6 such manipulation
arose in connection with the Lindahl equilibrium. The scope for manipulation arises
because some (or all) of the characteristics that are relevant for the proper allocation
of resources are not publicly observable.
To be more explicit, consider an economy populated by a set of agents I=
{1, . . . , i, . . . , n}.Eachagent, i, isdescribedbyθi, whichisalistofallthepersonalchar-
acteristics that are economically relevant. Let i be the set of possible characteristics
for agent i, so that θi has to be drawn from the alternatives in i.The corresponding pro-
ﬁle of characteristics for the set of agents in the economy is denoted θ = (θ1, . . . , θn).

611
Chapter 18: Limits to Redistribution
Finally let X be the set of economic allocations that are technically possible using the
economy’s resources.
Given the characteristics for the agents the optimal allocation, that which is best
according to the social choice functions is selected. The social choice function deter-
mines an allocation for every possible proﬁle of the agents’characteristics. Speciﬁcally,
if the proﬁle of characteristics is θ = (θ1, . . . , θn), the social choice function selects
the allocation x = f (θ). It must be the case that x is one of the allocations in X.
The central idea of mechanism design is the construction of an allocation mechanism
that implements the social choice function. That is, if the social choice function selects
the allocation x = f (θ), then given the characteristics θ, the mechanism will result
in the allocation x being achieved. It can be seen that this was exactly the process de-
scribed in chapter 2. The social welfare function selected the Pareto-efﬁcient allocation
that maximized welfare, and then competitive activity was combined with lump-sum
taxation to decentralize this allocation.
Amechanism is a strategy set for each agent and an outcome function that determines
the allocation given a choice of strategies for each agent. The strategy set of i is denoted
Si and describes the choices that are open to agent i. The collection of strategy sets for
the set of agents is (S1, . . . , Sn). Letting the chosen strategy of agent i be si, the out-
come function g (·) determines the allocation x = g (s1, . . . , sn). A mechanism, M, is
described by the strategy sets and the outcome function so that M = (S1, . . . , Sn, g(.)).
Each agent makes her choice of strategy to maximize her payoff. Often there will be
strategic interaction among the agents in the choice of strategies. The type of strategic
action involved will determine the appropriate equilibrium concept.
The mechanism M = (S1, . . . , Sn, g(.)) is said to implement the social choice func-
tion f (·) if there is an equilibrium strategy proﬁle (s∗
1, . . . , s∗
n) for the mechanism M
such that g(s∗
1, . . . , s∗
n) = x = f (θ1, . . . , θn). The strategy proﬁle is an equilibrium if
s∗
i is optimal for agent i given the strategy choices of the other agents. This deﬁnition
applies whether or not there is strategic interaction. These deﬁnitions are illustrated in
ﬁgure 18.1.
Among the very large set of possible mechanisms, there is a particularly interesting
set of mechanisms, called direct revelation mechanisms, in which each agent is asked to
reveal his characteristics directly (the characteristics can also be called the agent’s type).
Given the announcements of characteristics, the allocation is chosen according to the
social choice function f (·). More precisely, a direct revelation mechanism is a mecha-
nism in which the strategy set is Si = i for all i, so a strategy is an announcement of
characteristics, and g(θ1, . . . , θn) = x = f (θ1, . . . , θn) for all possible characteristics
(θ1, . . . , θn).

Mechanism design
As an example of the distinction between direct and indirect mechanisms, consider
the taxation of income. In the model of chapter 16 agents were distinguished by their
ability levels. A direct mechanism would involve each agent making an announcement
of his ability. In contrast, income taxation is an indirect mechanism in which the
announcement is an income level. Naturally, the income level is related to ability but
is not directly ability.
The reason for the interest in direct mechanisms is that any indirect mechanism
(where an announcement is made that need not be directly about characteristics) can
always be replaced with a direct mechanism that achieves the same outcome. This can
be easily demonstrated. Consider an indirect mechanism where the announcement of
i is μi and the outcome x = φ(μ1, . . . , μn). Since μi is chosen as the announcement
by i, there must be a relationship among their characteristics and the value chosen,
we write this relationship as μi = m(θi). But then the outcome of the indirect mech-
anism is x = φ(μ1, . . . , μn) = φ(m (θ1) , . . . , m (θn)), which ultimately depends on
the characteristics. A direct mechanism with f(θ1, . . . , θn) chosen to be identical to
φ(m (θ1) , . . . , m (θn)) will then provide precisely the same outcome. This is illus-
trated in ﬁgure 18.2. In brief, there is nothing an indirect mechanism can achieve that
can’t be achieved with a direct mechanism. Only direct mechanisms need therefore be
studied.

Direct and indirect mechanisms
The interesting issue here is whether mechanisms can be designed such that it is
optimal for the agents to announce their true characteristics. In this respect the social
choice function f (·) is truthfully implementable in dominant strategies (or incentive-
compatible) if the direct revelation mechanism M = (1, . . . , n, f (·)) has a domi-
nant strategy equilibrium (s∗
1, . . . , s∗
n) in which truth-telling is optimal, so that s∗
i = θi
for any value of θi in the set i. By a dominant strategy equilibrium, it is meant that
truth-telling is optimal for all agents regardless of what the other agents choose to do.
We are now almost in a position to state the fundamental result of this section but
one ﬁnal deﬁnition is necessary before this can be done. A truly feasible allocation is
deﬁned as one which is both technically feasible (given the endowments and technology
of the economy) and which is informationally feasible given that the characteristics on
which redistribution is based are not publicly observable. The following theorem is the
Revelation Principle that is key to analyzing allocation mechanisms.
Theorem 18.1
(Revelation principle Dasgupta, Hammond, and Maskin 1979 and
Myerson 1979)
The set of allocations that are truly feasible when agents’ charac-
teristics are not observable is the set of allocations that are incentive compatible (or
truthfully implementable in dominant strategies).

614
Part VI: Taxation
There are two aspects to this theorem. First, it tells us that there is nothing to be
gained by constructing mechanisms in which agents are deliberately led to reveal false
information. We can instead conﬁne attention to mechanisms in which the best strategy
is to tell the truth. Second, it reveals that we need to only study mechanisms where
the equilibrium is found in dominant strategies. There were several previous occasions
in the text where we analyzed the Nash equilibrium of games, and it may seem that
restricting attention to dominant strategies would reduce the set of allocations that could
be achieved. This is not true for the following simple reason: the mechanism must be
designed so that truth is the Nash equilibrium strategy for each agent whatever are
the characteristics of the other agents. Now consider agent i. Since truth is his Nash
equilibrium strategy for all possible characteristics of agents other than i, this implies
that it must be chosen in response to any announcement by the others (whether these
are truthful or not). Therefore, if it is always a Nash strategy, truth must be a dominant
strategy.
18.3
The Tax Principle
If optimal lump-sum taxes could be employed, the ﬁrst-best allocation would be
achieved. There is no allocation mechanism that can achieve more than this. How-
ever, optimal lump-sum taxes are not incentive-compatible, so they do not function
as an allocation mechanism. Other forms of taxation, such as income and commodity
taxation, are incentive-compatible but achieve only a second-best allocation. There is
therefore a gap between what the economy could achieve at the ﬁrst-best and what tax-
ation achieves at the second-best. This observation raises the question that this section
answers: Can we improve upon the allocation achieved with taxation? In other words,
is there any allocation mechanism that can locate the economy somewhere between the
second-best achieved by taxation and the ﬁrst-best?
The answer to this question is provided by the Taxation Principle. Loosely speaking,
the Taxation Principle says that we cannot improve upon taxation in the sense that
it is not possible to implement additional allocations by using a more complicated
mechanism. Taxation allocates goods to individuals with different characteristics by
designing the budget set to achieve the desired outcome. The appeal of taxation is that
it requires the government to possess only limited information: the government only
needs to know the aggregate distribution of characteristics in the population and not
the characteristics of any individual. Every individual faces the same tax system and
hence the same consumption opportunities, so that false revelation of characteristics

615
Chapter 18: Limits to Redistribution
does not change the budget set. Furthermore the point in the budget set chosen by an
individual is, by deﬁnition, the best that is available to him and there is no incentive to
cheat.
TheTaxation Principle determines what allocations can be reached under information
and incentive constraints, namely all the allocations that can be implemented using a
suitable tax system. Since this principle is the fundamental justiﬁcation for employing
taxation, it is important to state it precisely. To do this, we need some preliminary
deﬁnitions.
Following Hammond (1979), an allocation mechanism is admissible whenever it is
both individually and collectively physically feasible. It is anonymous if the allocation
that results from the permutation of the characteristics of two individuals is just the
permutationoftheoriginalallocation(i.e., theallocationmechanismdoesnotdependon
the name of the agent). An anonymous allocation mechanism makes each individual’s
allocation a function only of his own announcement and the announcements of all other
players. A mechanism is straightforward whenever it implements a given allocation in
dominant truth-telling strategies. A dominant strategy is a strategy that an individual,
given his information, is willing to play regardless of what he believes others know
and the way he believes others behave. The Tax Principle can now be stated.
Theorem 18.2 (Tax principle Guesnerie 1995 and Hammond 1979)
In a large econ-
omy, an allocation is implementable by an admissible tax mechanism if and only if it
is implementable by an admissible straightforward allocation mechanism.
The intuition behind this result is quite simple. The ﬁrst step is to show that if an
allocation is implementable by taxation, then it can be implemented by an admissible
straightforward allocation mechanism. The justiﬁcation for this result is that a tax
system is an indirect mechanism that has a dominant strategy solution consisting of
the announcements of each individual’s trades. In fact a tax schedule confronts each
individual with the same budget set so that the bundle allocated to them depends only
on their strategy. Thus, by appealing to the Revelation Principle, there exists a direct
mechanism (for individuals to announce their characteristics) that is equivalent to the
(indirect) tax mechanism.
The second step requires the demonstration that any allocation that is implementable
by a straightforward allocation mechanism is implementable by taxation. Since the allo-
cation must be incentive-compatible, each individual must ﬁnd the consumption bundle
allocated to that individual at least as good as that allocated to any other individual (if
they did not, they would make a false statement of characteristics in order to secure the

616
Part VI: Taxation
alternative). Abudget set can then be constructed that contains the consumption bundle
allocated to each of the individuals but excludes any preferable bundles. This budget
set implicitly deﬁnes a tax system. Faced with this budget set, the individuals will al-
ways choose the consumption bundle allocated by the mechanism. Taxation therefore
achieves the same outcome as the alternative allocation mechanism. Hence tax sys-
tems yield, in general, the best allocations that can be achieved in a private information
world! The only truly feasible allocations are those that can be decentralized by some
nonlinear income and commodity taxes (with everybody facing the same nonlinear tax
schedule).
We now illustrate this Taxation Principle in our economy composed of two ability
types (θl < θh) and two goods (x and ℓ). This example allows us to clarify the extent
to which incentive considerations limit redistribution. We assume, for simplicity, an
equal number of individuals of both ability types. Also we assume that the government
observes only income z = θℓand consumption x. From the preferences over consump-
tion and labor can be derived corresponding preferences over consumption and income
given by
U(x, ℓ) = U

x, z
θ

.
(This construction was explored in detail in chapter 16.) The indifference curves of
both types are depicted in ﬁgure 18.3 in income/consumption space. They satisfy the
single-crossing assumption in the sense that the high-ability individuals have a ﬂatter
indifference curve than the low-ability individuals through any point. This is because
the high-ability type needs to undertake less work to earn any given income. Utility
is increasing when moving in the north–west direction. With no redistribution, both
types choose an income-consumption bundle on the 45 degree line tangent to their
indifference curve; these are denoted


l , zn


and

. Each type strictly prefers
her own bundle.
We now consider the scope for redistribution when only income and consumption
are observable. The impossibility of observing ability opens up the possibility that the
high-ability individuals will, if redistribution is pushed too far, choose the allocation
intended for the low-ability individuals. If this happens the high-ability individuals are
said to mimic the low-ability. To avoid this happening, the allocations are restricted to be
incentive-compatible. In this case incentive-compatibility means that the allocations of
income and consumption should be such that the high-ability individuals do not prefer
the bundle intended for the low-ability. This implies that the allocation for the low-
ability type, {xl, zl}, must lie on or below the indifference curve through the allocation

It can be seen immediately that this incentive constraint rules out complete equal-

Therefore any incentive allocation must give the high-ability greater utility than the
low-ability, so the equality of utility is not feasible when abilities are not observable.
This conclusion conﬁrms that the existence of private information places a limit on
potential redistribution.
But then what exactly will be the maximum redistribution and the form of the op-
timal redistribution scheme? To answer this we analyze the problem of choosing the

for the high-ability type that
maximize the utility of the low-ability type subject to the constraints that the allocation
is feasible (meaning total income is equal to total consumption) and that the high-ability
will not choose to pretend to be low-ability. The solution is displayed in ﬁgure 18.4.
The optimal allocation is characterized by the fact that the incentive constraint is
binding: the high-ability individuals are just indifferent between their own bundle and
the bundle of the low-ability. This means that the allocations

lie on the same indifference curve for the high-ability type. With an equal number of
each type, feasibility requires that the amount taken off each high-ability individual be
equal to the amount given to each low-ability individual. In the ﬁgure, redistribution
away from the high-ability means that the allocation must lie below the 45 degree line,
with the vertical distance from the allocation to the 45◦line measuring the quantity
of their output redistributed to the low-ability. Correspondingly, the allocation of the
low-ability must be that same distance above the 45 degree line. The amount taken
from the high-ability type is maximized along a given indifference curve when the
indifference curve is parallel to the 45 degree line. Thus the allocation

According to the Tax Principle, this optimal allocation is decentralizable by a nonlin-

mal allocations but must not go above either the indifference curve I ∗

satisﬁes these conditions, it will ensure that the optimal allocations are in the budget
set but that preferred alternatives are excluded. Provided that the consumption function

, this can be achieved. The nonlinear tax function constructed in
this way ensures the decentralization.
In the absence of taxation, income would be equal to consumption and this is depicted
by the 45 degree line. Where the consumption function lies above the 45 degree line, the
tax payment is negative. It is positive where the consumption function is below the line.
It is clear from the ﬁgure 18.5 that both ability types face the same tax function and will
be induced to choose exactly the bundle designated for them. In addition the construc-
tion ensures that the gradient of the indifference curve of the high-ability individual
is equal to 1. Referring back to chapter 16, this implies that high-ability individuals
face a marginal income tax rate of 0 percent so that their income/consumption choice is
not distorted at the margin. This was exactly the result we derived for income taxation
using a different argument. However, because the bundle designated for the low-ability
must lie on the indifference curve of the high-ability, the choice of the low-ability type
has to be distorted in order to relax the incentive-compatibility constraint. This is easily
seen from the fact that such distortion shifts the bundle of the low-ability further away
from the bundle of the high-ability and thereby reduces the incentive of the high-ability
to mimic the low-ability.
It has been shown how the allocation arising from any admissible straightforward
allocation mechanism can be decentralized by means of a nonlinear tax schedule. More
important, a nonlinear tax schedule can attain the maximum redistribution that is possi-
ble given the limitations on information. There are no further redistributive instruments

620
Part VI: Taxation
that can expand the possibilities of redistribution. Therefore, having analyzed taxation
in earlier chapters, we have exhausted the possibilities for achieving redistribution.
18.4
Tax Mix: Separation Principle
What are the relative merits of taxing (total) income and taxing consumption? Histor-
ically the debate over the appropriate base for annual taxation and redistribution was
based on the deﬁnition of the best taxable capacity with two opposite approaches. The
Haig–Simons approach claims that total income, deﬁned as labor income plus accrued
income from capital, is the best measure of capacity to pay and so should serve as the
tax base. Conversely, the Kaldor approach claims that annual consumption is the best
measure of capacity to pay and so should serve as the tax base. The latter approach
was further supported by the moral argument that it is better to tax what people take
out of the economy (consumption) rather than what people put into the economy (labor
supply generating income). The literature has evolved away from this distinction to
assess the merits of different taxes on the sole basis of their impact on the equilibrium
outcome and the welfare properties of this equilibrium outcome.
To be sure, tax systems must be based on observable variables. In practice, govern-
ments use income and consumption as the basis of taxation, even if they are imperfect
measures of individual earning ability. It is important to observe that the distinction
between the taxation of consumption and income is diminished when viewed from
a lifetime perspective. This is because current savings are future consumption, and
thus, as consumption must equal income over the life cycle, a tax on the value of con-
sumption is equivalent to a tax on income. This can be seen from a simple two-period
life-cycle model. Labor income in the ﬁrst period is allocated between consumption and
saving:
z1 = x1 + s1.
(18.2)
Consumption in the second-period is ﬁnanced by labor income and the value of saving
with accumulated interest:
z2 + (1 + r)s1 = x2.
(18.3)
Eliminating saving between these budget constraints gives the lifetime budget con-
straint:
z1 +
z2
1 + r = x1 +
x2
1 + r .
(18.4)

621
Chapter 18: Limits to Redistribution
This demonstrates that the value of lifetime income (left-hand side) is equal to the
value of lifetime consumption (right-hand side). From this perspective, it does not
matter whether taxes are levied on income or on the value of consumption.
Further insight can be obtained by directly comparing an income tax and a consump-
tion tax. Let the tax rate on labor income be tℓand the tax rate on interest (capital
income) be tc. The budget constraints in the two-period model with this income tax
system are
(1 −tℓ) z1 = x1 + s1,
(18.5)
(1 −tℓ) z2 + (1 + (1 −tc) r)s1 = x2.
(18.6)
Combining these budget constraints over the life cycle obtains
(1 −tℓ) z1 +
(1 −tℓ) z2
1 + (1 −tc) r = x1 +
x2
1 + (1 −tc) r .
(18.7)
The lifetime budget constraint in (18.7) shows why an income tax distorts the intertem-
poral consumption decision. With taxation the price of period 1 consumption relative
to period 2 consumption is 1+r. With the income tax the relative price is 1+(1 −tc) r,
so, if tc > 0, the relative price of period 1 consumption is reduced. This is why it is
often said that an income tax provides a disincentive to save, but whether saving in fact
falls will depend on the resolution of income and substitution effects. Now consider a
consumption tax at rate τ. The two budget constraints are
z1 = (1 + τ) x1 + s1,
(18.8)
z2 + (1 + r) s1 = (1 + τ) x2,
(18.9)
which combine to the life-cyle budget constraint
z1 +
z2
1 + r = (1 + τ) x1 + (1 + τ) x2
1 + r
.
(18.10)
As can be seen from (18.10), the consumption tax does not affect the relative price
of consumption, so it creates no distortion in the intertemporal consumption decision.
The key point we wish to make is that the income tax is distortionary only if the tax
on interest income is positive. There is no reason why this must be so, and many tax
systems allow for tax-free saving vehicles. Now set tc = 0. It can be directly observed
from (18.7) and (18.10) that if the labor income tax and the consumption tax satisfy
1 −tℓ=
1
(1 + τ),

then the two lifetime budget constraints are identical. This argument demonstrates an
important equivalence result: an income tax with exemption for interest on savings is
equivalent to a consumption tax. The result is important because it shows that the issue
at the heart of debate over the choice of tax base is not really about taxing income or
consumption but instead is about the tax treatment of interest income (or capital income
more generally). Many of the arguments about the choice of tax base obscure this basic
point.
In the simple models we have used so far in this chapter, we have assumed that there
is a single consumption good. When there are two or more consumption goods, the
commodity taxes levied on them need not be uniform. As we showed in chapter 15, the
Ramsey rule says that, when there is no income tax the tax on each commodity should
be inversely related to the elasticity of demand. We now consider how this conclusion
can be modiﬁed when income and commodity taxes can be simultaneously employed.
The central question is whether commodity taxes should be differentiated when
combined with a nonlinear income tax. If they are not, a uniform commodity tax can be
easilyreplicatedbytheincometax(providedthereisanadequatedeductionforsavings).
There is a sense in which differentiated commodity taxation can usefully supplement
income taxation by reducing the distortion in the labor/consumption choice induced by
income tax. If we tax commodities that are substitutes for work and subsidize those that
are complements, we can encourage people to work more and thus reduce the work-
discouraging effect of the income tax. The optimal differentiation depends on how the
preferences for the goods vary with labor supply. Turning this argument around, if the
preference between commodities does not vary with labor supply, then there seems to
be no argument for differential commodity taxes.
Preferences over commodities are independent of labor supply if the utility function
is separable. What separable means is that utility can be written as U= U (u(x), ℓ),
so that the marginal rate of substitution between any pair of goods depends only on
the subutility u(x) and is independent of the labor supply. We now demonstrate that if
labor and goods are separable in utility, then there is no need to supplement an optimal
nonlinear income tax with differential commodity taxation.
The result that commodity taxation is not needed with separability between labor
and goods is easily demonstrated in the two-ability model we have been using in
this chapter. We now interpret xi as a vector describing the consumption levels of
n goods, xi =

, when the high-ability
mimic the low-ability. With separable preferences, such a difference does not affect the
indifference curves between commodities (since u(x∗
l ) is the same for both types), so
we cannot use differential taxation to separate the types (i.e., to make the consumption
bundle of the low-ability individual less attractive to high-ability individual). The fact
that differential taxes do not help in relaxing the incentive constraint renders their use
unnecessary.
With a nonseparable utility function, U(x, ℓ), the indifference curves between com-
modities differ, and we can tax more heavily the good that the high-ability person values
more in the low-ability consumption bundle. This reduces the incentive for the high-
ability to mimic the low-ability. Figure 18.6 illustrates how differential commodity
taxation (changing prices from p to p′) can be used to make the consumption bundle of
the low-ability type less attractive for the high-ability type. The change in prices from
the budget constraint labeled p to the budget constraint labeled p′ does not affect the
utility of the low-ability (the budget constraint pivots around their indifference curve
Il), but it causes a reduction in utility of the high-ability (shown by the new budget

constraint changing the location of the choice from initial indifference curve I 1
h to the
lower indifference curve I 2
h). This reduction in utility for the high-ability type relaxes
the incentive constraint.
Finally, there is a compliance argument for using commodity taxes over income
taxes. The indirect consumption taxes are a more effective method of collecting taxes
from individuals who do not (fully) report income or pay tax under the income tax. The
reason is that those who do not report their income pay no income tax, but eventually
will pay consumption taxes on their purchases.
18.5
Capital Income Tax
A capital income tax is a tax on the return to savings. It results in future consumption
being taxed more heavily than current consumption. Thus the merits of capital income
tax boil down to determining if it is optimal to tax consumption in different periods at
different rates.
The separation principle of the previous section can be used to answer this question. If
one interprets the different consumption goods as consumption in different periods, then
the separation result can be interpreted as recommending exclusively a progressive tax
on labor income or, assuming no initial assets and interpersonal transfers, a progressive
tax on lifetime consumption. Even if the separability condition is not satisﬁed, it does
not necessarily follow that future consumption should be more heavily taxed than
current consumption, as would be the case with a capital income tax. In fact a capital
income subsidy (negative tax) to encourage saving could well be the optimal policy
instrument.
The most striking result in the literature on capital income taxation is that with an
inﬁnite horizon (no end period to the economy) and a labor income tax, the capital
income tax should converge to zero in the long run. We demonstrate this result in
chapter 24. The result is quite general and the intuition also very simple. As already
noted, taxing capital income is, in effect, taxing future consumption more heavily than
current consumption. A positive capital income tax in every year imposes a very high
effective tax rate on consumption in the long run, say 20 or 30 years into the future. It is
implausible that in the very long run we would want to continue to tax capital income as
it would imply that we should tax consumption more and more heavily as we move into
later, and later, periods. Thus, no matter what the individual preferences are, the capital
income tax will have to converge to zero in the long run. This ﬁnding has led some
economists to favor taxing labor income but not capital income, or taxing consumption

625
Chapter 18: Limits to Redistribution
by taxing labor income minus net savings. However, the conditions required for the
result are too restrictive to provide a basis for abandoning the capital income tax.
The static separability principle with multiple persons was derived on the basis
that each household has just one form of labor supply (leaving aside that there are
different labor supplies and different labor incomes in different periods of life). Even
if consumption were separable from leisure at any given point in time, there is no
presumption that consumption and leisure are separable at different points in time. So
one might, for example, believe that some age-related labor income tax schedule would
make sense. But, more fundamentally, the static separability principle ignores the fact
that we observe labor and consumption decisions early in life before those later in life.
Thus we might choose to adopt a tax schedule in future periods that is conditioned on
current decisions. Alternatively, a government may have an incentive to announce that
there is to be no capital income tax and then deviate from the announcement later on
in order to tax capital income once it has been accumulated.
In a dynamic setting with a population that has differing earnings abilities, a capital
income tax can improve redistributive possibilities. The logic is that the existence of
capital income reduces the possibility of redistributing through the labor income tax
because those of high ability have greater incentive to earn less in response to redis-
tributive taxation in the presence of additional capital income. Taxing capital income
weakens the incentive to earn less, and so relaxes the incentive compatibility constraint
and expands the scope for redistribution.
Even if capital income taxes distort consumption choices over time, there are some
good redistributve motives for including them in the tax base. Nevertheless, it is not
possible to use the theory to claim that both labor and capital income should be taxed
equally. There are practical arguments why this might be beneﬁcial, such as the preven-
tion of tax avoidance through the transformation of labor income into capital income,
but no theoretical demonstration conﬁrms that this is optimal. So, returning to the
historical Haig–Simons claim, there is no reason why the tax base should be total in-
come deﬁned as the sum of labor income and capital income. In the United States, the
marginal tax rates on capital and labor income are related to each other, but in Europe,
the Nordic countries have provided a lead with a dual income tax where there is a
progressive income tax on labor and a uniform tax rate on capital income. Also deduc-
tions from labor income for pension saving is a widespread practice used to encourage
people to save more for their retirement. In chapter 3 we reviewed the many reasons
for people to make the “wrong” savings choice.

626

18.6
Non–Tax Redistribution
The principal implication of the previous analysis, as reﬂected in the tax principle, is that
society cannot improve redistributive possibilities by using nonﬁscal instruments. The
question is then why nonﬁscal forms of redistribution are so widely used. Governments
frequently provide goods such as education or health services at less than their costs,
which may be viewed as redistributional policies. One may expect that a cash transfer
of the same value would have more redistributional power than such in-kind transfer
programs. This is mistaken. There are three reasons why such transfers in-kind may be
superior to cash transfers as achieved through standard tax-transfer programs.
One reason is political. Rather than voting for a tax-transfer scheme that beneﬁts the
poor, I might impose my own preferences and vote for providing certain services such
as education, even though the recipient would have preferred another use. Voters may
support redistributional policies if they are in-kind but not if in cash with use at the
discretion of the recipient. Political considerations may dictate that many government
provision programs like education, pensions, and basic health insurance ought to be
universal. Without universality the programs would not have the political support re-
quired to be adopted or continued. For instance, public pensions and health care would
be far more vulnerable politically if they were targeted to the poor and not available
to others. It should be noted that it does not follow that if a government program is
universal, then there is no redistribution. First, if the program is ﬁnanced by propor-
tional income taxation, the rich will contribute more than the poor to its cost. Second,
even if everyone contributes the same amount to the program, it is possible that the
rich will not make use of the publicly provided good. To take an example, consider the
public provision of basic health care made available to everyone for free and ﬁnanced
by a uniform tax on all households. There exists a private health care alternative with
higher quality but at some cost. Since the rich can afford better quality health care, they
will choose to use private health care even though free public health care is available.
These rich households still pay their contribution to the public program, and thus the
poor households derive a net beneﬁt from this cross-subsidization.
Provision in-kind can also be justiﬁed by a self-selection argument. We have shown
that what ultimately sets the limit to redistribution is the possibility of it becoming
advantageous for higher ability people to earn lower incomes by expending less effort
and thereby paying taxes (or receiving transfers) intended for the lower ability people.
The limit to redistribution is reached when a person of a given ability would be just as
well off earning the income of someone with lesser ability. The self-selection argument

627
Chapter 18: Limits to Redistribution
is that anything that makes it less attractive for people to mimic those with lesser ability
will extend the limit to redistribution.As seen in the previous section, if the government
could supplement a nonlinear income tax with differential commodity taxes, it will do
so in certain cases (i.e., if the shares of income devoted to the consumption of each
good are not independent of the amount of leisure).
The use of in-kind transfers to supplement standard taxation can be optimal. This is
an efﬁciency-based argument. Basically a given degree of redistribution can be more
efﬁciently achieved by using in-kind transfers as a supplement to income taxes. The
argument, unlike the separability argument just used for differential commodity taxes,
relies on differences in preferences among different income groups. Consider two
individuals who differ not only in their ability but also in their health status. Suppose
that lower ability also means poorer health, so that the less able also spend more on
health. Then both income and health expenditures act as a signal of ability. It follows
that the limits to redistribution can be relaxed if transfers are made partly in the form of
provision of health care (or, equivalently, by full subsidization of health expenditures).
The reason is simply that the more able individuals (with less tendency to become ill)
are less likely to claim in-kind beneﬁts in the form of health care provision, than they
would be to claim cash beneﬁts. To take another example, suppose that the government
is considering redistributing either in cash or in the form of low-income housing. All
households, needy or otherwise, would prefer the cash transfer. However, few non-
needy households would want to live in low-income housing since they can afford better
housing. Thus self-selection arises through which the non-needy drop out of the housing
program and only the needy choose to take it up. In short, transfers in-kind invite people
to self-select in a way that reveals their neediness. When need is correlated to income-
earning ability, the in-kind transfers can relax incentive compatibility and selection
constraints, thereby improving the government’s ability to redistribute income.
Aﬁnal justiﬁcation for transfers in-kind is time consistency. In this case the argument
relies on the inability of a government to commit to its future actions. This is different
from the earliest Strotz (1956) argument for government time inconsistency as it does
not arise from a change in the government’s objective over time (e.g., because of
elections) nor from the fact that the government is not welfaristic or rational. The time
consistency problem arises from a perfectly rational government that fully respects
individual preferences but does not have the power to commit to its policy in the long
run. The time-consistency problem is obvious with pensions. If households expect
the government to provide a basic pension to those with too little savings, then their
incentive to save for retirement consumption and provide for themselves is reduced.
Anticipating this fact, the government may prefer to provide public pensions instead.

628
Part VI: Taxation
Arelated time consistency problem can explain why transfer programs, such as social
security, education, and job training are provided in-kind. If a welfaristic government
cannot commit not to come to the rescue of those in need in the future, potential recip-
ients will have little reason to invest in education or to undertake job training because,
if they do not, the government will help them out anyway. Again, the government
can improve both economic efﬁciency and redistribution by making education and job
training available at less than their cost, rather than making cash transfers of equivalent
value.
18.7
Conclusions
We addressed in this chapter the important question of what limits the extent of redistri-
bution in a society. We began with the very general concept of selecting the allocation
mechanism that achieved the best possible outcome given the constraint that some
relevant individual characteristics are private information. This information restriction
requires that the characteristics be reported, either directly or indirectly, as part of the
allocation mechanism. The competitive economy with taxation is just one example of
such a mechanism. Then we explored whether there are any better mechanisms.
When there are no informational problems, lump-sum transfers combined with com-
petitive economic activity can take the economy to the ﬁrst-best outcome. No allocation
mechanism can perform better than this. When there is private information, the situ-
ation is considerably changed: optimal lump-sum taxes are not incentive-compatible.
All other forms of taxation (income taxes, commodity taxes etc.) are distortionary and
so only allow the attainment of allocations that are strictly worse than the ﬁrst-best.
These observations raise the possibility that there may be allocation mechanisms that
can achieve outcomes that are strictly better than those arising from distortionary tax-
ation. Perhaps surprisingly, the Tax Principle shows this is not the case. The taxation
of observable variables is as good as any other allocation mechanism.
These are very general and very powerful results. What they do is offer a fresh per-
spective as to how successful is the competitive economy as an allocation mechanism.
When combined with intervention via taxation, there is no other allocation mecha-
nism that can better it. But it should always be recalled that the intervention has to be
well-intended and that politics can also shape the outcome and further constrain the
possibilities for redistribution. For example, with political determination of redistribu-
tion, increasing the number of the rich can actually leave the poor worse off: as the rich
become politically more inﬂuential, the extent of redistribution from each rich person

629
Chapter 18: Limits to Redistribution
may fall by so much as to more than offset the increase in the relative number of rich
redistributing to the poor.
The arguments developed in the chapter are also based on welfaristic objectives (i.e.,
social objectives that fully respect individual preferences). Recently there has been
growing emphasis on nonwelfaristic objectives that include equality of chance and
capability, fairness, poverty alleviation, and inequality. The real challenge is then not
just the value judgments associated with the different objectives but also that welfaristic
and nonwelfaristic objectives are typically in conﬂict. As the social choice theory has
convincingly shown, resolving the conﬂict involves a value judgment that ultimately
is left to the political process.

at Freakonomics with a chart showing that in 1980, one-percenters, on average, made 12.5
medians, but in 2006 (the latest year for which data are available) the average income of the
richest 1 percent was a whopping 36 medians. Ayres then makes the case for a “Brandeis

Fiscal Federalism
19.1
Introduction
Fiscal federalism is the division of revenue collection and expenditure responsibilities
among different levels of government. Most countries have a central (or federal) gov-
ernment, state or county governments, town councils, and, at the lowest level, parish
councils. Each level has restrictions on the tax instruments it can employ and the ex-
penditures that it can make. Together they constitute the multi-leveled and overlapping
administration that governs a typical developed country.
The central government can usually choose whatever tax instruments it pleases, and
although it has freedom in its expenditure, it usually focuses on national defense, the
provision of law and order, infrastructure, and transfer payments. The taxation powers
of state governments are more restricted. In the United Kingdom, local governments
can levy only property taxes; in the United States, both commodity and local income
taxes are allowed. Their responsibilities include education, local infrastructure, and the
provision of health care. Local governments provide services such as rubbish collection
and maintenance of parks. The responsibility for the police and ﬁre service can be at
either the state or local level. Levels of government are connected by overlapping
responsibilities and the transfer payments made among them.
The issue of ﬁscal federalism is not restricted to the design of government within
countries. Indeed the recent impetus for the advancement of this theory has been issues
involving the design of institutional structures for the European Union. The progress
made toward economic and monetary integration has begun to raise questions about
subsidiarity, which is the degree of independence that individual countries will maintain
in the setting of taxes. Such arguments just involve the application of ﬁscal federalism,
albeit at a larger scale.
These observations lead to a number of interesting economic questions. First, why
should there be more than one level of government? Using the logic of economic
reasoning, multi-level government can only be justiﬁed if it can achieve something that
a single level cannot. Explanations of what multi-level government can achieve must
revolve around access to information and how the information can be best utilized. If
this argument is accepted, and it is explored in detail below, then a second question
arises. How are the functions of government best allocated among the levels? A brief
sketch of how this allocation works in practice has already been given: Is this outcome
efﬁcient, or does it reﬂect some other factors?

multi-level government are then given. This is followed by a more detailed analysis of
some of the key issues, and the concept of an optimal structure is investigated. The is-
sue of accountability and decentralization is analyzed next. The essential elements of
interregional risk sharing are then presented, and the distinction between insurance
and redistribution is discussed. Empirical evidence is provided on the extent of de-
centralization by countries and functions, and the main determinants of the observed
decentralization.
19.2
Arguments for Multi-level Government
The economic arguments for having government are founded on the two principles
outlined in chapter 5. If there is market failure, the government can intervene in the
economy to increase efﬁciency. It can also intervene to improve equity, regardless of
whether the economy is efﬁcient. These arguments justify intervention; to justify multi-
level government, the case must be made that objectives of efﬁciency and equity are
better served by a combination of local and central government.
If the correct decisions are made about the level of public good provision and about
taxes, then it does not matter at which level of government they are taken. Provided that
there are no resources wasted in overlapping responsibilities, the number of levels of
governmentisamatterofindifference.Acaseformulti-levelgovernmentmusttherefore
be sought in differences in information and political process that allow some structures
to achieve better outcomes than others.
Decisions should be taken at a national level if they involve public goods that serve
the entire economy. The obvious example here would be defense, whose beneﬁts cannot
be assigned to any particular community within the economy. It is common to argue that
all citizens should have the same access to the law, have the same rights under the law,
and be subject to the same restrictions. An application of this equity argument supports
a legal system that is organized and administered from the center. Given the central
provision of these services, it is natural to support them through centrally organized
taxes.
Other public goods, namely the local public goods of chapter 7, beneﬁt only those
resident within a deﬁned geographic area. The level of supply of these goods could be
determined and ﬁnanced at the national level, but there are three arguments to suggest
a lower level decision is preferable.

637
Chapter 19: Fiscal Federalism
First, determination at the local level can take account of more precise information
available on local preferences. In this context, local ballots and knowledge of local
circumstances may help in reaching a more efﬁcient decision. Second, if a decision
were to be made at the national level, political pressures may prevent there being any
differentiation of provision among communities, whereas it might be efﬁcient to have
different levels of local public good provision in different areas. Finally the Tiebout
hypothesis investigated in chapter 7 argued that if consumers have heterogeneous pref-
erences, then efﬁciency requires numerous communities to form and offer different
levels of public good provision. This will not be possible if decisions are taken at a
national level.
If these arguments for determining and providing public goods at a local level are
accepted, then it follows almost inevitably that ﬁnancing should be determined at the
same level. To do otherwise, and to set a tax policy that is uniform across the economy,
would result in transfers among regions. Those regions choosing levels of public good
provision that are high relative to their tax base would not generate sufﬁcient tax revenue
to ﬁnance their provision, while those with relatively low levels would raise excessive
revenue. These deﬁcits and surpluses result in implicit transfers among regions. Such
transfers may not be efﬁcient, equitable, or politically acceptable.
Similar arguments can be repeated for the other roles of government such as the
control of externalities and some aspects of the reallocation of income. The provision
of services, even if they have the nature of private goods (e.g., garbage disposal), can be
subject to the same reasoning. This process suggests that different levels of government
should be constructed to ensure that decisions are made at the most appropriate level.
There is a limit, though, in that duplication of effort and wasted resources should be
avoided. The precise design of the structure of government then emerges from the trade-
off between increasing the number of levels to ensure that decisions are made at the
correct point and reaping the resource beneﬁts of having fewer levels.
The general observations made above can now be reﬁned into more detailed argu-
ments. We ﬁrst explore the costs of imposing uniformity and then consider positive ar-
guments for decentralization.
19.2.1
The Costs of Uniformity
Uniform provision of public goods and services by all jurisdictions will only ever
exactly meet the needs of the entire population when preferences are homogeneous.
When they are not, any form of uniform provision must be a compromise between

competing levels of demand. As such, it must involve some loss in welfare relative to
differentiated provision.
This argument can be illustrated by considering an economy where there are two
groups of consumers who have different tastes for the economy’s single public good.
The public good is ﬁnanced by a uniform income tax. Denote the two groups by A and
B, and assume that members of group B have a relatively stronger preference for the
public good than those of group A, taking into account the higher tax rate that this
implies. The utility levels of the two groups can then be graphed against the quantity of
public good provision as in ﬁgure 19.1. The preferred choices of public good provision
are denoted as GA and GB (with GA < GB). Now consider the choice of a uniform
level of provision, and let this level be G0. Assume that this level lies between GA and
GB (the argument easily extends to cases where it lies outside these limits). The loss of
welfaretosocietyisthengivenbyL = nA[uA(GA)−uA(G0)]+nB[uB(GB)−uB(G0)]
compared to what would be achieved if each group could be supplied with its preferred
quantity.
The value of the loss can be minimized by setting the location of G0 so that the

the more members there are of each group.

639
Chapter 19: Fiscal Federalism
This analysis shows how uniformity can be costly in terms of forgone welfare. A
policy of uniformity can then only be supported if the costs of differentiation exceed
the beneﬁt. Such costs could arise in the collection of information to determine the dif-
ferentiation and in the administration costs of a differentiated system. These arguments
will be explored further below. The next section considers, however, the limit of the
beneﬁts that can arise from differentiation.
19.2.2
The Tiebout Hypothesis
Although the costs of uniformity as illustrated above are indisputable, it is another step
to show that decentralization is justiﬁed. The route to doing this is to exploit the Tiebout
hypothesis that was analyzed in section 7.6 in connection with the theory of local public
goods. The exact same arguments are applicable here. Each community can be treated
as an independent provider of local public goods. If the consumers in the economy have
heterogeneous tastes, then there will be clear advantages to jurisdictions having differ-
ent levels of provision. Each can design what it offers (its tax rates, level of provision,
and type of provision) to appeal to particular groups within society. By choosing the
jurisdiction in which to live (i.e., by voting with their feet), the consumers reveal their
tastes for public goods. In the absence of transactions costs, or other impediments to
freedom of movement, an efﬁcient equilibrium must ensue.
The limits to this argument explored in the context of local public goods are also ap-
plicable here. Transactions costs are relevant in practice, and the problem of optimally
dividing a ﬁnite population into a limited number of jurisdictions will arise. The fact
that the ﬁrst-best allocation will not be achieved does not necessarily undermine the
preference-matching argument for decentralization. There are clearly still beneﬁts to
decentralization, even when this cannot be taken to the level required by the Tiebout
hypothesis. Starting from a uniform level of services that is too little for some con-
sumers and too much for others, a move away from this uniform level by some
jurisdictions must beneﬁt some of the consumers. This way even restricted decentral-
ization can be increasing in efﬁciency. This argument can be easily understood from
ﬁgure 19.1.
The Tiebout hypothesis shows the beneﬁts achievable by decentralization. Although
these are not fully realizable, a limited version of the same argument suggests that even
restricted decentralization will improve on uniform provision.

640
Part VII: Multiple Jurisdictions
19.2.3
Distributive Arguments
The regions that constitute any economy are endowed with different stocks of resources.
Some may be rich in natural resources, such as oil and coal, and others may have a well-
educated workforce with high levels of human capital. Such differences in endowments
will be reﬂected in disparities in living standards among regions.
The ability to differentiate public good provision among the regions then allows more
accurate targeting of resources to where they are required. This is an equity argument
for not having uniform provision. Decentralized decision-making allows each region
to communicate its needs to the center and permits the center to make differential allo-
cations to the regions.
This process will be designed to offset the differences in living standards caused by
endowments. Typically there will be no compensation for differences in preference for
public good provision such as giving more to a region wishing to spend more on public
goods. This form of redistribution among regions is called an equalization formula and
will be explored in chapter 20 when discussing intergovernmental grants.
19.3
Optimal Structure: Efﬁciency versus Stability
The previous arguments have explored a number of advantages of ﬁscal decentrali-
zation. These have involved both efﬁciency and equity aspects. The issue that remains
is what is the optimal structure or the correct number of levels of administration. The
difﬁculty that arises here is that the optimal division may differ from one public good
to another. The examples in the introduction have discussed how ﬁre services are
organized at a very local level, education at a higher level, and defense at an even
higher one. There are many other public goods provided by the federal government. If
each were to be allocated at the correct level of decentralization, this would imply an
equally large number of levels of government.
Each level of government brings with it additional costs. These involve all the factors
that are necessary to provide administration. Buildings, staff, and equipment will all be
required, as will elections to choose politicians. The politicians will also require com-
pensation for the time devoted to political activity. These costs are replicated each time
an additional level of government is introduced.
Consequently introducing further levels of government is not costless. The choice of
the optimal degree of decentralization must take these costs into account and balance
them against the beneﬁts. From such a process will emerge the optimal structure. This

641
Chapter 19: Fiscal Federalism
will depend on the relative sizes of costs and beneﬁts but is most likely to result in a
level of decentralization such that some decisions are taken at a higher level than would
be best if decentralization were costless.
This argument is now illustrated in a simple spatial model that trades off scale econo-
mies against diversity of preference. The point of departure is that centralized decision-
making produces a “one-size-ﬁts-all” outcome that does not reﬂect the heterogeneity of
tastes. Theuniformprovisionfollowsfrompoliticaleconomyconsiderationspreventing
centralized majority voting from allocating different levels of public goods to different
districts. It is only by decentralizing the majority voting at the district level that it is
possible to differentiate public good provision, but at some cost of duplication.
Suppose that there is one public good that can be provided either at the federal level or
at the regional level. We model the federation as the line segment [0, 1], with points on
the line representing different geographical locations. The public good can be located
anywhere along the line, and individuals are characterized by their ideal location for
the public good. With central provision the public good is located at 1
2, the midpoint
of the line segment. The farther away from this point individuals are located, the less
they like the public good provided at the federal level. This is shown in ﬁgure 19.2.
Alternatively, provision can be decentralized. Each region is then represented by an
interval on the line segment. Region L is the left-interval left [0, 1
2] and region R the
right-interval left [ 1
2, 1]. Individuals are assumed to be uniformly distributed, so both
regions are of equal size. With decentralized provision the public good is located at the
midpoint of each interval, that is, 1
4 in the left-region and 3
4 in the right-region. There is
a ﬁxed cost C (per capita) of providing the public good at the central level, and due to
duplication the cost is 2C with decentralized provision (i.e., the number of individuals
across whom the cost of public good provision is spread is reduced by one-half).

The rate at which utility decreases with the distance is given by the parameter α.
We can deﬁne when decentralization is socially optimal by considering the trade-
off between duplicating the cost of public good provision against taking provision
closer to individual preferences. The socially optimal solution maximizes the sum of
all individual utilities. Since individual utilities differ only in the distance to the public
good location (because of the equal cost sharing), the sum of utilities will depend on
the average distance. Under the centralized provision the average distance from 1
2 is,
due to the uniform distribution, just equal to 1
4. Note that this distance is actually
minimized by locating the public good at the midpoint 1
2. Decentralization brings the
average distance in either region down to 1
8. This positive effect of decentralization has
to be balanced against the extra cost C of providing the public good twice. Therefore
decentralization is the optimal solution if and only if the extra cost C is less than the
advantage of reducing the average distance by 1

These arguments show that the optimal amount of decentralization will be achieved
when the beneﬁts from further decentralization, in terms of matching the diversity of
tastes, outweigh the cost of differentiating the public good provision. In practice, the
extent of decentralization is determined through the political process. Using this basic
model, we can now illustrate the tendency for majority voting to lead to excessive
decentralization.
In order to look at the incentive for decentralization under majority voting, we assume
that decentralized provision prevails when a majority of voters are favorable in at least
one region. This assumption is innocuous given the symmetry between regions: if there

643
Chapter 19: Fiscal Federalism
is a majority in favor of decentralization in one region, there must also be an equivalent
majority in the other region. We concentrate on the incentive of the left-region for
decentralization.
The majority in the left-region is formed by those who are either to the left or to
the right of the individual at the regional midpoint 1
4. It is easily seen that if this
central individual prefers decentralization, then all those to his left also have the same
preferences because they are located further away from the centralized provision but
share the cost equally. Therefore there will be a majority in favor of decentralization in
the left-region if the decisive individual i = 1
4 prefers decentralization, that is, if

(19.3)
It can therefore be concluded that decentralization is a majority voting equilibrium if
and only if C ≤α
4 .
This result suggests that there will be excessive decentralization under majority
voting because the critical cost level under majority voting is higher than the critical
cost level for optimality. In particular, for any cost C between α
8 and α
4 majority
voting leads to decentralization (C ≤α
4 ), although it is not socially optimal (C > α
8 ).
Therefore under majority voting there is excessive decentralization: voters who are
located at the extremes have an incentive to support decentralized provision to get a
public good closer to what they want, but the democratic process does not internalize
the negative externalities imposed on voters located in the center who suffer from the
extra cost and little or worse preference matching.
19.4
Accountability
Politicians may pursue a range of different objectives. At times they may be public-
spirited and dedicate themselves fully to furthering public interest. But they may also
pursue their own interests, even if these differ from those of their constituents. Some
may want to derive private gains while in ofﬁce or actively seek perks of ofﬁce. Some
may extend clientilistic favors to their families and friends. But the most important
way in which they can act against the best interests of their constituents is by choosing
policies that advance their own interests or those of special groups to which they are
beholden.
Agovernment is accountable if voters can discern whether it is acting in their interest
and sanction them appropriately if they are not, so that incumbents anticipate that they

644
Part VII: Multiple Jurisdictions
will have to render accounts for their past actions. The problem is then to confront
politicians with a trade-off between diverting rents and losing ofﬁce or doing what
voters want and getting re-elected. In this view, elections can be seen as an account-
ability mechanism for controlling and sorting good from bad incumbents. By “good
incumbent,” we mean someone who is honest, competent, and not easily bought off by
special interests.
The standard view of how electoral accountability works is that voters set some
standard of performance to evaluate governments, and they vote out the incumbent
unless these criteria are fulﬁlled. However, elections do not work well in controlling
and sorting politicians. There are severe problems in monitoring and evaluating the
incumbent’s behavior in order to make informed decisions about whether or not to
re-elect. Voters face a formidable agency problem because they are inevitably poorly
informed about politicians’ behavior and type. Moreover the electoral sanction (pass
or fail) is such a crude instrument that it can hardly induce the politicians to do what
the public wants.
From this perspective it might be reasonable to try to organize competition among
politicians in order to control them. In this respect the Brennan and Buchanan (1980)
view is that decentralization is an effective mechanism to control governments’expan-
sive tendencies. The basic argument is that competition among different decentralized
governments can exercise a disciplinary force and break the monopoly power of a large
central government. Comparing performance in ofﬁce among different incumbents
helps in sorting good types from bad types as well as controlling the quality of their
decisions. Hence one votes against an incumbent if his performance is bad relative to
others, in order to induce each incumbent to behave in the public interest.
To see the logic of the argument, consider a simple example. Suppose that the
circumstances under which politicians make decisions can be good (state a) or bad
(state b). Governments decide to adopt policy A, which is better for their constituents
in the good state a, or policy B, which is better in the bad state b. Governments need
not pursue the public interest and can rather advance their own interests by choosing
policy A in state b and policy B in state a to get some private gains (e.g., a rent r > 0).
Suppose that politicians place a value V on being re-elected and that this value satisﬁes
V > r. The payoff matrix is shown in ﬁgure 19.3: the ﬁrst number in each cell is the
government payoff, and the second number is voters welfare. If the government is
re-elected, it gets the extra value V . The government knows the prevailing conditions
(i.e., whether a or b has occurred), but all that citizens observe is their current welfare.
To induce politicians to act as well as they can under this information structure, voters
must set the correct re-election rule. If voters set the standard the incumbent must meet

Figure 19.3
Political accountability and voter welfare
in order to be re-elected too high (e.g., committing to vote for the incumbent if the
welfare level is at least 3), then the incumbent cannot be re-elected whatever he does
if conditions turn out to be bad (state b). Consequently the incumbent has the incentive
to obtain the rent r and leave ofﬁce. Alternatively, if the voters set the standard for
re-election lower, say at 1, the incumbent will be able to divert rent when conditions
happen to be good (state a) and be re-elected by giving voters less than what they
could obtain. Then voters are in a quandary because whatever they decide to do, the
politicians will sometimes escape from their control and divert rent.
Suppose now that the electorate can compare the outcome of its incumbent with
other incumbents (in different constituencies) facing exactly the same circumstances.
Then from the observation of outcomes elsewhere, voters can potentially infer whether
the prevailing conditions are good or bad and thereby get the most they can under
either condition. The information will be revealed if there is at least one government
that chooses a different policy from that of the others. The voting rule then becomes:
When conditions are good, vote for the incumbent if the outcome is at least 3. When
conditions are bad, vote for the incumbent if the outcome is at least 1. Otherwise,
vote the incumbent out. Hence a government facing good conditions a knows that by
choosing the appropriate policy A, it will be re-elected for sure and get V , which is
more than the rent r it can get by choosing B and being voted out. In turn a government
facing bad conditions b knows that by choosing B, it will be re-elected and get V , which
is better than what it would get by adopting the wrong policy A to get the rent r but no
chance of being re-elected. Therefore, comparing the performance of their incumbent
with other incumbents facing similar circumstances, voters can gain increased control

646
Part VII: Multiple Jurisdictions
over their politicians and deduce what is attributable to circumstances as opposed to
government actions.
Another argument for why decentralization should lead to greater efﬁciency and
accountability is that a central decision maker does not need to please all jurisdictions to
getre-electedbutsimplyamajorityofthem. However, thisargumentisusuallybalanced
against the fact that the value of holding ofﬁce is larger in a centralized arrangement
and thus politicians are more eager to win election, which in a conventional political
agency model may increase accountability and efﬁciency.
19.5
Risk-Sharing
Interregional insurance is fundamentally about sharing risk among a group of regions so
that no region bears an undue amount of risk. Because of this risk-sharing, insurance can
arise even when all parties are risk averse. What is necessary for interregional insurance
to be possible is that the risks the parties bear are, to some degree, independent of each
other. Thatis, whenoneregionsuffersaloss, thereareotherregions(orgroupofregions)
that do not suffer a loss. While such independence is usually true of almost all individual
risks for which standard forms of insurance exist (ﬁres, car accidents, sicknesses, etc.),
it is less obvious at the regional level.
There are some fundamental principles in mutual insurance. First, risk-sharing is
more effective, the broader the basis is on which risks are pooled. This is a consequence
of Borch’s theorem on mutual insurance. Second, it is more advantageous for any region
to engage in mutual insurance with other regions when risks are negatively correlated
across regions. Third, there must be a degree of symmetry across regions. The reason is
that with an asymmetric regional distribution of risks, some regions will systematically
and persistently subsidize others. The distributional considerations will then dominate
insurance aspects. Fourth, risk-sharing arrangements require reciprocal behavior: a
region with a favorable shock accepts to help out other regions if it can reasonably
expect that those regions will in turn help it out in bad circumstances. With voluntary
insurance, participants are free to opt out at any time, so there is also the possibility of
a risk-sharing agreement without commitment.
19.5.1
Voluntary Risk-Sharing
Amodel of voluntary insurance between two regions when aggregate income is constant
is as follows: In each period two regions, indexed i = {a, b}, receive an income yi, and

Regional distribution of income
one region is randomly selected to receive a monetary gain  > 0. Each has the same
probability 1
2 of receiving this gain, and the total income is ﬁxed at Y = ya + yb + .
The regional income distribution is given in ﬁgure 19.4.
With constant aggregate income, risk-aversion requires the smoothing of regional
income across states of nature. Optimal risk-sharing arrangements imply full insurance,
which requires that the region receiving the gain  transfer one-half of this gain to the
other region. Denoting such a transfer by t∗, then t∗= 
2 . Therefore the gain is equally
shared among regions, and regional income is constant.
Let ui(x) denotes the utility of region i from disposal income x. Then it is readily
seen that both regions are better off with such an optimal risk-sharing arrangement,

(19.5)
Without commitment, complete risk-sharing is not guaranteed. We must take into
account the possibility that the region receiving the gain may refuse to transfer some
of the gain to the other region. A risk-sharing agreement without commitment must be
“self-enforcing” in the sense that no region has an incentive to defect unilaterally from
the agreement. To be self-enforcing, the risk-sharing arrangement must be such that
the expected net beneﬁts from participating is at any time larger than the one-time gain
from defection (by not making the transfer when called upon). If full insurance is not

648
Part VII: Multiple Jurisdictions
possible, it is still possible to design partial insurance by limiting transfers when the
participation constraint is binding.
Let ti be the transfer made by region i to the other region when region i receives the
gain . On receiving the gain , region i can trade off the immediate gain of defecting
by refusing to make the transfer ti, against the cost of being excluded from any future
insurance arrangement, and to bear regional income variation alone. Taking region a,
the gain from defection when receiving  is
ua(ya + ) −ua(ya +  −ta).
(19.6)
The cost of losing insurance in the next period (which will be discounted at rate δ < 1
when compared to the gain) is

The participation constraint holds if the gain from future insurance exceeds the cost

We can draw several implications from this simple model of risk-sharing without
commitment. First, the time horizon will inﬂuence the amount of mutual insurance
that is sustainable. Indeed the value attached to continued insurance depends on the
discount rate (reﬂecting the time horizon). At one extreme when δ −→0 (extremely
short horizon), the value of future insurance is zero and regions always defect. No
insurance is possible. At the other extreme when δ −→1 (very long horizon), the
value of future insurance is sufﬁciently high that full insurance is possible (ti = 
2 ).
And by a continuity argument, for intermediate discounting values δ ∈(δ, δ), with
0 < δ < δ < 1, only limited insurance is possible (ti < 
2 ). Therefore the expected
time horizon limits the amount of risk-sharing. For values δ ≥δ, complete risk-sharing
can be achieved. For intermediate values δ < δ < δ, there is partial risk-sharing. And
for values δ < δ, no risk-sharing is possible.

649
Chapter 19: Fiscal Federalism
The second implication is that the level of risk-sharing that regions can achieve
increases with risk aversion. The reason is that regions put more weight on the gain from
long-term insurance against the short-term gain from defecting. This is immediately
seen from the participation constraints. Indeed the income distribution on the left-hand
side of equations (19.8) and (19.9) is less uncertain than the income distribution on the
right-hand side, which makes the participation constraints more likely to be satisﬁed
under increased risk aversion.
A third implication concerns the effect of income inequality. Intuition would suggest
that mutual insurance is more likely if regions are ex ante identical and that regional
inequality limits the scope for insurance. But this is not true. The reason is that risk-
sharingredistributesexpostfromtheregionwithapositiveshocktotheotherregion, but
it does not redistribute ex ante from the rich to the poor regions. More surprisingly, the
increased inequality, while maintaining constant the aggregate income, can improve
insurance. To see this, start from income equality ya = yb. Using the participation
constraint, we can calculate the level of risk-sharing that is possible. Then we increase
ya and reduce yb by the same amount. The participation constraints are then affected
because income levels inﬂuence the demand for insurance. It is then possible to show
that for some standard utility functions the amount of risk-sharing has increased with
inequality.

Insurance versus Redistribution
In practice, interregional insurance is organized in a federation through federal taxes
and transfers. The effect of such a federal tax system is to redistribute income from
high- to low-income regions. By pooling income risk across the regions, the federal
tax system provides insurance against region-speciﬁc shocks. However, to the extent
that there is ex ante income inequality among regions, federal taxes also provide ex
ante regional redistribution. We ignore the stabilizing effect of federal taxation, which
refers to the possibility of smoothing shocks over time (between bad years and good
years). The insurance motive for the federal tax system is explicitly recognized in many
countries. For instance, in the United Kingdom part of the tax system is actually called
National Insurance. To appreciate the amount of insurance federal taxes can provide, it
is necessary to disentangle redistribution from insurance components. Redistribution
acts on the initial income distribution, while insurance responds to income shocks
(either permanent or temporary).
Assume that region i’s income at time t is subject to permanent shock ψt

Suppose that the federal tax system taxes all regions’ incomes at the same rate τ and
redistributes total tax revenue as a uniform transfer to all regions. It follows that region

Using this decomposition, it is interesting to measure the extent of insurance provided
by federal taxation in practice. Empirical studies for the US federal tax system clearly
suggest the presence of intranational insurance. Although there is disagreement about
the exact magnitude of the insurance, all studies ﬁnd that the redistribution effect largely
dominates the insurance effect. They also ﬁnd that insurance is rather modest, in the
sense that it cannot smooth more than a ten cents on a dollar change in state income
caused by asymmetric shocks.
19.6
Hard and Soft Budgets
In a federal system the central government can impose a budget constraint upon local
government. This can be done by ﬁxing the funding that is provided by the centre. The
budget constraint of the local government may be soft or hard. Ahard budget constraint
is one that must be met. This requires the federal government to make a credible com-
mitment about the level of funding. In contrast, a soft budget constraint arises when

651
Chapter 19: Fiscal Federalism
the amount of funding can be manipulated by the local government. Empirical research
has provided evidence that local governments do face soft budget constraints.
Soft budget constraints are a source of inefﬁciency since they encourage strategic
behavior among local governments. The logic is that the funds transferred to local
governments come from a common pool of resources controlled by federal government.
This gives an incentive for local governments to make excessive claims on this common
pool since the cost is shared. This is an application of the standard argument that a
common-access resource will be overexploited. One way that this can occur is for
local governments to borrow excessively in order to make current expenditures in the
knowledge that they will receive a bailout from the federal government.
The effect of the soft-budget constraint can be illustrated by considering the behavior
of two local governments in a two-period setting. In period 1 the local governments
determine how much public good to provide, how much to borrow in period 1, and what
local tax rate to set. Once decided, the public good provides services in both periods,
and there is no additional public good provision in the second period. After these
choices are made, the federal government sets a uniform tax on each region in period
1 and a differentiated transfer to each local government in period 2. The equilibrium
for this two-stage game can be found by backward induction: the choices of the federal
government are determined conditional on those of the local governments, then local
government choices are determined.
The local governments are denoted A and B. The residents of region j have aggregate
income yj in each period. This income is taxed at the local rate τ j. Income left after tax
is used to purchase quantity zj
t of a private good in period t, so zj
t =

1 −τ j
yj. The
local government of region j collects tax revenue τ jyj in each period, pays a tax T to
the federal government in period 1, and receives a transfer Ŵj in period 2. It borrows bj
in period 1 and repays [1 + r]bj in period 2. The budgets of the local government are
gA = τ AyA −T + bA,
(19.14)
[1 + r]bA = τ AyA + ŴA.
(19.15)
Equation (19.15) can be used to show that
zA
2 = yA + ŴA −[1 + r]bA.
(19.16)
The preferences of the residents in region j are represented by the quasi-linear utility
function
Uj = U(zj
1) + U(zj
2) + gj.
(19.17)

652
Part VII: Multiple Jurisdictions
Using the budget constraints, the local residents obtain utility
Uj = U([1−τ j]yj)+δU(yj +Ŵj −[1 + r]bj)+τ jyj −T +bj, j = A, B. (19.18)
In the second stage of the game the federal government takes the policy choices

τ A, bA, τ B, bB
of the local governments as given when it optimizes. The budget
constraint for the federal government is
ŴA + ŴB = 2T,
(19.19)
and its objective function is
W = UA + UB.
(19.20)
Using (19.18), we write the necessary conditions for the choice of the transfers as
δU′(yj + Ŵj −[1 + r]bj) −1 = 0,
j = A, B.
(19.21)
From the necessary conditions it can be calculated that
dŴj
dbj = 1 + r,
(19.22)
so an increase in local government borrowing raises the transfer it receives in the second
period to compensate.
At the ﬁrst stage the local governments make their choices. Substituting the federal
government budget into (19.18) gives the local government objective
max
{τ j,bj}
U([1 −τ j]yj) + δU(yj + Ŵj −[1 + r]bj) + τ jyj −ŴA
2 −ŴB
2 + bj,
j = A, B.
(19.23)
The key feature of (19.23) is that the apparent cost of the transfer, Ŵj, to the region
is halved since the cost of ﬁnancing it is shared between two local governments. The
necessary condition for choice of bj is
δU′(yj + Ŵj −[1 + r]bj)
dŴj



dŴj
dbj + 1 = 1 −1 + r

.
(19.24)
The ﬁrst-order condition is positive provided that r < 1, so for these quasi-linear pref-
erences the local government has an incentive to continue borrowing without limit. The

653
Chapter 19: Fiscal Federalism
central message is that there is a strategic motive to borrow excessively since half the
cost of borrowing is ﬁnanced by the other local government.
This ordering of moves implies a soft-budget constraint. The federal government has
an incentive to equalize private good provision across regions in the second period. It
does this by providing transfers in period 2, but since the cost of the transfer is shared
between regions, this gives each region has an incentive to borrow excessively and
over-provide the public good in period 1. The regions do this with the knowledge that
they will be bailed out by the federal government in period 2. The softening of the
budget constraint imposes a cost on all regions and distorts the level of public good
provision. Such soft-budget constraints will always be a problem when the federal
government has economic and political reasons for providing bailouts.
The same model can be used to analyze a hard-budget constraint. This can be done
by reversing the order of moves in the game so that federal government sets the ﬁrst-
period tax and the second-period transfer before the local governments make their
choices. Under this ordering of moves the choice problem of the local governments is
still described by (19.23), but Ŵj is taken as given. The necessary condition for bj is
−[1 + r] δU′(yj + Ŵj −[1 + r] bj + 1 = 0,
(19.25)
so the level of borrowing is efﬁcient given the level of the transfer.
It is therefore socially preferable for the federal government to impose a hard-budget
constraint. The difﬁculty in doing this in one of credibility. What will the federal govern-
ment do if a local government tests the hard-budget constraint by excessive borrowing?
It may be politically difﬁcult not to offer a bailout. The position of the federal govern-
ment is made worse if there is uncertainty, since it may be hard to distinguish between
borrowing that is excessive because of a poor realization of second-period income for
a region and borrowing that is deliberately excessive in expectation of a bailout. With
hidden information there is a clear moral hazard problem.

Evidence on Decentralization
19.7.1
Decentralization around the World
The degree of decentralization of government activity can be measured in several
different ways. Oates (1972) distinguishes three measures of ﬁscal decentralization: (1)
share of total public revenue collected by the central government, (2) share of the central
government in all public expenditures (including income redistribution payments), and
(3) share of the central government in current government consumption expenditures.

The ﬁrst measure based on revenue collection raises the problem that the center
may collect revenue for regions. It underestimates the degree of decentralization to
the extent that regions get back substantial portions of the revenue collected at the
central level. The second measure, including income redistribution payments, also
underestimates the degree of decentralization because the redistribution of income is
mostly the role of central governments regardless of how decentralized a country is.
The same argument applies for excluding defense spending, which is the other public
good that is uniformly provided by central governments. So the more appropriate mea-
sure is the concentration of total government current consumption. Such information is
readily available in the rich database at Brown University, in which total government
expenditures are the consolidated sum of all expenditures at different government lev-
els. Consolidation matters to prevent double-counting of intergovernmental grants and
transfers.
Table 19.1 shows the patterns of decentralization around the world and suggests some
clear trends. Developed countries are generally more decentralized. Latin America
countries decentralized mostly during the period 1980 to 1995. However, government
consumption in Latin America remains substantially more centralized, with spending
at the central level close to 70 percent against central spending less than 50 percent
in developed countries. African countries are the most centralized and display little
decrease in centralization (with almost all government spending occurring at the central
level). Developed countries exhibit the most substantial decreases among all regions
in centralization. The world level average (involving up to 48 countries) also reveals a
general trend toward greater decentralization, with the central spending share declining
from 75 percent in 1975 to 64 percent in 1995.

19.7.2
Decentralization by Functions
Previously the degree of decentralization was shown to differ quite substantially among
countries. It is instructive to measure the decentralization of public expenditures by
function to see whether this is consistent with normative advice. From a normative
point of view decentralization is desirable when the need to tailor spending to local
preferences dominates the possible economies of scale and interregional spillovers.
The Government Finance Statistics of the IMF contain the data for breaking down
government activities by functions and levels. All local expenditures refer to expen-
ditures of the state, regional and provincial governments. Table 19.2 indicates the
functional decentralization of government activity country by country. Housing and
community amenities are the most decentralized, with an average of 71 percent, fol-
lowed closely by education and health with an average of 64 percent each. The least
decentralized are the expenditures for social security and welfare with an average of 18
percent. This is consistent with the normative view that income redistribution is better
achieved at the central level.

19.7.3
Determinants of Decentralization
Decentralization is a complex process, and we have provided but a snapshot of the
enormous normative literature on how best to allocate different responsibilities between
central and local governments and the possible efﬁciency gains of decentralization.
However, the positive issue of why and when decentralization occurs deserves also
some attention.
The positive literature on decentralization suggests certain empirical regularities
concerning the forces that promote decentralization. Oates (1972) ﬁnds in a cross-
sectional analysis that both country size and income per capita play a crucial role in
explainingdecentralization. Theempiricalevidencesuggeststhatfordifferentmeasures
of decentralization, larger and richer countries are more decentralized. To better control
for interregional geographic and cultural differences, Oates and Wallis (1988) use a
panel analysis of 48 US states. They ﬁnd that diversity as measured by urbanization
increases decentralization.
In a very interesting study, Panizza (1999) estimates a theoretical model of decen-
tralization that allows a test for the preference sorting effect. He uses a linear country
model like the one presented previously in the optimal structure section. The level of
public good provision is determined at the central level by majority voting (i.e., by the
median voter’s preference). The central government provides a uniform public good
level whose value decreases with the spatial distance between citizens and the central
government. Local government provision is closer to the preferences of citizens and
so more valuable. Since voters beneﬁt more from local provision, increasing central
provision reduces overall demand for the public good. Central government decides its
share in provision of the public good, anticipating how that share inﬂuences overall
demand for the public good. Using cross-sectional analysis and standard measures of
decentralization, Panizza ﬁnds that decentralization increases with country size, income
per capita, the level of democracy, and ethnolinguistic fractionalization.
An important limit of the existing empirical testing of decentralization is that it
ignores a central force in the process of decentralization, namely the threat of separation.
Thepossibilityofsecessionhasbeenapowerfulforceinlimitingtheabilityofthecentral
government to exploit peripheral minorities of voters for the sake of the majority of the
population. The idea is that a unitary government is more willing to devolve more power
and responsibility when the threat of secession is more credible. It has been a recurrent
feature in Europe that the decision to decentralize is not necessarily guided by efﬁciency
considerations but is in fact driven by distributional and political forces. When rich
regions, which today transfer large amounts of income to poorer regions, demand more

657
Chapter 19: Fiscal Federalism
decentralization, it is to limit their net contributions. They often do that because they no
longer believe in the mutual insurance effect that such transfers might change directions
in the near future.Also the size of the regional redistribution has become so visible that it
creates an insurmountable political problem. The perception is that rich regions become
better off by seceding, and to prevent such countries from breaking apart, concessions
in the form of larger devolution of responsibilities and resources to regions have been
taking place. Italy and Belgium are two good illustrations of the sort of decentralization
forced by the pressing demand of the rich regions Lombardy and Flanders, respectively.
It is clear that in those cases the efﬁciency argument that decentralization allows policy
choices that better reﬂect local preference was not the key force. Richer regions demand
more autonomy because the regional income inequality is such that mutual insurance
becomes pure redistribution. Moreover the demand for more autonomy is exacerbated,
rightly or wrongly, by the perceptions in the rich regions that the regional transfers are
largely inﬂuenced by opportunistic behavior of the receiving regions (i.e., some form
of moral hazard problem at the regional level).
19.8
Conclusions
There is a considerable controversy as to what public activities should be decentralized
or centralized. There is also empirical evidence of increasing decentralization around
the world. In this chapter we considered the costs and beneﬁts of decentralization.
We saw that one important advantage of a decentralized system is the tailoring of the
provision of public goods and services to local preferences. The idea is that local gov-
ernment is closer to the people and so more responsive to their preferences than central
governments. Another advantage of decentralization is to foster intergovernmental
competition, making government more efﬁcient and more accountable to the electorate.
There are also disadvantages of a decentralized system. Some, like ﬁscal competition,
are covered in the next chapter. The main disadvantage of decentralization is probably
its failure to exploit all the economies of scale in the provision of public goods. Another
disadvantage is to limit the scope for interregional risk-sharing through the federal ﬁscal
system.
Optimal federalism results from trade-offs among the various costs and beneﬁts due
to decentralization. It provides normative conclusions about the allocation of respon-
sibilities between central and local levels. However, from a more positive perspective,
political and distributional considerations can lead to different conclusions. The best
illustration is that too much decentralization will result from a democratic choice.

incomes, denoted by y. Income takes on values between 0 and 1 and is uniformly distributed.
Individuals care about the income of those living in their region. The mean income of a region
j = 1, 2 is a function of the average value of y in that region, denoted by yj. An individual

(Oates’s decentralization theorem). There are two regions j = {1, 2} with the same population
size. The population in each region is represented by a continuum of residents with a mass of
unity. There are three goods: a private good x and two regional public goods g1 and g2. One
unit of either of the public goods requires c units of private good to produce. In each region

There are two regions j = 1, 2 and two goods, a private good x and a pure public good g.
There are nj identical residents in region j. Each resident is endowed with a ﬁxed amount
of private good that can be turned into a public good at a unit cost equal to one. The utility
of each resident in region j is U = xj + θj log(g).
a. Suppose that θ1 < θ2 and n1 < n2. Suppose also that each region chooses its public
good provision independently so that the common level of public good is the sum of regional

(Caplin and Nalebuff 1992) There are two regions j = 1, 2 competing for residents through

preferred policy is x = θ. Assume a triangular population distribution on the interval [0, 1].
Given the policy choice of each region, each resident chooses the region with the policy

There are two time periods. In each period, politicians in ofﬁce choose the level of public
good. Between periods, there is an election. All politicians are benevolent (there is no rent
diversion). They differ in their competence (i.e., ability to transform taxes into public output.
There is uncertainty about the quality of politicians: politicians are “good” with probability
π and “bad” with probability 1 −π. The good type is always low cost and can produce the
public good at a unit cost θL. The bad type is always high cost and can produce the public
good at a unit cost θH (where θH > θL). All voters have an identical per-period utility
function
W(G, T ) = B(G) −μT,
where B(G) is the increasing concave beneﬁt from the public good and μ ≥1 is the marginal
cost of public funds. The intensiﬁcation of tax competition is represented by an increase in
μ (i.e., a basic implication of the tax competition theory). There is no discounting between

Consider the above exercise and assume that the bad incumbent can “delay” the revelation of
the high cost by borrowing b (borrowing is only observable after the election). This creates
an incentive for the bad type to appear competent by acting as if cost is low and creating a
deﬁcit during election years (the political budget cycle). In the ﬁrst period, the incumbent
observes the unit cost θ ∈{θL, θH } and then chooses the level of provision G and the amount
of borrowing b, giving a total tax bill of T = θG −b. Voters observe the choices of T and
G prior to the election. Voters make an inference about the incumbent’s type and re-elect the
incumbent if he is at least as likely to be “good” as the challenger who is good with prior
probability, π. In the second period, the politician then in ofﬁce again chooses G given θ and
pays back b, making a tax bill of T = θGθ + b. There are no further elections.
a. Calculate the equilibrium outcome and show that there exists a critical value μ◦such that
the bad incumbent will separate and lose the election if and only if μ > μ◦, and he will pool
and be re-elected otherwise.

Introduction
What is the role of competition among governments? If competition is the fundamental
force for efﬁcient economic performance in the private sector, why should it be differ-
ent for the public sector? Why cannot the same disciplining effect of competition be
applied to the public sector as well? In the private sector, competition will promote efﬁ-
ciency because ﬁrms that best satisfy consumers’ preferences will survive and prosper
while others will lose customers and fail. Extending this argument to the public sector,
competition among governments and jurisdictions should induce them to best serve the
will of their residents. If they fail to do so, residents will vote with their feet and leave
for other jurisdictions that offer a better deal.
The purpose of this chapter is to show that if the private competition analogy has some
merit, it also needs to be seriously qualiﬁed. The chapter is organized as follows: First,
the efﬁciency aspects of ﬁscal competition are presented. Second, the distributional
aspects of residential mobility are evaluated. The key issue is how mobility limits the
possibility of redistributing income. Third, the role of intergovernmental transfers is
discussed both in terms of efﬁciency and redistribution. Fourth, some evidence on ﬁscal
competition and intergovernmental interactions is given. Last, the main results from
ﬁscal competition theory are summarized and evaluated in the concluding section.
20.2
Tax Competition
Tax competition refers to the interaction among governments due to interjurisdictional
mobility of the tax base. It does not include the ﬁscal interaction among governments
resulting from public good spillovers, where residents of one jurisdiction consume the
public goods provided by neighboring jurisdictions. The cause of tax competition is that
independent jurisdictions ﬁnance public expenditure by placing a tax on a mobile tax
base. For example, a tax on capital will cause capital to seek a better return in alternative
jurisdictions, and an income tax will cause workers to move to another jurisdiction if
they are mobile. The loss of tax base by one jurisdiction represents a gain to the others,
so mobility causes an externality among jurisdictions.
In the model we consider tax competition that arises because jurisdictions ﬁnance the
provision of a public good with a tax on locally employed capital. Capital moves across

666
Part VII: Multiple Jurisdictions
jurisdictions in response to tax differentials while residents are typically immobile (or
at least less mobile). In the competitive version of tax competition, jurisdictions are
“too small” (relative to the economy) to affect the net return to capital that is determined
worldwide. As a result each jurisdiction sets its tax on locally employed capital, taking
as given the net-of-tax price of capital. Tax rates in other jurisdictions do not matter,
and there is no strategic interaction among jurisdictions when setting their taxes. We
say that jurisdictions behave competitively. When jurisdictions are “large” relative to
the economy, each jurisdiction can affect the net return to capital by varying its own
tax rate. In this case the tax rate chosen in one jurisdiction varies with the taxes in other
jurisdictions. Jurisdictions behave strategically: they set their tax in response to the tax
rates in other jurisdictions.
Both the competitive and strategic versions of the tax competition model produce the
same important conclusion, namely that public goods are underprovided relative to the
efﬁcientSamuelsonrulelevel. Thereasonisthateachjurisdictionperceivesthemobility
of capital and keeps its tax low to preserve its tax base. To understand the inefﬁciency
arising from intergovernmental competition, it is useful to consider a simple model in
which we assume, in turn, that jurisdictions behave competitively and then strategically.
20.2.1
Competitive Behavior
The assumption of competition means that the mobile factor of production is available
to the “small” jurisdiction at a ﬁxed price. Suppose that capital is the mobile factor
of production and that the jurisdiction seeks to impose a tax on capital and to use the
revenue to provide public goods and services to its residents, or to directly transfer
cash to them. If capital were perfectly immobile, a local source-based tax on capital
would reduce the net rate of return to capital by the exact amount of the tax. This capital
tax would make the residents better off at the expense of capital owners (who are not
necessarily residents).
In contrast, when capital is costlessly mobile, local capital taxation cannot affect the
net return to capital. The reason is that the imposition of the local tax drives capital out
of the jurisdiction until the increase in the gross rate of return is sufﬁcient to compensate
capital owners for local taxes. However, the outﬂow of capital from the jurisdiction
reduces the remuneration of labor. The resulting loss of income to the residents will
exceed the value of the tax revenue collected from capital taxation. Except for the case
where public expenditures have greater value to local residents than the tax revenue
used to ﬁnance them, the net effect of capital taxation is to harm immobile residents.

667
Chapter 20: Fiscal Competition
Therefore, with competition and costless mobility, the taxation of capital is impossible,
whereas it may be desirable without mobility. Capital taxes that help immobile residents
when capital is immobile harm them when this factor is perfectly mobile.
Assume that the local production process uses mobile capital and immobile labor. The
production function is F(Ki, L), where Ki is the aggregate capital and L is aggregate
labor employed in jurisdiction i. Each worker is endowed with one unit of labor.
Under constant returns to scale, F(Ki, L) = LF

Ki
L , 1

= Lf (ki), where ki is the
capital–labor ratio. The production function f (ki) gives the per capita output, which is
increasing and concave (f ′′(ki) < 0 < f ′(ki)). The concavity of the production function
reﬂects diminishing returns to capital as it is combined with the immobile stock of labor.
Let ρ denote the net return to capital outside the jurisdiction, and let ti denote the per
unit tax on the capital employed in the jurisdiction i. With costless mobility of capital,
the local supply of capital equates its net return in jurisdiction i with its net return
elsewhere:
f ′(ki) −ti = ρ.
(20.1)
With exogenously ﬁxed ρ, the fact that f ′(ki) is decreasing in ki implies that a higher
tax drives capital away, so dki
dti < 0. Assuming that the net revenue collected from local
capital taxation accrues to workers in the form of cash transfers or public goods of the
same value, the net income of workers will be
yi = f (ki) −f ′(ki)ki + tiki
= f (ki) −ρki,
(20.2)
where the second equality follows from the arbitrage condition f ′(ki) = ρ+ti. Because
taxation reduces the amount of capital in the jurisdiction, it is then easily seen that the
welfare of the workers, as measured by their net income yi, is maximized by setting
ti = 0.
20.2.2
Strategic Behavior
It is now assumed that jurisdictions behave strategically. The strategic interaction makes
the equilibrium analysis more delicate, and it is useful to describe the equilibrium
outcome rigorously. Consequently this section will use more calculus than usual and
can be skipped with little loss of continuity by those who wish to.
Consider two countries (i = 1, 2) that levy a tax on the return to capital. Capital is
mobile and is used together with some ﬁxed amount of labor to produce output. The

production function is F(Ki, L), where Ki is the aggregate capital and L is aggregate
labor employed in country i. The quantity of labor available and the production tech-
nology are the same for the two countries, and each worker is endowed with one unit
of labor. Under constant returns to scale, F(Ki, L) = LF

Ki
L , 1

= Lf (ki), where
ki is the capital–labor ratio. The production function f (ki) gives the per capita output,
which is increasing and concave (f ′′(ki) < 0 < f ′(ki)). There is a ﬁxed stock of capital
k that allocates itself between the two countries, so k1 + k2 = k. Each country levies a
per unit tax ti on the capital that is employed within its boundaries. The revenue raised
is used to supply a level of public services of Gi = tiki. Due to capital mobility the tax
choice of one jurisdiction affects the size of the tax base available to the other country.
Given the pair of tax rates, costless mobility implies the equality of the after-tax
return to capital across countries:
f ′(k1) −t1 = f ′(k2) −t2
= f ′(k −k1) −t2.
(20.3)
This arbitrage condition produces an allocation of capital across countries that depends
on the tax rates, as illustrated in ﬁgure 20.1.
The partition of the capital stock between the two countries is represented on the
horizontal axis with the capital levels measured from the two corners (from left to

669
Chapter 20: Fiscal Competition
right for country 1). The corresponding marginal product of capital in each country is
measured on the vertical axis (the left axis for country 1). Note that if the tax rates do
differ (e.g., t1 > t2), then capital is inefﬁciently allocated because the marginal product
of capital differs across countries (f ′(k1) > f ′(k2)). It can also be seen that an increase
in the tax rate in country 1 reduces the net return to capital in that country and causes
some capital to move away to country 2. The converse holds when the tax in country
2 is increased.
These observations can be demonstrated formally by taking the total differential of
the arbitrage condition (20.3) with respect to t1and k1 to give
f ′′(k1)dk1 −dt1 = −f ′′(k −k1)dk1.
(20.4)
Then the variation in k1 in response to the tax change dt1 is
dk1
dt1
=
1
f ′′(k1) + f ′′(k2) < 0.
(20.5)
The sign of this expression follows from the assumption of a decreasing marginal
product of capital, f ′′ < 0. Note that this assumption implies some regulating forces
in the allocation of capital, since, when capital moves from 1 to 2, its marginal product
decreases in country 2 at rate f ′′(k2) and rises in country 1 at rate −f ′′(k1). When
setting its tax rate, country 1 will take into account how capital responds. That is, it will
incorporate the movement of capital described above into its decision problem.
Assumingthatthenetrevenuecollectedfromlocalcapitaltaxationaccruestoworkers
in the form of cash transfers or public goods of the same value, we have the net income
of workers (or residents) in country 1 as
y1 = f (k1) −f ′(k1)k1 + t1k1.
(20.6)
Each country maximizes the net income of its residents while taking into account capital
ﬂows resulting from tax changes. Because the amount of capital employed in each
country also depends on the other country’s tax rate, there is strategic ﬁscal interaction
among countries: neither can set its own tax rate without taking into account what the
other is doing.
The optimal choice of each country is found by applying the usual Nash assumption:
each takes the tax rate of the other as given when maximizing. By this reasoning, the
best response of country 1 to the other country’s tax t2 is described by the following
ﬁrst-order condition:

(20.8)
which can be solved for t1 to give
t1 = r1(t2).
(20.9)
Similarly, for country 2,
t2 = −k2 (t1, t2) f ′′
1 (k1 (t1, t2)) ,
(20.10)
which implies
t2 = r2(t1).
(20.11)
A Nash equilibrium is a pair (t∗

2 ) such that the tax choice of each country is
a best response to the other country’s tax choice, t∗
1 = r1(t∗
2 ) and t∗
2 = r2(t∗

symmetry of the model implies that both countries choose the same taxes in equilibrium,
so t∗

We can also ﬁnd the slope of the best-response function r1(t2) to evaluate the na-

ψ1(t1, t2) = k1f ′′
2 + t1 = 0 implicitly deﬁnes t1 as a function of t2, and we need to
know how the optimum choice of t1 will respond to changes in t2. Differentiating the

where dk1
dt1 < 0, and f ′′ < 0. It follows that for f ′′′ ≥0 the slope of the best-response
function satisﬁes 0 < dr1
dt2 < 1. It can be seen in ﬁgure 20.2 that the tax rates are strategic
complements: a higher tax in country 2 drives capital to country 1, which in response
raises its own tax rate.
It is now easily seen that such a Nash equilibrium with t∗
1 = t∗
2 = t∗involves inefﬁ-
ciently low taxes and that jointly increasing taxes to t > t∗is beneﬁcial to both countries.
First, observe that from the perspective of the two countries together, the stock of capital
is ﬁxed at k. Hence it is simply a ﬁxed factor. Provided that both countries levy the same
tax rate t = t1 = t2, half of the capital, k
2, will be located in each country regardless of
the level of the taxes. The welfare of the workers in each country, as measured by their
net income y = f (k) −f ′(k)k + tk, is then improved, since t k
2 > t∗k
2. In fact, with the
cooperative tax setting, the countries can maximize the net income of their residents
by fully taxing the mobile factor, whereas the noncooperative equilibrium leads to a
lower tax on capital. Welfare is higher with cooperation. This loss in potential welfare
is the efﬁciency cost of ﬁscal competition.

672
Part VII: Multiple Jurisdictions
Although the model just considered leads to the extreme conclusion that the tax is
pushed to its maximum with cooperation, this was not the major point of the analysis.
What the model does illustrate are the forces that are at work when an attempt is made to
tax a mobile factor of production. The movement of the factor generates an externality
among countries that is not internalized when their governments conduct individual
optimization of taxes. This externality is due to the fact that a higher tax in one country
pushes some of the factor to the other country. This has the beneﬁcial effect of increasing
the other country’s tax base and its tax revenue at any given tax rate. Cooperation among
countries in the choice of taxes internalizes this externality and allows them to choose
a mutually preferable set of tax rates.
Consequently competition for mobile factors of production results in tax rates that
are lower than is optimal for the countries involved. Implicitly each country can be
understood to be trying to undercut the other to attract the mobile factor of production.
This undercutting puts downward pressure on tax rates to the detriment of all countries.
The policy principle that emerges from this scenario is that international cooperation
on the setting of tax rates is beneﬁcial.
As already noted, although the argument has been phrased in terms of countries, the
same results would apply within a federal structure in which the separate jurisdictions at
any level set their own tax rates. It is possibly more relevant in such a context because the
factorsofproductionmaybemoremobilethantheyarebetweencountries. Furthermore,
for tax competition to arise, the tax base need not be a factor of production but simply
needs to be mobile between jurisdictions. For example, the argument applies equally
well to the taxation of commodities provided that purchases can be made mobile through
cross-border shopping. The resulting equilibrium with cross-border shopping will have
inefﬁciently low commodity taxes. The taxes will be lower, the higher the perceived
elasticity of cross-border shopping. This is so as long as goods are taxed according to the
origin principle (i.e., the goods are taxed where they are produced). If the destination
principle is applied, the goods are taxed in the country where they are consumed and
the incentive for cross-border shopping would disappear. However, the destination
principle of taxation is costly to operate because it requires that all taxes levied in the
country of production be rebated when the good is exported. This is only possible if
bordercontrolsaremaintained. Thesamecommoditytaxesmustbeleviedonallimports
into the country of ﬁnal consumption, with tax revenue also accruing to this country.
As such, the tax competition argument provides some important reasons for being
cautious about the beneﬁts of ﬁscal federalism that were described in the previous
chapter. Giving jurisdictions too much freedom in tax setting may lead to mutually
damaging reductions in taxes—the so-called race to the bottom.

673
Chapter 20: Fiscal Competition
20.2.3
Size Matters
Differences in country size, production technologies, factor endowments, or residents’
preferences can be expected to cause the countries to choose different tax rates. An
interesting aspect of the ensuing asymmetric tax competition is the so-called beneﬁt
of smallness. The idea is that although ﬁscal competition is inefﬁcient, it can actually
beneﬁt small countries. Of course, such a gain comes at the expense of larger countries.
This can be seen in our simple two-country model by assuming that they differ in
their number of residents only. Suppose that country 1 is “large” with a share s > 1
2
of the total population and country 2 is “small” with population share 1 −s < 1
2. The
capital market-clearing condition is then
sk1(t1, t2) + [1 −s] k2(t1, t2) = ˜k,
(20.15)
where ˜k is the (worldwide) average capital–labor ratio. The arbitrage condition implies
equality of the after-tax return on capital across countries:
f ′(k1) −t1 = f ′(k2) −t2
= f ′
/
˜k
1 −s −sk1

−t2.
(20.16)
Differentiating the arbitrage condition gives the capital outﬂow in response to a
domestic tax increase,
dk1
dt1
=
1 −s
[1 −s] f ′′(k1) + sf ′′(k2) < 0,
(20.17)
and by analogy, for the small country,
dk2
dt2
=
s
[1 −s] f ′′(k1) + sf ′′(k2) < 0.
(20.18)
From (20.17) and (20.18) it follows that both countries face a capital outﬂow after
an increase in their own tax rate, but this outﬂow is less severe in the large country.
Indeed, when t1 = t2, we have k1 = k2, f ′′(k1) = f ′′(k2), and thus dk2
dt2 < dk1
dt1 < 0 for
s > 1 −s. The larger country faces a less elastic tax base and thereby chooses a higher
tax rate than the smaller country, so in equilibrium t1 > t2. Because the small country
charges a lower tax on capital, it will employ more capital per unit of labor, (k2 > k1),
increasing per capita income and making its residents better off than the residents of
the large country. It is even possible that for a sufﬁciently large difference in size, the
small country will be better off than it would be without tax competition.

This beneﬁt of smallness is illustrated in ﬁgure 20.3, where for country i = 1, 2 per
capita income is denoted ci = f (ki) −f ′(ki)ki and tax revenue is denoted gi = tiki.
The net return to capital, denoted by R, is the same for both countries by arbitrage and
is adjusted to tax choices in order to clear the market. It is then readily seen that the
residents of the small country are better off taxing less, since c2 + g2 > c1 + G1.
We can obviously extend this reasoning to show that if the number of countries com-
peting for capital increases, each country having a lower population share will perceive
a greater elasticity of its tax base and choose lower taxes: the larger the number of
countries, the more intense the competition and the lower the equilibrium taxes. Again,
commodity tax competition displays a close similarity to capital tax competition when
countries differ in population size, with the smaller country setting the lower tax rate
as it perceives a higher elasticity of its domestic tax base.
20.2.4
Public Input Provision
In the standard model of tax competition there is no speciﬁc need for revenue. The
capital tax is used solely to extract the rent from capital and the revenue raised in each
jurisdiction is simply added to the net incomes of the workers. The addition to income
can be interpreted as public good provision, but only if a constant marginal utility of
public good is assumed. Different conclusions about tax competition can emerge if the
use of tax revenue is considered in more detail. If it is used to ﬁnance a public input

675
Chapter 20: Fiscal Competition
that is used with private capital in production, then there is a motive for levying the tax
that is missing in the standard model. This can have an effect on the nature of the tax
externality between jurisdictions.
Assume that there are two jurisdictions. Each jurisdiction, i, provides a public input,
gi, which combines with private capital, ki, in the production function
yi = f (ki, gi) .
(20.19)
The public input is ﬁnanced by the tax on capital, so the quantity in i is determined by
gi = tiki, i = 1, 2. If an increase in the tax rate, ti, raises additional revenue, it will
increase gi. If the increase in public input raises the marginal productivity of capital,
this will offset the effect of the tax increase on the net return to capital. When this effect
is strong enough, it is possible for an increase in the tax rate to attract mobile capital.
This can give an incentive to set taxes above the efﬁcient level.
This reasoning is made clear when the externality underlying the tax competition is
explored. The standard model without a public input has a positive tax externality
∂y2
∂t1
=

−fk2k2k2 + t2
 ∂k2

> 0,
(20.20)
so that an increase in the tax rate in jurisdiction 1 increases income in jurisdiction 2.This
is because the tax increase reduces the net return to capital in jurisdiction 1 and mobile
capital ﬂows out. Now consider the situation where the public input is included in the
model. The equilibrium level of the public input in jurisdiction 2 must depend on the
tax rates in the two countries
g2 = g2 (t1, t2) .
(20.21)
This dependence adds an additional component to the externality effect of taxation.

It can be observed from (20.24) that it is possible that a sufﬁciently strong comple-

If (20.25) is satisﬁed, the equilibrium tax rates will be higher than the efﬁcient level at
the Nash equilibrium.
20.2.5
Tax Overlap
A common feature of ﬁscal federalism is that higher and lower levels of government
share the same tax base. This tax base overlap gives rise to vertical ﬁscal externalities.
With tax competition among jurisdictions, the horizontal ﬁscal externality on other
regions is positive—an increase in tax rate by one region raises the tax base of others. In
contrast, if different levels of government share the same tax base, then the tax levied by
one government will reduce the tax base available to other levels of governments. This
introduces a negative vertical externality. Not surprisingly, such vertical externalities
lead to overtaxation in equilibrium because each level of government neglects the
negative effect of its taxation on the other levels of government.
The joint taxation of cigarettes by Canadian federal and provincial governments is
a good example. Figure 20.4 illustrates this tax overlap problem. The supply curve,
S, is assumed to be perfectly elastic, and the demand curve, D, is downward-sloping.
Suppose that the initial federal excise tax rate is T0 and the provincial tax rate is t0.
The corresponding price is p0 and the quantity of cigarettes consumed is q0. Tax
revenue is T0q0 for the federal government, and t0q0 for the provincial government.
If the provincial government raises its tax rate to t1 = t0 + , the consumer price
increases by the amount of the tax increase p1 = p0 + , and the quantity consumed
decreasestoq1. Thetaxrevenueoftheprovincialgovernmentincreasesby[t1 −t0] q1−
t0 [q0 −q1], but due to the reduction in the consumption of cigarettes, revenue for the
federal government decreases by T0 [q0 −q1], as represented by the shaded area in
ﬁgure 20.4. A similar vertical externality (but in the opposite direction) would arise if
the federal government were to raise its tax rate. If both levels of government neglect
the revenue losses incurred by the other government when making their tax choices,
then both governments are underestimating the cost of raising tax revenue from the
common tax base and will tend to choose tax rates that are inefﬁciently high.

Tax overlap
When vertical and horizontal externalities are combined, the noncooperative equi-
librium outcome is ambiguous: it involves excessively low taxes if the horizontal
externalities dominate the vertical externalities. Canada again provides an important ex-
ample because most provincial governments levy their personal income tax as a fraction
of the federal income tax. On top of this, each province levies a surtax on high-income
residents. The bias in the perceived marginal cost of taxation caused by tax base overlap
may explain why Canadian provinces have introduced high-income surtaxes when tax
competition for mobile high-income taxpayers predicts the reverse.
20.2.6
Tax Exporting
Inanycountrysomeofthecommoditiesthataresoldwithinitsborderswillbepurchased
by nonresidents (especially cross-border shoppers). This will be particularly true if the
country is important in the context of international tourism. It will also be encouraged
under ﬁscal federalism with a single market covering all jurisdictions. Similarly some
of the productive activity carried out in a country will be undertaken by ﬁrms that
repatriate their proﬁts to another country. Whenever there is such economic activity by
nonresidents, the possibility for tax exporting arises.
Tax exporting is the levying of taxes that discriminate against nonresidents. Asimple
example would be the imposition of a higher level of VAT on restaurants located in
centers of tourism. The motive for such tax exporting is to shift some of the burden of

678
Part VII: Multiple Jurisdictions
revenue collection onto nonresidents and to lower it on residents. All else held constant,
this is clearly of beneﬁt to residents. However, all else is not constant in practice, and
the same argument will apply to all countries.As for tax overlap, tax exporting provides
an argument for why tax rates may be set too high when countries compete.
Another form of tax exporting is the taxation of capital employed in the country
but owned by nonresidents. The simplest version of this form of tax exporting can be
described with the previous model of tax competition by assuming that country 1’s
residents have a capital endowment k1 > 0 that differs from that of country 2, k1 ̸= k2.
Capital owners in each country are free to invest their capital in their home country or
abroad. The level of social welfare in country 1 is measured by the net income of its
workers, y1 = f (k1) −f ′(k1)k1 + t1k1, where k1 is the amount of capital employed in
country 1, plus the net income of its capital owners, ρk1. The capital market-clearing
condition requires that
k1 −k1 = −

k2 −k2

.
(20.26)
That is, if k1 < k1, country 1 is employing less capital than its endowment, and its net
export of capital has to be equal to the net import of capital from country 2. For country
1 the problem is to set its tax t1 on capital given the tax of country 2 so as to maximize
f (k1) −f ′(k1)k1 + t1k1 + ρk1,
(20.27)
where k1 = k1(t1, t2) is the amount of capital employed in country 1 given tax rates
t1, t2 and ρ is the net return to capital. Using ρ = f ′(k1) −t1, the objective function
can be written as follows:
W1 = f (k1) + ρ

k1 −k1

;
(20.28)
that is, country welfare is equal to total production f (k1) plus the net return to capital

. When deriving the ﬁrst-order condition, we must differentiate W1
with respect to t1, taking into account the change in capital supply dk1

(20.31)
with f ′′
i < 0. Therefore in any equilibrium, if country 1 has the larger endowment of
capital so that k1 > k2, it will export capital (k1 < k1) and prefer to subsidize capital,
t1 < 0. The reason is the terms-of-trade effect. By subsidizing capital, the country
with large endowment of capital can raise the net return to capital. Because the other
country will import capital from country 1, it will tax capital, t2 > 0, as a means of
taxing nonresidents. This is the tax-exporting effect. Next, note that the initial asym-
metry in capital endowments leads countries to set different tax rates. This nonuniform
tax equilibrium has important implications in terms of productive efﬁciency. Indeed
the efﬁcient allocation of capital requires its marginal product to be equalized across
countries. But because country 1 subsidizes capital and country 2 taxes it, the marginal
product of capital is higher in country 2 than in country 1, f ′
2 > f ′
1. Therefore, in
equilibrium, country 1 attracts too much capital and country 2 too little, relative to
what efﬁciency recommends.
20.2.7
Efﬁcient Tax Competition
Tax competition has been seen as producing wasteful competition. There are circum-
stances, however, where tax competition may be welfare enhancing. We consider two
examples.
The ﬁrst example is the case where countries seek to give a competitive advantage
to their own ﬁrms by offering wasteful subsidies. In equilibrium all countries will do
this, so the effect of each country’s subsidy cancels out with that of the others. Since
the subsidies cancel, no country gains an advantage, and all countries will be better off
giving no subsidy. This is the prisoners’dilemma once again. Tax competition may help
overcome this inefﬁcient outcome by allowing ﬁrms to locate wherever they choose
and preventing governments from discriminating between domestic and foreign ﬁrms
operating within a country. The mobility of the ﬁrms will force governments to rec-
ognize that their subsidy will not only give a competitive advantage to their domestic
ﬁrms but that it will also attract ﬁrms from other countries. Because the government
cannot discriminate between the domestic and foreign ﬁrms operating within its bor-
ders, it will have to pay the subsidy to both types of ﬁrms, thereby eliminating the

680
Part VII: Multiple Jurisdictions
competitive advantage. Therefore mobility eliminates the potential gains from the
subsidy and raises its cost by extending its payment to foreign ﬁrms.
Tax competition can therefore improve welfare by reducing the incentive for coun-
triestoresorttowastefulsubsidiestoprotecttheirownindustries. Noticethatthenondis-
crimination requirement plays a crucial role in making tax competition welfare
improving. If discrimination were possible, then governments could continue to give
wasteful subsidies to their domestic ﬁrms.
The second example is the use of tax competition as a commitment device. In the tax
competition model, governments independently announce tax rates and then the owners
of capital choose where to invest. A commitment problem arises here because the
governments are able to revise their tax rates after investment decisions are made. If
there were a single government and investment decision were irreversible, then this
government would have an incentive to tax away all proﬁts. The capital owner would
anticipate this incentive when making its initial investment decision and choose not to
invest capital in such a country.
Tax competition may help solve this commitment problem. The reason is that inter-
governmental competition for capital would deter each government from taxing away
proﬁts within its borders because it would induce reallocation of capital between coun-
tries in response to differences in tax rates. Tax competition is a useful commitment
device as it induces governments to forgo their incentive to tax investment in an effort
to attract further investment or to maintain the existing investment level.
The original insight that tax competition leads to inefﬁciently low taxes and public
good provision was obtained in models with benevolent decision makers.An alternative
approach is to consider public ofﬁcials that seek in their decision-making to maximize
their own welfare and not necessarily that of their constituencies. From this perspec-
tive, tax competition may help discipline nonbenevolent governments. For instance,
if we view governments as “leviathans” mainly concerned with maximizing the size
of the public sector, then tax competition may improve welfare by limiting taxation
possibilities and thereby cutting down the size of government that would be otherwise
excessive. This argument suggests that the public sector should be smaller, the greater
the extent to which taxes and expenditures are decentralized. The evidence on this is,
however, mixed. In fact there is not much evidence on the relationship between ﬁscal
decentralization and the overall size of the public sector.
An analogous argument applies to governments with some degree of benevolence,
possibly due to electoral concerns. When political agency problems are introduced,
this inefﬁciency of competition among governments is no longer so clear. Intergov-
ernmental competition makes the costs of public programs more visible, as well as

681
Chapter 20: Fiscal Competition
their beneﬁts, in ways that make public ofﬁcials accountable for their decisions. Stated
brieﬂy, competition may induce government ofﬁcials to reduce waste and thus reduce
the effective price of public goods.
20.3
Income Distribution
When the powers for tax setting are devolved to individual jurisdictions, the Tiebout
hypothesis asserts that the outcome will be efﬁcient. The basis for this argument is that
there are enough jurisdictions for individuals to sort themselves into optimal locations.
For practical purposes it is not possible to appeal to this large-numbers assumption,
and questions need to be asked about the outcome that will emerge when only a small,
predetermined number of jurisdictions exist. The Tiebout hypothesis is also silent about
how the policy of a jurisdiction emerges. It is possible that equilibrium results in all
the residents of any jurisdiction being identical, so that there is no need to resolve
different points of view. More generally, though, it is necessary to explore the con-
sequences of political decision-making, expressed through elections, on the choice of
policy.
An important set of issues revolves around income distribution and the role that this
has in determining the composition of the population in jurisdictions. For instance, will
it always be the case that the rich wish to detach themselves from the poor so that they
can avoid being subject to redistributive taxation? Also, if they have the option, would
the poor wish to live with the rich? These questions are now explored under perfect
and imperfect mobility.
20.3.1
Perfect Mobility
Thedifﬁcultythatmobilityposesforredistributionisseenmoststronglyinthefollowing
example: Consider individuals who differ only in income level y and who can choose
to reside in one of the two available jurisdictions. The jurisdictions independently set a
constant tax rate t between 0 and 1 and pay a lump-sum transfer g subject to a budget
balance constraint. Individuals care only about their income after taxes and transfers,
so their preferences are given by
u(t, g; y) = g + [1 −t] y.
(20.32)
The tax-transfer pair (t, g) in each jurisdiction is chosen by some unspeciﬁed collective
decision rule (e.g., majority voting). We are looking for an equilibrium in which the

682
Part VII: Multiple Jurisdictions
two jurisdictions differ and offer different tax and transfer schemes, thereby inducing
the sorting of types across jurisdictions (as the Tiebout hypothesis would predict).
With no loss of generality, suppose that it is jurisdiction 1 that sets the higher tax rate.
Then, to attract any individuals, it must also provide a higher level of transfer, that is,
(t1, g1) > (t2, g2). Individuals with different income levels differ in their preferences
for redistribution. From (20.32), if a type y prefers the high-tax jurisdiction 1, then all
those with lower income levels will also prefer this jurisdiction. And, if a type y prefers
the low-tax jurisdiction 2, then all those with higher income levels will also prefer this
jurisdiction. Therefore, if both jurisdictions are occupied in equilibrium, there must
exist a separating type y∗who is just indifferent between the two tax schemes and all
those who are poorer, with y ≤y∗, join jurisdiction 1 and all those who are richer, with
y > y∗, join jurisdiction 2. That is, the jurisdiction undertaking more redistribution
attracts the poorest individuals.
However, this cannot be an equilibrium because the richest individual in the poor
jurisdiction loses out from intrajurisdictional redistribution and will prefer to move
to the rich jurisdiction and become a net beneﬁciary of redistribution as its poorest
resident. Therefore there cannot be an equilibrium with different tax-transfer schemes.
There remains the possibility of a symmetric equilibrium with individuals evenly
divided between the two jurisdictions. In other words, perfect mobility leads to har-
monization of tax-transfer schemes, even though agents differ in their preferences.
MobilitydoesnotleadtothesortingoftypesacrossjurisdictionsasTieboutpredicts. The
possibility for the rich to detach themselves from the poor to escape redistributive taxa-
tion induces jurisdictions either to abandon any taxation or to choose the same tax rate.
20.3.2
Imperfect Mobility
Suppose now that consumers have one of two income levels. Those with the higher
income level are termed the “rich,” and those with the lower income are the “poor.”
The two groups are imperfectly mobile but to different degrees. The rich (group 1) have
income 1 and poor (group 0) have income 0. For simplicity, there is an equal number
of poor and rich in the total population. The focus is placed on one of the jurisdictions
(e.g., region 1) and the proportions from each group residing there are denoted x1 and
x0, where the subscript denotes income group. The remainder, [1 −x1] and [1 −x0],
are located in the other jurisdiction. Redistribution implies that the rich are subject to
taxation and the poor are recipients of a transfer. Accordingly, each jurisdiction levies
a head tax t on its rich residents to pay a transfer b to each of its poor residents. The
feasible choices are restricted by the budget constraint tx1 = bx0.

683
Chapter 20: Fiscal Competition
In addition to income differences each individual is characterized by a preference
for location x, with 0 ≤x ≤1, where a low x implies a preference for region 1 and a
high x implies a preference for region 2. It is assumed that x is uniformly distributed
within income groups. Individuals care only about their net income and their location.
Given the pair of transfers (b, b∗) in the two regions, the payoff of a poor individual
with preference x is
b −d0x
in region 1,
b∗−d0 [1 −x]
in region 2,
(20.33)
where d0 measures the degree of attachment to location of the poor, with higher at-
tachment equivalent to lower mobility. Given the tax pair (t, t∗), the payoff of a rich
individual with preference x is

Given the tax policies, the population is divided between the two regions. The
proportion of poor joining region 1, x = x0, is deﬁned by the type that is indifferent
between the two regions, so

Taxing more drives out some of the rich (i.e., x1 decreases with t).

region 1 sets its tax rate t, taking as given the tax rate of the other, t∗, so as to maximize

many rich to leave that the poor will ﬁnd it better to follow them. In such circumstances
the poor will chase affer the rich.

685

Putting these points together the (symmetric) equilibrium tax choice can be de-
termined. Region 1 chooses its tax rate t so as to maximize the transfer to its poor
residents b taking as given the tax choice of the other region and correctly anticipating
the migration responses of the rich and the poor. The necessary ﬁrst-order condition is

Consequentlytheequilibriumlevelofredistributivetaxationisinverselyproportional
to the difference in the mobility of the rich and the poor. Higher mobility of the rich
reduces taxation, but this is partially offset by the mobility of the poor. The reasoning
behind this is that in equilibrium the poor chase after the rich, so it is not possible for
the rich to detach themselves from the poor.
The same logic applies in modelling capital and labor mobility. By extension, the
possibility for taxing capital increases with the mobility of labor, so the problem of tax
competition is more connected to the relative mobility of capital with respect to the
mobility of labor.
20.3.3
Race to the Bottom

competitionareatwork, anyattemptatredistributionortheprovisionofsocialinsurance
in a country would be impossible because it would induce emigration of those who were
supposed to give (the rich) and immigration of those who were supposed to receive
(the poor). The most extreme predictions of this form imply a “race to the bottom” but

686
Part VII: Multiple Jurisdictions
receive little theoretical or empirical support. This is probably due to the presence of
signiﬁcant costs and barriers to migration.
Forexample, welfareshoppingisdiscouragedinEuropebyportabilitylimitsbetween
member states and by the eligibility requirement of previous employment in the country.
However, underprovision of social insurance in an integrated market is an issue that
cannot be ignored in the European Union. Even if it has not been a pressing issue to date,
ﬁscal competition for capital and labor factors has already arrived. The Irish success
with reduced corporation taxes suggests that with the EU enlargement this issue will
become ever more evident.
20.4
Intergovernmental Transfers
The reasons for organizing intergovernmental transfers are twofold: efﬁciency and
redistribution. We consider the two in turn.
20.4.1
Efﬁciency
A critical insight from the analysis of tax competition is that increasing the tax rate in
one region beneﬁts other regions by increasing their tax bases. We now consider how
transfers between regions can be employed to secure efﬁciency.
If we take the tax base to be the capital stock and the aggregate supply of capital to
be ﬁxed, then the tax-induced outﬂow of capital from the region taxing more represents
an inﬂow of capital to the other regions. In particular, another region j beneﬁts from
increased revenue by the amount tjkj, where tj is its tax rate and kj the ﬁscally
induced capital inﬂow. The problem facing each region is to choose the tax rate on
capital to ﬁnance the public good level that maximizes the welfare of its residents
subject to the budget constraint G = tk(t). The optimal regional level of a public good
is given by the fact that the marginal beneﬁt of public good MB must be high enough
to not only cover its marginal cost, MC, but also to offset the negative impact of capital
outﬂow on tax revenue, denoted by tk < 0. Then, following the modiﬁed Samuelson
rule, we obtain
MB = MC −tk.
(20.48)
The context of identical regions provides a useful reference for isolating the ﬁscal-
externality inefﬁciency from other equity and efﬁciency aspects that would arise when
regions differ and choose different tax rates and public good levels. With identical tax

687
Chapter 20: Fiscal Competition
rates, t, the cost of a capital outﬂow from one region is exactly offset by the beneﬁts
from the resulting capital inﬂows to other regions. It follows that if regions were to take
into account such external beneﬁts, they would no longer perceive capital outﬂows as
a cost. The efﬁcient provision of public good (as given by the usual Samuelson rule)
would then obtain with
MB = MC.
(20.49)
The central authority can achieve this efﬁcient outcome by means of revenue-matching
grants. The idea is to correct the externality by providing a subsidy to the revenue raised
by each region. The matching rate to a region is the additional revenue that accrues to
otherregionswhenthisregionraisesitstaxrate. Thenregionsarecorrectlycompensated
for the positive externalities generated when they raise their taxes.
Differences among regions bring about a second inefﬁciency from tax competition,
namely that different tax rates induce a misallocation of capital across regions, such
that the marginal product of capital is relatively high in high-tax regions (see ﬁgure
20.3). It follows that matching rates should be differentiated to induce all regions to
choose the same tax rate and at the same time to internalize the ﬁscal externality. Tax
harmonization requires the payment of a higher subsidy to regions with a low prefer-
ence for taxation and public goods. In practice, however, the central government may
not have the political authority nor the information required to impose differentiated
matching grants. The information problem is rather severe because all regions can
claim to be of the low-tax type in order to obtain a higher subsidy. With tax overlap,
the matching rate will be negative to represent the reduction in tax revenues for other
levels of government when the region raises additional revenue from the common tax
base (see ﬁgure 20.4).
Expenditure externalities can also be corrected with expenditure-matching grants.
For example, spending by a local government on education or public infrastructure im-
proves the potential earnings of its residents by making them more productive, and this
will increase the federal government’s revenue from income, payroll, and sales taxes.
To induce the local government to internalize this vertical expenditure externality, the
federal authority can use expenditure-matching grants. Matching grant programs spec-
ify that the federal government matches on a dollar-for-dollar basis local expenditure up
to some maximum. The effect is to lower the price of local public goods and thereby off-
set the tendency for local governments to under provide public expenditures generating
positive externalities.
An important example of vertical expenditure externalities in Canada is the sub-
stitutability between expenditures on unemployment beneﬁts at the federal level and

welfare beneﬁts at the provincial level. If the federal government reduces unemploy-
ment beneﬁts or their duration, more people will apply for welfare beneﬁts, increasing
spending at the provincial level. Conversely, employment programs by provincial gov-
ernment that allow welfare recipients to regain eligibility to unemployment beneﬁts
will lead to higher spending at the federal level.
In the United States, until 1996, the federal government could bear 50 to 80 percent
of the cost of some welfare expenditures undertaken by states (e.g., Aid to Families
with Dependent Children, Food Stamp, and Medicaid programs). In 1996 the AFDC
matchingsystemwasreplacedbyalump-sumgrant. Interestingly, asillustratedinﬁgure
20.5, this matching system has proved to be more effective in stimulating local public
expenditures than a lump-sum subsidy of the same amount. The reason is simply that the
lump-sum grant can be used in any way the recipient wishes, in contrast to the matching
grantthatisincreasingwiththeamountofpublicspending. Inthisperspective, matching
grants are also called “conditional” grants because they place some restrictions on their
use by the recipient, and the lump-sum grants are called “unconditional” grants. Figure
20.5 also indicates the distortionary effect of matching grants: higher welfare can be
attained at the same cost with lump-sum grants. This is the advantage of the freedom
of choice that “unconditional” grants provide.
The attraction of matching grants is to internalize expenditure externalities. However,
lump-sum grants also have their own attraction, which is to maintain ﬁscal discipline

689
Chapter 20: Fiscal Competition
(at the heart of the EMU). The idea here is that by creating a hard budget constraint, they
impose very useful discipline on decentralized expenditure decisions. More generally,
a hard-budget constraint implies that decentralized governments must place a basic
reliance on their own sources of revenue and must not be overly dependent on transfers
from the federal government. Self-ﬁnancing is a powerful incentive device, and it is
essential that local governments do not turn to the federal authority to bail them out of
ﬁscal difﬁculties by resorting to expansible matching grants.
20.4.2
Redistribution
Intergovernmental grants are also used to channel resources from wealthy jurisdictions
to poorer ones. Such transfers are based on equalization formulas that measure the ﬁscal
need and ﬁscal capacity of each jurisdiction, locality, or province. Fiscal equalization
then involves higher grants to those jurisdictions with the greatest ﬁscal need and
the least ﬁscal capacity. If the objective is to equalize taxable capacity, the central
government can supplement the revenue base of poorer jurisdictions by matching any
revenues they collect by the addition of a further percentage. This form of equalization
is sometimes called “power equalization.”
In practice, equalization grants play a major role in countries like Australia,
Denmark, Canada, Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland and involve substantial trans-
fers from wealthy to poor jurisdictions. In the United States such equalizing grants have
never played an important role in allowing poorer states to compete effectively with
ﬁscally stronger ones, but the equalization formula has been the basis of local school
district ﬁnance in many states.
Typically an equalization system sets the transfer to each region equal to the differ-
ence between its observed tax base and the average tax base of all regions, multiplied
by some standard tax rate, usually equal to the average tax among all the regions. Ac-
cordingly, if bi is the tax base of region i with b the average tax base among regions
and t the average tax rate, then the equalization transfer to region i is given by
Ti = t[b −bi] ≷0
for bi ≶b.
(20.50)
The use of the average tax rate as the standard tax rate is to accommodate a di-
versity of regional spending behavior. The intention is that equalization compensates
for a difference in ﬁscal capacities but not for the difference in preferences for public
spending. Indeed, when all regions choose the same tax rate, the formula guarantees
equal revenues. The equalization formula can also correct for ﬁscal externalities. A tax
cut by one region increases not only its tax base at the expense of other regions but

690
Part VII: Multiple Jurisdictions
also relative to the average tax base, thereby reducing the entitlement of this region to
equalization grants.
Fiscal equalization is a contentious issue. In some cases, as in Canada, it may provide
the cement that holds the bricks of the federation together. In other cases, like Italy or
Belgium, it may become the source of division, where rich regions weary of large and
durable transfers to poor regions, actually seek the break up of the federation.
20.4.3
Flypaper Effect
When considering the budgetary decisions of the recipients of intergovernmental grants,
models of rational choice suggest that the response to a lump-sum grant should be
roughly the same as the response to an equal increase in income resulting from a federal
tax cut. But empirical studies of the response to grants have rejected this equivalence.
There is instead strong evidence that local government spending is more sensitive to
grants than it is to increasing income through tax cuts.
Among the best estimates of this for the United States: the marginal propensity for
state and local governments to spend out of personal income in the state is about 10
percent, but the marginal propensity for state and local governments to spend out of
grants from the federal level is around 80 to 90 percent. This has been known as the
“ﬂypaper effect” to say that money sticks where it hits. This is intriguing because it
suggests that the same budget could give rise to different choices depending on what
form the increment to the budget takes. It has been suggested that this may reﬂect
the behavioral regularity that money on hand (from grants) has a different effect on
spending than when the money must be raised (by taxation).
This can be understood with the following thought experiment. Say you have lost
your ticket for the cinema and you must decide whether to buy a new one. Now suppose
instead that you lose the same amount of money, would you be as willing to buy the
ticket in the ﬁrst place. Although in both cases you face exactly the same budget
constraint, it is less likely that you will buy the new ticket after losing the original one
than if you lost the equivalent amount of money.
The ﬂy paper effect also casts serious doubt as to the notion that local governments
are more responsive to local demand. Indeed, from the estimates above, one might think
that if the local government were strictly responding to local demand, $100 per capita
of federal grants would lead to about $90 per capita tax reduction and $10 additional
spending. It is, of course, entirely the other way around, with about $90 additional
spending and $10 of reduced local taxes.

Evidence
20.5.1
Race to the Bottom
The central result of the tax competition model is that increasing mobility of capital
will drive down the equilibrium tax on capital. This canonical model is at the heart of
concerns about capital tax competition within the European Union. In response to this
growing concern, the OECD published a report (OECD 1998) comprising about twenty
recommendationstocounterwhatwasperceivedas“harmful”taxcompetitionofcapital
income. This issue was also taken seriously by the European Union in December 1997.
The EU commission agreed to a “Code of Conduct” in business taxation, as part of
a “package to tackle harmful tax competition.” The Code is aimed at identifying tax
measures that reduce the level of tax paid below the “usual” level. In particular, a
measure is considered “harmful” if the tax advantage is restricted only to nonresidents,
or if it is “ring-fenced” from the domestic market, or if the tax break is granted without
any real economic activity taking place.
The central motivation for these reforms is the race to the bottom in capital taxation.
To appreciate the relevance of this, we should evaluate the existence and magnitude
of this race to the bottom. Table 20.1 shows the statutory corporate income tax rates
in 1982 and 2001 for a group of EU and G7 countries. The statutory tax rate includes
local tax rates and any supplementary charges made. Except for Italy and Ireland, all
countries have signiﬁcantly reduced their statutory tax rate. In 1982, Ireland had the
lowest rate at 10 percent and Germany the highest rate at 64 percent, while both the
United States and the United Kingdom had a rate around 50 percent. In 2001, Ireland
had still the lowest rate at 10 percent but both Germany and the United States had
reduced their rate just below 40 percent, and the rate in the United Kingdom was down
to 30 percent. Over the same periodAustria, Finland, and Sweden had cut their statutory
rate by more than one-half.
Table 20.2 shows the fall in the median statutory corporate income tax rates over the
last two decades for the same group of countries. Between 1982 and 2001, the median
statutory tax rate for this group fell from 50 percent to 35 percent. The statutory tax
rate is likely to be important in determining the incentive for ﬁrms to shift investment
between countries. However, the tax base is also likely to be relevant. A higher tax
rate does not necessarily imply higher tax payments, since effective tax payments also
depend on the deﬁnition of the tax base. Governments with different tax rates can also
adjust their rates of depreciation allowances for capital expenditure. The rate allowed

for ﬁrms to spread the cost of capital against tax varies considerably across countries.
Adjusting the statutory tax rate to take account of this effect and other difference in
tax base, we obtain the “effective” average tax rate. It measures the proportion of total
proﬁt taken in tax. The evolution of the “effective” rate does not replicate the statutory
rate. There is a decline from 43 percent in 1982 to 32 percent in 2001, but the fall is less
pronounced than for the statutory rate. The lower fall in the effective rates indicates that
the reduction in the statutory rates has been partially offset by less generous allowances
for capital expenditures (broader tax base).

Chapter 20: Fiscal Competition
20.5.2
Race to the Top
It is natural for economists to think that competition among jurisdictions can stimulate
public decision makers to act more efﬁciently and limit their discretion to pursue objec-
tives that are not congruent with the interest of their constituency. Tests of this hypoth-
esis have led to substantial empirical research investigating whether intergovernmental
competition through ﬁscal decentralization affects public expenditures.
The evidence as reviewed in Oates (1999) supports strongly the conclusion that in-
creased competition tends to restrict government spending. But the fact that spending
falls with more competition does not mean that resources are more efﬁciently allocated
as competition increases. The problem is that it is hard to come up with measures of the
quality of locally provided public services. However, there is one notable exception,
that is education where standardized test scores and postgraduation earnings pro-
vide performance measures that are easily comparable across districts. Following this
strategy, Hoxby (2000) ﬁnds that greater competition among school districts has a sig-
niﬁcant effect both in improving educational performances and reducing expenditures
per student.
Besley and Case (1995) develop and test a political model of yardstick competition
in which voters are poorly informed about the true cost of a public good provision.
They use data on state taxes and gubernatorial election outcomes in the United States.
The theoretical idea is to see how much of a tax increase is due to the economic en-
vironment and how much to the quality of their local government, so voters can use
the performance in other jurisdictions as a “yardstick” to obtain an assessment of the
relative performance of their own government. The empirical evidence supports the
prediction that yardstick competition does indeed inﬂuence local tax setting. From
that perspective intergovernmental competition is good for disciplining politicians and
limiting wasteful public spending.
20.5.3
Tax Mimicking
Asubstantial body of empirical studies has emerged testing for interdependence among
jurisdictions in tax and expenditure choices. An early and very inﬂuential piece of work
is by Case et al. (1993) who test a model in which a state’s expenditure may generate
spillovers to nearby states. The novelty of this work is that it allows for spatially
correlated shocks as well as spillovers. Data from a group of states showed strong
evidence of ﬁscal interdependence and the effects arising from interdependence to be

694
Part VII: Multiple Jurisdictions
large. A dollar increase in spending in one state induced neighboring states to increase
their own spending by seventy cents.
Brueckner and Saavedra (2001) test for the presence of strategic competition among
local governments using data for seventy cities in the Boston metropolitan area. Where
capital is the mobile factor and population ﬁxed, local jurisdictions were found to
choose property tax rates that take into account the mobility of capital in response to
tax differentials. Property taxes are the only important source of local revenue. The au-
thors use spatial econometric methods to relate the property tax rate in one community
to its own characteristics and to the tax rates in competing communities. They found
that the tax rate in one locality is positively and signiﬁcantly related to tax rates in con-
tiguous localities. This means that the tax interdependence generates upward-sloping
reaction functions. The same conclusion was obtained with similar methodology by
Heyndels and Vuchelen (1998) in their study of property-tax mimicking among Belgian
municipalities.
Turning to welfare migration, Saavedra (1998) uses spatial econometric estimates of
cross-sectional welfare beneﬁts (AFDC) for the years 1985, 1990, and 1995 for all states
in the continental United States. She ﬁnds strong evidence that a given state’s welfare
beneﬁt choice is affected by the beneﬁt levels in nearby states for each year. Moreover
her ﬁndings show signiﬁcant and positive spatial interdependence, suggesting that
a given state will increase its beneﬁt level as beneﬁts in nearby states rise.
20.6
Conclusions
Competition may be thought of as a means to secure better ﬁscal performance, or at least
exposes ﬁscal inefﬁciency. If market competition by private ﬁrms provides households
with what they want at least cost, why cannot intergovernmental competition lead to
better governmental activities? Poorly performing governments will lose out, and better
performing ones will be rewarded. Although appealing, the analogy can be misleading,
and the competitive model is not directly transferable to ﬁscal competition among
governments. Once there is more than one jurisdiction, the possibility is opened for a
range of ﬁscal externalities to emerge. Such externalities can be positive, as with tax
competition, and lead to tax rates that are too low. Competition among governments
to render high-quality services may give way to competition for undercutting tax rates
to attract mobile factors from neighboring jurisdictions. Given capital mobility, any
attempt by local government to impose a net tax on capital will drive out capital until
its net return is raised to that available elsewhere. The revenue gain from the higher

695
Chapter 20: Fiscal Competition
tax rate will be more than offset by an income loss to workers due to the reduction
in the locally employed capital stock. Fiscal harmonization across jurisdictions would
be unanimously preferred. Alternatively, the externalities can be negative, as with tax
overlapping, and put upward pressure on tax rates. This is the common pool problem
leading to overspending and overtaxation.
Interestingly, when there is no clear division of power, there is competition between
central and local governments not only for the same tax base but also for the same local
voter base. The federal government is competing with the local government for the
provision of what might otherwise be local government services (child care, education,
police, etc.). The implication of that is the overexpansion of public spending. To make
things worse, tax bases as well as consumers of public services are mobile and need not
move together. By voting with their feet to sanction inefﬁcient government, consumers
of public services can move to escape ﬁscal obligations rather than to obtain efﬁcient
public services. At the extreme, given household mobility, public services may be used
and beneﬁts may be received in one region, while income is derived and taxes are paid
in another.
Such externalities can be corrected, and intergovernmental transfers are one means
of doing so. Grants may be either conditional (matching grants and categorical grants)
or unconditional (lump-sum block grants). Each type of grant involves different incen-
tives and induces different behaviors of local governments. The ﬁnal mix of increased
expenditure versus lower local taxes depends on the preferences guiding local choices.
Empirical studies are essential to compare the costs and beneﬁts of intergovernmental
competition. The presence of ﬁscal interaction between jurisdictions is not compelling
evidence of harmful tax competition. Tax interactions can also be due to a political effect
where electoral concern induces local governments to mimic tax-setting in neighboring
jurisdictions. In such a case competition can be an effective instrument to discipline
and control ofﬁcials.
Recall the question raised at the beginning of this chapter on the analogy between
market competition and government competition. The main lesson from the ﬁscal com-
petition theory is that intergovernmental competition limits the set of actions and
policies available to each government. There is no doubt that the constraints that are im-
posed on the authority of governments do constrain or limit actions, and this way both
“good” and “bad” actions can be forestalled. Whether or not we view intergovernmen-
tal competition as harmful depends on our perception of the quality of governments.
Unconstrained actions of a benevolent governments are good, but they can be very
costly when governments abuse power.

A car manufacturer can choose to locate a new plant in country A or country B. Your job is
to determine where to locate this new plant. The only inputs used in car production are labor
and capital, and the production function is Cobb–Douglas: F(L, K) = L1/2K1/2, where L
is the labor input and K the capital input. In country A, labor costs $7 per unit and capital
costs $7 per unit, while in country B, labor costs more ($8) but capital costs less ($6).

Issues in International Taxation
21.1
Introduction
The recent explosion of globalization has followed a reduction of institutional barriers
to the free movement of goods, services, and factors of production. The effect that
this has had on trade between nations is dramatic: world GDP has increased by a
multiple of ﬁve since 1960 but the volume of world trade has increased by a multiple
of eleven. It has also become easier and cheaper to move production facilities and
corporate headquarters between countries. This in turn allows taxable proﬁts to be
shifted between tax jurisdictions. The political landscape has changed as well, with
national governments having to accept constraints upon their ability to unilaterally
implement policy. These constraints can derive from membership of institutions such
as the European Union, from agreement to tax treaties, and from the mobility of the
tax base.
The series of issues we consider in this chapter derive from the incentives of ﬁrms
and consumers to exploit international tax differentials to their advantage. The process
of globalization has enhanced these incentives with consequences for the tax choices of
individual countries and the willingness to participate in international agreements.
Some of the issues have been brought into sharp focus by the continuing evolution
of the European Union. The ever-closer economic union between member states and,
in particular, the completion of the single market in 1993 increased the mobility of
ﬁrms and made it legal for consumers to purchase anywhere in the European Union
at the local tax rate. This has raised questions about the design of an appropriate tax
structure for a customs union and has lead to several new policy initiatives. The is-
sues facing the European Union have been the motivation for much recent research
but the process of globalization makes many of the issues of signiﬁcant worldwide
relevance.
The ﬁrst section considers the characterization of international efﬁciency and em-
phasizes that efﬁciency has to be deﬁned relative to mobility. One consequence of
globalization has been the increased international mobility of capital. We look at the
implications of mobility for the taxation of capital in general, and the corporation in
particular. Increased internationalization of ﬁrms with production in many different
countries allows a ﬁrm to choose where to produce and, to some extent, where to
earn proﬁt. Firms can relocate proﬁt through the transfer prices used to account for

704
Part VII: Multiple Jurisdictions
transactions between divisions. We analyze the effect of taxation on transfer pricing
and assess policies used to mitigate the practice. The focus is then placed more directly
on the issue of taxation and location choice. Some empirical evidence is reviewed. The
chapter then moves onto the design of indirect taxes in an international setting. The
beneﬁts of harmonization are considered and alternative tax principles are assessed.
The chapter is completed by a study of tariff policy and the role of trade agreements in
liberalizing trade.
21.2
International Efﬁciency
In a closed economy production efﬁciency is achieved when the ratio of the marginal
products of any two inputs is the same in the production of all goods. When this
condition is attained, it is not possible to reallocate inputs to increase the output of one
good without reducing the output of another. The discussion of commodity taxation
in chapter 15 demonstrated that Pareto-efﬁciency is achieved when ﬁnal consumption
goods are taxed but intermediate inputs are not. The key property of a value-added tax
(VAT) is that it is designed to achieve precisely this outcome. With a VAT producers
can reclaim the tax paid on the inputs they use, so only the value added at each stage
of the production process is taxed. At the end of the production process the sum of
value added is equal to the ﬁnal consumption value. This appealing property of VAT is
one of the reasons for the increasing number of countries using the system. The United
States remains a notable exception, which brings to mind the famous quip about when
the United States will ﬁnally move to a VAT. As the New York Times reported way
back in 1988, Larry Summers predicted that the United States will have a VAT when
liberals ﬁgure out that it is a money machine and conservatives see that it is a tax on
the poor.
In an international setting there are additional considerations that need to be taken
into account in order to describe an efﬁcient allocation. The criteria that must be satisﬁed
for efﬁciency have to include the allocation of production and consumption within and
across countries. The important additional point is that the characterization of efﬁciency
across countries depends on the degree of mobility of factors and goods. To see this,
consider an extreme case where factors of production are absolutely immobile. In this
case efﬁciency has to be deﬁned with the initial factor allocation taken as given even
if a reallocation of factors across countries could achieve an increase in world output.
In contrast, if factors are freely mobile, then their allocation across countries must be
determined as part of the description of an efﬁcient location.

705
Chapter 21: Issues in International Taxation
21.2.1
Efﬁcient Allocations
These points are now developed by considering a world with two countries, A and B,
and two inputs, K and L. The inputs are in ﬁxed supply but may be mobile between the
countries. The inputs are used to produce a single output in each country. The efﬁcient
allocation of inputs is found by considering the decision problem of a world social
planner. The constraints on the optimization reﬂect the mobility of factors.
Suppose that initially the inputs and the produced good are perfectly mobile between
the countries. This implies that it does not matter in which country production takes
place. The efﬁcient outcome is then described by the allocation of capital and labor to
the two countries that maximizes the sum of outputs
max
{KA,KB,LA,LB} Y A + Y B.
(21.1)
This optimization is subject to the production constraints
Y A = F(KA, LA),
Y B = F(KB, LB),
(21.2)
and the constraints on input use
K = KA + KB,
L = LA + LB.
(21.3)
NotethattheoutputlevelcanbewrittenY A + Y B = F(KA, LA) + F(K −KA, L −LA).
So the necessary condition for the allocation of capital is
FK(KA, LA) = FK(K −KA, L −LA),
(21.4)
and the necessary condition for labor is
FL(KA, LA) = FL(K −KA, L −LA).
(21.5)
In this case production efﬁciency requires the marginal product of each input to be the
same in both countries. These are arbitrage conditions that require identical returns on
each input in the two countries and are a consequence of the mobility of the two factors.
These conditions are more restrictive than the more familiar efﬁciency condition for
the closed economy involving the ratio of marginal products. We can divide (21.4) by
(21.5) to show that the arbitrage conditions imply the standard efﬁciency condition
FK(KA, LA)
FL(KA, LA) = FK(KB, LB)
FL(KB, LB) .
(21.6)

706
Part VII: Multiple Jurisdictions
The consequences of different assumptions on mobility are now considered. If one
of the factors was immobile, then the efﬁciency condition for the other factor must be
deﬁned with respect to the ﬁxed allocation. For example, if labor was immobile, then
there is only the efﬁciency condition for capital
FK(KA, ¯LA) −FK(K −KA, ¯LB) = 0.
(21.7)
In this case the ratio condition (21.6) does not apply because the immobility of labor
prevents the ratio of marginal products from being equalized.
Alternatively, if it is assumed that the factors of production are mobile but the ﬁnal
product is not, then the allocation of production between countries matters. The efﬁcient
allocation solves
max
{KA,KB,LA,LB} F(KA, LA),
(21.8)
subject to the constraints that
F(KB, LB) = ¯Y B
(21.9)
and
K = KA + KB, L = LA + LB,
(21.10)
where ¯Y B is some ﬁxed level of output in country B. The solution to this optimization
is characterized by the standard efﬁciency condition for input use (21.6) and the cons-
traint (21.9).
These examples illustrate the general principle that the characterization of an efﬁcient
allocation depends on the mobility of factors of production and the ﬁnal product. This
observation is important for judging the efﬁciency, or otherwise, of tax systems and
policies.
21.2.2
Markets and Efﬁciency
In a closed economy the operation of a competitive market ensures that an efﬁcient
outcome is achieved. The same claim is valid for an open economy provided that
the market has the same degree of mobility of the factors and product as the planned
outcome. This need not be the case. For example, capital may be mobile from the
perspective of a world social planner, but arbitrary regulations may prevent it being
mobile in the market setting. The market will then not achieve efﬁciency. In the absence

707
Chapter 21: Issues in International Taxation
of any differences in mobility, it can be asserted that the competitive market will achieve
a Pareto-efﬁcient equilibrium.
The extent to which efﬁciency is achieved when there is monopoly (or any form of
imperfect competition) needs a more detailed analysis. The mobility of the factors and
the ﬁnal product restrict the choices of the ﬁrm in the same way that they restricted the
choices of the social planner.
Assume ﬁrst that the product and the factors are both mobile. The total output of the
monopolist is divided between the supplies, xA and xB, to the two countries. Hence
xA + xB = F(KA, LA) + F(KB, LB).
(21.11)
The ﬁrm chooses the allocation of inputs to maximize proﬁt
π = xApA(xA) + xBpB(xB) −rKA −rKB −wLA −wLB,
(21.12)
subject to (21.11). The assumption of a common rental rate, r, for capital and wage
rate, w, for labor is a consequence of the mobility assumption: if the factors are mobile,
then the prices must be the same in the two countries. The optimization has necessary
conditions
pA + xApA′ = pB + xBpB′,
(21.13)
FKA = FKB,
(21.14)
FLA = FLB,
(21.15)
where pA′ and pB′ are the derivatives of the inverse demand functions. The ﬁrst condi-
tion determines the allocation of output across markets to equalize marginal revenues.
The second and third are the efﬁciency conditions that the social planner achieves with
full mobility. The ﬁrm therefore allocates the inputs it uses between the two countries
using the same criterion as the social planner.
Consider now the case where the product cannot be transported. Then the output
must be used to supply the market in which it is produced. The proﬁt of the monopoly
ﬁrm is
π =

j=A,B

F(Kj, Lj)pj(F(Kj, Lj)) −rKj −wLj
.
(21.16)
The necessary conditions are
FKA[pA + FpA′] = FKB[pB + FpB′],
(21.17)
FLA[pA + FpA′] = FLB[pB + FpB′].
(21.18)

708
Part VII: Multiple Jurisdictions
Dividing the conditions for Ki, i = A, B, by those for Li gives
FKA
FLA = FKB
FLB .
(21.19)
This condition requires that the ratio of marginal products be equal. This is the standard
between-ﬁrm efﬁciency condition for the allocation of inputs, and again, it is the same
as the efﬁciency condition for the social planner under these mobility assumptions.
The allocation of inputs by a proﬁt-maximizing monopolist and the allocation by a
social planner are characterized by the same efﬁciency conditions. Therefore the inputs
used by the monopolist are allocated efﬁciently between countries. This does not mean
that monopoly will achieve an identical outcome to the social planner because the
monopolist produces less output than is efﬁcient in order to increase price and extract
a rent. More precisely, what the results show is that given the chosen level of output,
the monopolist will efﬁciently allocate inputs.
21.2.3
Taxation and Efﬁciency
It is now possible to assess the desirability of production efﬁciency when governments
use commodity taxes to raise revenue. In a closed economy the Diamond–Mirrlees
lemma shows that production efﬁciency should be maintained. This conclusion was
established by the argument that a move from an inefﬁcient point inside the production
set would be beneﬁcial provided that there was a good that all consumers enjoyed (or
one that all disliked).
This argument does not extend directly to an open economy. The reason for this
is that each country has a separate government budget constraint. The effect of these
budget constraints is to make it more difﬁcult to ﬁnd a direction of movement from
a point inside the world production possibility set that beneﬁts all consumers in all
countries simultaneously. Since a potentially beneﬁcial move may adversely affect the
budget constraint of one or more governments, it will only be actually beneﬁcial if the
governments that lose can be compensated by those that gain. This problem does not
arise in the single-country case.
The production efﬁciency argument can only be established if compensatory trans-
fers between countries are permitted. If there are no such transfers, then production
inefﬁciency may be desirable. It is interesting to observe in this context that the op-
eration of the European Union has the features of a transfer scheme between member
states. The EU budget is funded by contributions from members states and is used to
ﬁnance payments to member states. The net effect is equivalent to transfers between

709
Chapter 21: Issues in International Taxation
member states. There is no claim that the transfers made by the European Union are
the ones required to support production efﬁciency and justify VAT, but it is interesting
to observe the existence of a system that could deliver the transfers.
21.3
Capital and Corporations
The growth of globalization has particularly strong implications for the taxation of
capital. Globalization has increased the mobility of capital, which has increased the
potential for tax competition to occur. Mobility has other implications. It can result in
capital being invested in one tax jurisdiction but the return paid to an owner located
in another. It can also result in a return being earned by the joint operation of capital
located in several different jurisdictions. Such outcomes raise questions about which
jurisdiction should have the right to tax the income ﬂows from the capital to the owners.
This section addresses these issues in the context of capital taxation generally and, in
more detail, for the taxation of corporate proﬁt in an international environment.
21.3.1
Capital Taxes
Capital taxes include taxes on corporate proﬁt, on interest income, on dividends from
the ownership of stock, and on the capital gains from asset ownership. It is important
for capital taxation in a globalized world that income can arise from an asset located
in one country and accrue to an individual located in another country. For example,
a ﬁrm that is headquartered in the United Kingdom may earn proﬁt by producing in
China and paying a dividend to a shareholder who is resident in the United States. This
multiplicity of international locations creates complexity in allocating capital income
to tax jurisdictions.
Capital income can be taxed on either a source basis or a residence basis. When
a source-based tax is in operation, the income from capital is taxed in the country
in which the income is generated. For example, a resident of the United States with
funds deposited in a German bank account will pay tax in Germany on the interest
added to the account. With a residence-based tax, income from capital is taxed in the
country of residence of the owner of the capital. For example, a UK resident who
owns shares in a US company will pay tax on the dividends in the United Kingdom.
The alternative systems have different incidence effects. These effects are now demon-
strated by considering a small open economy that takes the world return to capital as
given.

710
Part VII: Multiple Jurisdictions
The introduction of a source-based system implies that the return offered on invest-
ment in the country will have to rise by the amount of tax to ensure that the net-of-tax
return is equal to the ﬁxed world return. This can only happen if the capital stock in
the country falls (so that the marginal product of capital, and hence the return, rise),
which means that capital must ﬂow out of the country. The owners of capital will not be
affected by the tax, since they always earn the world return. Instead, the incidence will
fall upon the residents of the small open economy who earn income from non-mobile
factors of production.
In contrast, the introduction of a residence-based tax will not affect the return earned
by investors resident outside the country. This implies that the pre-tax return in the
country has to equal the world rate. If it did not, there would be an opportunity for
international investors to increase returns by investing in the country. Consequently
the post-tax return for domestic investors will be reduced by the level of the tax. The
cost of investment for the ﬁrms located in the country is not affected by the tax, so
investment decisions will not be affected. This places the incidence of the tax on the
owners of capital resident in the country.
The different effects of source and residence systems imply that they have different
neutrality properties. A tax is deﬁned as being neutral with respect to an economic
choice when it does not change the relative values of marginal beneﬁts and marginal
costs involved with that choice. The choice involved here concerns the ﬂows of capital
into and out of a country, and how the imposition of a tax system affects the location of
capitalacrosscountries.Asource-basedtaxappliesequallytoallcapitalwithinacountry
regardless of its country of origin. Therefore the source-based tax achieves capital
import neutrality provided that all countries exempt capital income earned abroad from
taxation (which they will if they all operate a source-based system). Conversely, the
residence-based system treats all capital income the same way regardless of where the
income arises. It therefore achieves capital export neutrality provided that all countries
practice the system or the domestic country provides a full tax credit for foreign taxes.
The system of taxation in operation can also affect the international pattern of
ownership of capital by altering relative return on assets across countries. In many cases
the ownership pattern should not matter for the real choices of the corporation, but it can
do in some circumstances, such as when intangible assets are involved. When owner-
ship patterns are not distorted, the tax system is deﬁned as satisfying capital ownership
neutrality. This can be achieved if countries levy a residence-based capital tax.
The choice of system for capital taxation has become increasingly important with
increased globalization and the enhanced mobility of capital. The ownership of corpo-
rations is more internationally diversiﬁed than ever before, and an increasing number

711
Chapter 21: Issues in International Taxation
of ﬁrms are multinational. These changes have increased the number of issues that
have to be taken into account in the design of the tax system. In a globalized world no
country is isolated, and tax changes in one country can cause a reallocation of ﬁnancial
and productive capital that affects all countries.
21.3.2
Corporate Taxation
The taxation of corporate income involves the transformation of proﬁt into tax revenue.
Globalization has made corporations increasingly mobile across jurisdictions. If the tax
system attempts to tax proﬁt where it is generated, then a multinational ﬁrm will have
an incentives to change the location of proﬁt to where it is the most advantageous from
a tax perspective. This can be achieved either through changing the physical location
of the ﬁrm (or parts of the ﬁrm) to earn proﬁt in a different location or by restructuring
ﬁnancial ﬂows to make it appear that proﬁt is earned in a different location.
The increasing exploitation of low-tax jurisdictions by corporations is illustrated in
ﬁgure 21.1. The ﬁgure reports the proﬁts of the subsidiaries of US corporations located
in four low-tax jurisdictions (often called tax havens) and the effective tax rates in those
jurisdictions. The proﬁts reported in each of the jurisdictions rose substantially over the
four-year period considered. The one exception is the signiﬁcant fall in the year that
the effective tax rate in Switzerland increased. The sharp fall in proﬁt resulting from
this tax increase further illustrates the international mobility of these proﬁts.
In an international setting the ﬁrst step in allocating the tax base between jurisdictions
is to determine where proﬁt is generated. If this can be done, the next step is to decide
whether proﬁt should be taxed on the basis of where it is generated, or on some other
basis such as where it accrues to owners. Both choices are possible when taxes are
being designed. Tax design must also take into account the ability of the headquarters
of a ﬁrm to move from one country to another. Production and ofﬁce facilities can also
move. The important feature of this mobility is that it often involves a discrete choice:
the headquarters may be in the United States or in Germany, the plant in Vietnam or
Thailand (but not a bit in both). Usually in tax analysis it is the effect of the marginal
rate of tax on marginal decisions that is important. The situation is different when a
discrete choice has to be made. In such a case it is the average rate of tax that determines
the chosen outcome.
These points can be related to the decisions that a company must make. The choice
of where to produce is made by calculating the level of proﬁt net of tax liability in each
of the alternative locations. The location delivering the highest proﬁt net of tax will
be chosen. It is for this choice that the average tax rate is relevant. Conditional on the

choice of location the company must then select the level of output. This is a standard
marginal decision for which the marginal tax rate is relevant. The ﬁnal decision for the
ﬁrm is to choose the location of proﬁt. This is not the same as the real decision about
where to produce, but refers to the nominal allocation of proﬁt through accounting
choices. The following discussion of corporate taxation will treat each of these issues.
They will be discussed separately to isolate the key points, but it is clear that they are
interrelated. For example, a ﬁrm will choose to locate where the average tax rate is low,
and will produce more at the location if the marginal rate is low. It will also choose to
locate proﬁt in that location to take advantage of the low tax rate.
Consider a corporation that operates divisions in two or more tax jurisdictions. Four
of the alternative tax bases are now introduced and some of the issues relating to the
choice of base are discussed. The four tax base alternatives are:
• Source-based taxation
Corporate income earned in the country where productive
activity takes place.
• Residence-based taxation (corporate)
Income accruing to the residence country of
the corporate headquarters.
• Residence-based taxation (personal)
Income accruing to the residence country of
the corporate headquarters or personal shareholders (residence-based taxation)
• Destination-based taxation
The sales (net of costs) in the destination country where
the goods or services are ﬁnally consumed.
The ﬁrst point that needs to be made concerning the choice between these tax bases is
that it is difﬁcult to deﬁne the source of proﬁt. Difﬁculties can arise even when a corpo-
ration has a simple structure but undoubtedly becomes more pronounced as corporate
structure increases in complexity. A corporation may have many different functional
units, such as management, production, marketing, ﬁnance, sales, and research and
development (R&D), and each of these functions can be divided between different
divisions of the ﬁrm in different jurisdictions. The problem confronting source-based
taxation of the corporation is the allocation of proﬁt across these functions and across
the divisions. Each one of the functions is necessary for the operation of the ﬁrm and
so ultimately has a claim to be a source of proﬁt. Neither the internal accounting of
the ﬁrm nor the information observed by tax authorities will generally be adequate to
allocate proﬁt to sources.
One resolution to this difﬁculty is to deﬁne prices at which the products of one of
the divisions are sold to another. If such prices exist then the proﬁt can be distributed
across sources. Some products may be traded within the ﬁrm, and some may be sold

714
Part VII: Multiple Jurisdictions
outside as well as used inside. In these cases observable prices exist. For other products
there may be no observable prices. For example, the supply of management services
may not be priced within the ﬁrm. However, the distinction between these cases may not
bethatsigniﬁcant. Whatthetaxauthoritiesrequirearearm’s-lengthprices thatrepresent
the price that the product or service would be sold at between unrelated parties. Since
the prices used within the ﬁrm may not represent arm’s-length prices (we explore why
when we look at transfer pricing later), the observation of a price within the ﬁrm may
not actually be much more helpful than having no price.Amore fundamental problem is
the possibility that no price can be deﬁned for the transaction. To see this point, assume
that the discoveries of two distinct R&D divisions are critical for the production process
of the corporation, but neither discovery is of any value alone. The arm’s-length price
is zero individually or positive when the discoveries are combined. However, pricing
the combined discoveries does not assist with the identiﬁcation of the source of proﬁt.
These comments demonstrate the difﬁculties, both practical and conceptual, involved
in allocating proﬁt on a source basis. These problems would have to be faced by any
implementation of a source-based tax. In practice, the problems are dealt with through
rules that attempt to approximate what is economically correct and through occasional
litigation.
At ﬁrst sight, it might seem easier to identify a residence country than to identify a
source country. Close inspection shows that this is not necessarily the case. Deﬁning
the jurisdiction of residence of the headquarters of a multinational can be problematic.
In practice, it is deﬁned through the concept of the location of control and management.
TherulingonthispointinUnitedKingdomlawsummarizesthepositionas“thequestion
where control and management abide must be treated as one of fact or ‘actuality’.” In
brief, this means there is no absolute principle but a judgment on the facts in each case.
Proﬁts are usually taxed when they are repatriated to the parent company. Taxing on
repatriation provides an incentive not to repatriate, which might mean that excessive
investments are undertaken abroad. So an alternative is to tax proﬁts when they are
accrued. The beneﬁt of a residence-based tax is that all that must be observed is the
total proﬁt of the company. It does not matter where it is earned. If all countries were to
operate on the residence basis, then companies would not beneﬁt from shifting proﬁt
around and using tactics such as transfer pricing. However, there are two problems with
this. First, the holding company of a multinational is mobile, and it may well move
to take advantage of tax beneﬁts. Consider the case of a holding company located in
one country but with all productive activity and sales taking place elsewhere, and the
shareholders resident elsewhere. There is a serious question about the moral legitimacy
of residence-based tax in this case, and possibly also considerable mobility of the

715
Chapter 21: Issues in International Taxation
holding company since it has no real connections to location. Second, a multinational
may have many divisions across numerous countries. This is not a problem in theory,
but in practice it may be very difﬁcult for the residence country to monitor the taxable
activity across the range of divisions. Even though it is only the sum of proﬁt that
needs to be known, this can only be monitored by using information on the individual
components going into that sum.
An alternative is to tax the shareholders of a ﬁrm on a residence basis when they re-
ceive dividend payments. There are two sources of practical problems with this choice
of tax base. The ﬁrst problem confronting a tax authority is the difﬁculty of observing
the dividend income that arises from foreign shareholdings. There may be regulations
requiring domestic corporations to report payments to the domestic tax authority, but
these need not extend internationally. Observation of dividend income is made partic-
ularly problematic by the fact that countries have an incentive to offer lax regulations
in order to attract corporate headquarters. Such tax havens do exist, and can play host
to an exceptionally high numbers of ﬁrms (Liechtenstein has a population of 35,000
people but approximately 73,000 registered corporations). The second problem is that
the country of residence of individuals is not always clear. People can be internationally
mobile with their country of residence ill-deﬁned and open to dispute.
In summary, both source- and residence-based systems of corporate taxation have to
confront a range of practical and conceptual difﬁculties. These difﬁculties prevent the
implementation of either system in a manner that conforms with the theoretical idea.
This has led to proposals for the implementation of systems that approximate the ideal
but can be applied in practice. One such proposal is now considered.
21.3.3
Formula Apportionment
A practical solution to the problems of implementing the source- or residence-based
systems is to employ formula apportionment to allocate the tax base across jurisdic-
tions. Formula apportionment aggregates the activities of a multinational regardless
of location and then allocates the tax base across countries according to a pre-agreed
formula. The formula can be chosen to approximate either system of taxation. The Eu-
ropean Commission has proposed the use of formula apportionment using a common
coordinated EU tax base. The apportionment proposed by the European Commissions
is based on the proportion of total sales that take place in each country. If the proﬁt
margin was constant and identical across countries, then this would be a source-based
system. Otherwise, it will provide an approximation to a source-based system. The con-
sequences of using this version of formula apportionment are now investigated with

716
Part VII: Multiple Jurisdictions
the main focus placed on whether it is consistent with production efﬁciency and the
effect it has on the choices of a corporation.
To explore the implications of this system, consider a monopolist producing in two
countries using two internationally mobile inputs. The output produced by the ﬁrm can
also be transported costlessly between countries. There is a supranational government
(representing the European Union) that implements formula apportionment.
With the proposed form of formula apportionment a proportion q of proﬁt is taxed
in country A and 1 −q in country B. With tax rates tA and tB the level of proﬁt is
π =

xAp(xA) + xBp(xB) −r

KA + KB
−w

LA + LB 
1 −qtA −[1 −q] tB
.
(21.20)
This is maximized subject to the constraint that
xA + xB = F(KA, LA) + F(KB, LB)
(21.21)
and the formula apportionment rule
q =
xAp(xA)
xAp(xA) + xBp(xB).
(21.22)
The necessary conditions for the capital levels in the two countries are
−r

1 −qtA −[1 −q] tB
+ λFKj = 0,
j = A, B,
(21.23)
where λ is the Lagrange multiplier on the production constraint. The necessary
conditions imply that
FKA = FKB,
(21.24)
which is the efﬁciency condition for the mobile factor. The necessary conditions for LA
and LB provide the same conclusion. This shows that formula apportionment based on
sales does not affect the international efﬁciency of factor allocation. This is a point in
its favor.
It should not be concluded that formula apportionment is entirely distortion-free.
Formula apportionment provides a motive to move proﬁt to the low-tax country. This
is achieved by directing more output to that country. If the demand function is the same
in both countries, then this implies the price must be lower in the low-tax country to
raise the proportion of sales in that country. Hence a system of formula apportionment
operates as a form of implicit tax in the high-tax country.

21.3.4
Summary
The process of globalization has made capital and corporations more mobile. This
makes it harder to identify the source of proﬁt and the place of residence of the recipients
of proﬁt. In principle, there are clearly deﬁned systems for taxing proﬁt, or the return
to capital generally, on a consistent basis. These systems differ in the effects that they
have and in their neutrality properties. The drawback is that all systems are faced with
practical difﬁculties that hinder implementation. Formula apportionment is a possible
solution, and this can have desirable efﬁciency properties.
21.4
Transfer Pricing
Consider a multinational ﬁrm with divisions in two countries. Assume that one of the
ﬁrm’s divisions produces a good while the other uses it, either as an input or for ﬁnal
sale. The price at which the good is transferred between the two divisions of the ﬁrm is
known as the transfer price. For the division of the multinational ﬁrm that produces the
good, the transfer price determines revenue. Conversely, for the division that uses the
good the transfer price determines costs. The transfer prices on the transactions between
the divisions of the ﬁrm should guide resource allocation within the ﬁrm. From this
perspective, the ﬁrm has an incentive to choose transfer prices that mirror the true costs
of production.
The choice of transfer price also has another implication for the ﬁrm: it affects the
international allocation of proﬁt between the countries in which the different units of
the ﬁrm are located. A high transfer price will raise the proﬁt of the unit producing the
good, whereas a low transfer price will raise the proﬁt of the user. If the countries in
which the units of the ﬁrm are located have different corporate tax rates, the ﬁrm can
set the transfer price to ensure the largest possible proﬁt is made in the low-tax country.
This will increase net-of-tax proﬁt by exploiting the tax differential. It also affects the
tax revenues of the countries and provides an incentive for countries to reduce corporate
tax rates. The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines describe this in the following way:
“Transfer prices are signiﬁcant for both taxpayers and tax administrations because
they determine in large part the income and expenses, and therefore taxable proﬁts, of
associated enterprises in different tax jurisdictions.”
To prevent ﬁrms from using transfer pricing to reduce tax liability many governments
have adopted rules on transfer pricing. The central feature of the rules is the concept
of an arm’s-length price. This is deﬁned as the price that would be charged if the

718
Part VII: Multiple Jurisdictions
intermediate good was sold to an independent buyer. This is easy to apply if there is
a market for the intermediate good and the transfer price can be compared to the price
actually charged. If there is no market, which will be the case for many specialized
intermediate inputs, the rules specify a process for determining what constitutes the
correct arm’s-length prices. The rules typically allow the transfer price to be freely set,
but permit the tax authorities to adjust that price when it falls outside what is judged to
be a reasonable range for the arm’s-length price.
There are practical difﬁculties in operating the arm’s-length standard. It has already
been noted that the good in question may not be openly marketed. It may also be the
case that there is no sufﬁciently similar item on open sale to permit a price comparison,
or that the terms and conditions of sale may vary among transactions. Transfer-pricing
rules usually allow the use of several methods for testing whether the transfer price is
appropriate. The common methods include the use of comparable uncontrolled prices,
cost-plus pricing, resale price or markup, and proﬁtability-based methods.
We begin by exploring the incentives the ﬁrm faces when choosing a transfer price
in the absence of restrictions on behavior. Suppose that the ﬁrm produces in country A.
Some of the output is sold in country A, whereas the remainder is supplied to a division
in B for sale in that market where there is no other production. The price in country
i,i = A, B,isdenotedbypi. ThecostofproductionincountryAisC = C (XA + XB),
where C′ > 0. Country i, i = A, B, levies a proﬁt tax at rate ti.
With a transfer price φ the aggregate proﬁt of the ﬁrm is
π = [1 −tA][pAXA + φXB −C(XA + XB)] + [1 −tB][pBXB −φXB].
(21.25)
This can be written as
π = [1 −tA] [pAXA −C(XA + XB)] + [1 −tB]pBXB + φ [tB −tA] XB.
(21.26)
The choice of transfer price is clear from (21.26). If
tB −tA < 0,
(21.27)
then the ﬁrm will want to set the lowest possible transfer price to shift proﬁt to the low-
tax country B. In this case the incentive is to maximize the proﬁt accruing in country
B. Conversely, if
tB −tA > 0,
(21.28)
then the ﬁrm will want to set the highest possible transfer price to shift proﬁt to the low-
tax country A. These conditions make it clear that the incentives for transfer pricing
arises from international tax differences.

719
Chapter 21: Issues in International Taxation
The analysis can be extended to explore the effect of arm’s-length regulation of the
transfer price. It has been argued that it may be hard to exactly determine the correct
arm’s-length price. This suggests that there may be a range of acceptable prices that
can be used. Such a range can be represented by placing upper and lower bounds on the
transfer price. The two natural bounds to place on the transfer price are that it cannot be
below marginal cost and that it cannot be above the market price in country A. Hence
φ must satisfy
C′ ≤φ ≤pA.
(21.29)
Consider the choice of a monopoly ﬁrm when (21.27) is satisﬁed so county B has the
lower tax rate. In this case φ = C′, so the proﬁt level for the ﬁrm is
π = [1 −tA][pA(XA)XA −C(XA + XB)]
+ [1 −tB]pB(XB)XB + C′[tB −tA]XB.
(21.30)
The necessary conditions for the choice of XA and XB are respectively
[1 −tA][pA + p′
AXA −C′] + C′′[tB −tA]XB = 0,
(21.31)
[1 −tB][pB + p′
BXB −C′] + C′′[tB −tA]XB = 0.
(21.32)
The effect of the bound on the transfer price can be seen to be dependent on the sign
of C′. If C′′ = 0, the lower bound is unaffected by changes in output. In this case
the second terms vanish from the two necessary conditions. The supply to country A
equates marginal revenue to marginal cost. The same condition holds true in country
B, so supply also equates marginal revenue and marginal cost. When C′′ > 0, the cost-
increase effect has to be taken into account. An increase in output raises marginal cost
and tightens the bound on the transfer price. This implies that the supply to country A
is reduced below the level that equates marginal revenue and marginal cost. The same
distortion arises in country B. Conversely, when C′′ < 0, an increase in output reduces
the lower bound and encourages greater supply to both countries.
Now consider the choices of the ﬁrm when tB −tA > 0 so that is at the upper bound
of the transfer price rule. The level of proﬁt is
π = [1 −tA][pA(XA)XA −C(XA + XB)]
+ [1 −tB]pB(XB)XB + pA(XA)[tB −tA]XB,
(21.33)
with necessary conditions for the choice of output levels
[1 −tA][pA + p′
AXA −C′] + p′
A[tB −tA]XB = 0,
(21.34)
[1 −tB][pB + p′
BXB −C′] + [tB −tA][pA −C′] = 0.
(21.35)

720
Part VII: Multiple Jurisdictions
The effect of the bound here is to reduce supply to country A because this increases
the upper bound on the transfer price. Since (21.34) implies that pAC′ > 0, the supply
to country B beyond the level that equates marginal revenue to marginal cost despite
country B levying the higher tax.
In effect, the consequence of a transfer price rule with upper and lower boundaries
is that it gives an incentive for the ﬁrm to change its supply to the two markets in an
attempt to manipulate the rule. Hence introducing a rule causes additional distortions.
Of course, one of the countries will gain from the rule by ensuring that its corporate
tax revenues are increased. The other must lose.
Firms can use transfer pricing to obtain a favorable tax treatment of proﬁt. If
there is no limitation on the transfer price then the ﬁrm will set an extreme value
in order to locate as much proﬁt as possible in the low-tax jurisdiction. This pro-
cess undermines the ability of jurisdictions to levy corporate taxes and encourages
tax competition. To prevent this from happening transfer price rules are needed. The
rules typically make use of the concept of an arm’s-length price. Placing upper and
lower limits on the transfer price can cause a distortion if ﬁrm sees these limits as
endogenous.
21.5
Location
It has already been mentioned in chapter 20 that the European Union operates an
agreement to prevent harmful tax competition. One aspect of harmful tax competition
is that some EU member states may try to attract ﬁrms from other member states. Even
with the agreement the differences in tax treatment of corporations across member
states still give rise to relocations of ﬁrm, with the media focusing on the role of
taxation in these moves. This raises the question of the sensitivity of location choice
to tax rates. The previous section considered the location decisions as given. This
section goes one step further and looks at the issue of how taxation affects the choice of
location.
For most economic choices at intensive margins, such as the decision to work a little
bit more or less, it is the marginal tax rate that matters. The location decision of a ﬁrm is
instead a choice at the extensive margin: it will either locate in one country or another.
For such discrete choices it is the average tax rate that is important. This matters from
the policy design perspective. It also matters from an empirical perspective since, to
analyze location, it is necessary to construct effective average tax rates. This is a point
to which we return after some theory.

721
Chapter 21: Issues in International Taxation
21.5.1
Locational Choice
Firms are able to extract rents from competing jurisdictions. The extent of the rent
depends on the beneﬁts to the jurisdiction and location-speciﬁc beneﬁts for the ﬁrm.
Controlling competition between jurisdictions will reduce the rent extracted.
Consider two countries, A, B, that will derive beneﬁts Y A and Y B respectively if
the ﬁrm decides to locate within their borders. The ﬁrm has a preference for country
A since it earns an additional rent if it locates there. This location-speciﬁc rent could
arise because of a skilled workforce in A or local availability of necessary inputs. The
location-speciﬁc rent for the ﬁrm in A is θ > 0. The two countries compete by choosing
the taxes that they will charge the ﬁrm.
Denote the tax levied by country i by T i (so it is a subsidy if T i< 0). The ﬁrm obtains
π + θ −T A in country A and π −T B in country B. The ﬁrm will locate in country A
provided that
T A ≤θ + T B.
(21.36)
The maximum subsidy in B must leave the country with a nonnegative payoff so that
Y B + T B ≥0.
(21.37)
Given that country A wishes to minimize its subsidy (or maximize its tax), it will choose
the level of tax T A = θ −Y B. The tax can be positive or negative depending on the
values of θ and Y B.
With this value of T A country A receives
Y A + θ −Y B,
(21.38)
and the ﬁrm receives the payoff
θ −T A = Y B.
(21.39)
If T A > 0, then the location-speciﬁc rent is shared between the ﬁrm and country A
(with θ > Y B). If T A < 0, the ﬁrm extracts a payoff in excess of the location-speciﬁc
rent (with θ < Y B).
This analysis illustrates how mobile ﬁrms are able to extract rents when countries
compete to host them. The countries will compete to provide tax concessions, and
the ﬁrm will choose the location that provides the highest payoff after taking these
concessions into account. The other message of the analysis is that when location is
a discrete choice (either A or B), it is the total tax payment or, equally, the average

722
Part VII: Multiple Jurisdictions
tax rate that matters for choice. This is in contrast to the usual focus on the marginal
tax rate. This observation is important for empirical analysis of location choice since
the average tax rate is often very difﬁcult to determine—it is often the consequence of
a complex set of taxes and allowances—and has to be constructed. This is discussed
further shortly.
21.5.2
Agglomeration Rents
In addition to taxation, location choices are determined by other agglomeration and
dispersion forces. The New Economic Geography, developed in the early nineties by
Krugman and others, states that even when high corporate tax rates deter ﬁrms from
locating in a country, there can still be agglomeration rents that attract them.
The agglomeration force is the access to the market for inputs and outputs. The
closer one is to the center of activity, then (1) the better the access to the market to sell
output, and (2) the better the access to inputs and intermediate goods. Because of these
factors, ﬁrms want to locate close to their workers and workers want to locate close to
ﬁrms. These agglomeration forces can result in external economies of scale: as more
ﬁrms locate in a given region and aggregate industry output rises the average cost of
production falls. External economies can be due to knowledge spillovers and access
to intermediate goods and trained workers. This raises the incentive for more ﬁrms to
locate in the same region. The location of computer chip manufacturers in California’s
Silicon Valley is an example of such agglomeration. There is no reason why the ﬁrst
chip manufacturer located there other than an accident of history, but once the process
began, it gathered its own momentum.
The attraction force of agglomeration is offset by the dispersion force that arises
from the competition effect. The closer a ﬁrm is to center of activity, the tougher is the
competition from other ﬁrms located in the same area. The proximity of location will
result in products being close substitutes, which enhances competition.
How the two forces are balanced depends on the level of transportation costs (or,
equivalently, of trading costs). A key result of New Economic Geography is that in-
creasing returns to scale (at the ﬁrm level) and imperfect competition combined with
transportation costs may result in agglomeration. From this perspective, corporate taxes
deter ﬁrms from a location while agglomeration rents attract ﬁrms. So it is possible to
tax the agglomeration rent to some extent without driving ﬁrms away. Tax differences
across locations are explained by a countervailing gap in agglomeration rents. For both
low and high transportation costs, the agglomeration rents are low. For intermediate
transportation costs, the agglomeration rents are higher, which implies that taxes can

723
Chapter 21: Issues in International Taxation
be set at a higher level in the center compared to the periphery of the economic activity.
In this approach transportation is a proxy for trade costs, so the agglomeration rent is
a bell-shaped function of the trade costs.
21.5.3
Evidence
The discussion of the international tax treatment of capital assumed that ﬁrms will
relocateproﬁtorcapitaltotakeadvantageofinternationaltaxdifferentials. Thepractical
signiﬁcance of the effects we have identiﬁed depends on the extent to which ﬁrms do
respond to taxation. There is a large literature that has analyzed the data to measure
this responsiveness.
The movement of proﬁt between locations is much easier than the physical movement
of ﬁrms. It is therefore not surprising that there is ample evidence that international
proﬁt-shifting does indeed take place. This is despite the efforts of governments to
contain it via transfer-pricing regulations. Evidence of proﬁt-shifting has been found
between the United States and various other countries and, more generally, within the
OECD area. The typical evidence is that reported income within a country falls in
response to a unilateral tax increase by that country.
The second issue is the response of the international location of real investment to
differences in tax rates. This is a more difﬁcult question to address. The chosen location
is observed, but the rejected alternatives are not, so the factors that entered the decision
process of the ﬁrm cannot be observed directly. The choice of location depends on
the average tax rate that a ﬁrm faces (controlling for agglomeration rents). This tax
rate cannot simply be read from legislation for several reasons. First, the tax system
may involve several marginal rates of tax that depend on the proﬁt level. Second, there
may be reductions in the marginal rate in special circumstances such as location in
an enterprise zone or as a start-up incentive. Third, there can be allowances for R&D
expenditures and special depreciation provisions. These factors make the average rate
of tax potentially speciﬁc to the circumstances of each ﬁrm and have required that it be
computed as part of an empirical analysis.
The analysis in section 21.5.1 considered a ﬁrm making a single-period location
decision. In practice, a ﬁrm must assess how the choice of location affects its value
as determined by the future ﬂows of dividends to the owners. This ﬂow of dividends
is determined by both the investment policy and the ﬁnancial policy of the ﬁrm over
the future lifetime of the ﬁrm. The analysis of the lifetime decision problem is com-
plex, but for the purpose of analyzing how taxation affects location choice, it can be
considerably simpliﬁed. The method for doing this is to use a perturbation argument:

724
Part VII: Multiple Jurisdictions
investment is increased by one unit at time t and reduced by 1 −δ units at time
t + 1, where δ is the depreciation rate of capital. This perturbation leaves the capital
stock unchanged from period t + 1 onward, so the ﬂow of proﬁt is only changed (or
perturbed) in periods t (where extra investment is ﬁnanced) and t + 1 (where extra
output is produced and investment reduced). The total effect of this perturbation can
be summarized by calculating the net present value (NPV) of the additional costs and
revenues.
For each potential location a NPV can be deﬁned before tax (NPVB) and after tax
(NPVA). The choice of location is determined by the comparison of the after-tax NPVs.
This comparison can be related to taxation by using the NPVA and NPVB to deﬁne an
effective average tax rate (EATR). The standard way to do this is to determine the net
present value of the increase in revenues from the perturbation, NPVR.The perturbation
increases investment by one unit at t so raises capital by one unit at t + 1. Assume
that the extra unit of capital produces additional output that earns revenue p at time
t + 1. The value of this additional revenue at t is NPVR =
p
1+r , where r is the interest
rate. The EATR is then deﬁned by
EATR = NPVB −NPVA
NPVR
.
(21.40)
The reason for measuring the EATR relative to NPVR is that this will almost certainly be
positive (because it is an increase in revenue without subtracting costs), whereas either
of NPVB or NPVA could be zero (or negative) because they include the additional cost
of investment. Computing the EATR for each location provides a comparison of the
level of taxes.
One line of research has considered the effects of US tax policy. It has been shown
that companies that can claim tax credits against their home-country tax bill for state
income taxes paid in the United States are less likely to avoid high-tax states. This is
consistent with the theoretical prediction. In addition the evidence demonstrates that
US ﬁrms shifted away from international joint ventures in response to the higher tax
costs created by certain provisions of the US Tax Reform Act of 1986.
An alternative line of research estimated the sensitivity of foreign direct investment
(FDI) to changes in tax regimes. Many studies have been undertaken that suggest
an elasticity somewhere in the range −0.6 and −1.5, with a value that varies across
countries. Some studies have reported even higher ﬁgures.
The theoretical analysis shows how the mobility of ﬁrms can enable rent extraction.
The empirical studies provide evidence that taxation does have a signiﬁcant effect on
the location of proﬁt and of activity. The design of the international tax structure is

725
Chapter 21: Issues in International Taxation
therefore important. This is why there is so much concern about competition for the
location of ﬁrms that will distort location choice.
21.6
Harmonization of Taxes
In many areas of policy the European Union ﬁnds the idea of approximation—the closer
alignment of the policies of member states—to be appealing. When applied to inter-
national tax policy, the process of approximation implies a reduction in the dispersion
of tax rates across member states. The European Union announced an acceleration of
the process of approximation of VAT rates in 1985. At the outset of this process, the
aim was that by 1993 the tax rate on any commodity in any member state would not
deviate more than 2.5 percentage points from a community norm. The process did not
reach its intended outcome but did make some progress. The process of approximation
remains an EU policy objective.
In the economic literature the EU terminology of approximation is replaced by that
of harmonization, which means moving toward, though not necessarily achieving, a
common value for tax rates. Complete harmonization would replace a range of different
tax rates across countries with a single tax rate. This could be, for example, the average
of the initial tax rates. A partial harmonization would move the individual tax rates a
little closer to a common target.
It is not immediately obvious that harmonization can raise economic welfare. Ap-
plying the analysis of commodity taxation in chapter 15 provides a reason to believe
that harmonization may well reduce welfare. Recall that the inverse elasticity rule
demonstrates that tax rates should be differentiated across goods to reﬂect the demand
conditions for each. Extending this argument to countries suggests thatVATrates should
be based on local demand elasticities. If these elasticities vary across countries, then
implementing a process of harmonization will move the system away from the efﬁcient
outcome. There are two reasons why this anti-harmonization argument may not apply.
First, the existing tax rates need not be efﬁcient. Second, there may be inefﬁciencies
that are not resolved (or may even be enhanced) by the imposition of differentiated
taxes. These arguments are now brieﬂy explored.
It is always possible that an existing set of tax rates was selected for reasons other
than efﬁciency. The tax rates might have been the outcome of lobbying or of historical
precedent. Whatever the case, if the tax rates are not efﬁcient, then harmonization may
be able to raise welfare. Harmonization may even be welfare-improving if the tax rates
were chosen efﬁciently. This is because there is a distinction between what is efﬁcient
for each country and what is efﬁcient for a set of countries. If each country chooses

726
Part VII: Multiple Jurisdictions
its tax rate to maximize national welfare, then it will not take into account spillover
effects on other countries. Harmonization could move the tax rates closer to those that
maximize aggregate welfare. We explore this argument in more detail below.
One form of inefﬁciency that has been the basis of a practical argument in favor of
harmonization of VAT in the European Union is cross-border shopping. Cross-border
shopping is inefﬁcient because individual consumers are driven by tax differentials
to personally transport commodities. The transport of commodities across borders by
ﬁrms can exploit economies of scale; cross-border shopping by individuals does not.
In addition individual transportation increases congestion and environmental damage.
These costs are avoided if VAT rates are harmonized, thus removing the incentive to
engage in cross-border shopping. More generally, harmonization lessens the distortion
of trade patterns and enhances the efﬁciency of trade.
These competing perspectives show that the question of whether harmonization can
be beneﬁcial is a signiﬁcant one that does not have an immediately obvious answer.
Insight into the question can be obtained by considering two countries that impose
different rates of VAT. This permits a harmonization of the rates to be imposed and the
welfare consequences determined. The question is whether such a harmonization can
raise the welfare levels of both countries.
Acase for harmonization can be constructed when countries choose tax rates indepen-
dently and ignore the effects on other countries. To demonstrate this argument, suppose
that for two countries, A and B, and two goods, 1 and 2, good 1 is exported from coun-
try A to B while good 2 travels in the opposite direction. (The direction of trade should
really be derived as the equilibrium outcome, but it is easier to impose it directly.) The
price of good 1 is normalized at 1 and the price of good 2, before tax is imposed, is p.
The tax on good 2 in country j is denoted tj. Neither country taxes good 1.
The equilibrium condition for the economy is that trade is balanced. Demand for good
i in country j is a function of the price of good 2 in that country. Hence xi

For country B the price p represents the terms of trade (the price of exports of good 2
divided by the price of imports of good 1). For country A it is the inverse of the terms

Chapter 21: Issues in International Taxation
The source of the inefﬁciency can now be explained. The dependence of the equi-
librium price on the tax rates means that domestic tax policy in one country affects the
terms of trade for the other country. This is a form of externality between the countries.
When the tax rates are chosen independently, this externality will not be internalized
and the resulting equilibrium will be inefﬁcient. Notice that this is a consequence of
assuming that the countries are “large” in the sense that their actions have a signiﬁcant
effect on the world price. In contrast, if the countries are assumed to be “small,” then
the terms of trade would be perceived as ﬁxed and the externality would not exist.
When the countries act independently country A chooses the tax rate to solve

in both countries. This happens because the countries move from a jointly inefﬁcient
tax system to one that is preferable. The harmonized system need not be jointly optimal,
but it is better. If this is the case, a partial harmonization will also improve welfare. A
form of partial harmonization is for each country to move to a weighted average of the
independent tax rates

nization. Unless the welfare functions have unusual properties, it will generally be the
case that both countries gain by moving from the independent taxes to the partially
harmonized taxes.
There are caveats to this argument. If one—or both—of the countries prefer indepen-
dent taxation to the harmonized tax rates, then harmonization will not raise welfare.
Note that unlike the joint taxation solution, harmonization can make both countries

729
Chapter 21: Issues in International Taxation
worse off. We have also said little about the role of tax revenue. If tax revenue is used
in a beneﬁcial manner (e.g., to provide a public good), then it will matter how the partial
harmonization affects revenue. If it leaves revenue unchanged, the argument holds as
given. If it changes revenue, then the argument will need to be extended to take this
into account.
An extension to the analysis makes it possible for partial harmonization to raise the
welfare of both countries even when one country is worse off at the efﬁcient harmonized
taxes(oneof(21.51)or(21.52)doesnothold)orevenatthejointlyefﬁcienttaxes(oneof
(21.48) or (21.49) does not hold). If there is a country that gains from partial harmoniza-
tion, the extension is to permit it to make a lump-sum transfer to the country that loses.
Partial harmonization will then raise welfare if one country gains more than the other
loses, so that a compensating transfer can be found that leaves both countries better off.
Thisanalysishasexploredwhypartialharmonizationcanraisewelfare. Theargument
is supported if there are other inefﬁciencies—such as cross-border shopping—that are
reduced by partial harmonization. It is also supported if there are other externalities
between the countries generated by the taxes. One example could be the locational
decisions of ﬁrms as described in section 21.5.1. Despite the potential beneﬁts of
partial harmonization, it is important to recognize that it is very much a second-best
policy if the jointly determined taxes are not uniform. In most cases there will be some
way of combatting the externality that allows the countries to retain the right to set
different tax rates.
21.7
Tax Principles
Completion of the single EU market has raised some debate as to how to operate the
VAT system. Prior to 1993 the operation of the VAT system involved commodities
leaving tax free from the exporting country and being taxed in the importing country.
This was achieved by a zero-rating of exports, combined with subjecting all imports to
VAT. In 1993 border controls within the European Union were abolished to facilitate
free trade and a level playing ﬁeld between ﬁrms operating within and across the EU
member states. Cross-border trade undermined the operation of the VAT system, so
a search began for a system that would be consistent with the principles of a single
market. The EU committed to introducing a “deﬁnitive” system by 1997, but no such
system is yet in place.
As a commodity crosses a border between the place of production and the place of
consumption, the question of which country should levy tax is raised. Should it be

730
Part VII: Multiple Jurisdictions
the country where the good is produced or the country where it is consumed? VAT is
fundamentally a system of consumption taxation. By design, the (formal) incidence of
VAT falls on the ﬁnal consumer. At each stage in the production process the VAT paid
on inputs can be reclaimed so that VAT is only paid on the value added. Only the ﬁnal
consumer is unable to reclaim VAT.
There are two distinct principles of taxation that correspond to the choice between
levying taxes on consumption or production. Under the destination principle, goods are
taxed in the country of ﬁnal consumption. Under the origin principle, goods are taxed
in the country of production.An important practical distinction between them is that the
destinationprinciplerequiresborderstomonitormovementofgoods, whereastheorigin
principle does not. The EU system with its zero-rating of exports involves an application
of the destination principle. There have been numerous proposals that the European
Union should move to the origin principle to ensure that the tax system is compatible
with the absence of internal borders. These proposals are often based on the observation
that the two systems are equivalent in the sense that a switch from one to the other will
not lead to any reallocation of resources. This equivalence is demonstrated next.
In a closed economy with no exports or imports the consequence of the circular ﬂow
of income is that consumption and production must be equal. Expressed formally, over
any given period of time,
Value of consumption = Value of production.
(21.55)
The equality between these two ﬂows implies that it does not matter whether consump-
tion or production is taxed. A tax at a ﬁxed rate levied on ﬁnal consumption will have
exactly the same economic effects as the same tax levied on production. The interesting
question is how this equivalence of a consumption tax and a production tax translates
to an open economy engaged in trade. The key insight is that the same logic still applies
but with one extra degree of complication.
To illustrate the argument better, suppose that in the two countries (A, B) with two
goods (1, 2), good 1 is produced in A, and good 2 is produced in B. The goods are
produced with constant returns to scale using only labor as an input. The tax rate in
country i is ti. The wage rate in i is wi with destination taxation and vi with origin
taxation. The prices with destination taxation are given in table 21.1a. The prices with
origin taxation are given in table 21.1b.
The next step is to adopt the price normalization wB = 1 and vB = 1, and then express
the prices of the two goods relative to the wage rates wA and vA. The real prices of the
two goods are displayed in tables 21.2a and 21.2b. It is these real prices that determine
resource allocation.

Consider starting with the destination principle in operation. The real prices shown
in table 21.2a must be the equilibrium prices that clear the markets for the two goods
and labor in each country. Now switch to the origin principle. After the switch the wage
rate in country A must adjust to the new structure of taxes to ensure that equilibrium is
attained. The equivalence argument is completed by observing that the wage rate with
the origin principle and the wage rate with the destination principle must be related by
vA =
1 + tB
1 + tA

wA.
(21.56)
This relation must hold because it is the only one that ensures that the real commodity
prices are identical in tables 21.2a and 21.2b: the initial real prices attained equilibrium,
so they must remain the same to attain equilibrium after the switch. This demonstrates
that switching from one of these tax principles to the other does not change the equilib-
rium. The wage rate instead adjusts to compensate for the change in relative tax rates
so as to leave the equilibrium unchanged.
This equivalence was described by the economist Tinbergen in a 1956 report for
the European Steel and Coal Community (the forerunner of the European Union). The
result shows that borders can be eliminated inside a single market and a system of
destination taxation replaced by a system of origin taxation. Real resource allocation
will not change as a consequence of the change in the tax system. The conditions under
which the equivalence results hold are much more general than those in the example.All
that is required for equivalence to hold is that taxation within each country is uniform (so

all commodities are taxed at the same rate) and that the wage rate (or the exchange rate
in a monetary model) can adjust. The insight for policy is that origin taxation provides
a viable alternative to destination taxation. It would also allow EU member states the
freedom to set their own tax rates without the intensity of tax competition that occurs
with the destination tax. The implementation of some form of origin system (though
probably not the simple form used above) remains a “long-term goal” of the European
Union. There is no (publicly known) movement toward that goal at the present time.
It remains a problem that has to be resolved in the construction of a “deﬁnitive” tax
system.
21.8
Tariff Policy
A tariff is a charge levied as a good crosses a border into a country. The advantage of
tariffs over other forms of taxation is that they are generally easy to collect. Recall that
taxes are most easily collected when they are levied on observable activities that are
public information. A good crossing a border is observable, particularly if the good is
carried on a ship that must enter a port. Hence tariffs can be used to raise revenue even
if other parts of the tax administration are weak. Tariffs also offer protection to the
home industry relative to the foreign industry, since they make the price of imported
goods more expensive relative to home-produced goods. This makes tariffs attractive
to countries wishing to encourage development. The drawbacks in using tariffs are that
they are distortionary and may be met with retaliatory tariffs from trade partners.

733
Chapter 21: Issues in International Taxation
21.8.1
Welfare Cost of Tariffs
The imposition of a tariff on a good raises the price paid by domestic consumers, raises
the price received by domestic producers, and raises some revenue for the government.
Since a tariff is a form of distortion, it must be the case that it creates a deadweight
loss. The allocation of this deadweight loss is more interesting, and it may even be the
case that a country can gain by the introduction of a tariff.
The effects of a tariff depend on whether the country is large or small. The meaning
of large is that the policy actions of the country have an effect on the prices of traded
goods in world markets. Conversely, small means that the country does not affect world
prices.
We begin by analyzing the effect of a tariff levied by a small country. Suppose that
there are two goods. The country imports one of these goods and exports the other. The
country is small, so imports are sold at the ﬁxed world price pM and exports at the
ﬁxed world price pX. The imposition of a tariff τ implies that the domestic price of
the imported good is qM = pM +τ. This is the price that is paid by domestic consumers
and the price that is earned by domestic ﬁrms on domestic sales (domestic ﬁrms do not
pay the tariff).
The effect of the tariff is shown in ﬁgure 21.2. The curves Dd and Sd represent
domestic demand and supply respectively. The imposition of the tariffs increases do-
mestic supply from s0 to s1 but reduces domestic consumption from d0 to d1. Imports
fall from d0 −s0 to d1 −s1. Area a is the increase in producer surplus of domestic ﬁrms
and area b the revenue accruing to the government from the tariff. The fall in consumer
surplus is the area a +b +c. Hence the tariff causes a deadweight loss equal to the area
c. This is the standard result: the imposition of a tariff by a small country will reduce
welfare.
There is a caveat to this result, however. The comparison of the areas in the ﬁgure
is based on the assumption that the two forms of surplus and government revenue are
valued equally. Recall from our introductory discussion that tariffs are a practical form
of policy to implement in a country with limited tax administration capability. In such
a country it is likely that a social valuation would weight government revenue more
highly than consumer surplus. An example would be a country that needs the tariff
revenue to ﬁnance the provision of an essential public good. This opens the possibility
that the tariff can increase a welfare measure when the use of revenue is added to the
analysis.
The welfare effect of a tariff in a large country is potentially very different due to
the effect of the policy on world prices. When a large country introduces a tariff on

an imported good, it encourages domestic ﬁrms to increase output. This raises world
output and reduces the world price of the imported good. In addition, as domestic ﬁrms
produce more of the imported good, they must produce less of the exported good. The
world price of the export increases as a consequence. The changes in world prices can
be beneﬁcial to the domestic country.
This discussion can be summarized using the concept of the terms of trade. The terms
of trade measure the price of the exported good relative to the price of the imported
good, pX
pM . An improvement in the terms of trade (meaning an increase in pX relative
to pM) is advantageous for the domestic country because it allows more units of the
import for each unit of export. The effect of the tariff is to improve the terms of trade,
and this can permit the domestic economy to gain from the imposition of a tariff.
The argument is illustrated in ﬁgure 21.3. The tariff causes the world price of the
import to fall from p0
M to p1
M, so the price on the domestic market rises only to
qM = p1
M + τ < p0
M + τ. The consequence of this smaller rise in price is that areas
a, b, and c are all reduced in size compared to the small country case. In the small
country case, government revenue from the tariff was area b. In the large country case,
the tariff revenue is the sum of areas b and d. The total loss of consumer surplus from
the tariff is a + b + c. Area a is gained by domestic ﬁrms as an increase in proﬁt and
b is gained by the government as revenue. Therefore, if area d is greater than area c,
then the tariff will increase welfare. This is clearly the case in the ﬁgure, but it does not

have to hold since it depends on the size of the tariff and the extent to which the world
price falls.
There is one clear result that can be established in this framework: a large country
will always gain by introducing a small tariff. That is, starting from a position with no
tariff, the country can increase welfare if it implements a tariff that is just above zero.
Formally, if welfare is written as a function of the tariff, W = W (τ), then dW
dτ |τ=0 > 0.
This is because the terms of trade effect dominates the loss of consumer surplus for a
small tariff. It follows that there must be an optimal tariff, τ ∗> 0, that maximizes the
welfare of the large country. This tariff is optimal conditional on other countries not
changing their policies in response.
A tariff is always a distortion in the pricing system, and so must cause a deadweight
loss. Now, if a large country gains from the tariff, where does the deadweight loss
arise? The answer is that the trading partners of the large country must lose. They
suffer a deterioration in the terms of trade as the price of the good they import rises
relative to the price of their export. The resulting welfare loss due to the introduction
of a tariff is always damaging for trading partners. Since the tariff must cause a re-
duction in world welfare, the trading partners always lose more than the large country
gains.

21.9
Trade Agreements
In an attempt to protect the US economy during the Great Depression the Smoot–
Hawley Act of 1930 introduced heavy tariffs on imports. This was met by swift
retaliation from Canada and reversed many years of trade liberalization. At the conclu-
sion of theWorldWar II, pressure mounted for a reduction in tariffs to secure the beneﬁts
of increased international trade. There have been numerous trade agreements since 1945
that have secured signiﬁcant reductions in tariffs and ushered in the current era of glob-
alization. There is little doubt that these trade agreements have beneﬁted developed
countries, but many would argue they have disadvantaged developing countries.
A fundamental premise of economics is that voluntary trade is welfare-enhancing: if
two parties choose to enter a trade, then both must gain. In the absence of market failure,
this argument leads to the conclusion that unregulated trade will attain a Pareto-efﬁcient
distribution of resources. If correct, this implies that any government intervention to
prohibit trade, restrict trade, or levy taxes and tariffs creates a distortion and causes a
loss of efﬁciency. Furthermore these arguments are as relevant for trade between two
countries as they are to trade between two individuals and provide the basis for seeking
free trade.
The basic explanation for trade among countries is comparative advantage that is
based on the rate at which one good is given up to get another. It is distinct from abso-
lute advantage that measures quantity of inputs used to produce output. Comparative
advantage exists even in the absence of absolute advantage. Trade allows countries
to specialize in the goods they produce relatively efﬁciently. Specializing and trad-
ing increases welfare. The beneﬁts of trade are enhanced when countries differ in
endowments and so can specialize in production of the goods that use their abundant
factors intensively. Increased trade also expands market size, which permits gains to be
obtained from external economies of scale. Increased competition from abroad forces
domestic ﬁrms to be efﬁcient. In the longer run the rate of economic growth can be
increased through FDI (foreign direct investment) and the import of innovation. The
summary of these arguments is that free trade is superior to autarky (the position of no
trade) and superior to an intermediate regime of trade restrictions.
It needs to be said that the beneﬁts of free trade rely on the assumption that market
failure is absent. If there are preexisting market failures, then free trade would not
lead to the beneﬁts described. Involuntary unemployment due to market failure may be
made worse by liberalization if labor market rigidities hinder redeployment of labor to
the production of exports. Markets may be missing so that intermediate goods are not

available for the production of ﬁnal goods (but, conversely, free trade may allow the
necessary intermediates to be imported). Countries may not have adequate ﬁnancial
markets to permit risk to be hedged, so liberalization could increase volatility. Such
market failures undermine the argument for free trade, but they do not prove that
intervention is better: the beneﬁts of intervention need to be demonstrated.
These comments provide background to what the trade agreements have been trying
to achieve and also help explain the current deadlock in the latest round. The successive
rounds of talks are now described and the achievements documented.
There have been nine rounds of world trade talks (see table 21.3). The ﬁrst eight
rounds were conducted under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
The Doha Round are the current talks and began in 2001 but have not yet reached
conclusion. GATT was a draft charter for the International Trade Organization (but the
charter was not ratiﬁed by the US Congress) and became a multilateral treaty in 1948.
GATT set principles for the negotiation of reduction in tariffs, the reduction in other
impediments to trade, and the elimination of discriminatory practices. It also provided
a forum for exchange of concessions and the settlement of trade disputes. The success
of GATT in liberalizing world trade is clear from the substantial increase in world trade
since 1948. In this sense at least, GATT was successful in promoting the liberalization
of trade. GATT was succeeded by the World Trade Organization in 1995, which is now
the body that overseas trade talks and arbitrates over trade disputes.
Astrong argument can be made that the world trade system that has emerged from the
successive agreements is tailored to suit developed countries. The fact that developing

738
Part VII: Multiple Jurisdictions
countries played little role in the ﬁrst seven rounds is signiﬁcant in this. Furthermore
Article XVIII of the 1947 agreement provided for “special and differential treatment”
for developing countries. In principle, this was intended to assist developing countries
by permitting them greater freedom in trade policy. In practice, the consequence has
been that it has marginalized those countries in negotiations.
The purpose of GATT was to reduce barriers to trade. This was achieved by nego-
tiating tariff reductions and by the process of tarifﬁcation: changing nontariff barriers
(e.g., a quota) into an equivalent tariff that led to the same level of trade. Two argu-
ments support the process of tarifﬁcation. First, it made the size of the barrier explicit.
Second, it was believed to be easier to negotiate future reduction in tariffs than it was
to negotiate reductions in nontariff barriers. The downside has been that countries can
exploit the tarifﬁcation process to set a high initial tariff to obtain something that can
be traded in future concessions.
There is no doubt that the successive rounds of talks have signiﬁcantly reduced the
level of tariffs on goods traded among developed countries. This is demonstrated in
table 21.4a, which shows that the levels of tariffs are now, on average, very low after the
successive rounds of trade talks. The average tariff on goods imported from other high-
income countries is 0.8 percent. So, on trade among high-income countries, there is very
little scope for further reductions. The position on imports from developing countries
is worse but not by a great deal: the average tariff levied by high-income countries on
manufactured goods from developing countries is higher, at 3.4 percent. In contrast,
developing countries, on average, levy higher tariffs, and the highest average tariffs are
on trade among developing countries.Adifferent story emerges from table 21.4b, which
reports tariffs on trade in agricultural products. The average tariff is much higher than
it is for manufactured products, which is a reﬂection of the focus of the early rounds of
trade talks. What the two ﬁgures have in common is that it is the developing countries
that levy the highest tariffs on average.
Further details on the protection offered to the agricultural sector, and the food sector
more generally, are given in table 21.5. As the table shows, there can be high levels
of tariff, signiﬁcant export subsidies, and production subsidies. Each one of these is
an impediment to free trade. It has been argued that the trade policies of developed
countries impede development. One justiﬁcation for this argument is that tariffs on
processed food imports are 42 percent in Canada, 65 percent in Japan, and 24 percent
in the European Union. In contrast, the tariffs on the least processed food items are
3 percent, 35 percent, and 15 percent respectively. This tariff structure discourages
developing countries from moving into food processing and limits the value added
that they derive from agriculture. A second justiﬁcation can be found in the level of

farm subsidies in developed countries. In 1986 to 1988 OECD farm subsidies were
equal to 51 percent of the value of farm production. Such subsidies have proved highly
persistent: in 2002 they were still 48 percent of value. Subsidies of this level greatly
reduce the ability of developing countries to compete in world agricultural markets.
The Uruguay Round that began in 1986 was characterized by a signiﬁcant increase
in the number of countries that participated. This round also extended the scope of the
discussion. It included talks on services, trade-related aspects of intellectual property,
and trade-related investment measures. The Round was brought to a close in 1993 and
was predicted to bring large welfare improvements for developing countries. Estimates
since have suggested that developing countries actually suffered a loss as a result of the
Uruguay Round. Explanations for the difference between the expected and the actual
outcome were that the agreement to remove barriers to trade in textiles was backloaded,
so it did not come into effect until several years after the Round was completed. It has
also been suggested that the beneﬁts from tarifﬁcation were overestimated and the
implementation of the agreement proved costly. Furthermore the average OECD tariff
on imports from developing countries remained four times larger than the average tariff
on imports from developed countries.

The latest round of talks began in Doha in 2001. These aimed to set the mandate
of the World Trade Organization (which replaced GATT in 1995) after the previous
meeting in Seattle in 1999 ended in failure. The Doha Declaration outlined a frame-
work for negotiations that focused on the promotion of economic development and led
to it being given the name of “The Development Round”. In 2003 the WTO convened
a meeting in Cancun in Mexico. This ended without agreement because the develop-
ing countries felt that the European Union and United States had not given ground
on agricultural subsidies. The developing countries also saw signiﬁcant costs arising
from the implementation of new regimes concerning competition policy, investment
regulations, trade and customs procedures, and intellectual property rights.
The Doha talks were suspended in July 2008. The European Union and India were
blamed by the United States for trying to exclude too many agricultural products from
tariff cuts. China and India refused to lower barriers to imports of subsidized agricultural
goods. ForseveralWestandCentralAfricancountriestheUScottonsubsidyisaprimary
issue. In negotiations the United States refused to reduce the subsidy but offered more
aid instead. This proved unacceptable. However, there are two additional arguments to
consider. First, many agricultural exports from Africa are subsidized or beneﬁt from
artiﬁcially high international prices. Second, many African countries also have little to
gain from a trade agreement because under the EU Everything But Arms programme
African LDCs (least developed countries) have duty-free, quota-free access to the EU
market. Many sub-Saharan countries have duty-free, quota-free access to markets in
developed countries under Economic Partnership Agreements. These facts limit the
gains to be obtained from a successful trade agreement.

741
Chapter 21: Issues in International Taxation
The reduction of tariffs and the growth of world trade are clear evidence that the
rounds of trade talks have been successful. At least part of this success has arisen from
the existence of mutual gains to be exploited. These gains have been realized in the
trade of developed countries. The Doha Round intentionally set out to help developing
countries. The interests of developed and developing countries can be very different,
so it may be hard to ﬁnd mutual gains. More likely, aiding the developing countries
will involve losses by the developed countries. It is therefore not surprising that the
history of successful talks is now confronted with this round of talks that failed to make
progress.

Conclusions
Increasing globalization of the world economy has enhanced the mobility of capital
and labor. This mobility has signiﬁcant implications for tax policy because a mobile tax
base will quickly move to exploit international tax differentials. The ability of countries
to design tax policy with no regard for what international competitors are doing is being
rapidly diminished. A country that chooses to impose a punitive tax policy will quickly
discover other countries reaping the beneﬁts.
The central theme of the chapter is that tax design is confronted with signiﬁcant
challenges in this era of globalization. This was exempliﬁed by the discussion of alter-
native bases for capital taxation. None of the possible bases was free from shortcomings
created by the difﬁculty of allocating the tax base across countries. These problems
have been addressed by international agreements on taxation. International agreements
have also succeeded in liberalizing much of international trade. They are likely to play
an equally important role in the future development of international tax policy.

uniformly across the population with values from 0 to 1. Let the utility level in country A of
a consumer with attachment x be equal to M −x −tA, where tA is the tax rate in country

A ﬁrm has to choose to locate in country A or country B. It will earn proﬁt π wherever it
locates, but will earn an additional location-speciﬁc rent in A. The location speciﬁc-rent is
uncertain. It assumes the value θH with probability p and value θL with probability 1 −p,
with θH > θL. Country A earns income Y A if the ﬁrm chooses to locate there and levies a
tax T A, while country B earns income Y B and levies a tax T B. The countries choose their
tax rates and the ﬁrm chooses its location before the location-speciﬁc rent is realized.

Toyota has the production capacity to produce 550,000 vehicles a year in Thailand. Much of

Why?
21.17
(Cross-border shopping) International traded goods can be taxed either in the country where
they are consumed (destination principle), or where they are produced (origin principle).
In open economies such as European Union where border controls have been abolished,
consumers can shop around for the lowest price. Under GATT rules, international commodity
trade is generally taxed under the destination principle.
a. What are the tax implications for the goods that are exported and for the goods that are
imported?
b. Consider two countries c = A, B and two goods i = 1, 2 with commodities tax rates tc

that can be differentiated across goods and countries. Show that consumer arbitrage under
the destination principle will always guarantee international production efﬁciency even
in the presence of differentiated commodity taxation (tc

Consider the previous exercise and suppose that each country levies a uniform tax rate on
both goods (tc

21.20
To combat proﬁt-shifting by using transfer-pricing, American law and the OECD model
require the use of arm’s-length prices for international transactions. Arm’s-length prices are
market prices: the prices that unrelated parties transacting at “arm’s length would use. What
problems do you see with the application of this principle?
21.21
The interaction of two tax systems, each belonging to a different country, can result in double
taxation. Every country seeks to tax the income generated within its territory on the basis of
one or more connecting factors such as location of the source, residence of taxable entity, and
maintenance of permanent establishment. Double taxation of the same income in the hands
of same entity would give rise to harsh consequences and impair economic development.
Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements between two countries therefore aim at eliminating
or mitigating the incidence of double taxation. The object of Double Taxation Agreements
is to provide for the tax claims of two governments, both legitimately interested in taxing a
particular source of income, either by assigning to one of the two the whole claim or else
by prescribing the basis on which tax claims is to be shared between them. What are the
objectives of these Double Taxation Agreements?

This exercise seeks to illustrate the optimal capital income tax problem for an economy
with an open capital market and two types of capital, one of which is private, mobile,
and “directly productive” (i.e., generates proﬁts) while the other is public, immobile, and
“indirectly productive” (i.e., infrastructure). The problem is how to set a level of tax so as to
fund infrastructure and maximize welfare when capital can move abroad. Let us consider an
economy with three production factors: immobile labor (L), mobile capital (K), and public
infrastructure (P). National income (Y) is determined by
Y = LαKβP γ ,
with 0 < α, β, γ < 1. The return on capital is given by
r = ∂Y
∂K = βLαKβ−1P γ.
The capital stock is endogenous as capital can ﬂow inward or outward, depending on the
after-tax rate of return. At equilibrium then
(1 −t)r = (1 −t∗)r∗,
where t is the domestic tax rate, t∗is the foreign tax rate, and r∗is the foreign return on
capital.
a. Calculate the equilibrium capital stock, and show that this will give an elasticity of the
capital stock to the tax rate that is negative and greater than unity (in absolute value) if
β > 1−2t

b. Show that for a ﬁxed level of public infrastructure (P) any increase in the domestic tax
rate (t) will reduce national income (Y). Show also that a reduction in the foreign tax rate t∗
would require a reduction in t as well to ensure national income remains unchanged. Explain.
Now suppose that tax revenues serve to ﬁnance infrastructure P, so that the stock of public
infrastructure is no longer independent of the tax rate but is given by
P = trK.
c. Show that national income is not monotically decreasing with t and that the optimal tax
rate is positive. Explain the optimal tax pattern in relation to the relative productivities of
private capital and public infrastructure.

VIII
ISSUES OF TIME


22
Intertemporal Efﬁciency
22.1
Introduction
Time is an essential component of economic activity. The passage of time sees the birth
and death of consumers and the purchase, depreciation, and eventual obsolescence
of capital. It sees new products and production processes introduced, and provides a
motive for borrowing and saving. Time also brings with it new and important issues in
public economics such as the beneﬁts from the provision of social security (pensions)
and the effect of government policy on economic growth. This chapter and the two that
follow are devoted to exploring these issues.
The competitive economy described in chapter 2 provided a ﬁrm foundation for
the discussion of economic efﬁciency and equity in a static setting. This economy
underpinned the analysis of efﬁciency failures and the policy responses to them. It
taught a number of important lessons about economic modeling. For all these reasons
it has been one of the most inﬂuential and durable models in economics. Despite its
usefulness, the model has shortcomings when it is applied to economic issues involving
time. We presented the competitive economy as being atemporal—having an absence
of any time structure. A temporal structure can be added by interpreting commodities
as being available at different times so that the commodity “bread for delivery today” is
a distinct commodity from “bread available tomorrow.” The list of commodities traded
is then extended to include all commodities at all points in time. Since only the labeling
of commodities has changed, all the results derived for the economy—the efﬁciency
theorems in particular—remain valid.
Although analyzing time in this way has the beneﬁt of simplicity, it also has one major
shortcoming. This shortcoming is best understood by considering the implications of
the equilibrium concept we applied to the model. Equilibrium was found by selecting
a set of prices that equate supply and demand on all markets. Moreover it was assumed
that no trade takes place until these equilibrium prices are announced. The implication
of this structure is that all agreements to trade present commodities, and commodities
to be consumed in the future, have to be made at the start of the economy. That is,
contracts have to be negotiated and agreed, and equilibrium prices determined, before
production and consumption can take place. This produces a poor representation of an
intertemporal economy that misses the gradual unfolding of trade, which is the very
essence of time. It is also an untenable interpretation: the need to make trades now

752
Part VIII: Issues of Time
for all commodities into the future requires all consumers and ﬁrms to be present at
the start of the economy and to know what all future products will be. Consequently,
if issues of time are to be properly addressed, a better model is needed. We consider
two alternative models of time: the overlapping generations economy, whose focus is
on population structure, in this chapter, and an alternative set of models, focusing on
growth through capital accumulation and technological innovation, in chapter 24.
The overlapping generations economy is one alternative to the competitive economy
that introduces time in a more convincing manner. This model has the basic feature
that the economy evolves over time with new consumers being born at the start of
each period and old ones dying. At any point in time the population consists of a mix
of old and young consumers. The life spans of these generations of young and old
overlap, which gives the model its name and provides a motive for trade between
generations at different points in their life cycles. This evolution of the population
allows the overlapping generations economy to address many issues of interest in public
economics.
Overlapping generations economies are important, not only because they give a
simple yet realistic model of the life cycle but also because of their many surprising
properties. Foremost among these properties, and the one that is focus of this chapter,
is that the competitive equilibrium can fail to be Pareto-efﬁcient despite the absence
of any of the sources of market failure identiﬁed in part III. The potential failure of
Pareto-efﬁciency provides an efﬁciency-based justiﬁcation for assessing the beneﬁts of
government intervention. Among such interventions the one with the most important
policy implications is social security (or pensions). Social security can transfer wealth
across points in the life cycle and between the generations. Given the impending “pen-
sions crises” that are slowly developing in many advanced economies as the elderly
population increases relative to the number of workers, social security is an issue of
major policy concern.
This chapter sets out the structure of a basic overlapping generations economy with
production. It presents the decision problems facing the consumers and the producers
in the economy. The solutions to these problems are then used to characterize the
equilibrium of the economy and to determine the steady-state equilibrium in which
consumption and output per capita are constant. Both Pareto-efﬁcient steady states
and the optimal Golden Rule steady state are characterized. It is then shown that the
economy can settle into an inefﬁcient steady state that is the important result from
a policy perspective. The nature of the inefﬁciency and the reason why it arises are
discussed.

753
Chapter 22: Intertemporal Efﬁciency
22.2
Overlapping Generations
22.2.1
Time and Generations
The two features of economic activity connected with the passage of time that we
wish to capture are the accumulation of capital and the fact that the life span of each
individual is short relative to the life span of the economy. The model we now develop
incorporates the ﬁrst aspect by allowing capital to be transferable across time periods
and to depreciate steadily over time. The second aspect is introduced by letting each
consumer have a ﬁnite life set within the inﬁnite life of the economy.
In the overlapping generations economy, time is divided into discrete periods, with
the length of the unit time interval being equal to the time between the birth of one
generation and the birth of the next. There is no end period for the economy; instead,
economic activity is expected to continue indeﬁnitely. At the beginning of each period
a new generation of young consumers is born. Each consumer lives for two periods of
time. The population grows at a constant rate, so, if the rate of population growth is
positive, each generation is larger than the previous one. Generation t is deﬁned as the
set of consumers who are born at the start of period t. Denoting the population growth
rate by n, if generation t is of size Ht, then the size of generation t + 1, Ht+1, is given
by Ht+1 = [1 + n] Ht.
The population at any point in time is made up of young and old consumers; it is
this overlapping of two consecutive generations that gives the model its name. This
generational structure is shown in ﬁgure 22.1 where the solid lines represent the life
span of a generation. It is the differing motives for trade for the old and the young, due
to their different life-cycle positions, that give economic content to the model.
At each point in time the economy has a single good that is produced using capital
and labor. This good can either be consumed or saved to be used as the capital input
in the next period. (Thinking of potatoes may be helpful. When harvested, they can
be either eaten or put aside to be used for planting in the next year.) The existence
of capital as a store of value allows consumers to carry purchasing power from one
period to the next. To simplify, we assume that capital does not depreciate during the
production process. Consumers plan their consumption to maximize lifetime utility and
the level of production is chosen so as to maximize proﬁts. All markets are competitive.
An allocation of production is feasible for the economy if consumption plus saving by
the two generations alive at each point in time is no greater than total output.

22.2.2
Consumers
The modeling of consumers is designed to capture a very simple form of life-cycle
behavior. Each consumer works only during the ﬁrst period of their life and inelastically
supplies one unit of labor. This unit of labor is their entire endowment. Hence the total
quantity of labor in the economy is equal to the number of young consumers. In their
second period of life each consumer is retired and supplies no labor. Retired from
work, old consumers live off the savings they accumulated when working. They are
fully aware of their own mortality and plan their consumption proﬁle accordingly. The
income earned by a consumer during the ﬁrst period of their life is divided between
consumption and savings. Second-period consumption is equal to savings plus interest.
With the exception of their date of birth, consumers are otherwise identical.
All consumers have identical preferences over consumption in the two periods of
life. For a consumer born in period t, these preferences are represented by the utility
function
U = U

xt
t , xt+1
t

,
(22.1)
where xt
t is consumption when young and xt+1
t
consumption when old. There is no
explicit disutility from the supply of the single unit of labor in the ﬁrst period of life.
The budget constraint of a typical consumer can be constructed by noting that labor
income is equal to the sum of consumption and saving. In the ﬁrst period of life,
consumption, xt
t , and saving, st, must satisfy the budget constraint
wt = xt
t + st,
(22.2)

755

where wt is the wage received for the single unit of labor. Savings accrue interest at
rate rt+1 (with interest paid in period t +1), so the value of second-period consumption

Before proceeding to further analysis of consumer choice, it is worth emphasizing
an important point: there are no ﬁnancial assets in this economy. Instead, saving takes
the form of investment in real capital. The interest rate is therefore equal to the return
on capital, and the same interest rate guides the purchase of capital by ﬁrms.
From (22.1) and (22.4) the utility-maximizing consumption plan satisﬁes the ﬁrst-

In (22.5) the left-hand side is the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution between
consumption in the two periods of life. The right-hand side is the intertemporal marginal
rate of transformation. The solution to this choice problem is illustrated in ﬁgure 22.2.
22.2.3
Production
The productive sector of the economy is assumed to consist of many competitive ﬁrms
all producing with the same constant-returns-to-scale production technology. These as-
sumptions allow the ﬁrms to be aggregated into one single representative ﬁrm modeled
by an aggregate production function. Using a representative ﬁrm greatly simpliﬁes the
presentation.
It has been assumed that the capital used in production does not depreciate (this
simpliﬁes matters but has no signiﬁcant economic consequences). At the end of the
production process in each period, the ﬁrm has (1) the (undepreciated) capital used in
production and (2) new output. The sum of these is the total output of the economy,
which is divided between saving (to be re-invested as capital) and consumption. To be
consistent, the aggregate production function is deﬁned to measure the gross output of

the ﬁrm, which is the sum of new output plus the undepreciated capital. Denote this
production function by F(Kt, Lt), where Kt is the capital stock in period t and Lt is
aggregate labor supply. An allocation is feasible if gross output is equal to the sum of
consumption for the two generations alive at time t plus savings
F(Kt, Lt) = Htxt
t + Ht−1xt
t−1 + Htst.
(22.6)
The representative ﬁrm chooses its use of capital and labor to maximize proﬁts, πt,
where
πt = F(Kt, Lt) −wtLt −rtKt.
(22.7)
Note that this expression for proﬁt values net output and the undepreciated capital
equally and assigns a rental rate of rt for the use of capital. The necessary condition
for choice of the level of capital is
FK = rt.
(22.8)
This is just the usual statement that capital should be employed up to the point at which
its marginal product, FK, is equal to its cost, rt. The ﬁrst-order condition for the quantity
of labor input is
FL = wt,
(22.9)

757
Chapter 22: Intertemporal Efﬁciency
so labor is employed up to the point at which its marginal product, FL, is equal to the
wage, wt.
This development of the ﬁrm’s decision problem allows the results to be related to
standard results from microeconomics. However, an alternative presentation is more
helpful in the context of an overlapping generations economy with a possibly variable
population. In this case what matters for economic welfare is not just how much is
producedbut, instead, howmuchisproducedperunitoflabor.Anincreaseinproduction
per unit of labor (with labor equal to the number of young consumers) can allow an
unambiguous increase in welfare provided that it is correctly distributed, but an increase
in production, without reference to the size of population, cannot. To capture these
observations, it is preferable to re-phrase the formulation of the production function.
It is now assumed that the production function satisﬁes constant returns to scale.
This assumption makes it possible to write
Yt = LtF
Kt

(22.10)
where Kt
Lt is the capital–labor ratio. Deﬁning yt = Yt
Lt and kt = Kt
Lt , we determine net
output per unit of labor by way of a function that has the capital–labor ratio as its sole
argument
yt = f(kt).
(22.11)
It is assumed that this function satisﬁes f (0) = 0, f ′ > 0, and f ′′ < 0 so that no output
can be produced without capital and the marginal product is positive but decreasing.
From (22.10) it follows that the marginal product of capital is

(22.12)
and the marginal product of labor

and
f(kt) −ktf ′(kt) = wt.

Part VIII: Issues of Time
Conditions (22.14) and (22.15) represent the optimal choice of capital and labor for
the ﬁrm when the production function is expressed in terms of the capital–labor ratio.
This pair of conditions characterize the choices arising from proﬁt maximization by
the ﬁrm.
22.3
Equilibrium
At an equilibrium for the overlapping generations economy it is necessary that con-
sumers maximize utility, that the representative ﬁrm maximizes proﬁt, and that all
markets clear. Since there is a single good that can be used as capital or consumed,
market clearing can be captured by the equality of demand and supply on the capital
market.
Granted this fact, there are two ways in which equilibrium can be viewed. The ﬁrst
is to consider the intertemporal equilibrium of the economy. Here, by intertemporal, is
meant a sequence of values for the economic variables that ensure that markets are in
equilibrium in every time period. This intertemporal equilibrium fully determines the
time path for the endogenous variables (xt
t , xt+1
t
, kt, wt, and rt) and hence their changes
from one period to the next. The alternative form of equilibrium is to consider the steady
state of the economy. The steady state is the situation where the endogenous variables
remain constant over time. Such an equilibrium can be thought of as a long-run position
for the economy. By deﬁnition, once the economy reaches a steady state, it never
leaves it.
To describe either form of equilibrium, it is ﬁrst necessary to characterize equilibrium
in the capital market. Equilibrium is achieved when the quantity of capital used in
production is equal to the level of savings, since capital is the only store of value for
saving. By deﬁnition, saving is labor income less consumption, so st = wt −xt
t . Hence,
since there are Ht young consumers in period t, the equality of total savings in period
t with capital used in period t + 1 requires that
Ht

wt −xt

= Kt+1.
(22.16)
Dividing through by Ht, and recalling that Ht+1 = [1 + n] Ht and Ht = Lt, we can
express this in terms of the capital–labor ratio as
wt −xt
t = kt+1[1 + n].
(22.17)
When (22.17) is satisﬁed, there is equilibrium in the capital market.

759
Chapter 22: Intertemporal Efﬁciency
22.3.1
Intertemporal Equilibrium
An intertemporal equilibrium is a sequence {xt
t , xt+1
t
, kt, wt, rt} of the endogenous vari-
ables that attains equilibrium in every time period t. In each time period all consumers
must maximize utility, the representative ﬁrm must maximize proﬁt, and the capital
market must be in equilibrium. Putting these together, we have the set of conditions
that must be simultaneously satisﬁed for the economy to be in equilibrium:
• Utility maximization: (22.4), (22.5)
• Proﬁt maximization: (22.14), (22.15)
• Market clearing: (22.17)
The equilibrium determined by these conditions should be seen as one where the
economy develops over time. The way that this works can be understood by following
the economy from its very beginning. Let the economy have an initial capital stock,
k1, in period 1. This capital stock is endowed by nature and belongs to consumers who
are already in the second period of life at the start of economic activity. The level of
capital and the initial labor force determine the interest rate, r1, and wage rate, w1,
from (22.14) and (22.15). Correspondingly (22.5), (22.4), and (22.17) simultaneously
determine x1
1, x2
1, and k2. Starting with k2, the process can be repeated for the next
time period. Continuing forward in this way generates the entire equilibrium path of
the economy.
Although the intertemporal behavior of the overlapping generations economy is of
great analytical interest, it will not be pursued in detail here. Instead, our focus will be
on the steady state from this point on.
22.3.2
Steady State
In a steady state all variables are constant. Consequently consumers in all generations
must have the same lifetime consumption plan. The quantity of capital per worker must
also remain constant. These observations suggest an interpretation of the steady state as
the long-run equilibrium in which the economy has reached the limit of its development
(but note that this interpretation is only strictly true if the economy converges to the
steady state).
Since all variables are constant in the steady state, the notation can be simpliﬁed by
dropping the subscripts referring to time. The steady-state equations determining the
wage and the interest rate are w = f (k) −kf ′(k) and r = f ′(k), where k, w, and r are

760
Part VIII: Issues of Time
the (constant) capital–labor ratio, wage rate and interest rate. Each consumer’s budget
constraint can then be written as
x1 +
x2
1 + f ′ (k) = f(k) −kf ′(k),
(22.18)
wherex1 andx2 arethesteady-stateconsumptionlevelsintheﬁrstperiodandthesecond
period of the consumer’s life. The steady-state capital market equilibrium condition
becomes
f(k) −kf ′(k) −x1 = [1 + n] k.
(22.19)
These equations can be used to provide a helpful means of displaying the steady-state
equilibrium. Solving (22.18) and (22.19) for the consumption levels x1 and x2 gives
x1 = f(k) −kf ′(k) −[1 + n] k,
(22.20)
and
x2 = [1 + n] k

1 + f ′ (k)

.
(22.21)
The interpretation of (22.20) and (22.21) is that each value of the steady-state capital–
labor ratio k implies a steady-state level of ﬁrst-period consumption from (22.20) and of
second-period consumption from (22.21).As k is varied, this pair of equations generates
a locus of

x1, x2
pairs. This is termed the consumption possibility frontier. It shows
the steady-state consumption plans that are possible for alternative capital–labor ratios.
There are basic economic reasons for expecting the consumption possibility frontier
to describe a non-monotonic relationship between x1 and x2 as illustrated in ﬁgure 22.3.
When k = 0, it can be seen immediately that x1 and x2 are both zero–no output can be
produced without capital. This is illustrated by the frontier beginning at the origin in
the ﬁgure. When k becomes positive, x1 and x2 also become positive. As k is increased,
we move further around the frontier with both x1 and x2 increasing. For large values
of k, x1 may begin to fall; x1 can even become zero since f(k) increases at an ever
slower rate while [1 + n]k increases at a constant rate. The actual shape of the frontier
depends on how quickly the returns to capital decrease as the capital input is increased
while holding labor input constant. What is underlying this is that low values of k do
not allow much to be produced, so consumption must be low. As k increases, more
consumption becomes possible. However, at high values of k, decreasing returns to
capital become important and consumption must be decreased in order to support the
reproduction of a very high capital stock.

Consumption possibilities
The importance of this construction is the following interpretation: All points on the
frontier are potentially steady-state equilibria. Each point determines a pair

x1, x2
and an implied value of the capital–labor ratio, k. The steady state that will actually
arise as the competitive equilibrium of the economy is determined by the interaction
of consumer preferences and the consumption possibility frontier. The question then
arises as to the efﬁciency properties of the consumption pair

x1, x2
, or equivalently
of the value of k. That is, are all values of k equally good or are some preferable
to others? If some are preferable, will the competitive economic activity result in an
optimal value of k in equilibrium? The answers to these questions are given in the
following sections. Before proceeding to these discussions, we will look at how the
competitive equilibrium is determined.
The optimal choice of the consumer is a point where the highest attainable in-
difference curve is tangential to the budget constraint. The budget constraint has
gradient−[1+r]. In a steady-state equilibrium the consumption plan

x1, x2
must also
be on the consumption possibility frontier and be tangential to the budget constraint.
The equilibrium is found by moving around the frontier until a value of k is reached
at which the indifference curve is tangent to the budget constraint deﬁned by the rate
of interest, r = f ′(k), at that level of capital. A steady-state equilibrium satisfying this
condition and two nonequilibrium allocations, at a and b, are shown in ﬁgure 22.4.

22.4.1
The Golden Rule
The central message of the previous section was that the competitive equilibrium will
occur at some point on the consumption possibility frontier. The consumer’s pre-
ferences, in conjunction with the production function, will determine precisely which
point this is. Having reached this conclusion, it is now possible to determine whether
any of the points on the frontier are preferable to others.
To do this, it is ﬁrst necessary to clarify in what sense one point can be preferable to
another. In a steady state every consumer in every generation has an identical lifetime
consumption plan. Consequently there are no equity issues involved, so “preferable”
will have to be stronger than just raising welfare through redistribution. If one point
is to be preferred to another, it must in the sense of a Pareto improvement. But if a
Pareto-preferred allocation can be found, it implies that the competitive equilibrium is
not efﬁcient—a ﬁnding that would show the First Theorem of Welfare Economics does
not apply to the overlapping generations economy.
The analytical strategy that we employ is to show that there is an optimal value of
the capital–labor ratio. This is the content of this section. The next step is to show that
there are other values that are Pareto-inferior to the optimal value. This is undertaken
in the next section.

763
Chapter 22: Intertemporal Efﬁciency
In the construction of the consumption possibility frontier it was noted that each
consumption allocation was related to a unique value of the capital–labor ratio. This
observation allows the study of the efﬁciency of alternative consumption allocations to
be reinterpreted as the study of alternative capital–labor ratios. The optimum level of
the capital–labor ratio can then be taken as that which maximizes total consumption in
each period. The relation that this level of capital satisﬁes is termed the Golden Rule
and the resulting capital–labor ratio is the Golden Rule level. Rules such as this are
important throughout the theory of economic growth.
The Golden Rule is derived by observing that total consumption in any period must
be equal to total output less additions to the capital stock, or
xt

t−1Ht−1 = Htf (kt) −Ht[kt+1 [1 + n] −kt] .

At a steady-state equilibrium (22.22) reduces to a constraint on steady-state consump-
tion levels given the capital stock:
x1 +
x2
[1 + n] = f (k) −nk.
(22.23)
The Golden Rule steady state consumption levels are found by maximizing the
steady-state level of utility, U(x1, x2), subject to the constraint (22.23). Substitut-
ing for x2, the Golden Rule level of ﬁrst-period consumption, x1, and capital, k,

The ﬁrst condition implies that at the Golden Rule the marginal rate of substitution

is given by [1 + n]. The second condition implies that the optimal capital–labor ratio,
denoted k∗, satisﬁes
f ′

(22.27)

764
Part VIII: Issues of Time
The condition in (22.27) is called the Golden Rule and the capital–labor ratio k∗is
termed the Golden Rule capital–labor ratio. It is the optimal capital–labor ratio in the
sense that it maximizes steady-state utility. Its relation to Pareto-efﬁciency is addressed
in the next section.
Returningtothecompetitiveeconomy, wehaveasimplerulefordeterminingwhether
its equilibrium achieves the Golden Rule. The choice of capital by the ﬁrm ensures that
f ′ = r. Combining this equality with the Golden Rule shows that if the competitive
economy reaches a steady-state equilibrium with r = n, this equilibrium will satisfy
the Golden Rule. Since no other equilibrium will, r = n must be the Golden Rule rate
of interest. Hence the competitive economy achieves the Golden Rule when its interest
rate is equal to the rate of population growth. If this occurs, it will have a capital–labor
ratio k = k∗.
Some further analysis provides more insight into the structure of the Golden
Rule equilibrium. From (22.20) and (22.21) total differentiation shows that dx1 =
−

(22.28)
This expression is the gradient of the consumption possibility frontier at a point corre-
sponding to a given value of k. At the Golden Rule capital–labor ratio k∗, with f ′ = n,
(22.28) reduces to
dx2
dx1 = −[1 + n] .
(22.29)
To understand what this implies, recall that with r = n the gradient of the consumer’s
budget constraint is −[1 + n]. The maximal budget constraint with this gradient will
thus be tangential to the consumption possibility frontier at the point corresponding to
the Golden Rule capital–labor ratio. Denote the implied consumption levels at this point
by x1∗, x2∗(see ﬁgure 22.5). Therefore, for the competitive equilibrium to achieve the
Golden Rule, when offered this budget constraint, the consumer must want to choose
the quantities x1∗, x2∗. The solid indifference curve in ﬁgure 22.5 illustrates such an
outcome. The coincidence of the Golden Rule allocation and the consumer’s choice
can only happen with an unlikely combination of preferences and technology. In fact
the optimal choice for the consumer with this budget constraint will almost always be
somewhere other than at the Golden Rule. With the dashed indifference curve in ﬁgure
22.5 the Golden Rule will not be a competitive equilibrium.

22.4.2
Pareto-Efﬁciency
Having now characterized the Golden Rule capital–labor ratio and its corresponding
rate of interest, it is possible to address the question of Pareto-efﬁciency. To do this,
ﬁrst note that if k > k∗, so that the equilibrium capital stock exceeds the Golden Rule
level, then r < n and the rate of interest is less than the rate of population growth. The
converse is true if k < k∗. These relations are a simple consequence of the decision
process of the ﬁrm and the concavity of the production function. In treating Pareto-
efﬁciency, we should take the cases of k > k∗and k≤k∗separately. We begin with
k > k∗.
If the capital–labor ratio is above k∗, the economy has overaccumulated along its
growth path. Consequently it is in a steady state with an excessive capital–labor ratio.
The analysis of the Golden Rule has shown that such a steady state fails to maximize
consumption per head. We now show that it is also not Pareto-efﬁcient. This is achieved
by describing a Pareto-improving reallocation for the economy.
The ﬁrst point to note is that there is a single good available in the economy, so
capital simply represents units of the good withheld from consumption. It is therefore
feasible at any point in time to reduce the capital stock and to raise consumption simply
by consuming some of the capital stock (i.e., eating the potatoes put aside for planting.)
So, in an economy that has overaccumulated, the consumers alive in any period with
an excessive capital stock (k > k∗) can consume some of the existing capital stock so

766
Part VIII: Issues of Time
as to reduce the stock to the level k∗. Consumption of the excess capital stock has two
consequences:
1. It raises the welfare of the existing generations because it increases their present
consumption at no cost.
2. It raises the welfare of all following generations because it places the economy on
the Golden Rule path and so maximizes their consumption.
Clearly, undertaking consumption of the capital stock above the Golden Rule level
raises the consumption of those currently alive and of all those who follow. This is a
certain Pareto improvement. Therefore any steady state with k > k∗and r < n is not
Pareto-efﬁcient.
When k ≤k∗, no such Pareto improvements can be found. In this case the economy
has accumulated insufﬁcient capital over the growth path. For the economy to move
to the Golden Rule, it must accumulate additional capital. This can only be achieved
if one (or more) of the generations is willing to forgo consumption. This has two
effects:
1. It reduces the welfare of the generations who give up consumption to increase the
capital stock.
2. It raises the welfare of all following generations because it moves the economy
closer (or on to) the Golden Rule.
Consequently, since at least one generation must reduce their consumption in the
transition to a Golden Rule steady state, no Pareto improvement can be made from the
initial position. Therefore all states with k ≤k∗are Pareto-efﬁcient.
In summary, any steady state with k > k∗and r < n is not Pareto-efﬁcient. Such
states are called dynamically inefﬁcient. Those with k ≤k∗are Pareto-efﬁcient and
are termed dynamically efﬁcient. The fact that steady states that are not Pareto-efﬁcient
can exist despite the model satisfying all the standard behavioral and informational
assumptions that describe a competitive economy shows that the First Theorem of
Welfare Economics cannot be extended to include overlapping generations economies.
Therefore these economies demonstrate that competition does not always lead to ef-
ﬁciency even when none of the standard causes of inefﬁciency (e.g., monopoly) are
present. This observation is the most fundamental to emerge out of the analysis of the
overlapping generations economy. As we will see, it provides the motive for studying
numerous forms of policy intervention.
The discussion has concluded that a steady-state equilibrium with r < n is not Pareto-
efﬁcient despite the economy satisfying all the standard competitive assumptions.

767
Chapter 22: Intertemporal Efﬁciency
However, it might still be suspected that to arrive at a steady state with r < n
requires some unusual structure to be placed on the economy. To show that this is
not so, consider the following example: The utility function of the single consumer in
each generation is given by
U(x1, x2) = β log x1 + [1 −β]log x2,
(22.30)
and the production function is Cobb–Douglas with y = Akα. From the ﬁve equations
describing a steady state, the interest rate can be calculated to be (the derivation of this
result is undertaken in exercise 22.7)
r =
α[1 + n]
[1 −β] [1 −α].
(22.31)
This will only be equal to the Golden Rule rate when
n =
α
[1 −β] [1 −α] −α .
(22.32)
If preferences and production do not satisfy this condition, and there is no reason
why they should, the economy will not grow on the Golden Rule growth path. This
example illustrates that a Golden Rule economy will be the exception rather than the
norm. A dynamically inefﬁcient steady state occurs when r < n. Using the solution for
r in (22.31), we can write this inequality as
α
1 −α <
n
1 + n [1 −β] .
(22.33)
From (22.33) it can been seen that inequality is most likely to arise when the following
occurs:
1. The increase in output following a marginal increase in the capital–labor ratio is
small (α low).
2. The rate of population growth is high (n large).
3. The consumer places a high weight on second-period consumption (1 −β large).
In conclusion, the efﬁciency of the steady-state equilibrium is dependent on the
relation of the capital stock to the Golden Rule level. The economy may reach equi-
librium at a dynamically inefﬁcient steady state that is not Pareto-efﬁcient. In such
a case a Pareto improvement can be achieved by consuming some of the capital
stock. A Cobb–Douglas example illustrated the factors that may lead to dynamic
inefﬁciency.

768
Part VIII: Issues of Time
Nowthatithasbeendemonstratedthatthecompetitiveequilibriumoftheoverlapping
generations economy need not be Pareto-efﬁcient, it remains to explain why. There is
a signiﬁcant difﬁculty in doing this: there is no agreed explanation for the inefﬁciency.
To explore this further, consider a very simple variant of the economy. In this variant
there is no production, and hence no capital. Instead, each young consumer is endowed
with one unit of a consumption good while old consumers are endowed with nothing.
Clearly, each consumer would like to even out consumption over the life span and so
would trade some consumption when young for consumption when old. But such a
trade is not possible. The young could give the old some consumption, but the old
have nothing to trade in exchange. Therefore the only equilibrium is that no trade takes
place (a position called autarky), whereas a Pareto-efﬁcient allocation would have
consumption in both periods of life.
It was in this setting that the inefﬁciency result was discovered. At ﬁrst sight it might
seem that it is just the structure of the economy—in particular, the lack of any way of
transferring purchasing power across periods—that prevents the attainment of Pareto-
efﬁciency. There are two responses to this. First, in the standard competitive economy
the efﬁciency result holds independent of any particular details of the economy. Second,
the analysis above has already shown that inefﬁciency can hold even if consumers
are able to hold savings that transfer purchasing power across periods. Inefﬁciency
usually arises when the market provides the wrong price signals. This is the case, for
example, with monopoly and externalities. Here one might suspect the inefﬁciency
to be due to an interest rate that provides the wrong signal for investment. But this
cannot be the explanation because in a model without production there is no interest
rate.
There is one point that is agreed on. Because the overlapping generations economy
has no end, it can have an inﬁnite number of consumers and, counting the good in each
period as a different good, an inﬁnite number of goods. The inefﬁciency only arises
if there is a double inﬁnity of consumers and goods. We have already seen that the
competitive economy with a ﬁnite number of goods and consumers is Pareto-efﬁcient.
If the number of consumers is inﬁnite but the number of goods ﬁnite, we have the
idealized competitive model with each consumer being insigniﬁcant relative to the
market, and efﬁciency again holds. Finally, with a ﬁnite number of consumers but an
inﬁnite number of goods, the economy is again efﬁcient.

22.5
Testing Efﬁciency
The Golden Rule, and the characterization of dynamic efﬁciency, provide conditions
that are very simple to evaluate. Before this can be done credibly, there is an important
issue concerning the assumptions describing the economy that needs to be addressed.
The critical assumption is that of a constant growth rate in the population. The im-
portance of constant growth lies in the fact that the Golden Rule is determined by the
equality of the interest rate to the growth rate of population. If the growth rate is not
constant, then this simple condition cannot be used. To provide a general means of
testing efﬁciency, an extension must be made to the analysis.
A more general condition can be motivated as follows: In the economy we have
described, thegrowthrateofcapitalisequaltothegrowthrateofpopulationinthesteady
state. Observing this, the new investment in each period is nK. The total payments to
the owners of capital are rK. The difference between these, rK −nK, measures
the total ﬂows out of the ﬁrm—which we can call dividend payments. The economy
is dynamically efﬁcient if r ≥n, which implies that dividend payments are positive
so that funds are ﬂowing out of the ﬁrm to the consumption sector. Conversely, the
economy is dynamically inefﬁcient if r < n, so funds are ﬂowing to the ﬁrm. The logic
of looking at the ﬂows in or out of ﬁrms provides a more general method of testing
efﬁciency than comparing the interest rate to the population growth rate, since it holds
under much less restrictive assumptions.
The general version of the test is to look at the difference between gross proﬁt
(the generalization of rK) and investment (the generalization of nK). The value of this
difference, as a proportion of GDP, for a selection of countries is presented in table 22.1.
All the values in the table are positive, which is clear evidence that the countries are
dynamically efﬁcient. However, given the high values reported in the table, these
countries remain at some distance from achieving the Golden Rule.

Conclusions
The overlapping generations economy provides a very ﬂexible representation of how an
economy evolves through time. It captures the natural features that consumers’lives are
short relative to the life span of the economy and that consumers allocate consumption
in a rational way over their life cycle. The concept of the steady state also gives a
description of equilibrium that is simple to apply.
The most interesting feature of the economy is that its lack of an ending means that
there is a double inﬁnity of goods and consumers. The double inﬁnity is responsible
for creating a potential inefﬁciency of the competitive equilibrium. Note the complete
contrast to the static model. The chapter has characterized both efﬁcient and optimal
steady-state equilibria. The characterization of efﬁciency produces a simple test of
dynamic efﬁciency that, as the evidence suggests, is met by a range of economies.

Social Security
23.1
Introduction
A typical social security system provides income during periods of unemployment,
poor health or disability, and ﬁnancial support, in the form of pensions, to the retired.
Although the generosity of systems varies among countries, these elements are present
in all developed economies. The focus of this chapter is the economic implications of
ﬁnancial assistance to the retired. The overlapping generations economy proves to be
ideal for this purpose.
In economic terms, the analysis of the part of the social security system that provides
assistance during unemployment or poor health is concerned with issues of uncertainty
and insurance. Speciﬁcally, unemployment and poor health can be viewed as events
that are fundamentally uncertain, and the provision of social security is insurance cover
against bad outcomes. In contrast, retirement is an inevitable outcome, or at least an
option, once the retirement age has been reached. Insurance is therefore not the main
issue (except for the problem of living for longer than accumulated wealth can ﬁnance).
Instead, the issues that are raised with pensions are the potential transfers of resources
between generations and the effect on savings behavior in the economy. Both issues
require a treatment that is set within an explicitly intertemporal framework.
The pensions systems in many developed economies are coming under pressure in a
process that has become known as the “pensions crisis.” The roots of this crisis can be
found in the design of the systems and the process of change in population structure.
The potential extent of this crisis provides strong ground for holding the view that
reform of the pension system is currently one of the most pressing economic policy
challenges.
After describing alternative forms of pension systems, the nature of the pensions
crisis is described. This introduces the concept of the dependency ratio and how this
ratio links pensions and pension contributions. The economic analysis of social secu-
rity begins with a study of its effect on the equilibrium of the economy. Chapter 22
introduced the overlapping generations economy and showed how its competitive equi-
librium may be inefﬁcient. The potential for inefﬁciency opens up the possibility of
efﬁciency-enhancing policy interventions. From this perspective we consider whether
social security can be used to secure a gain in efﬁciency. The fact that a social security
program may enhance efﬁciency can be understood from the effect of social security

776
Part VIII: Issues of Time
on the level of the capital stock. If a social security program has the form of forced
saving, so that consumers are provided with greater second-period income than they
would naturally choose, then the program will raise the capital stock through the in-
creased savings it generates. This will be beneﬁcial in an undercapitalized economy.
Conversely, if the program simply transfers earnings from those who are working to
those who are retired, savings will fall and hence the level of capital. These observations
motivate the search for a social security program that can guide the economy to the
Golden Rule.
The fall in the birth rate is one of the causes of the pensions crisis. It is an interesting
question to consider how a change in the birth rate affects the level of welfare at the
steadystateofanoverlappinggenerationseconomy. Wepursuethisissuebyconsidering
how the birth rate affects the structure of the consumption possibility frontier, both in
the absence and in the presence of a social security program. Social security may be
beneﬁcial for the economy, but there are issues of political economy connected with the
continuation of a program. The introduction of a program with the structure observed
in practice results in a transfer of resources toward the ﬁrst generation of retired (they
receive but do not contribute) and away from some of the generations that follow. This
raises the question of how such a program is ever sustained, since each generation has
an incentive to receive but not to contribute. The ﬁnal analytical issue is to review
the concept of Ricardian equivalence and its implications for social security. Ricardian
equivalence is the observation that by changing their behavior, consumers are able to
offset the actions of the government. We show the consequences this can have for social
security and address the limitations of the argument. Finally, after having completed
the analytical material, we return to address some of the proposals that have been made
for the reform of social security programs.
23.2
Types of System
One deﬁning characteristic of a social security system is whether pensions are paid from
anaccumulatedfundorfromcurrenttaxcontributions. Thisfeatureformsthedistinction
between fully funded and pay-as-you-go social security systems. The economic effects,
both in terms of efﬁciency and distribution, between these two polar forms of system
are markedly different.
In a pay-as-you-go social security program the current contributions through tax-
ation of those in employment provide the pensions of those who are retired. At
any point in time the contributions to the system must match the pension payments

777
Chapter 23: Social Security
made by the system. The social security systems presently in operation in the United
States, the United Kingdom, and numerous other countries are broadly of this form.
The qualiﬁer “broadly” is used because, for example, although the US system owns
some assets and could afford a short-term deﬁcit, the assets would fund only a very
short period of payments. At each point in time a pay-as-you-go system satisﬁes the
equality
Beneﬁts received by retired = Contributions of workers.
(23.1)
This equality can be expressed in terms of the number of workers and pensioners by
βR = τE,
(23.2)
where τ is the average social security contribution of each worker, β is the average
pension received, E the number of workers in employment, and R the number of retired.
If there is a constant rate of growth of population, so that the workforce is a constant
multiple of the retired population, then E = [1 + n]R. Using this in (23.2) yields
βR = τ [1 + n] R, or
β = [1 + n] τ.
(23.3)
This relationship implies that the tax paid when young earns interest at rate n before
being returned as a pension when old. Hence in a pay-as-you-go pension system the
return on contributions is determined by the growth rate of population.
In a fully funded system each worker makes contributions toward social security via
the social security tax, and the contributions are invested by the social security program.
The program therefore builds up a pension fund for each worker. The total pension
beneﬁts received by the worker when retired are then equal to their contribution to
the program plus the return received on the investment. Such a program satisﬁes the
equalities
Pensions = Social security tax plus interest = Investment plus return.
(23.4)
The implication of this constraint is that the fund earns interest at rate r, so the pension
and the tax are related by
β = [1 + r] τ.
(23.5)
A fully funded social security system forces each worker to save an amount at least
equal to the tax they pay. It remains possible for workers to save more if they choose
to do so. If, in the absence of social security, all workers chose to save an amount
in excess of the taxed levied by the program, then, holding all else constant, a fully

778
Part VIII: Issues of Time
funded system will simply replace some of the private saving by an equivalent amount
of public saving. In this case a fully funded system will have no effect on the equilibrium
outcome. We explore this observation further when we discuss Ricardian equivalence
in section 23.8. In more general settings with a variety of investment opportunities, the
possibility must be considered that the rate of return on private savings may differ from
that on public savings. When it does, a fully funded system may affect the equilibrium.
This point arises again in the analysis of pension reform.
Contrastingthesetwoformsofsystem, itcanbeobservedthatapay-as-you-gosystem
leads to an intergenerational transfer of resources, from current workers to current
retired, whereas a fully funded system can at most cause an intertemporal reallocation
for each generation. This observation suggests that the two systems will have rather
different welfare implications; these will be investigated in the following sections. In
addition the pay-as-you-go system has a return of n on contributions and the fully
funded system has a return of r. These returns will differ unless the economy is at the
Golden Rule allocation.
Systems that fall between these two extremes are termed non–fully funded. Such
systems make some investments, but the payments made in any given period may
be greater than or less than the revenue, composed of tax payments plus return on
investment, received in that period. The difference between payments and revenue will
comprise investment, or disinvestment, in the pension fund.
23.3
The Pensions Crisis
Many countries face a pensions crisis that will require that their pensions systems be
signiﬁcantly reformed. This section identiﬁes the nature and consequences of this crisis.
Once the analysis of social security is completed, we return in section 23.9 to review a
range of proposals for reform of the system in the light of this crisis.
The basis of the pensions crisis is threefold. First, the birth rate has fallen in most
developed economies. Although immigration has partially offset the effect of this in
some countries, there has still been a net effect of a steady reduction in the addition
of new workers. The second effect is that longevity is increasing since people are, on
average, living longer. For any given retirement age, this is increasing the number of
retired. Third, there is also a tendency for the retirement age to fall.
The net effect of these three factors is that the proportion of retired in the population
is growing, and it is this increase that is problematic. In general terms, as the proportion
of the population that is retired rises, the output of each worker must support an ever

larger number of people. Output per capita must rise just to keep consumption per
capita constant. If output does not rise quickly enough, then productivity gains will be
diluted and output per capita will fall. Furthermore, supporting the retired at a given
standard of living will impose an increasing burden on the economy.
The size of this effect can be seen by looking at forecasts for the dependency ratio.
The dependency ratio measures the relative size of the retired population and is deﬁned
as the size of the retired population relative to the size of the working population.
Table 23.1 reports the dependency ratio for a range of countries over the recent past
and forecasts for its development into the future. The countries in the table are typical
with the dependency ratio forecast to increase substantially—in all cases the ratio more
than doubles from 1980 to 2040. This means that those working have to support an
increasing proportion of retired. In some cases, Japan for instance, the forecast increase
in the dependency ratio is dramatic.
The consequence of the increase in the dependency ratio can be expressed in more
precise terms by looking at the relationship between the contributions to pay for social
security and the resulting level of social security. Using the identity (23.2) for a pay-
as-you-go system and dividing through by E, we can write the relationship between
social security tax, pension, and dependency ratio as
τ = βD,
(23.6)
where D is the dependency ratio, R
E . Hence as D rises, τ must increase if the level of
the pension β is to be maintained. Alternatively, the pension decreases as D increases if
the tax rate is held constant. If some combination of such changes is not made, then the
social security system will go into deﬁcit if the dependency ratio increases. Neither a
deﬁcit, a falling pension, or an increasing tax is not an attractive option for governments
to present to their electors.

These factors can be seen at work in forecasts for the future path of the US social
security program as predicted by the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and
Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance Trust Funds (OASDI). Figure 23.1 shows
the forecast deﬁcit for the US Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Fund (but does not
include the Disability Insurance Fund). The income rate is deﬁned as the ratio of income
from payroll tax contributions to the OASDI taxable payroll (effectively the average
tax rate for social security contributions), and the cost rate is the ratio of the cost of
the program to the taxable payroll. The projections are based on the structure of the
social security program remaining much as it is today (in terms of the rate of tax and
the value of beneﬁts). As the ﬁgure shows, the fund is forecast to go into deﬁcit in 2018
and remain in deﬁcit unless some signiﬁcant reform is undertaken.
To avoid such deﬁcits, what these facts imply is that governments face a choice
between maintaining the value of pension payments, but with an ever-increasing tax
rate, or allowing the value of pensions to erode so as to keep the tax rate broadly
constant. For example, the UK government has reacted to this situation by allowing the
real value of the state pension to steadily erode. As shown in table 23.2, the value of the
pension has fallen from almost 40 percent of average earnings in 1975 to 26 percent in
2000, and it is expected to continue to fall, especially since the pension is now indexed
to prices rather than earnings. These reductions have taken the value of the pension well
below the subsistence level of income. Consequently pensioners with no other source of
income receive supplementary state beneﬁts to take them to the subsistence level. This
reduction in the state pension has been accompanied by government encouragement of
the use of private pensions. We return to this in the discussion of reforms in section 23.9.

In conclusion, the basis of the pensions crisis has been identiﬁed, and it has been
shown how this impacts on the state pensions that will be paid in the future. The depth
of this crisis shows why social security reform is such an important policy issue. The
chapter now proceeds to look at the economic effects of social security as a basis for
understanding more about the arguments behind the alternative reforms that have been
proposed.
23.4
The Simplest Program
Having set out the issues connected with social security programs, the focus is now
placed on their economic effects. The fundamental insight into the effect of social
security on the economy can be obtained using the simple model of section 22.4.2. In
this economy there is no production but only the exchange of endowments. Although
simple, this economy is still capable of supporting a role for social security.
In the economy under analysis, each consumer receives an endowment of one unit of
the single consumption good in the ﬁrst period of their life but receives no endowment
in the second period. To simplify, the population is assumed to be constant. As already
noted in chapter 22 the equilibrium of this economy without any government interven-
tion has the endowment entirely consumed when young so that there is no consumption
when old. This has to be the equilibrium, since the old have nothing to offer the young
in trade. This autarkic equilibrium is not Pareto-efﬁcient, since all consumers would
prefer a more even distribution of consumption over the two periods of life.
How can a social security program improve on the autarkic equilibrium? Consider
a pay-as-you-go program that taxes each young consumer half a unit of consumption

and transfers this to an old consumer. The lifetime consumption plan for every con-
sumer then changes from the autarkic equilibrium consumption plan of {1, 0} to the
new consumption plan of
 1

. Provided that the preferences of the consumers are
convex, the new allocation is preferred to the original allocation. Since this applies to
all generations, the social security system has achieved a Pareto improvement. This
argument is illustrated in ﬁgure 23.2. The Pareto improvement from the social security
system is represented by the move from the lowest indifference curve to the central
indifference curve.
In fact a far stronger conclusion can be obtained than just the ability of social security
to achieve a Pareto improvement. To see this, note that the assumption of a constant
population means that the per capita consumption possibilities for the economy lie on
the line joining {1, 0} to {0, 1}. In the same way that the Golden Rule was deﬁned for the
economy with production, the Golden Rule allocation can be deﬁned for this economy
as that which maximizes utility subject to the ﬁrst- and second-period consumption
levels summing to 1. Denote this allocation by {x1∗, x2∗}. The Golden Rule allocation
can then be achieved by a pay-as-you-go social security program that transfers x2∗
units of the consumption good from the young consumer to the old consumer.
These arguments show how social security can achieve a Pareto improvement and,
for the simple exchange economy described, even achieve the Golden Rule allocation.
The social security program is effective because of the intergenerational transfer that it

engineers and the consequent revision in the consumption plans. The optimality result
was built upon the use of a pay-as-you-go program. In contrast, a fully funded program
cannot be employed, since there is no commodity that can be used as an investment
vehicle. The form in which these conclusions extend to the more general overlapping
generations economy with production is now discussed.
23.5
Social Security and Production
It has already been shown how social security can obtain a Pareto improvement in
an overlapping generations economy with no production. When there is production, a
wider range of effects can arise, since social security affects the level of savings and
hence capital accumulation. These additional features have to be accounted for in the
analysis of social security.
The concept of the Golden Rule and its associated capital–labor ratio was introduced
in chapter 22. This showed that the optimal capital stock is the level that equates the rate
of interest to the rate of population growth. If the capital stock is larger than this, the
economy is dynamically inefﬁcient and a Pareto improvement can be made by reducing
it. When it is smaller, the economy is dynamically efﬁcient, so no Pareto improvement
can be made, but the economy is not in an optimal position. These observations then
raise the questions: How does social security affect capital accumulation? Can it be
used to move a nonoptimal economy closer to the Golden Rule?
To answer these questions, consider a social security program that taxes each worker
an amount τ and pays each retired person a pension β . The program also owns a
quantity Ks
t of capital at time t. Equivalently it can be said to own ks
t , ks
t = Ks
t
Lt , of
capital per unit of labor. A social security program will be optimal if the combination
of τ, β, and ks
t is feasible for the program and ensures that the economy achieves the
Golden Rule.

(23.7)
which states that pension payments must be equal to tax revenue plus the return on

Noting that the pension, β, which is received in the second period of life, is discounted
in a consumer’s budget constraint (since x1 + s = w −τ and [1 + r] s + β = x2, it
follows that s = x2−β
1+r ), the budget constraint under the program can be written as
x1 +

Equilibrium on the capital market requires that private savings are equal to total capital
less the capital owned by the social security program. This condition can be expressed as
w −x1 −τ = [1 + n] 
k −ks
.
(23.11)
The choices of the representative ﬁrm do not change, so the conditions relating factor
prices to capital still apply with
f ′(k) = r,
(23.12)
f(k) −kf ′(k) = w.
(23.13)
The steady-state equilibrium with the pension program is the solution to equations
(23.8) to (23.13).
The aim now is to investigate the effect that the social security policy can have on
the equilibrium. To see why it may be possible to design a program that can achieve
the Golden Rule, it should be noted that the failure of the competitive equilibrium
without intervention to achieve efﬁciency results from the savings behavior of individ-
uals leading to over- or underaccumulation of capital. With the correct choice of social
security program the government can effectively force-save for individuals. This alters
the steady-state level of the capital stock and hence the growth path of output.
In equations (23.8) to (23.13) there are ﬁve private-sector choice variables (k, x1,
x2, w, and r) that are treated as endogenous, plus the three variables (β, τ, and ks) that
describe the social security program. Given that there are six equilibrium conditions,
the pension system can choose any two of the variables describing the program with
the third determined alongside the endogenous variables. To analyze the system, it is
simplest to treat β as endogenous and τ and ks as exogenous.
The method of analysis is to assume that the Golden Rule is achieved and then to
work back to the implications of this assumption. Consequently let r = n. From the

785
Chapter 23: Social Security
ﬁrm’s choice of capital, the Golden Rule is consistent with a capital stock that solves
f ′(k∗) = n and hence a wage rate that satisﬁes w = f (k∗) −k∗f ′ (k∗). The important
observation is that with r = n, the budget constraint for the social security program
collapses to
β
1 + n = τ + [r −n] ks = τ,
(23.14)
so a program attaining the Golden Rule must have the form of a pay-as-you-go system
with β = [1 + n] τ. It is important to observe that any value of ks is consistent with
(23.14) when r = n, including positive values. This observation seems to conﬂict with
the deﬁnition of a pay-as-you-go program. These comments are rationalized by the fact
that we are working with the steady state of the economy. The social security program
may own a stock of capital, ks > 0, but in operating the pay-as-you-go-system, it does
notaddtoorsubtractfromthislevelofcapital. Instead, thereturnonthecapitalitownsis
justsufﬁcienttomaintainitataconstantlevel. Itremainstruethatalonganygrowthpath,
including the steady state, a pay-as-you-go system cannot increase its capital holdings.
The values of the tax and capital stock of the program required to support the Golden
Rule can now be found by using the fact that the program is pay-as-you-go to reduce
the consumer’s budget constraint to
x1 +
x2
1 + r = w.
(23.15)
Combining this constraint with the condition describing consumer choice indicates that
the demand for ﬁrst-period consumption must depend only on the wage rate and the
interest rate, so x1 = x1 (w, r). Using the conditions for the choice of the ﬁrm, we
have that the wage rate and interest rate depend on the level of capital, so demand for
ﬁrst-period consumption can be written as
x1 = x1(w, r) = x1
f(k) −kf ′(k) , f ′(k)

= x1(k).

The capital market-clearing condition can then be written as

Part VIII: Issues of Time
Condition (23.18) determines pairs of values {τ, ks} that will achieve the Golden Rule.
Since k∗is ﬁxed the relationship between τ and ks can be written more compactly as
τ = a + bks.
(23.19)
Any pair {τ, ks} that satisﬁes (23.19) will generate the Golden Rule provided that the
capital stock held by the program is not negative. For instance, if the program holds no
capital, so that ks = 0, then the value of the social security tax will be
τ = a.
(23.20)
Although the discussion to this point has implicitly been based on the tax, τ, being
positive, it is possible that the optimal program may require it to be negative. If ks = 0,
it follows from (23.20) that τ < 0 when a < 0. When τ is negative, the social security
program involves a transfer from the old to the young (rather than a pension paid to the
old from the output of the young). As an example, if x1 (w, r) = w
2 and f (k) = kα,
then k∗=

these values into (23.20) gives

If the rate of population growth is 5 percent, then the tax will be negative whenever
1
43 < α.
(23.22)
For this example the tax rate is positive only for very small values of α.
The results have shown that attainment of the Golden Rule requires a pay-as-you-go
social security system. By implication, a fully funded program will fail to attain the
Golden Rule. In fact an even stronger result can be shown: a fully funded program
will have no effect on the equilibrium. To demonstrate this result, observe that a fully
funded program must satisfy the identity that the value of pension paid must equal the
value of tax contributions plus interest, or
βLt−1 = τLt−1 [1 + rt] = ksLt[1 + rt].
(23.23)
Evaluated at a steady state,
β = τ [1 + r] = ks [1 + n] [1 + r] .
(23.24)
The substitution of (23.24) into the equilibrium conditions (23.8) to (23.13) shows
that they reduce to the original market equilibrium conditions described in (22.18) to

787
Chapter 23: Social Security
(22.21). The fully funded system therefore replaces private saving by public saving
and does not affect the consumption choices of individual consumers. It has no real
effect on the equilibrium, and if the initial steady state were not at the Golden Rule, the
fully funded social security program would not restore efﬁciency. This observation is
discussed further in section 23.8.
This analysis has demonstrated how a correctly designed social security program can
generate the Golden Rule equilibrium, provided that it is not of the fully funded kind. A
fully funded system does not affect the growth path. In contrast, a pay-as-you-go system
can affect the aggregate levels of savings and hence the steady-state capital–labor ratio.
This allows it to achieve the Golden Rule.
23.6
Population Growth
The fall in the rate of population growth is an important factor in the pensions crisis.
While operating a simple pay-as-you-go program, a decreasing population size makes
it harder to sustain any given level of pension. Observing this fact raises the general
question of how the level of welfare is related to the rate of population growth. This
section addresses this issue both with and without a social security program.
Assume ﬁrst that there is no social security program in operation. Recall that the
consumption possibility frontier is deﬁned by a pair of consumption levels x1 and x2
that satisﬁes the conditions
x1 = f(k) −kf ′(k) −[1 + n] k
(23.25)
and
x2 = [1 + n] k

1 + f ′ (k)

.
(23.26)
The effect of a change in the population growth rate can be determined by calculating
how it modiﬁes this consumption possibility frontier. For a given value of k, it follows
that ∂x1
∂n = −k and ∂x2
∂n = k

1 + f ′ (k)

. Consequently, holding k ﬁxed, an increase in
the growth rate of population reduces the level of ﬁrst-period consumption but raises the
second-period level. This moves each point on the consumption possibility frontier
inward and upward. Furthermore, when evaluated at the Golden Rule capital–labor
ratio, these changes in the consumption levels satisfy

Population growth and consumption
Hence, for a small increase in n, the point on the frontier corresponding to the Golden
Rule equilibrium must shift upward along a line with gradient −[1 + n]. The conse-
quence of these calculations is that the shift of the consumption possibility must be as
illustrated in ﬁgure 23.3.
How the level of welfare generated by the economy is affected by an increase in n
then depends on whether the initial equilibrium level of capital is above or below the
Golden Rule level. If it is below, then welfare is reduced by an increase in the population
growth rate—the capital stock moves further from the Golden Rule level. The converse
occurs if the initial equilibrium is above the Golden Rule. This is illustrated in ﬁgure
23.4 where the initial equilibrium is at e0 with a capital–labor ratio below the Golden
Rule. The equilibrium moves to e following an increase in n. It can also be seen in the
ﬁgure that if the initial equilibrium had been at a point on the frontier above the Golden
Rule, then the upward shift in the frontier would imply that the new equilibrium moves
onto a higher indifference curve.
Now introduce a social security system and assume that this is adjusted as population
growth changes to ensure that the Golden Rule is satisﬁed for all values of n. For a small
change in n, the Golden Rule allocation moves along the line with gradient −[1+n], as
noted above. However, for large increases in n, the gradient of this line becomes steeper.
This moves the Golden Rule equilibrium as shown in ﬁgure 23.5 to a point below the
original tangent line. As a consequence the increase in population growth must reduce
the per capita level of consumption x1 +
x2
1+n. Therefore, even with an optimal social

security scheme in operation, an increase in population growth will reduce per capita

The effects of changes in the rate of population growth are not as clear as the simple
equilibrium identity for a pay-as-you-go program suggests. As well as the mechanics
of the dependency ratio, a change in population growth also affects the shape of the
consumption possibility frontier. How welfare changes depends on whether a social

790
Part VIII: Issues of Time
security program is in operation and on the location of the initial equilibrium relative to
the Golden Rule. If an optimal program is in operation, then an increase in population
growth must necessarily reduce the level of per capita consumption.
23.7
Sustaining a Program
In the simple economy without production, a social security program involving the
transfer of resources between generations achieves a Pareto improvement. This raises
the obvious question of why such a program will not always be introduced.
The basic nature of the pay-as-you go pension program described above is that
the young make a transfer to the old without receiving anything directly from those
old in return. Instead, they must wait until their own old age before receiving the
compensating payment. Although these transfers do give rise to a Pareto improvement,
it can be argued that it is not in the young consumer’s private interest to make the transfer
provided that they expect to receive a transfer. (Think of the generations playing a game.
Giving a transfer cannot be a Nash equilibrium strategy.) If the young consumers do
not give their transfer but still expect to receive their pensions, then their consumption
level will be increased. Clearly, this makes them better off, so they will not wish to
make the transfer. Since the social security system is not individually rational, how can
the young be persuaded to consent to the imposition of the social security program?
Two different answers to this question will be considered. The ﬁrst answer is based
on altruism on the part of the young—they are willing to provide the transfer because
they care about the old. This rationalizes the existence of a social security program but
only by making an assumption that moves outside the standard economic framework of
individual self-interest. The second answer works with the standard neoclassical model
of self-interest but shows how the program can be sustained by the use of “punishment
strategies” in an intertemporal game. It should be stressed that the fact that participation
in a social security program is mandatory is not by itself a valid explanation of the
existence of the program. All programs have to have willing participants to initiate
them (so they must be individually rational at their introduction) and need continuing
support to sustain them.
Altruism refers to feelings of concern for others beside oneself. It is natural to think
that altruism applies to close family members, but it may also apply to concern for
people generally.
Although the existence of altruism takes us outside the standard perspective of be-
havior driven by narrow self-interest, it need not affect the tools we employ to analyze

791
Chapter 23: Social Security
behavior. What is meant by this is that altruism alters the nature of preferences but does
not affect the fact that a consumer will want to achieve the highest level of preference
possible. Consequently, given a set of altruistic preferences, the consumer will still
choose the action that best satisﬁes those preferences subject to the constraints placed
on their choices. The standard tools remain valid but operate on different preferences.
There are numerous ways to represent altruism, but one of the simplest is to view it
as a consumption externality. Writing the utility of a consumer in generation t in the
form
Ut = U

xt
t , xt+1
t
, xt
t−1

,
(23.28)
gives an interpretation of altruism as concern for the consumption level, xt
t−1, achieved
by a member of the earlier generation (which is usually interpreted as the parent of the
consumer). A very similar alternative would be to assume that
Ut = U

xt
t , xt+1
t
, Ut−1

,
(23.29)
so that altruism is reﬂected in a concern for the utility of the member of the earlier
generation.
Both of these forms of altruism provide a motive for a social security program that
transfers resources from the young to the old. Consider (23.28). A consumer with this
utility function can be thought of as choosing her personal consumption levels xt
t ,
xt+1
t
, and a transfer, τ, to the old consumer. The effect of the transfer is to raise the
consumption level xt
t−1, since the budget constraint of the old consumer is
xt
t−1 = [1 + rt] st−1 + τ.
(23.30)
Provided that the marginal utility generated by an increase in xt
t−1 is sufﬁciently
high, the consumer will willingly choose to make a positive transfer. In this sense
the provision of social security has become individually rational because of altruism.
The second reason why transfers may be sustained is now considered. A rational
explanation for participating in a social security program can be found in the fact that
each young person expects a similar transfer when he is old. Young persons can then
be threatened with having this removed if they do not themselves act in the appropriate
manner. This punishment can sometimes (but not always) be sufﬁcient to ensure that
compliance with the social security program is maintained.
To give substance to these observations, it is best to express the argument using the
language of game theory. The analysis so far has shown that the strategy to provide a
transfer is not a Nash equilibrium. Recall that in the determination of a Nash equilibrium

each individual holds the strategies of all others constant as he considers his own choice.
So, if all others are providing transfers, it will be a better strategy not to do so but to
still receive. If others are not transferring, then it is also best not to do so. Therefore
not providing a transfer is a dominant strategy, and the individually rational Nash
equilibrium must be for no transfers to take place.
These simple Nash strategies are not the only ones that can be played. To motivate
what else can be done, it is best to think about repeated games and the more sophisticated
strategies that can be played in them. A repeated game is one where the same “stage”
game is played once each period for an endless number of periods by the same players.
The prisoners’ dilemma, given in the matrix in ﬁgure 23.6, has the general features of
the social security model. It is not exactly the same, since the social security model has
many generations of consumers and not just the two given in the game.
If both players contribute to social security, then a payoff of 5 is attained. If neither
contributes, the payoff is only 2. This reﬂects the fact that the social security equilibrium
is Pareto-preferred to the equilibrium without. However, the highest payoff is obtained
if a player chooses not to contribute but the other does. When played a single time, the
unique Nash equilibrium is for both players to choose Don’t contribute—if the other
contributes, then it pays not to. This reasoning applies to both players and hence the
equilibrium. This equilibrium is inefﬁcient and is Pareto-dominated by {Contribute,
Contribute}.
The situation is completely changed if the game is repeated indeﬁnitely. Doing so
allows the efﬁcient equilibrium {Contribute, Contribute} to be sustained. A strategy
that supports this is for each player to choose Contribute until their opponent chooses
Don’t contribute. Once this has happened, they should continue to play Don’t contribute
from that point on.

793
Chapter 23: Social Security
To evaluate the payoffs from this strategy, assume that the discount factor between
periods is δ. The payoff from always playing Contribute is then

Alternatively,ifDon’tcontributeisplayedunilaterallyatemporarygainwillbeobtained

(23.34)
That is, {Contribute, Contribute} will be an equilibrium if the players are sufﬁciently
patient. The reason behind this is that a patient player will put a high value on payoffs
well into the future. Therefore the reduction to a payoff of 2 after the ﬁrst period will
be very painful. For a very impatient player, only the payoff of 10 will really matter
and they are driven to Don’t contribute.
The strategy just described is known as a “punishment strategy”: the deviation from
Contribute is punished by reversion to the inefﬁcient Nash equilibrium. Although the
punishment will hurt both players, the point is that it will not happen in equilibrium,
since the optimal play with these strategies is always to choose Contribute when players
are patient. In summary, in an inﬁnitely repeated game, punishment strategies can be
used to support efﬁcient equilibria.
The same line of reasoning can be applied to the analysis of social security. What is
different in this context is that the same players do not interact every period. Instead, it
is a different pair of old and young consumers that meet in each period. However, the
punishment strategy can still be employed in the following way: each consumer when
young will provide a transfer of size x to the old consumer that overlaps with them
only if that old person alive at the same time provided a transfer in the previous period;

794
Part VIII: Issues of Time
otherwise no transfer is provided. If all generations of consumers play according to this
strategy, then the transfers can be made self-supporting.
There remains one important limitation to this use of punishment strategies in the
social security environment. To implement the strategy, each young consumer must
know whether the transfer was made in the period before they were alive. This issue
does not arise in the standard application of punishment strategies, since the players are
alive in all periods—they need only remember what happened in the previous period.
Consequently some form of veriﬁcation device is necessary to support the punishment
strategy. Without the veriﬁcation, the only equilibrium is for there to be no transfers,
which is a Pareto-inferior outcome.
This discussion of pay-as-you-go social security has shown how such a system can
be sustained even when there is a short-run incentive for consumers not to make the
required transfers. The basis for this claim is that social security in an overlapping
generations economy has the nature of a repeated game so that strategies that punish
the failure to provide a transfer can be employed. What this analysis shows is that an
apparent act of generosity—the gift of a transfer to the older generation—can be made
to be rational for each individual. So the provision of social security may occur not
through altruism but through rationality.
23.8
Ricardian Equivalence
Ricardian equivalence refers to the proposition that the government can alter an eco-
nomic policy and yet the equilibrium of the economy can remain unchanged. This
occurs if consumers can respond to the policy by making off-setting changes in their
behavior that neutralize the effect of the policy change. In terms of the present chapter,
Ricardian equivalence holds when the government introduces, or changes, a social
security system and yet the changes in individual behavior render the policy change
ineffectual.
Such equivalence results have already featured twice in the text. On the ﬁrst occasion,
in the analysis of the private purchase of public goods, it was shown that by changing
their purchases, the individuals could offset the effect of income redistribution. Fur-
thermore it was also rational for the individuals to make the off-setting changes. The
second case of equivalence arose in the derivation of the optimal social security pro-
gram where it was noted that a fully funded system would not affect the capital–labor
ratio. The explanation for this equivalence was that consumers react to a fully funded
social security program by making a reduction in their private savings that ensures that
total savings is unchanged.

795
Chapter 23: Social Security
The common feature of these examples is that the effect of the policy change and the
off-setting reaction involves the same individuals. So they have a direct incentive to
modify their behavior. Clearly, this is characteristic only of a social security system that
is fully funded with a return equal to that on private savings. If social security is anything
but fully funded, a change in the system will affect a number of generations, since the
system must be redistributive over time. In the case of pay-as-you-go, social security
involves purely intertemporal redistribution.Achange in a program can therefore affect
consumers in different generations who need not be alive at the time the program is
changed nor even be alive at the same time. At ﬁrst sight, this would seem to mean that
it cannot be possible for equivalence to hold. This argument is in fact correct given the
assumptions made so far.
To obtain a basis for eliminating the effect of policy, it is necessary to link the
generations across time so that something that affects one generation directly somehow
affects all generations indirectly. The way that this can be done is to return to the idea
of altruism and intergenerational concern. Intuitively we can think of each consumer as
having familial forebears and descendents (or parents and children in simple language).
This time we assume that each parent is concerned with the welfare of their children,
and that their children are concerned with the welfare of the grandchildren. Indirectly,
although they are not alive at the same time in the model, this makes the parents
concerned about the grandchildren. What effect does this have? It makes each family
act as if it was a dynasty stretching through time, and its decisions at any one moment
take into account all later consequences. A change in a social security program then
causes a reaction right through the decision process of the dynasty.
To provide some details, let the utility of the generation born at time t be
Ut = U

xt
t , xt+1
t
, 
Ut+1

.
(23.35)
It is the term 
Ut+1 that represents the concern for the next generation. Here 
Ut+1 is
deﬁned as the maximum utility that will be obtained by the children, who are born at
t + 1, of the parent born in t. The fact that the family will act as a dynasty can then be
seen by substituting for 
Ut+1 to give
Ut = U

xt

(23.36)
If this substitution is continually repeated, then the single parent born at t ultimately
cares about consumption levels in all future time periods.
By this fact it is now possible to demonstrate that Ricardian equivalence applies
to social security in these circumstances. Consider an initial position with no social

796
Part VIII: Issues of Time
security program and no population growth (so n = 0). The consumer at t reﬂects his
concern for the descendent by making a bequest of value bt. Hence the consumption
level in the second period of life is
xt+1
t
= st [1 + rt+1] −bt,
(23.37)
and that of his descendent is
xt+1
t+1 = wt+1 + bt −st+1.
(23.38)
Assume that a social security program is now introduced and that each consumer has
one descendent. Under the terms of the program, young consumers are taxed an amount
τ to pay a pension of equal value to old consumers. Then the consumption level of each
parent satisﬁes
xt+1
t
= st [1 + rt+1] + τ −ˆbt,
(23.39)
and that of his descendent
xt+1
t+1 = wt+1 + ˆbt −τ −st+1.
(23.40)
But note that if the bequest is changed so that ˆbt = bt + τ, the same consumption
levels can be achieved for both the parent and the child as for the case with no pension.
Furthermore, since these consumptions levels were the optimal choice initially, they
will still be the optimal choice. The old consumers will make this change to their
bequest, and the social security scheme will have no effect.
Theconclusionofthisanalysisisthatthechangeinthebequestcanoffsettheintertem-
poral transfer caused by a social security system. Although this was only a two-period
system, it can easily be seen that the same logic can be applied to any series of inter-
generational transfers that the government might implement. All that the dynasty has
to do is adjust each bequest to offset the effect of the government transfer between
any two generations. This will always be possible if the initial bequests are sufﬁciently
large. The outcome is that the policy has no effect. This is the basic point of Ricardian
equivalence.
It must be noted that there are limitations to this argument. First, it is necessary that
there be active intergenerational altruism. Without this altruism, there is no dynastic
structure, and the offsetting changes in bequests will not occur. In addition the argument
only works if the initial bequest is sufﬁciently large that it can be changed to offset
the policy without becoming negative. Does it apply in practice? We clearly observe
bequests, but many of these may be unintentional and occur due to premature death.

797
Chapter 23: Social Security
The concept of Ricardian equivalence can be extended into other areas of policy.
Closely related to social security is the issue of government debt, which is also an
intergenerational transfer (but from children to parents), and its effects on the economy.
This was the initial area of application for Ricardian equivalence, with changes in
bequests offsetting changes in government debt policy. Furthermore, if links are made
across households, it becomes possible for changes in household choices to offset
a policy that causes transfers between households. This has lead to the question of
whether “everything is neutral.” The answer depends on the extent of the links.
23.9
Social Security Reform
The basic nature of the pensions crisis facing a range of economies was identiﬁed in
section 23.3: increasing longevity and the decline in the birth rate are combining to
increase the dependency ratio. Without major reform or an unacceptably high increase
in tax rates, the pension programs will either go into deﬁcit or pay a much reduced
pension. A variety of reforms have been proposed in response to this crisis. Some of
these are now brieﬂy reviewed.
Underlying the crisis is the fact that the pension systems are essentially of the pay-
as-you-go form. With such a structure an increase in the dependency ratio will always
put pressure on the pension system. The reform most often discussed in the United
States is for the social security system to move toward a fully funded structure. Once
the system reaches the point of being fully funded, pensions are paid from the pension
fund accumulated by each worker. This breaks the identity relating pensions to the
dependency ratio.Afully funded system can operate either as a government-run scheme
or on the basis of private pensions. We comment on this choice below. For now, we note
that as well as reducing the real value of the pension, the UK government has moved
in the direction of a fully funded program by encouraging the use of private pensions.
The difﬁculty with this approach is that it relies on workers making adequate provision
for their retirement—and there is much evidence that this is not the case.
If an economy were to reform its pension system, it would take some time to transit
from the pay-as-you-go system to the fully funded system. The reform requires that a
capital fund be established that requires a period of investment. Furthermore the pay-
as-you-go system cannot be terminated abruptly. Those already retired will still require
the provision of their pensions, and those close to retirement will have too little time
to invest in a pension fund and so will require the continuation of the pay-as-you-go
element. These facts imply that those who are working during the transition process

798
Part VIII: Issues of Time
will have to both pay the pensions of the retired and pay to ﬁnance their own pension
fund. In simple terms, they are paying for two sets of pensions and fare badly during the
reform process. At the very least, this suggests that there could be signiﬁcant political
pressure against the proposed reform.
It is interesting to consider the extent to which social security provision is determined
by political considerations. Evidence on this is provided by Mulligan, Gil, and Sala-i-
Martin (2002) in their analysis of social security and democracy. Their key ﬁnding is
that social security has little to do with the voting process because countries without
voting still supply public insurance in the same way. They even observe for Chile that
most of the growth in social security spending occurred under nondemocratic regimes,
and payroll taxes reached extremely high levels under GeneralAugusto Pinochet. In fact
they report on nine dynamic case studies—Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Argentina,
Brazil, Chile, Peru, and Uruguay—for the period 1960 to 1990. The countries were
selected on the basis of their extreme political changes over this period. With the ex-
ception of Greece, it is found that formerly nondemocratic countries do not, relative to
their democratic neighbors, change their social security programs after experiencing
democracy (in terms of the amount of public insurance spending, and the design of
tax and beneﬁt formulas). Similarly formerly democratic countries do not change their
program when they become nondemocratic. Furthermore multiple regression studies
of the determinants of public insurance spending, controlling for population age and
per capita income, ﬁnd neither a signiﬁcant partial correlation between democracy
and social insurance spending (relative to GDP) nor a signiﬁcant interaction between
democracy and the other variables in a spending regression. These results suggest that
the role of political constraints on social security may sometimes be overstated.
It is useful to stress a classical error that often accompanies discussion of switching
to a fully funded system. The error arises from comparing the likely rates of return on
personal accounts with those paid under the current pay-as-you-go system. The propo-
sition that suggests switching to the fully funded system to beneﬁt from the opportunity
for higher rates of return is a fallacy. Compare ﬁrst the real rate of return delivered by
the existing social security over the last decades (about 2 percent per year) with the
risk-free rate of return of 3 to 4 percent that personal accounts could guarantee by
holding inﬂation-indexed US Treasury securities. The return in the existing system is
only 2 percent because of the arithmetic of the pay-as-you-go system.
Suppose that all workers contribute a ﬁxed fraction of their incomes to social secu-
rity. The key point is that today’s contributions cover the pension beneﬁts of today’s
retirees, who were the previous generation of workers that contributed. The total return
corresponds to the growth of overall wage income (population plus productivity growth

799
Chapter 23: Social Security
rate). Thus the real rate of return in an ongoing system is 2 percent if the economy grows
at that rate in the long run.
There is a fallacy to the argument that 3 to 4 percent yield on personal accounts
is better. The fallacy is that the return on the existing system is low because workers
start with a liability to provide for the retirees of the previous generation. If the workers
could defect from their liability to the current elderly, they could earn a rate much higher
than 2 percent, even if no personal accounts were introduced. But, of course, no one
wants to cut the beneﬁts of the elderly who contributed to the system throughout all
their working lives. To put it differently, the opportunity of a higher rate of return
with personal accounts comes from the misleading feature that they come with no
obligation to raise the pensions of the current elderly. This is the feature that accounts
for the differences in returns. Moreover the higher expected return is offset by at least
the perception of greater risk. This is not to say that the returns in the existing system
are risk-free. The major risk in the present system is probably that pension beneﬁts paid
in the future are subject to the political whims of future governments.
The distributional effects of a reform from a pay-as-you-go system to a fully funded
system are illustrated by the simulation reported in table 23.3. This simulation deter-
mines the growth path of an economic model for a reference case in which the state
pension is held constant. Applied to the United Kingdom, the model assumes that the
value of the pension is 20 percent of average earnings. For the application to Europe,
the value is taken to be 40 percent. Areform is then considered where an announcement

is made in 1997 (the year the research was conducted) that the state pension will be
steadily reduced from the year 2020 until being phased out in 2040. The aim of the
long period between announcement and reduction is to allow for adjustment in private
behavior. The removal of the state pension implies that private savings will have to
increase to compensate.
The negative ages in the ﬁrst column of table 23.3 refer to consumers who had not
yet been born in 1997, so a consumer with age −10 in 1997 will be born in 2007. The
numbers in the second and third columns shows the percentage by which the lifetime
wage of that age group would need to be changed in the reference case to give the same
level of welfare as in the reform case. Hence the value of −1.1 for the age group 40
to 50 in the United Kingdom shows that this group is worse off with the reform—a
reduction of 1.1 percent of their wage in the base case would give then the same welfare
level as in the reform case.
The values in table 23.3 show that the pension reform hurts those early in life who
must pay the pensions of the retired and pay into their own retirement fund. Ultimately
the reform beneﬁts consumers in the long run. The long-run gain comes from the fact
that the reduction in the pension leads to an increase in private saving. Private saving
has to be invested, so there is also an increase in the capital stock. The consequence
of this capital stock increase depends on the initial level of capital compared to the
Golden Rule level. In the simulations, capital is initially below the Golden Rule level
and remains so throughout the transition. But since this is moving the economy closer to
the Golden Rule, there is ultimately a gain in welfare for later generations. The structure
of the gains and losses also illustrates the political problem involved in implementing
the reform: those who must vote in favor of its implementation are those who lose the
most. This political problem will be exacerbated by the aging of the electorate that is
expected over the next 50 years. Estimates of the age of the median voter are given
in table 23.4. These estimates reveal that the age of the median voter is likely to rise
from the midforties to the midﬁfties. So the electorate will become dominated by the
age group that will lose most if the pension system reform is undertaken.
It has already been noted that a fully funded scheme run by the government is equiv-
alent to a system of private pension provision. This is only strictly true in an economy,
like the overlapping generations model we have studied, that has a single capital good.
In a more practical setting with a range of investment assets, the equivalence will only
hold if the same portfolio choices are made. Moving from a pay-as-you-go system to
a fully funded system run by the government raises the issue of the portfolio of invest-
ments made by the pension fund. In the United States the assets of the fund are invested
entirely in long-term Treasury debt. Such debt is very low risk, but as a consequence

it also has a low return. This is not a portfolio that any private sector institution would
choose, except one that is especially risk-averse. Nor is it one that many private in-
vestors would choose. Permitting the social security fund to invest in a wider portfolio
opens the possibility for a higher return to be obtained but introduces questions about
the degree of investment risk that the pension fund could accept. In addition changing
the portfolio structure of the social security fund could have signiﬁcant macroeconomic
consequences because of its potential size.
A further issue in the design of a pensions system is the choice between a deﬁned
contributions system and a deﬁned beneﬁts system. In a deﬁned contribution scheme,
social security contributions are paid into an investment fund, and at the time of re-
tirement the accumulated fund is annuitized. What annuitized means is that the fund
purchases an annuity, which is a ﬁnancial instrument paying a constant income to the
purchaser until his date of death. In a deﬁned beneﬁts scheme, contributions are made
at a constant proportion of income and the beneﬁt is a known fraction of income at
retirement (or some average over income levels in years close to retirement).
The consequences of these differences are most apparent in the apportionment of risk
under the two types of system. With a deﬁned contributions system, the level of payment
into the pension fund is certain for the worker. What is not certain is the maturity value
of the pension fund, since this depends on the return earned on the fund, or the pension
that will be received, since this depends on the rate offered on annuities at retirement.

802
Part VIII: Issues of Time
All risk therefore falls upon the worker. With a deﬁned beneﬁts system, the risk is
placed entirely on the pension fund, since it must meet the promises that have been
made. The pension fund receives contributions that it can invest, but it runs the risk that
the returns on these investments may not meet pension commitments. This is currently
the situation of the US fund where the forecast deﬁcit is a consequence of the deﬁned
beneﬁts it has promised.
Assuming that a deﬁned contributions scheme is chosen, there is a further reform that
can be made. In the discussion of the simulation it was noted that the reform involved
a move from a state pension scheme to private pension schemes. In a deﬁned contribu-
tion system there is no real distinction between state and private schemes in principal.
When put into practice, distinctions will arise in the choice of investment portfolio,
the returns earned on the portfolio and the transactions costs incurred in running the
scheme. If moving to a fully funded system pensions, the choice between state and
private become a real issue. One option is to use a public fund, either directly admin-
istered or run privately after a competitive tendering process. Alternatively, a limited
range of approved private funds could be made available. Both choices would lead
to a problem of monitoring the performance of the schemes given the fundamentally
uncertain nature of ﬁnancial markets. In addition, seeking low transactions costs could
prove detrimental to other areas of performance.Aﬁnal option is to make use of an open
selection of private investment funds. Doing so relies on investors making informed
choices between the providers and between the funds on offer to ensure that the risk
characteristics of the fund match their preferences. Such a scheme will not work with
poorly informed investors and may run foul of high transactions costs. Both of these
have been signiﬁcant problems in the United Kingdom where “mis-selling”—the sell-
ing of pensions plans with inappropriate risk characteristics for the purchasers—and
high costs have accompanied the move toward the private ﬁnancing of pensions.

Conclusions
Social security in the form of pensions is important both in policy relevance and for
its effect on the economy. The generosity of a pension scheme has implications for

803
Chapter 23: Social Security
individual saving behavior and, in the aggregate, for capital accumulation. Since an
economy may reach an inefﬁcient steady state, the designs of pension schemes have
an impact on economic efﬁciency.
Demographic changes and changes in employment behavior are currently putting
existing state pension schemes under pressure because of their fundamentally pay-as-
you-go nature. Reform proposals have focused on a move to a fully funded system, but
such a reform can be detrimental to the welfare level of consumers living during the
transition period.

in period 1 and labor income of $50 in period 2. They can save as much of their income in
period 1 as they like in bank accounts, earning interest rate of 5 percent per period. They

that the individual has an income of Y1 > 0 in the ﬁrst period and no income in the second
period, so Y2 = 0. He can transfer some income to the second period at a before-tax rate of

the substitution effects? What about the replacement effect of substituting IRAs for savings
already done outside the program?
b. Is the evidence-based prediction that IRAs increase savings necessarily correct? Why or
why not? How might the distinction between private and national savings affect the analysis?

What are the advantages and problems related to a reform of social security that consists of

23.23
Social security requires mandatory participation in most countries. Milton Friedman (1999)
states that “The fraction of a person’s income that is reasonable for him or her to set aside
for retirement depends on that person’s circumstances and values. It makes no more sense
to specify a minimum fraction of income that must be spent on housing or transportation.”
Discuss the possible implications of making participation in social security voluntary. You
can also use arguments of adverse selection and moral hazard covered in chapter 10.

Economic Growth
24.1
Introduction
Economic growth is the basis of increased prosperity. Growth comes from the accumu-
lation of capital (both human and physical) and from innovation that leads to technical
progress. These advances raise the productivity of labor and increase the potential for
consumption. The rate of growth can be affected by policy through the effect that taxa-
tion has on the return to investments. Taxation can also ﬁnance public expenditures that
enhance productivity. In most developed countries the level of taxes has risen steadily
over the course of the last century: an increase from about 5 to 10 percent of gross
domestic product at the turn of the twentieth century to between 30 and 40 percent at
present is typical. Such signiﬁcant increases raise serious questions about the effect
taxation has on economic growth.
Untilrecentlyeconomicmodelsthatcouldofferconvincinginsightsintothisquestion
were lacking. Much of the growth literature focused on the long-run equilibrium where
output per head was constant or modeled growth through exogenous technical progress.
By deﬁnition, when technical progress is exogenous, it cannot be affected by policy.
The development of endogenous growth theory has overcome these limitations by
explicitly modeling the process through which growth is generated. This allows the
effects of taxation to be traced through the economy and predictions made about its
effects on growth.
The chapter begins with a review of exogenous growth models. The concept of the
steady state is introduced, and it is shown why growth is limited unless there is some
external process of technical progress. The exogenous growth model is employed to
prove the important result that the optimal long-run tax rate on capital income should
be zero. Actual tax systems are some way from this ideal position, so the welfare cost
of the nonoptimality is also addressed.
Endogenous growth models are then considered. A brief survey is given of the
various ways in which endogenous growth has been modeled. The focus is placed
on endogenous growth arising from the provision of a public input for private ﬁrms.
It is shown that there is an optimal level of public expenditure that maximizes the
growth rate of consumption. This model provides a positive role for government in the
growth process. The optimality of a zero tax on capital extends to endogenous growth
models with human capital as an input. With this result in mind, a range of simulation

810
Part VIII: Issues of Time
experiments has assessed the effect on the growth rate of changes in the tax structure in
this setting. The differences in structure and parameter values between the experiments
provides for some divergent conclusions.
The analytical results and the simulations reveal that economic theory provides no
deﬁnitive prediction about how taxation affects economic growth. The limitations of
the theory places an increased reliance on empirical evidence to provide clariﬁcation.
We look at a range of studies that have estimated the effect of taxation on economic
growth. Some of these studies ﬁnd a signiﬁcant effect, and others do not. We discuss
the many issues involved in interpreting these results.
24.2
Exogenous Growth
The exogenous growth theory that developed in the 1950s and 1960s viewed growth
as being achieved by the accumulation of capital and increases in productivity via
technical progress. The theory generally placed its emphasis on capital accumulation,
sothesourceofthetechnicalprogresswasnotinvestigatedbythetheory. Itwasassumed
instead to arise from some outside or exogenous factors.
The standard form of these growth models was based on a production function that
had capital and labor (with labor measured in manhours) as the inputs into production.
Constant returns to scale were assumed, as was diminishing marginal productivity
of both inputs. Given that the emphasis was on the level and growth of economic
variables rather than their distribution, the consumption side was modeled by either a
representative consumer or a steadily growing population of identical consumers.
Our analysis begins with the simplest of these growth models, which assumes that
both the rate of saving and the supply of labor are constant. This model is a special case
of the general Solow growth model. Although the assumption of a constant saving rate
eliminates issues of consumer choice, the model is still able to teach important lessons
about the limits to growth and the potential for efﬁciency of the long-run equilibrium.
The key ﬁnding is that if growth occurs only through the accumulation of capital, there
has to be a limit to the growth process if there is no technical progress.
24.2.1
Constant Saving Rate
The fact that there are limits to growth in an economy when there is no technical progress
can be easily demonstrated in a setting where consumer optimization plays no role. It
is assumed instead that a constant fraction of output is invested in new capital goods.

811
Chapter 24: Economic Growth
This assumption may seem restrictive, but it allows a precise derivation of the growth
path of the economy. In addition the main conclusions relating to limits on growth are
little modiﬁed even when an optimizing consumer is introduced.
Consider an economy with a population that is growing at a constant rate. Each person
works a ﬁxed number of hours and capital depreciates partially when used. There is a
single good in the economy that can be consumed or saved. The only form of saving
is investment in capital. Under these assumptions the output that is produced at time t,
Yt, must be divided between consumption, Ct, and investment, It. In equilibrium the
level of investment must be equal to the level of saving.
With inputs of capital Kt and labor Lt employed in production, the level of output is
Yt = F(Kt, Lt).
(24.1)
It is assumed that there are constant returns to scale in production. Output can be either
consumed or saved. The fundamental assumption of the model is that the level of
saving is a ﬁxed proportion s, 0 < s < 1, of output. As saving must equal investment
in equilibrium, at time t investment in new capital is given by
It = sF(Kt, Lt).
(24.2)
The use of capital in production results in its partial depreciation. We assume that this
depreciation is a constant fraction δ, so that the capital available in period t +1 is given
by new investment plus the undepreciated capital, or
Kt+1 = It + [1 −δ] Kt
= sF(Kt, Lt) + [1 −δ] Kt.
(24.3)
This equation is the basic capital accumulation relationship that determines how the
capital stock evolves through time.
The fact that the population is growing makes it preferable to express variables in
per capita terms. This can be done by exploiting the assumption of constant returns to
scale in the production function to write Yt = LtF

Kt
Lt , 1

= Ltf(kt), where kt = Kt

After we divide (24.3) through by Lt, the capital accumulation relation becomes
Kt+1

= sf (kt) + [1 −δ])Kt

.
(24.4)
We denote the constant population growth rate by n, so that labor supply grows ac-
cording to Lt+1 = (1 + n)Lt. Using this growth relationship, we obtain the capital
accumulation relation, which shows that the dynamics of the capital–labor ratio are

(24.5)
The relation in (24.5) will trace the development of the capital stock over time from
an initial stock k0 = K0
L0 . To see what this implies, consider an example where the
production function has the form f(kt) = kα
t . The capital–labor ratio must then satisfy
kt+1 = skα
t + [1 −δ]kt
1 + n
.
(24.6)
For k0 = 1, n = 0.05, δ = 0.05, s = 0.2, and α = 0.5, ﬁgure 24.1 plots the ﬁrst 50 values
of the capital stock. It can be seen that starting from the initial value of k0 = 1, the
capital stock doubles in 13 years. After this the rate of growth slows noticeably, and
even by the ﬁftieth year it has not yet doubled again. The ﬁgure also shows that the
capital stock is tending to a long-run equilibrium level that is called the steady state.
For the parameters chosen, the steady-state level is k = 4, which is achieved at t = 328,
though the economy does reach a capital stock of 3.9 at t = 77. It is the ﬁnal part of the
adjustment that takes a long time.
The steady state is achieved when the capital stock is constant with kt+1 = kt.
Denoting the steady-state value of the capital–labor ratio by k, we have from the capital
accumulation condition that k must satisfy
[1 + n] k = sf(k) + [1 −δ] k,

sf(k) −[n + δ] k = 0.
(24.8)
The solution to this equation is called the steady-state capital–labor ratio, and it can be
interpreted as the economy’s long-run equilibrium value of k.
The solution of this equation is illustrated in ﬁgure 24.2. The steady state occurs
where the curves sf(k) and [n + δ] k intersect. If this point is achieved by the economy,
the capital–labor ratio will remain constant. Since k is constant, it follows from the
production function that Yt
Lt will remain constant as will Ct
Lt . (However, it should be
noted that as L is growing at rate n, then Y, K, and C will also grow at rate n in the

achievable by this economy. Once Ct
Lt is constant, the level of consumption per capita
will remain constant over time. In this sense a limit is placed on the growth in living
standards that can be achieved. The explanation for this limit is that capital suffers from
decreasing returns when added to the exogenous supply of labor. If excessive capital is
employed, the return will fall so low that the capital stock is unable to reproduce itself.
Although we have not yet included any policy variables, this analysis of the steady
state can be used to reﬂect on the potential for economic policy to affect the equilibrium.
Studying ﬁgure 24.2 reveals that the equilibrium level of k can be raised by any policy
that engineers an increase in the saving rate, s, or an upward shift in the production
function, f (k) . However, any policy that leads only to a one-off change in s or f (k)

814
Part VIII: Issues of Time
cannot affect the long-run growth rate of consumption or output. By deﬁnition, once
the new steady state is achieved after the policy change, the per capita growth rates of
the variables will return to zero. Furthermore any policy that only increases s cannot
sustain growth, since s has an upper limit of 1 that must eventually be reached. If
policy intervention is to result in sustained growth, it has to produce a continuous
upward movement in the production function. A mechanism through which policy can
achieve this is studied in section 24.3.2.
A means for growth to be sustained without policy intervention is to assume that
output increases over time for any given level of the inputs. Input gains can be achieved
by labor or capital (or both) becoming more productive over time for exogenous reasons
summarized as “technical progress.” A way to incorporate this in the model is to write
the production function as f (k, t), where the dependence on t captures the technical
progress that allows increased output. Technical progress results in the curve f (k, t)
in ﬁgure 24.2 continuously shifting upward over time, thus raising the steady-state
levels of capital and output. The drawback of this approach is that the mechanism for
growth, the “growth engine,” is exogenous, so preventing the model from explaining
the most fundamental factor of what determines the rate of growth. This deﬁciency is
addressed by the endogenous growth models of the next section, where we explore the
mechanisms that can drive technical progress.
Returning to the basic model without technical progress, we have by condition (24.8)
that the steady-state capital–labor ratio is dependent on the savings rate s. This raises
the question as to whether some saving rates are better than others. To address this
question, we note ﬁrst that for each value of s there is a corresponding steady-state
capital–labor ratio at the intersection of sf (k) and [n + δ] k. It is clear from ﬁgure
24.2 that for low values of s, the curve sf (k) will intersect the curve [n + δ] k at low
values of k. As s is increased, sf (k) shifts upward and the steady-state level of k
rises. The relationship between the capital–labor ratio and the saving rate implied by
this construction is denoted by k = k(s). We have observed that k(s) is an increasing
function of s up until the maximum value of s = 1.
Employing the link between s and k allows the level of consumption per capita to
be written as
c(s) = (1 −s)f(k (s)) = f(k (s)) −(n + δ) k(s),
(24.9)
where the second equality follows from deﬁnition (24.8) of a steady state. What is of
interest are the properties of the saving rate that maximizes consumption. The ﬁrst-
order condition for deﬁning this savings rate can be found by differentiating c(s) with
respect to s. Doing so gives

Since k′(s) is positive, the saving rate, s∗, that maximizes consumption is deﬁned by
f ′
k(s∗)

= n + δ.
(24.11)
The savings rate s∗determines a level of capital k∗= k(s∗), which is called the Golden
Rule capital–labor ratio. If the economy achieves this capital–labor ratio at its steady
state, it is maximizing consumption per capita. The same logic applies here as it did in
the derivation of the steady state in chapter 22 (though δ was assumed to be zero in the
overlapping generations economy).
The nature of the Golden Rule is illustrated in ﬁgure 24.3. For any level of the capital–
labor ratio, the steady-state level of consumption per capita is given by the vertical
distance between the curve [n + δ]k and the curve f (k). This distance is maximized
when the gradient of the production function is equal to [n + δ], which gives the Golden
Rule condition. The ﬁgure also shows that consumption will fall if the capital–labor
ratio is either raised or lowered from the Golden Rule level. In line with the deﬁnitions
of chapter 22, an economy with a steady-state capital stock below the Golden Rule
level, k∗, is dynamically efﬁcient—it requires a sacriﬁce of consumption now in order
to raise k—so a Pareto improvement cannot be found. An economy with a capital stock
in excess of k∗is dynamically inefﬁcient, since immediate consumption of the excess
would raise current welfare and place the economy on a path with higher consumption.

For an example of these calculations, let the production function be given by y = kα,
with α < 1. For a given savings rate s, the steady state is deﬁned by the solution to

We adopt the parameter values n = 0.025, δ = 0.025, and α = 0.75, and plot in ﬁgure
24.4 the level of consumption as a function of s. In the ﬁgure note that consumption
rises with s until the optimal saving rate is reached, at which point the equilibrium
capital stock is equal to the Golden Rule level, and then falls again for higher values.
Formally, the fact that the savings rate is ﬁxed leaves little scope for policy analysis.
However, studying the effect of changes in the saving rate reveals the factors that would
be at work in a more general model in which the level of savings is a choice variable that
can be affected by policy. By deﬁnition, the per capita level of the variables is constant
once the steady state has been achieved. The living standards in the economy reach a
limit and then cannot grow any further unless the production function is continually
raised. Changes in the saving rate affect the level of consumption but not its growth
rate.

817
Chapter 24: Economic Growth
24.2.2
Optimal Taxation
The analysis of the ﬁxed saving model has touched on some of the potential conse-
quences of policy intervention. As a tool for policy analysis, the model is very limited
given the lack of choice variables that can be affected by policy. This shortcoming is
now overcome by studying a variant of the Ramsey growth model in which a repre-
sentative consumer chooses an intertemporal consumption plan to maximize lifetime
utility. Using this model, we analyze the optimal taxes on labor and capital income.
The Ramsey model has a single representative consumer who chooses the paths of
consumption, labor, and capital over time. The single consumer assumption is adopted
to eliminate issues concerning distribution among consumers of differing abilities and
tastes, and to place the focus entirely on efﬁciency. For simplicity, it is also assumed
that the growth rate of labor, n, is zero. There is a representative ﬁrm that chooses
its use of capital and labor to maximize proﬁts. Given that the market must be in
equilibrium, the choices of the consumer drive the rest of the economy through the
level of savings, and hence capital, that they imply. The supply of labor and capital
from the consumer combine with the factor demands of the ﬁrm to determine the
equilibrium factor rewards.
The aim is to characterize the optimal tax structure in this economy. We assume
there is a government that requires revenue of amount gt at time t. It raises this revenue
through taxes on capital and labor, which are denoted by τ K
t
and τ L
t respectively. The
government chooses these tax rates in the most efﬁcient manner.
Before proceeding, it is helpful to discuss the choice of tax instruments. A question
that is frequently analyzed in the literature is whether it is better to tax consumption
or to tax income. The point we now wish to emphasize is that this question is not a
clear-cut as many presentations suggest. This can be seen by taking a simple one-period
budget constraint with two goods. With a tax t on income the consumption choices x1
and x2 must satisfy
[1 −t]M = p1x1 + p2x2.
(24.14)
Observe that the real constraint remains the same if (24.14) is rewritten
M =
1
1 −t p1x1 +
1
1 −t p2x2 = [1 + τ] p1x1 + [1 + τ] p2x2,
(24.15)
where τ =
t
1−t . In words, the two budget identities show that an income tax at rate t is
equivalent to a consumption tax at rate
t
1−t . Since the two taxes are equivalent, there
is no question of one being better or worse than the other. This equivalence between

818
Part VIII: Issues of Time
the income tax and the consumption tax can be extended to the Ramsey growth model.
Assume, for ease of exposition, that the tax rates are constant over time. The equivalence
is stated formally in the proposition.
Proposition 24.1 (Tax system equivalence)
A tax on labor income, τ L > 0, with an
exemption for interest income, τ K = 0, is equivalent to a consumption tax τ C > 0.
The point of the proposition is that the difference between an income tax system—
which would tax all ﬂows of income equally—and a consumption tax is entirely
captured in the tax treatment of interest income. Hence, if we ﬁnd that the optimal
tax system has τ L = τ K > 0, then an income tax is optimal. Alternatively, if the opti-
mum is τ L > 0, τ K = 0, then a consumption tax is optimal. Finally, if the optimum is
τ L > 0, τ K > 0, τ L ̸= τ K, then the system is neither an income tax or a consumption
tax. These points should make the value of the following analysis clear.
In the Ramsey growth model the choices of the consumer are made to maximize the
discounted sum of the ﬂow of utility. Letting 0 < β < 1 be the discount factor on future
utility, the consumer’s preferences are described by
U =
∞

t=0
βtU(Ct, Lt).
(24.16)
The speciﬁcation of the utility function implies that the consumer has an inﬁnite life.
This can be justiﬁed by treating the consumer as a dynasty with concern for descendents.
Further discussion of this assumption can be found in section 23.8.
As there is a single consumer, the capital stock is equal to the savings of this consumer.
This observation allows the budget constraint for the consumer to be written as

In solving this optimization, it is assumed that the representative consumer takes
the factor rewards wt and rt as given. This captures the representative consumer as a
competitive price taker. (It is helpful to note that when we consider the government
optimization below, the dependence of the factor rewards on the choice of capital
and labor is taken into account by the government. This is what distinguishes the
consumer who reacts to the factor rewards and the government that manipulates the
factor rewards.) With ﬁxed factor rewards the necessary conditions for the choices of

Conditions (24.22) and (24.23) describe utility maximization by the consumer. To
interpret these, it should be observed that there are two aspects to the consumer’s
decision. First, within each period the consumer needs to optimize over the levels of
consumption and labor supply. The efﬁcient solution to this within-period decision is
described by (24.22), which ensures that the marginal utilities are proportional to the
relative prices. Second, the consumer has to allocate her resources efﬁciently across
time. Condition (24.23) describes efﬁciency in this process by linking the marginal
utility of consumption in two adjacent periods to the rate at which consumption can
be transferred through time via investments in capital. Taken together for every time
period t, these necessary conditions describe the optimal paths of consumption, labor
supply, and capital investment for the consumer.
The representative ﬁrm is assumed to maximize proﬁt by choosing its use of capital
and labor. Since the ﬁrm rents capital from the consumer, it makes no irreversible

820
Part VIII: Issues of Time
decisions, so it need do no more than maximize proﬁt in each period. The standard
efﬁciency conditions for factor use then apply and equate marginal products to factor
rewards. Hence the interest rate and the wage rate satisfy
FKt = rt
(24.24)
and
FLt = wt.
(24.25)
Following these preliminaries, it is possible to state the government optimization
problem. The sequence of government expenditures {gt} is taken as given. It is assumed
that these expenditures are used for a purpose that does not directly affect utility.
Formally, the government chooses the tax rates and the levels of consumption, labor
supply, and capital to maximize the level of utility. The values of these variables
must be chosen for each point in time, so government decisions form a sequence

τ K
t , τ L
t , Ct, Lt, Kt

. The choices of Ct, Lt and Kt must be identical to what would
be chosen by the consumer given the tax rates τ K
t
and τ L
t . This can be achieved by
imposing conditions (24.22) and (24.23) as constraints on the optimization. When these
constraints are satisﬁed, it is as if the consumer were making the choice. As already
noted, the government explicitly takes into account the endogenous determination of
the factor rewards.
The optimization also has to be constrained by the budget constraints of the consumer
and government, and by aggregate production feasibility. However, if any two of these
constraints hold, the third must also hold. Therefore one of them need not be included as
a separate constraint for the optimization. In this case the consumer’s budget constraint
is dropped. The government budget constraint that taxes must equal expenditure is
given by
τ K
t rtKt + τ L
t wtLt = gt.
(24.26)
In addition the aggregate production condition for the economy is that
Ct + gt + It = F (Kt, Lt).
(24.27)
By the deﬁnition of investment, this becomes
Ct + gt + Kt+1 = F (Kt, Lt) + (1 −δ) Kt.
(24.28)
From the determination of the factor prices (24.24) and (24.25), the government
optimization problem that determines the efﬁcient taxes is

The complete set of ﬁrst-order necessary conditions for this optimization involves the
derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to all the choice variables at every point in
time plus the derivatives with respect to the multipliers at every point in time. However,
to demonstrate the key result concerning the value of the optimal capital tax, only the
necessary conditions for the tax rates and for capital are required. The other ﬁrst-
order conditions will add further information to the solution but do not bear on the

Along the growth path of the economy this equation is only one part of the complete
description of the outcome induced by the optimal policy. However, by focusing on
the steady state in which all the variables are constant, it becomes possible to use the
information contained in this condition to determine the optimal tax on capital.
Consequently the analysis now moves to consider the steady state that is reached
under the optimal policy. To be in a steady state, it must be the case that the tax rates
and the level of government expenditure remain constant over time. In addition the

822
Part VIII: Issues of Time
levels of capital, consumption, and labor supply will be constant. Moreover being in a
steady state also implies that θt = θt−1. Using these facts, we have in the steady state
the necessary condition for the choice of the capital stock as
ψτ KFK + θ (FK + 1 −δ) −1
β θ = 0.
(24.34)
This condition can be simpliﬁed further by observing that in the steady state the choice
condition for the consumer (24.23) reduces to

(24.35)
We use (24.35) to substitute for β, and the ﬁnal condition for the choice of the capital
stock is
[ψ + θ] τ KFK = 0.
(24.36)
Given that the resource constraints are binding, implying that ψ and θ are positive, and
that the marginal product of capital, FK, is positive, the solution to (24.36) has to be
τ K = 0. This is the well-known result (due originally to Chamley 1986 and Judd 1985)
that the long-run value of the optimal capital tax has to be zero.
The analysis has concluded that in the steady state, which we can interpret as the
long-run equilibrium, income from interest on capital should not be taxed. Several
points can be made about this result. First, note that the result does not say that the
tax should be zero when we are on the growth path to the steady state—it was derived
for the steady state and so applies only to that situation. This does not prevent the
tax from being positive (or negative) along the growth path. Second, the zero tax on
capital income implies that all taxation must fall on labor income. If labor were a ﬁxed
factor, this conclusion would not be a surprise, but here labor is a variable factor. In
light of our earlier discussion the result can be seen as supporting the optimality of
a consumption tax in the steady state. Finally the reason for avoiding the taxation of
capital is that the return on capital is fundamental to the intertemporal allocation of re-
sources by the consumer. The result shows that it is optimal to leave this allocation
undistorted to focus distortions on the choice between consumption and labor within
periods.
Since the optimal tax rate is zero, any other value of the tax rate must lead to a
reduction in welfare compared to what is achievable. An insight into the extent of
the welfare cost of deviating from the optimal solution is given in table 24.1. These
results are derived from a model with a Cobb–Douglas production function and a

utility function with a constant elasticity of intertemporal substitution (see equation
24.47 below). The policy experiment calculates what would happen if a tax on capital
is replaced by a lump-sum tax. The increases in consumption and the welfare cost are
measured by comparing the steady state with the tax to the steady state without. When
a tax rate of 30 percent on capital income is replaced by a lump-sum tax, consumption
increases by 3.3 percent and the welfare cost of the distortionary tax is measured at
11 percent of tax revenue. The increases in consumption and the welfare cost are both
higher for an initial 50 percent tax rate.
In summary, the optimal tax policy is to set the long-run tax on capital to zero. This
outcome is explained by the wish to avoid intertemporal distortions. As a consequence
all revenue must be raised by taxation of labor income. This will cause a distortion of
choice within periods but does not affect the intertemporal allocation. The conclusion
is very general and does not depend on any restrictive assumptions. Simulations of the
welfare cost of nonoptimal policies show that these can be a signiﬁcant percentage of
the revenue raised.

Endogenous Growth
Decreasing returns to capital have already been identiﬁed as the source of the limit on
growthintheexogenousgrowthmodel. Theremovalofthislimitrequiresthedecreasing
marginal product of capital to be circumvented in a way that is, ideally, determined by
choices made by the agents in the economy. Models that allow both sustained growth
and explain its source are said to generate “endogenous growth.” There have emerged
in the literature four basic methods by which endogenous growth can be achieved.
All four approaches achieve the same end—that of sustained growth—but by different
routes. We brieﬂy review these four approaches and then focus attention on government
expenditure as the source of endogenous growth.

24.3.1
Models of Endogenous Growth
The ﬁrst, and simplest, approach to modeling endogenous growth, the AK model,
assumes that capital is the only input into production and that there are constant returns
to scale. This may seem at ﬁrst sight to simply remove the problem of decreasing
returns by assumption, but we will later show that the AK model can be given a
broader interpretation. Under these assumptions the production function is given by
Yt = AKt, hence the model’s name. Constant returns to scale ensures that output grows
at the same rate as the capital stock.
To show that this model can generate continuous growth, it is simplest to return to
the assumption of a constant saving rate. With a saving rate s the level of investment in
time period t is It = sAKt. Since there is no labor, the capital accumulation condition
is just
Kt+1 = sAKt + (1 −δ)Kt = (1 + sA −δ)Kt.
(24.37)
Provided that sA > δ, the level of capital will grow over time at rate sA −δ. Output
will grow at the same rate, as will consumption. The model is therefore able to generate
continuous growth.
The second approach is to match increases in capital with equal growth in other
inputs. One way to do this is to consider human capital as an input rather than just
raw labor time. The level of the human capital input is then the product of the quality
of labor and labor time. Doing so allows labor time to be made more productive by
investment in education and training, which raises human capital. Technical progress
is then embodied in the quality of labor. The model requires two investment processes:
one for investment in physical capital and another for investment in human capital.
There can either be one sector, with human capital produced by the same technology as
physical capital, or two sectors with a separate production process for human capital.
The standard form of the production function for such a model would be
Yt = F(Kt, Ht) ,
(24.38)
where Ht is the level of human capital. If the production function has constant returns
to scale in human capital and physical capital jointly, then investment in both can raise
output without limit even if the quantity of labor time is ﬁxed.
The one-sector model with human capital actually reduces to the AK model—this
is the broader interpretation of the AK model referred to above. To see this, note that
under the one-sector assumption output can be used for consumption, or invested in
physical capital, or invested in human capital. This means that the two capital goods are

825
Chapter 24: Economic Growth
perfect substitutes for the consumer in the sense that a unit of output can become one
unit of either. The perfect substitutability implies that in equilibrium the two factors
must have the same rate of return. Combining this with the constant returns to scale in
the production function results in the two factors always being employed in the same
proportions. Therefore the ratio Ht
Kt is constant for all t. Denoting this constant value
by H
K , we write the production function as
Yt = Ktf
H
K

= AKt,
(24.39)
where A ≡f
 H

. This returns us to the AK form.
Atwo-sector model can have different production functions for the creation of the two
types of capital goods. This eliminates the restriction that they be perfect substitutes and
moves away from the AK setting. In a two-sector model different human and physical
capital intensities can be incorporated in the production of the two types of capital.
This can make it consistent with the observation that human capital production tends to
be more intensive in human capital—for example, through the requirement for skilled
teaching staff, and so forth.
The next two approaches focus on inputs other than labor. If output depends on
labor use and a range of other inputs, technological progress can take the form of the
introduction of new inputs into the production function without any of the old inputs
being dropped. The additional inputs allow production to increase, since the expansion
of the input range prevents the level of use of any one of the inputs becoming too
large relative to the labor input. An alternative view of technological progress is that
it takes the form of an increase in the quality of inputs. Expenditure on research and
development results in better quality inputs that are more productive. Over time old
inputs are replaced by new inputs, and total productivity increases. Firms are driven
to innovate in order to exploit the position of monopoly that goes with ownership of
the latest innovation. This is the process of “creative destruction” that was seen by
Schumpeter as a fundamental component of technological progress.
Aspecial case of this approach, and the one on which we will focus, is to use a public
good as the additional input in the production function. This can allow for constant
returns in the private inputs to production and also constant returns to private capital,
provided that the level of the public good is raised to match. The analytical details of
this model are described below because it is a useful vehicle for thinking about the
channels through which public expenditure can have an impact on growth.
A ﬁnal approach to endogenous growth is to assume that there are externalities
among ﬁrms that operate through learning by doing. Investment by a ﬁrm leads to

826
Part VIII: Issues of Time
parallel improvements in the productivity of labor as new knowledge and techniques
are acquired. Moreover this increased knowledge is a public good so the learning
spills over into other ﬁrms. Spillovers make the level of knowledge, and hence labor
productivity, dependent on the aggregate capital stock of the economy. Decreasing
returns to capital for a single ﬁrm (for a given use of labor) then translate into constant
returns for the economy.
The common property of these models of endogenous growth is that there are growth-
related choices that can be inﬂuenced by policy. The government can encourage (or
discourage) investment in human capital through subsidies to training or the tax treat-
ment of the returns. Subsidies to research and development can encourage innovation,
as can the details of patent law. From among these many possibilities, for the remainder
of the chapter we focus on the interaction of taxation and economic growth.
24.3.2
Government Expenditure
Endogenous growth can arise when capital and labor are augmented by additional
inputs in the production function. One case of particular interest for understanding the
link between government policy and growth is when the additional input is a public
good ﬁnanced by taxation. The existence of a public input provides a positive role for
public expenditure and a direct mechanism through which policy can affect growth.
This opens a path to an analysis of whether there is a sense in which an optimal level
of public expenditure can be derived in a growth model.
A public input can be introduced by assuming that the production function for the
representative ﬁrm at time t takes the form
Yt = AL1−α
t
Kα
t G1−α
t
,
(24.40)
where A is a positive constant and Gt is the quantity of the public input. The structure
of this production function ensures that there are constant returns to scale in Lt and Kt
for the ﬁrm given a ﬁxed level of the public input. Although returns are decreasing to
private capital as the level of capital is increased for ﬁxed levels of labor and public
input, there are constant returns to scale in public input and private capital together.
For a ﬁxed level of Lt, this property of constant returns to scale in the other two inputs
permits endogenous growth to occur.
It is assumed that the public input is ﬁnanced by a tax on output. Assume that capital
does not depreciate in order to simplify the derivation. The proﬁt level of the ﬁrm is
πt = [1 −τ] AL1−α

(24.43)
The government budget constraint requires that tax revenue equal the cost of the public
good provided, so that
Gt = τYt.
(24.44)
Now assume that labor supply is constant at Lt = L for all t. Without the public
input, it would not be possible, given this assumption, to sustain growth because the
marginal product of capital would decrease as the capital stock increases. With the
public input, growth can now be driven by a joint increase in private and public capital,
even though labor supply is ﬁxed. From (24.40) and (24.44) the level of public input
can be written as
Gt = [τA]1/α L[1−α]/αKt.
(24.45)
This result can be substituted into (24.42) to obtain an expression for the interest rate
as a function of the tax rate:
rt = [1 −τ] αA1/α [Lτ][1−α]/α .

The economy’s representative consumer is assumed to have preferences described
by the utility function

(24.47)
This speciﬁc form of utility is adopted to permit an explicit solution for the steady
state. The consumer chooses the path {Ct} over time to maximize utility. The standard
condition for intertemporal choice must hold for the optimization, so the ratio of the
marginal utilities of consuming at t and at t +1 must equal the gross interest rate. Hence
∂U/∂Ct

By solving for Ct+1

and then subtracting Ct
Ct from both sides of the resulting equation,
this optimality condition can be written in terms of the growth rate of consumption as
Ct+1 −Ct
Ct
= [β [1 + rt+1]]1/σ −1.
(24.49)
Finally, substituting the solution (24.46) for the interest rate allows the growth rate of
consumption to be related to the tax rate by
Ct+1 −Ct
Ct
= β1/σ
1 + [1 −τ] αA1/α [Lτ][1−α]/α 1/σ −1.
(24.50)
The result in (24.50) demonstrates the two channels through which the tax rate affects
consumption growth. First, taxation reduces the growth rate of consumption through
the term 1 −τ, which represents the effect on the marginal return of capital reducing
the amount of capital used. Second, the tax rate increases growth through the term
τ [1−α]/α, which represents the gains through the provision of the public input.
Further insight into these effects can be obtained by plotting the relationship between
the tax rate and consumption growth. This is shown in ﬁgure 24.5 under the assumption
that A = 1, L = 1, α = 0.5, β = 0.95, and σ = 0.5 The ﬁgure displays several notable
features. First, for low levels of the public input, growth is negative, so a positive tax
rate is required for there to be consumption growth. Second, the relationship between
growth and the tax rate is nonmonotonic: growth initially increases with the tax rate,
reaches a maximum, and then decreases. Finally there is a tax rate that maximizes the
growth rate of consumption. Differentiating (24.50) with respect to τ gives the tax
rate that maximizes consumption growth as
τ = 1 −α.
(24.51)
For the values in the ﬁgure, this optimal tax rate is τ = 0.5. To see what this tax rate
implies, observe that
∂Yt
∂Gt
= [1 −α] Yt
Gt
= 1,
(24.52)
since Gt = τYt and τ = 1−α. Hence the tax rate that maximizes consumption growth
ensures that the marginal product of the public input is equal to 1, which is also its
marginal cost.
This model reveals a positive role for government in enhancing growth through the
provision of a public input. It illustrates a sense in which there can be an optimal level
of government. Also, if the size of government becomes excessive, it reduces the rate

of growth because of the distortions imposed by the tax used to ﬁnance expenditure.
Although simple, this model does make it a legitimate question to consider what the
effect of increased government spending may be on economic growth.
24.4
Policy Reform
The analysis of section 24.2.2 has demonstrated the surprising and strong result that
the long-run tax rate on capital should be zero. Although the derivation was undertaken
for an exogenous growth model, the result also applies when growth is endogenous.
The basic intuition that the intertemporal allocation should not be distorted applies
equally in both cases. This is an important conclusion, since it contrasts markedly
with observed tax structures. For example, in 2002 the top corporate tax rate was 40
percent in the United States, 30 percent in the United Kingdom, and 38.4 percent in
Germany. Although Ireland was much lower at 16 percent, the OECD average was 31.4
percent.
This divergence of the observed tax rates from the theoretically optimal rate raises
the possibility that a reform of the actual system can raise the rate of economic growth
and the level of welfare. This question has been tested by simulating the response of

model economies to policy reforms involving changes in the tax rates on capital and
labor. Such studies have provided an interesting range of conclusions that are worth
close scrutiny.
Before discussing these results, it is helpful to clarify the distinction between the
effect of a change in taxation on the level of output and its effect on the rate of growth
of output. This distinction is illustrated in ﬁgure 24.6, which shows three different
growth paths for the economy. Paths 1 and 2 have the same rate of growth—the rate of
growth is equal to the gradient of the growth path. Path 3, which has a steeper gradient,
displays a faster rate of growth.
Assume that at time t0 the economy is located at point a and, in the absence of any
policy change, will grow along path 1. Following this path, it will arrive at point b
at time t1. The distinction between level and growth effects can now be described.
Consider a policy change at time t0 that moves the economy to point c with consequent
growth along path 2 up to point d at time t1. This policy has a level effect: it changes
the level of output but not its rate of growth. Alternatively, consider a different policy
that causes the economy to switch from path 1 to path 3 at t0, so at time t1 it arrives at
point e. This change in policy has affected the rate of growth but not (at least initially)
its level. Of course, output eventually achieves a higher level because of the higher
growth rate. This second policy has a growth effect but no level effect. Most policy
changes will have some combination of level and growth effects.

where Ct is consumption and Lt is leisure. Alternative studies adopt different values
for the parameters α and σ. The second area of differentiation between studies is the
range of inputs into the production process for human capital, in particular, whether
it requires only human capital and time or whether it also needs physical capital. The
analytical process is to specify the initial tax rates, which usually take values close to
the actual position in the United States, and then calculate the initial growth path. The
tax rates are changed and the new steady-state growth path calculated. The two steady
states are then contrasted with a focus placed on the change in growth rate and in levels
of the variables.
Figure 24.7 summarizes some of the policy experiments and their consequences. The
experiment of Lucas (1990) involves elimination of the capital tax with an increase in
the labor tax to balance the government budget. This policy change has virtually no
growth effect (it is negative but very small) but a signiﬁcant level effect. In contrast,
King and Rebelo (1990) and Jones et al. (1993) ﬁnd very strong growth and level ef-
fects. King and Rebelo consider the effect of an increase in the capital tax by 10 percent,
whereas Jones et al. mirror Lucas by eliminating the capital tax. What distinguishes
the King and Rebelo analysis is that they have physical capital entering into the pro-
duction of human capital. Jones et al. employ a higher value for the elasticity of labor
supply than other studies. The model of Pecorino (1993) has the feature that capital is a
separate commodity to the consumption good. This permits different factor intensities
in the production of human capital, physical capital, and the consumption good. Com-
plete elimination of the capital tax raises the growth rate, in contrast to the ﬁnding of
Lucas.
The importance of each of the elements in explaining the divergence between the
results is studied in Stokey and Rebelo (1995). Using a model that encompasses the
previous four, they show that the elasticity of substitution in production matters lit-
tle for the growth effect but does have implications for the level effect—with a high
elasticity of substitution, a tax system that treats inputs asymmetrically will be more

distortionary. The elimination of the distortion then leads to a signiﬁcant welfare
increase. The important features are the factor shares in production of human capi-
tal and physical capital, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution in utility, and the
elasticity of the labor supply. Stokey and Rebelo conclude that the empirical evidence
provides support for values of these parameters that justify Lucas’s claim that the growth
effect is small.
A range of estimates have been given for the effects of taxation on growth involving
severaldifferentpolicyexperiments. Someofthemodelspredictthatthegrowtheffectis
insigniﬁcant; others predict it could be very signiﬁcant. What distinguishes the models
are a number of key parameters, particularly, the share of physical capital in human
capital production, the elasticities in the utility function, and the depreciation rates.
In principal, these could be isolated empirically, and a ﬁrm statement of the size of
the growth effect given. To do so, and thus claim an “answer,” would be to overlook
several important issues about the restrictiveness of the model. Moreover it would not
be justiﬁable to provide an answer without consulting the empirical evidence. Tax rates
have grown steadily over the last century in most countries, so there should be ample

833
Chapter 24: Economic Growth
evidence for determining the actual effect. Consequently the next section considers
empirical evidence on the effect of taxation.
24.5
Empirical Evidence
Wehavepresentedtwotheoreticalperspectivesonthelinkbetweentaxationandgrowth.
The endogenous growth model with a public good as an input provided a positive
channel through which taxation could raise growth. The relationship was not monotonic
because increases in the tax rate above the optimum would reduce the growth rate. In
practice, economies could be located on either side of the optimum. Similarly the
evidence from the simulations provides a wide range of estimates for the effect of
taxation on economic growth from negligible to signiﬁcant. Since the theory is so
inconclusive, it is natural to turn to the empirical evidence.
At ﬁrst glance a very clear picture emerges from this: tax revenue as a proportion
of gross domestic product has risen signiﬁcantly in all developed countries over the
course of the last century, but the level of growth has remained relatively stable. This
suggests the immediate conclusion that in practice, taxation does not affect the rate of
growth. Data to support this claim is displayed in ﬁgures 24.8 and 24.9. Figure 24.8
plots the growth rate of US gross domestic product and federal government tax revenue

the data series using ordinary least squares regression to show the trend over time. The
two trend lines show a steady rise in taxation (the upper line) and a very slight decline
in the growth rate (the lower line). Although the variance of the growth process reduces
after 1940, statistical tests on US data have found no statistical difference between the
average rate of growth prior to 1942 and after 1942. The data for the United Kingdom
in ﬁgure 24.9 tell a very similar story. The trend lines show an increase in taxation but,
in contrast to the United States, an increase in the rate of growth.
The message of these ﬁgures is compelling but should be considered carefully. First,
a contrast between tax rate and growth rate across time cannot answer the counterfactual
question: If taxes had been lower, would growth have been higher? To do so requires a
study involving countries with different regimes. Second, there are substantive issues
that have to be resolved about the deﬁnition of the tax rate as should be used in any
such comparison.
To understand the problem of deﬁnition, consider ﬁgure 24.10 which illustrates a
typical progressive income tax. There is an initial tax exemption up to income level Y1,
then a band at tax rate t1, and a ﬁnal band at rate t2, t2 > t1. Notice in the ﬁgure how the
marginal rate of tax differs from the average rate of tax. For instance, at income ˆY the
marginal rate is one minus the gradient of the graph while the average rate is one minus
the gradient of the ray to the graph (shown by the dashed line). With a progressive tax
system, the marginal rate is always greater than the average rate.

Average and marginal tax rates
The data displayed in ﬁgures 24.8 and 24.9 uses tax revenue as a fraction of gross
domestic product to measure the tax rate. This measure captures the average rate of tax.
However, what matters for economic behavior is the marginal tax rate—the decision
on whether to earn additional income depends on how much of that income can be
retained. This suggests that the link between growth and taxation should focus more
on how the marginal rate of tax affects growth.
The difﬁculty with undertaking the analysis comes in determining what the marginal
tax rate actually is. Figure 24.10 illustrates this problem: the marginal tax rate is 0, t1, or
t2 depending on the income level of the consumer. In practice, income tax systems have
several different levels of exemption (e.g., married and single persons allowances) and
several marginal rates, and they interact with social security taxes and with the beneﬁt
system.All this makes it difﬁcult to assign any unique value to the marginal rate of a tax.
The same comments apply equally to corporation tax, which has exemptions, credits,
and depreciation allowances, and to value-added taxation, which has exemptions, zero-
rated goods, and lower rated goods. In brief, the rate of growth should be related to the
marginal rate of tax, but the latter is an ill-deﬁned concept.
Given these preliminaries, it is now possible to review the empirical evidence. The
strongest empirical link between taxation and growth was reported by Plosser (1993).
Plosser regressed the rate of growth of per capita gross domestic product on the ratio of

836
Part VIII: Issues of Time
income taxes to gross domestic product for the OECD countries and found a signiﬁcant
negative relationship. The limitation of this ﬁnding is that the OECD countries differ
in their income levels and income has been found to be one of the most signiﬁcant
determinants of growth. Taking account of this, Easterly and Rebelo (1993) showed
that the negative relationship all but disappears when the effect of initial income is
accounted for.
Easterly and Rebelo extend this analysis by using several different measures of the
marginal tax rate in regressions involving other determinants of growth, notably initial
income, schoolenrollments, assassinations, revolutions, andwarcasualties. Inresponse
to some of the difﬁculties already noted, four different measures of the marginal tax
rate are used: statutory taxes, revenue as a fraction of gross domestic product, income-
weighted marginal income tax rates, and marginal rates from a regression of tax revenue
on tax base. From a number of regressions involving these variable, Easterly and Rebelo
conclude: “The evidence that tax rates matter for economic growth is disturbingly
fragile.”
A very similar exercise is undertaken in Mendoza, Milesi-Ferretti, and Asea (1997).
The clear ﬁnding is that when initial GDPis included in the regressions, the tax variable
isinsigniﬁcant. EvidencecontrarytothisispresentedinLeibfritz, Thornton, andBibbee
(1997). Their regression of average growth rates for OECD countries over the period
1980 to 1995 against three measures of the tax rate (average tax rate, marginal tax
rate, and average direct tax rate) showed that a 10 percent increase in tax rates would
be accompanied by a 0.5 percent reduction in the rate of growth, with direct taxation
reducing growth marginally more than indirect taxation.
One possible route out of the difﬁculties of deﬁning the appropriate tax rate is to adopt
a different method of determining the effect of ﬁscal policy. Engen and Skinner (1996)
label the regressions described above as “top-down,” since they work with aggregate
measures of taxation. Instead of doing this, they propose a “bottom-up” method that
involves calculating the effect of taxation on labor supply, investment, and productivity,
and then summing these to obtain a total measure. Doing this suggests that a cut of
5 percent in all marginal rates of tax and 2.5 percent in average rates would raise the
growth rate by 0.22 percent.
An alternative line of literature—Barro (1991), Dowrick (1993), and de la Fuente
(1997)—has considered the more general issue of how ﬁscal policy has affected growth.
In particular, the relationship of growth to the composition and level of public sector
spending is investigated. The results of de la Fuente show that if public spending
(measured as the share of total government expenditure in gross domestic product)
increases, growth is reduced (an increase in government spending of 5 percent of

837
Chapter 24: Economic Growth
gross domestic product reduces growth by 0.66 percent), whereas an increase in public
investment will raise growth. There are four signiﬁcant points to be made about these
ﬁndings. First, governmentspendingmayjustbeaproxyfortheentiresetofgovernment
non–price interventions—including, for example, employment legislation, health and
safety rules, and product standards—and that it may be these, not expenditure, that
actually reduce growth. Second, since the share of public spending in gross domestic
product is very closely correlated to the average tax rate, it is not clear which hypothesis
is being tested.
The ﬁnal points are more signiﬁcant. Levine and Renelt (1992) have shown that the
ﬁnding of a negative relationship is not robust to the choice of conditioning variables.
Finally, as noted by Slemrod (1995), the method of the regressions is to use national
income, Y, as the left-hand-side variable and government expenditure, G, as the right-
hand-side variable. In contrast, economic theory usually views the causality as running
in the opposite direction: government expenditure is seen as being determined by the
preferences of the population as expressed through the political system. An extreme
version of this view is captured in Wagner’s law, which relates government expenditure
to national income via the income elasticity of demand for government-provided goods
and services. If Y (or the growth of Y) and G are related via an equilibrium relationship,
then a simple regression of Y on G will not identify this.
This review of the empirical evidence leads to the following observation. A visual
inspection of tax rates and growth rates suggests that there is little relationship between
the two. This is weak evidence, but it does ﬁnd support in some more detailed inves-
tigations in which regression equations that include previously identiﬁed determinants
of growth, especially initial income, reveal that tax rates are insigniﬁcant as an ex-
planatory variable. Other regressions ﬁnd a small but signiﬁcant tax effect. All these
results are hampered by the difﬁculties in actually deﬁning marginal rates of tax and in
their lack of an equilibrium relationship.

Conclusions
Growth is important. Without growth, living standards will stagnate, if not decline. The
effect of even small changes in the growth rate can be dramatic. With a growth rate of
2 percent it takes 35 years to double the level of income, but at a rate of 5 percent it
takes just 14 years. Even if economic policy only succeeds in increasing the growth
rate from 2 to 3 percent, it will reduce the time taken to double income by 12 years.
The cumulative effect of a policy that affects the growth rate will eventually dominate
anything achieved by a policy that affects only the level of economic variables.

Part VIII: Issues of Time
In an exogenous growth model the economy must eventually reach a limit to its
growth unless there is technical progress. The effects of policy are limited in this form
of model because in the long run policy cannot affect the growth rate. Nevertheless,
these models provide some insight into what policy must achieve in order for it to
have a lasting effect on economic growth. In particular, the exogenous growth model
provides a simple setting for demonstrating the important result that efﬁciency requires
that the tax rate on capital income be zero in the long run.
The limitations of the exogenous growth model led to the development of theories
of endogenous growth. The literature on endogenous growth has provided a range of
mechanisms by which taxation can affect economic growth. This chapter has described
the range of models and has discussed the results that have been obtained. In quantitative
terms, a wide range of theoretical predictions arise for the size of the tax effect, from
the insigniﬁcant to considerable. The size of the growth rate effect depends just about
equally on the structure of the model and on the parameter values within the model. The
production process for human capital is also critical, as are the elasticities in the utility
function and the rates of depreciation. A fair summary is that the theoretical models
introduce a range of issues that must be considered but do not provide any convincing
or deﬁnitive answers.
The conclusions of the empirical evidence are not quite as diverse as for the theory.
Although there are some disagreements, the picture that emerges is that the effect of
taxation, if there is any at all, is relatively minor. However, the estimates have to be
judged by taking account of the difﬁculty of deﬁning the appropriate measure of the tax
rate and the choice of appropriate regressors. When these problems have been overcome
the effect of taxation on growth may prove to be signiﬁcant but that is unlikely. As far
as policy is concerned, this is a reassuring conclusion because it removes the need to
be overly concerned about growth effects when tax reforms are planned.

Cost–Beneﬁt Analysis
25.1
Introduction
The Flood Control Act of 1936 established a commitment by the US federal govern-
ment to protect people and property on approximately 100 million acres of land. The
act required that the US Corps of Engineers carry out projects for the improvement of
the waterway system when the total beneﬁts of a project exceed the costs of that project.
Subsequently the US Congress has authorized the Corps of Engineers to construct hun-
dreds of miles of levees, ﬂood walls, and channel improvements and approximately 375
major reservoirs. According to Arnold’s 1988 history of the 1936 Act, these projects
“have saved billions of dollars in property damage and protected hundreds of thousands
of people from anxiety, injury, and death. They stand today as one of the more signiﬁcant
marks of our technical skill and humane spirit.” The requirement that projects have to
pass the test of offering beneﬁts in excess of costs has meant that the Corps of Engineers
had to create systematic methods for measuring the items in the calculation.
Aproject involves a ﬂow of beneﬁts and a ﬂow of costs. Cost–beneﬁt analysis (CBA)
estimates and totals up the monetary values of the beneﬁts and costs to the community of
projects to establish whether they are worthwhile. CBA has traditionally been applied
to public projects such as new motorways, by-passes, dams, tunnels, bridges, ﬂood
relief schemes, and new power stations. Cost–beneﬁt analysis is widely used in project
and policy evaluations in many OECD countries, including Australia (where CBAs
are termed Regulatory Impact Assessments), the United States, the United Kingdom,
and the Nordic countries. The European Commission conducts CBA for all new EU
Directives, and the World Bank and the regional development banks in Asia, Africa,
and Latin America use CBA in their project evaluations.
It is possible to view most forms of policy choice as the selection of a project.
The idea of a project can be interpreted as any policy that affects the economy. This
allows the basic principles of CBA to be applied to a very wide range of projects or
programs. Some usual examples are the introduction of a public health program (e.g.,
the mass immunization of children using new drugs), an investment in a new rail safety
system, or the opening of a new railway line. CBA can also be used in assessing the
costs and beneﬁts of introducing congestion charges for motorists in a metropolitan
area, or the costs and beneﬁts of an employment program designed to reduce long-
term unemployment. CBA was even used during the recent inquiry into genetically

848
Part IX: Applications
modiﬁed foods. Increasingly the principles of cost–beneﬁt analysis are being applied
to evaluate the returns on investment in environmental projects such as wind farms and
the development of other sources of renewable energy.
Because ﬁnancial resources are scarce, CBA allows different projects to be ranked
according to those that provide the highest expected net gains in social welfare. This
is particularly important given the limitations of government spending. The idea of
this economic accounting originated with Jules Dupuit, a French engineer whose 1848
article is still worth reading. The British economist, Alfred Marshall, formulated some
of the formal concepts that are at the foundation of CBAin his Principles of Economics
(1890). The practical development of CBA in the United States began in the 1930s, but
it wasn’t until about twenty years later in the 1950s that economists tried to provide a
rigorous, consistent set of methods for measuring beneﬁts and costs in deciding whether
a project is worthwhile.
A formal theory of cost–beneﬁt analysis has now been developed. There are some
technical issues of CBA that are not entirely resolved—and these are discussed later—
but the fundamental theory presented in this chapter is well established and widely
accepted. The chapter begins with the basic principles that guide the practical applica-
tion of CBA. These principles are straightforward, but CBA application can be tricky
and controversial. Most of the controversy can be related to valuing human life and
intangible environmental beneﬁts in the estimation of costs and beneﬁts. The choice of
the discount rate to balance the consequences for current and future generations when
the project has long-lasting effects and the relative weights given to poor and rich when
a project has distributional implications are also controversial points. The discussion
of the many points of difﬁculty for CBA is followed by a more comprehensive analysis
of welfare measurement, valuation of life, and choice of discount rate. Underlying the
argument in favor of CBA as a policy tool is that its use ensures only projects that
raise welfare will be implemented. The ﬁnal part of the chapter explores the theory that
links CBA to welfare, and focuses on the use of shadow prices and their relationship
to market prices.
25.2
What Is Cost–Beneﬁt Analysis?
Cost–beneﬁt analysis is basically an appraisal technique that aims to place monetary
values on all the beneﬁts and costs arising from a project, and then determine whether
the total value of the project is positive or negative. Essentially the process of CBA is
a comparative one, so that judgments can be made about which projects from a limited

849
Chapter 25: Cost–Beneﬁt Analysis
choice should be given the go-ahead. It has numerous potential applications though
there are inherent difﬁculties in assigning monetary valuations to some of the effects
of a project.
25.2.1
Simple Example
Let us start with an example. Suppose that you are the production manager of a ﬁrm
and you are proposing the purchase of a $1 million machine to increase output. You
know you need some facts to support your proposal before you can present it to the
ﬁrm’s president, so you decide to run the numbers and do a cost–beneﬁt analysis. You
list the additional beneﬁts that the machine will deliver: with the new machine, 100
more units could be produced each hour, the three workers currently doing the work
by hand could be replaced, all units produced will be of higher quality because they
will be more uniform. You are convinced these outweigh the additional costs: there is
a cost to purchase the machine, and it will consume some electricity. Any other costs
will be insigniﬁcant.
You calculate the selling price of the 100 additional units per hour multiplied by
the number of production hours per month. Two percent is added for the units that
are not rejected because of the quality of the machine-produced output. You also add
the monthly salaries of the three workers. Then you calculate the monthly cost of the
machine, by dividing the purchase price by 12 months per year, and divide that by the 10
years the machine should last. The manufacturer tells you what the power consumption
of the machine is, and you can get power cost numbers from accounting, so you ﬁgure
the cost of electricity to run the machine and add the purchase cost to get a total cost
ﬁgure. You subtract your total cost ﬁgure from your total beneﬁt value and your analysis
reveals a proﬁt.
All you have to do now is present the calculation to the president, right? Wrong.
You have the right idea, but you left out a lot of detail. Look at the beneﬁts ﬁrst. You
used the selling price of the units to calculate the value. But the sales price includes
many additional factors (e.g., the proﬁt margin) that will unnecessarily complicate your
analysis if you include them. Instead, get the activity-based value of the units from ac-
counting and use that. You rightly added the value of the increased quality by factoring
in the average reject rate, but you may want to reduce that a little because even the
machine will not be perfect. Last, when calculating the value of replacing three em-
ployees, in addition to their salaries, you should add their overhead costs, the costs of
their beneﬁts, and so forth, to obtain the workers’ full labor rates. Every future beneﬁt

850
Part IX: Applications
must be discounted to turn it into a comparable current beneﬁt. In addition to properly
quantifying the beneﬁts, it is important to make sure you included all of them.
As for the cost of the machine, in addition to its purchase price and any taxes you
will have to pay on it, you must add the cost of interest on the money spent to purchase
it. Check the amortization period. Just because the machine may last 10 years, this does
not mean the company will keep it on the books that long. It may amortize the purchase
over half that period if it is considered capital equipment. If the cost of the machine is
not enough to qualify as capital, the full cost will be expensed in one year. Adjust your
monthly purchase cost of the machine to reﬂect these issues. You have the electricity
cost ﬁgured out, but there are some costs you missed too. The typical failure of a cost–
beneﬁt analysis is not including all the costs. In the case of the machine, here are some
of the questions you may have to address: Will the machine ﬁt in the existing available
space ? What will it cost to install the new machine? Will you need someone with special
skills to operate the machine? Does this person need special training and what will be
the salary, including overheads, cost? Will the new machine require soundprooﬁng
to be built around it? Will the new machine increase the insurance premiums for the
company?
Once you have collected all the positive and negative factors and have quantiﬁed
them, you can put them together into an accurate cost–beneﬁt analysis. You will then
know whether the machine will save your company a signiﬁcant amount of money each
year.
This is just one simple example of how you can use cost–beneﬁt analysis to deter-
mine the advisability of a course of action and then to support your decision once you
propose the action. CBA is a relatively simple and widely used technique for deciding
whether to undertake a project. As its name suggests, the technique involves simply
adding up the discounted value of the beneﬁts of the project, and subtracting the costs
associated with it. Costs may be one-off or may be ongoing. Beneﬁts are most often
received over time. We build this effect of time into the analysis by calculating a pay-
back period. This is the time it takes for the beneﬁts of the project to repay its costs.
Many companies look for payback over a speciﬁed period of time (e.g., three years).
25.2.2
Broader Approach
In its simple form, cost–beneﬁt analysis is carried out using only ﬁnancial costs and
ﬁnancial beneﬁts. For example, a simple cost–beneﬁt analysis of a road scheme would
measure the cost of building the road and subtract this from the economic beneﬁt of
improvingtransportlinks. Itwouldnotmeasureeitherthecostofenvironmentaldamage

851
Chapter 25: Cost–Beneﬁt Analysis
or the beneﬁt of quicker and easier travel to work. A more sophisticated approach to
cost–beneﬁt measurement models requires a ﬁnancial value to be put on intangible costs
and beneﬁts. This can be highly subjective. Take, for example, a historic water meadow.
Is it worth $50,000 to protect the meadow from development or is it worth $500,000
because of its environmental importance? What is the value of stress-free travel to work
inthemorning? TheexampleofCBAweexplainedaboveisintentionallysimple. Where
large sums of money are involved and many persons are concerned (e.g., as would be
the case in a public project), project evaluation can become an extremely complex and
sophisticated art.
To recap, CBA is a powerful, widely used and relatively easy tool for deciding
whether to make a change. To use the tool, ﬁrst work out how much the change will
cost to make. Then calculate the beneﬁt you will get from it. Where costs or beneﬁts
are paid or received over time, work out the time it will take for the beneﬁts to repay the
costs. CBAcan be carried out using only ﬁnancial costs and ﬁnancial beneﬁts. You may,
however, decide to include intangible items within the analysis. As you must estimate
a value for these, this inevitably brings an element of subjectivity into the process.
25.3
The Process of CBA
At the heart of any public project appraisal decision is this basic question: Does a
planned project lead to a net increase in social welfare? Conducting a CBA requires a
sequence of steps to be followed, which we now describe.
The ﬁrst step in any CBA is to clarify the purpose of the analysis, or to deﬁne the
“project.”At this stage, it is important to delineate the limits of the project as well
as its standing. The standing of a project is the identiﬁcation of which beneﬁts and
costs should count as well as the time horizon over which costs and beneﬁts should
count. As a basic rule, all stakeholders should be included insofar as they are affected
by the project. The deﬁnition of the project involves the identiﬁcation of its many costs
and beneﬁts with measures of risk when the project involves probabilistic outcomes and
an assessment of uncertainty when it is impossible to assign probabilities to different
outcomes. The distributional impact of the project must also be identiﬁed. The limits
of the project represent the scope and the reach of the various impacts of the project.
The second step is the calculation of social costs and social beneﬁts. This would
include calculation of (1) tangible beneﬁts and costs (i.e., direct costs and beneﬁts),
and (2) intangible beneﬁts and costs (i.e., indirect costs and beneﬁts—externalities).
For example, if a child is effectively immunized against a transmittable disease, the

852
Part IX: Applications
direct beneﬁt is that the child will stay healthy. Positive externalities arise because that
child will not pass on the disease to others, with favorable impacts on productivity
levels and health sector budgets.
This process is very important. It involves trying to identify all the signiﬁcant costs
and beneﬁts. The CBA, however, always compares the situation with and the situation
without the project. This is needed because in CBA only the effects that may be at-
tributed exclusively to the project should be considered. In the CBA way of thinking
effects are deﬁned as changes that take the form of additional costs and additional
beneﬁts. It is worth noting that the distinction between the “situation with project”
and “the situation without project” is not the same as the “before-project” and “after-
project” situations. This basic principle can be illustrated by the following example
of a road project. A proposed project involves the reconstruction of a road linking a
regional town to the capital. At present 1,000 cars use this road daily. Two consultants
were asked to estimate the beneﬁts of road improvement. After project completion they
both agreed that 1,400 cars would use the road daily. However, their estimates of the
project beneﬁts (i.e., additional daily trafﬁc) were different, namely 400 and 100 cars.
The consultants give the following justiﬁcations for their estimates: Consultant 1: the
beneﬁt is 400 because this is the increase in daily trafﬁc. Consultant 2: the beneﬁt is
100 because even if the road is not reconstructed, trafﬁc will increase to 1,300, because
of autonomous economic growth in the region and drivers will still use the road, even
when it is in a bad condition.
Consultant 1 does not apply the CBA principle soundly. To see which changes in
trafﬁc may be attributed to the project, consultant 1 should have investigated the dif-
ference between the expected situation if the project is implemented and what would
have happened without the project. In fact the focus was incorrectly on the difference
between the trafﬁc before (present, pre-project) and after the project. This approach is
only correct if the project is the only factor inﬂuencing trafﬁc. And this is not the case,
so consultant 1 is wrong. That does not mean consultant 2 is right either. Suppose a third
consultant comes with the following analysis. Consultant 3: the beneﬁt is 800 because,
without the project, trafﬁc would decline to 600 cars daily due to fewer drivers being
willing to use the road when it continues to deteriorate further. Whereas both consultant
2 and consultant 3 apply the CBA principle soundly, they differ on trafﬁc forecasting
and consequently arrive at widely different estimates on the without-case and thus the
project beneﬁts. One of them, or both of them, may be wrong depending on the quality
of their trafﬁc forecasts. The costs and beneﬁts of the project may be hard to estimate if
they include changes in human health and mortality. They may also have long-lasting
effects and involve uncertainty.

25.3.1
Discounting Future Values
Another basic requirement of CBAis discounting. This is important as costs and beneﬁts
do not occur at the same time but have the form of ﬂows over time. It makes a signiﬁcant
difference when, after having made an investment (incurred a cost), one has to wait a
long time before beneﬁts are generated. Generally, people would rather have money
right away than wait for it. They are only willing to wait for something, if a larger reward
is promised. This is the consumption side of time preference.
There is also an investment side of time preference. Consider holding $100 that
could be invested and in one years’ time would realize a proﬁt or earn interest. The
rate of time preference, or discount rate, is often equated to the interest rate. Hence
individuals normally prefer to enjoy the beneﬁts now rather than later—so the value of
future beneﬁts has to be discounted.
Costs occur mostly in the short-term (investment) and to a lesser extent in the long
term (maintenance and operational costs). In the case of nuclear power station, there
are signiﬁcant operational costs in the long term. Beneﬁts can arise in the long term. So
the choice of the discount rate will impact particularly the beneﬁts far away in the future
(i.e., back-end vs. front-end loaded beneﬁts). All costs and beneﬁts are “brought back”
to the starting time. With a rate of 8 percent, a time line of 30 years is usually applied.
After this, the discounted costs and beneﬁts become so small as to be insigniﬁcant.
For example, a sum of $1,000 discounted at 8 percent over 30 years shrinks to less
than $100. Lower rates imply a longer timeline.
These comments can be now be incorporated into a formal calculation. Let the
beneﬁts of a project at time t be B(t) and the costs of the project be C(t). The basic
rule of cost–beneﬁt analysis is that the project should be adopted if the associated net
present value (NPV) is positive,
NPV =
T

t=0
(1 + d)−t [B (t) −C (t)].
(25.1)
where T is the time line of the project.
The beneﬁt–cost ratio BCR is similar to the NPV. Whereas the NPV is the difference
between all costs and beneﬁts, the BCR is the ratio of (discounted) costs and beneﬁts.
It is given by
BCR =
	T
t=0(1 + d)−tB (t)
	T
t=0(1 + d)−tC (t)
.
(25.2)

854
Part IX: Applications
It is assumed initially that beneﬁts are gross beneﬁts, and costs are gross costs,
which means that all costs (investments and operational recurrent costs) are added
together. For a project to be selected, the BCR should exceed 1. The BCR is used least
often, as there are no strict guidelines on how to treat recurrent operational costs: some
analysts prefer to include them in the cost denominator, whereas others deduct them
from the beneﬁts. So the outcome depends on the approach followed. Although when
systematically applied in all cases the problem is small, the NPV is preferred for its
unequivocal outcome.
Another way of analyzing the ﬂow of discounted costs and beneﬁts of a project is
calculating its internal rate of return (IRR). The IRR is the rate with which the dis-
counted costs equal the discounted beneﬁts. That is, the rate d = d0 such that the NPV
is zero at that particular rate:
NPV =
∞

t=0
(1 + d0)−t [B (t) −C (t)] = 0.
(25.3)
The IRR can then be compared with a baseline or standard rate, for example, the current
interest rate or a certain minimum rate, and if the IRR is higher, the project would be
proﬁtable.
These values can be used to compare different projects. The government may have
limited funds at its disposal and therefore faces a choice about which projects should
be given the go-ahead. The IRR is the most popular proﬁtability indicator because it
is a relative measure that allows a direct comparison between investments and market
interest rates (yield). Nevertheless, there are three constraints on its use.
First, the use of the IRR in the case of mutually exclusive projects may lead to
incorrectrecommendations. Mutuallyexclusiveprojectsoccurifimplementationofone
project makes the other project impossible. For instance, if a site is used for a factory,
it cannot be used for agriculture. The IRR may then suggest that the factory project be
chosen, whereas the agriculture project would be preferable at a given discount rate.
Consider two different size projects with immediate cost and future beneﬁt: project A
(big) costs 100 for a beneﬁt of 110, and project B (small) costs 10 for a beneﬁt of 12.
The IRR is higher for project B with a return of 20 percent against 10 percent for project
A. However, project A displays a higher NPV than project B for a given discount rate.
For example, with discounting at 5 percent, the NPV of project A is 5, whereas it is
only 1.5 for project B. So the IRR would recommend the (small) project B whereas the
NPV would recommend the (big) project A.

855
Chapter 25: Cost–Beneﬁt Analysis
Second, the IRR may not be unique when the ﬂow of net beneﬁts is ﬂuctuating
between positive and negative values. Take a project C with a ﬂow of net beneﬁts over
three periods of −1, +5 ,−6. Then the IRR can either be 100 or 200 percent. The reason
is that when computing the NPV as a function of discount rate, we ﬁnd that the NPV
curve is a bell—shaped with roots at 100 percent and 200 percent. So, for any discount
rates outside this range, the NPV is negative.
Third, if the IRR of project A is 15 percent and 20 percent for project B, the IRR
does not prove that alternative B is better and should be selected. If the discount rate is
10 percent, both should be implemented. The NPV is an absolute proﬁtability indicator
and, like the IRR, should not be used to rank project alternatives.Asmall, very proﬁtable
project might have a lower NPV than a large, marginally proﬁtable project, as illustrated
by the previous example. The NPV simply shows whether or not a project should be
selected. The advantage of the NPV is that it is also applicable in the case of mutually
exclusive projects, when the IRR should not be applied.
Finally, the IRR is a purely positive concept—it is the solution that makes the present
discounted value zero. In contrast, the NPV can be a normative concept that involves
welfare judgments about the relative social weights assigned to current and future
generations. This point is developed in detail in sections 25.7.2 and 25.6.
Before a decision is reached, a ﬁnal step has to be taken in the CBA that concerns
an important question: If you estimate that the possible beneﬁt (or cost) is $1 million,
how likely is that outcome? In some cases, the occurrence of beneﬁts or costs may be
uncertain. Even if it is reasonably clear that a beneﬁt or cost will “occur,” it is still
important to determine the degree of uncertainty about the actual values of the costs
and beneﬁts. In CBAit is unwise to assume that because costs of equipment and capital
infrastructure can be estimated, the costs are more certain than the beneﬁts. History
provides many examples where the costs of major projects were seriously understated
or overstated (e.g., the dismantling of a nuclear power plant and decontamination of
the site). In other words, there may be cost pessimism or cost optimism.
In view of this problem it is important to conduct a sensitivity analysis, namely to
learn how the ﬁnal net beneﬁt ﬁgure changes if costs are increased or decreased by
some percentage. Because of the uncertainty often involved in CBA, and opinions
that differ on the “correct” costs and beneﬁts or other assumptions regarding effects,
many CBA studies include a sensitivity analysis. Two approaches can be followed in a
sensitivity analysis. The ﬁrst is to determine NPVs for different assumptions regarding
costs and beneﬁts (including prices, time frame, and discounting). The second, and
alternative approach, is to analyze switching values. These are the speciﬁc values of
costs, beneﬁts, and timing that cause a project to switch from being beneﬁcial to being

856
Part IX: Applications
nonbeneﬁcial. Switching values provide information on the cost and beneﬁt items for
which the overall result is most sensitive. For instance, it may be found that—starting
from initial assumptions—a 10 percent increase in investment costs would be needed
to decrease the NPV to 0 but that a 1 percent increase in the (average) operational and
maintenance cost has the same effect. Or that increasing the discount rate at 3 to 3.5
percent means that the project no longer yields a proﬁt.
25.4
Principles of CBA
One of the problems of CBAis that the method for the computation of many components
of beneﬁts and costs is intuitively obvious, but there are others for which intuition fails
to suggest methods of measurement. Therefore some basic principles are needed as a
guide. We now brieﬂy review a number of these and then look in more detail at two of
them in the following sections.
25.4.1
Common Unit of Measurement
In order to reach a conclusion as to the desirability of a project all aspects of the project,
positive and negative, must be expressed in terms of a common unit; that is, there must
be a “bottom line.” The most convenient common unit is money. This means that all
beneﬁts and costs of a project should be measured in terms of their equivalent monetary
value.Aprogram may provide beneﬁts that are not directly expressed in terms of dollars,
but there is some amount of money the recipients of the beneﬁts would consider to be
just as good as the project’s beneﬁts. For example, a project may provide for the elderly
in an area a free monthly visit to a doctor. The value of that beneﬁt to an elderly recipient
is the minimum amount of money that recipient would take instead of the medical care.
This could be less than the market value of the medical care provided. It is assumed
that more intangible beneﬁts such as from preserving open space or historic sites have
a ﬁnite equivalent monetary value to the public.
Not only do the beneﬁts and costs of a project have to be expressed in terms of
equivalent monetary value, but they have to be expressed in terms of dollars of a
particular time. A dollar available ﬁve years from now is not as good as a dollar
available now. This is due to the differences in the value of dollars at different times
because of inﬂation and because of the effect of interest payments. A dollar available
now can be invested and earn interest for ﬁve years and would be worth more than a
dollar in ﬁve years. If the interest rate is r, then a dollar invested for t years will grow
to be (1 + r)t. Therefore the amount of money that would have to be deposited now so

857
Chapter 25: Cost–Beneﬁt Analysis
that it would grow to be one dollar t years in the future is (1 + r)−t. This is called the
discounted value or present value of a dollar available t years in the future.
When the dollar value of beneﬁts at some time in the future is multiplied by the dis-
counted value of one dollar at that time in the future, the result is the present discounted
value of the beneﬁt of the project. The same thing applies to costs. The net present
value of the project is just the present discounted value of the beneﬁts less the present
discounted value of the costs. The choice of the appropriate interest rate to use for the
discounting is a separate issue that will be treated later.
25.4.2
Revealed Preferences
According to some economists, the valuation of beneﬁts and costs used in CBA should
reﬂect the preferences revealed by choices that have been made by individuals in the
different markets in which they act. Information contained in the demand curve tells us
much about what people are willing and able to pay for something. This is important
in revealed preference theory. When consumers make purchases at market prices, they
reveal that the things they buy are at least as beneﬁcial to them as the money they
relinquish.
Hard choices made in markets are the best guide to private beneﬁts. For example,
improvements in transportation frequently involve saving time. The question is how to
measure the monetary value of that time saved. The value should not be merely what
transportation planners think time should be worth or even what people say their time
is worth (the stated preference for time saving). The value of time should be that which
the public reveals their time is worth through choices involving trade-offs between time
and money (revealed preference for time saving). The value of time is revealed in many
choice situations. If people have a choice of parking close to their destination for a fee
of 50 cents or parking farther away for free and spending 5 minutes more walking, and
they always choose to spend the money and save the time and effort, then they have
revealed that their time is more valuable to them than 10 cents per minute. If they were
indifferent between the two choices they would have revealed that the value of their
time to them was exactly 10 cents per minute.
The most challenging part of CBA is ﬁnding past choices that reveal the trade-offs
and equivalencies in preferences. For example, the valuation of the beneﬁt of cleaner
air could be established by ﬁnding how much less people paid for housing in a more
polluted area that is otherwise identical in characteristics and location to housing in a
less polluted area. Generally, the value of cleaner air to people as revealed by the hard
market choices seems to be less than the stated valuation of clean air.

25.4.3
Valuing Market Goods: Marshallian Surplus
Consumers will increase their consumption of any good up to the point where the
beneﬁt of an additional unit (marginal beneﬁt) is equal to the market price of that unit
(the marginal cost). Therefore, for any consumer buying some of a commodity, the
marginal beneﬁt is at least equal to the market price. The marginal beneﬁt will decline
with the amount consumed just as the market price has to decline to get consumers
to purchase a greater quantity of the commodity. The relationship between the market
price and the quantity consumed is summarized in the demand curve. Thus the demand
curve provides the information about marginal beneﬁt that is needed to place a money
value on an increase in consumption.
The increase in gross beneﬁts resulting from an increase in consumption is the sum of
themarginalbeneﬁttimeseachincrementalincreaseinconsumption.Astheincremental
increases considered are made smaller and smaller, the sum goes to the area under the
marginal beneﬁt curve. But the marginal beneﬁt curve is the same as the demand curve,
so the increase in gross beneﬁts is the area under the demand curve. The area is taken
over the range from the lower limit of consumption before the increase to consumption
after the increase. In ﬁgure 25.1 the lower limit of consumption is x0 and the increase
is the amount . The beneﬁt of this increase is the shaded area. When the increase in
consumption is small compared to the total consumption, the gross beneﬁt is adequately

Chapter 25: Cost–Beneﬁt Analysis
approximated, as is shown in a welfare analysis, by the market value of the increased
consumption; that is, market price times the increase in consumption. The cost of this
additional consumption is also equal to price times the increase in consumption, so the
net beneﬁt is zero.
Formally, consider a quasi-linear utility function given by U(x, y) = v(x)+y, with
v(x) increasing (v′(x) > 0) and concave (v′′(x) < 0). Let good y be the numéraire and p
the (relative) price of good x. The budget constraint is px+y ≤M. The inverse demand
function is obtained by equating price to marginal utility p = v′(x). By inversion, the
demand function is x = v′−1(p) ≡x(p) (assuming an interior solution, y > 0, for
otherwise, x(p) = M
p ). The gross beneﬁt of this level of consumption is
 x(p)
0
v′(x)dx = v(x(p)) −v(0).
(25.4)
The Marshallian surplus (or net beneﬁt) is obtained from the gross beneﬁt by subtracting
the cost of consumption at the market price:
 x(p)
0
v′(x)dx −px(p) = v(x(p)) −v(0) −px(p).
(25.5)
This is the welfare gain from consuming x(p) at price p. An allocation is efﬁcient if it
maximizes the sum of individual surpluses. This is not a complete measure of welfare
because it does not take into account the income level M. The Marshallian surplus is
only valid as a measure of efﬁciency in a quasi-linear economy. This is because with
quasi-linear preferences utility is transferable, so efﬁciency and the distribution can be
treated as separate issues.
25.4.4
Valuing Nonmarket Goods: Hedonic Prices
It is sometimes necessary in CBA to evaluate the beneﬁt of saving human lives. There
is considerable antipathy in the general public to the idea of placing a dollar value
on human life. Economists recognize that it is impossible to fund every project that
promises to save a human life and that some rational basis is needed to select which
projects are approved and which are turned down. The controversy is defused when it
is recognized that the beneﬁt of such projects is in reducing the risk of death. There are
many cases where people voluntarily accept increased risks in return for higher pay,
such as in the oil ﬁelds or mining, or for time savings in higher speed in automobile

860
Part IX: Applications
travel. These choices can be used to estimate the personal cost people place on increased
risk and thus the value to them of reduced risk. This computation is equivalent to placing
an economic value on the expected number of lives saved.
Methods based on hedonic pricing use the fact that some market goods are in fact
bundles of characteristics, some of which are intangible goods. By trading these market
goods, consumers are thereby able to express their values for the intangible goods, and
these values can be uncovered through the use of statistical techniques. This process
can be hindered, however, by the fact that a market good can have several intangible
characteristics, and that these can be collinear. It can also be difﬁcult to measure the
intangible characteristics in a meaningful way.
Similarly defensive expenditures can be used to estimate the value of intangible
impacts. This refers to individual behavior to avoid negative intangible impacts. For
example, people might buy goods such as safety helmets to reduce accident risk, and
double-glazed windows to reduce trafﬁc noise, thereby revealing their valuation of such
intangible goods as safety and quietness. Travel cost methods use the fact that market
and intangible goods can be complements, to the extent that a purchase of market goods
and services is required to access an intangible good. Speciﬁcally, people have to spend
time and money traveling to recreational sites, and these costs reveal something of the
value of the recreational experience to those people incurring them.
25.4.5
Impact Assessment
The impact of a project is the difference between what the situation in the study area
would be with and without the project. That is, when a project is being evaluated
the analysis must estimate not only what the situation would be with the project but
also what it would be without the project. For example, in determining the impact of
a rapid transit system (RTS) in a metropolitan area, the number of rides that would
have been taken on an expansion of the bus system should be deducted from the rides
provided by RTS, and likewise the additional costs of such an expanded bus system
would be deducted from the costs of RTS. In other words, the alternative to the project
must be explicitly speciﬁed and considered in the evaluation of the project. As al-
ready noted the with-and-without comparison is not the same as a before-and-after
comparison.
Another example shows the importance of considering the impacts of a project and a
with-and-without comparison. Suppose that an irrigation project is proposed to increase
cotton production in Arizona. If the US Department of Agriculture limits the cotton

861
Chapter 25: Cost–Beneﬁt Analysis
production by a system of quotas, then expanded cotton production inArizona might be
offset by a reduction in the cotton production quota for Mississippi. Thus the impact of
the project on cotton production in the United States might be zero despite the increase
in the amount of cotton produced by the project.
Double counting of beneﬁts or costs must be avoided. Sometimes an impact of a
project can be measured in two or more ways. For example, when an improved highway
reduces travel time and the risk of injury, the value of property in areas served by the
highway will be enhanced. The increase in property values due to the project is a very
good way, at least in principle, to measure the beneﬁts of a project. But, if the increased
property values are included, then it is not necessary to include the value of the time and
lives saved by the improvement in the highway. The property value went up because
of the beneﬁts of the time saving and the reduced risks. To include both the increase
in property values and the time saving and risk reduction would amount to double
counting.
25.4.6
Decision Criteria
If the discounted present value of the beneﬁts exceeds the discounted present value of
the costs, then the project is worthwhile. This is equivalent to the condition that the net
beneﬁt must be positive. Another equivalent condition is that the ratio of the present
value of the beneﬁts to the present value of the costs must be greater than one.
If there are more than one mutually exclusive projects that have positive net present
value then there has to be further analysis. From the set of mutually exclusive projects
the one that should be selected is the one with the highest net present value. If the funds
required to carry out all of the projects with positive net present value are less than the
funds available, then the discount rate used in computing the present value is too low
and does not reﬂect the true cost of capital. The present values must be recomputed
using a higher discount rate. It may take some trial and error to ﬁnd a discount rate such
that the funds required for the projects with a positive net present value are no more
than the funds available. Sometimes as an alternative to this procedure, people try to
select the best projects on the basis of some measure of goodness such as the internal
rate of return or the beneﬁt–cost ratio. This is not valid for several reasons.
The magnitude of the ratio of beneﬁts to costs is to a degree arbitrary because some
costs such as operating costs may be deducted from beneﬁts and thus not be included
in the cost ﬁgure. This is called “netting out of operating costs.” Netting out may
be done for some projects and not for others. The manipulation of the beneﬁts and

862
Part IX: Applications
costs will not affect the net beneﬁts but may change the beneﬁt–cost ratio. However,
it will not raise a beneﬁt–cost ratio that is less than one to above one. More important,
the ranking of different projects can be reversed when choosing the beneﬁt–cost ratio
instead of the NPV. To better see this, consider three projects i = 1, 2, 3 with the
following (discounted) beneﬁts and costs (Bi, Ci): (200, 100), (110, 50), and (120, 50).
Based on the beneﬁt–cost ratio, project 3 ≻project 2 ≻project 1 with respect to the
beneﬁt–cost ratios of 2.4, 2.2, and 2.0. Conversely, on the basis of the NPV, project 1
≻project 3 ≻project 2 with respect to the NPVs of 100, 70, and 60.
25.4.7
Difﬁculties for CBA
CBA should be seen as a highly practical method for making decisions. The various
approaches that we have described were developed to reﬁne the method. There are still
difﬁculties that CBA must confront in use. These are now brieﬂy described.
Attaching Valuations to Costs and Beneﬁts
Some costs are easy to value such as the running costs (e.g., staff costs) and capital
costs (e.g., purchases of new equipment) of a project. Other costs are more difﬁcult to
evaluate—not least when a project has a signiﬁcant impact on the environment. The
value attached to the destruction of a natural habitat is to some people priceless but to
others entirely worthless. Costs are also subject to change over time. This is frequently
illustrated by the cost overruns in large construction projects or innovative IT schemes
(e.g., the introduction of electronic road pricing).
Covering Everyone Affected
The ideal application of CBA would include all parties that are directly or indirectly
affected by a project. Inevitably, with any major project, such as the construction of a
new airport or a new road, there are a large number of potential “stakeholders” who
stand to be affected (positively or negatively) by the project. For example, people living
many miles from an airport could be affected by noise. CBA cannot hope to include
all stakeholders, so there is a risk that some groups might be left out of the decision
process. The effect of discounting is to make costs and beneﬁts that occur in the future
insigniﬁcant relative to current costs and beneﬁts. This can be interpreted as effectively
excluding the effects on future generations from the evaluation of the project. This is an
issue that we return to in chapter 26. The position of “nonhuman” stakeholders raises
a further set of issues.

863
Chapter 25: Cost–Beneﬁt Analysis
Distributional Consequences
Costs and beneﬁts mean different things to different income groups—beneﬁts to the
poor are usually worth more (or are they?). Those receiving beneﬁts and those burdened
with the costs of a project may not be the same. Are the losers to be compensated? To
many economists, the equity issue is as important as the efﬁciency argument.
Social Welfare Is Not the Same as Individual Welfare
What we want individually
may not be what we want collectively. Do we attach a different value to those who
feel “passionately” about something (e.g., building of new housing on greenﬁeld sites)
contrasted with those who are more ambivalent? Valuing the environment: How are
we to place a value on public goods such as the environment where there is no market
established for the valuation of “property rights” over environmental resources? How
does one value “nuisance” and “aesthetic values”?
Valuing Human Life
Some measurements of beneﬁts require the valuation of human
life—many people are intrinsically opposed to any attempt to do this. This objection can
be partly overcome if we focus instead on the probability of a project “reducing the risk
of death.” There are indeed insurance markets in existence that tell us something about
how much people value their health and life when they take out insurance policies.
Discounting the Future
Discounting reduces all future costs and beneﬁts to express
them as today’s values. The key question is: How do you choose an “interest rate” for
reducing future costs to give them a present value today? Setting a general discount
rate for new projects has important implications for the environment.
A low discount rate is often favored by economists, since they argue that investing
a high proportion of current income is a good way of providing for the future. A high
discount rate may also be favored because it discourages investment (and by implication
environmental damage) in the present. Most projects have lifetimes of 20 to 30 years—
with many of the big costs arising early in a project, such as from construction, whereas
the stream of beneﬁts from a project occur over a much longer period of time. But for
many huge construction projects, some of the costs only become apparent in the long
run. Consider the building of a new nuclear power station. Environmentalists would
argue that there is a long list of costs from waste management and decommissioning
that stretch over 100 years into the future whereas no social beneﬁts exist to offset
these costs beyond year 30 or 40 (when the nuclear power station might reasonably be
expected to be ready for closure). The value of decommissioning costs over 100 years

away is almost negligible no matter what discount rate we use. This makes discounting
difﬁcult to justify
Accommodating Risk
Consider a cost–beneﬁt analysis of the effects of genetically modiﬁed foods. Two prin-
ciples can be applied to the risk that is inherent in these foods. Under the precautionary
principle, it is assumed that the foods are toxic until they are proved to be safe. From
this principle follows the policy conclusion: if in doubt, regulate. The contrasting al-
ternative is the free-market principle: assume that the foods are safe until a hazard is
identiﬁed. The consequent policy maxim is: if in doubt, do not regulate. These alterna-
tive principles have also been applied to climate change. Some economists apply the
precautionary principle to argue that action should be taken now to mitigate greenhouse
gas emissions even if there is no compelling evidence that climate is changing. Other
economists follow the free-market principle and wait for incontrovertible evidence
before the cost of mitigation is incurred. Despite these conﬂicts, most economists
argue that CBA is better than other ways of including the environment in project
appraisals.
Many projects to which CBA is applied involve risk. Cost and beneﬁts are risky
because of future contingencies and the problems of forecasting. The issue is how to
take account of risk. It is not correct to use the expected value of the forecast outcomes.
This does not work because it does not take account of risk aversion. Individuals who
are risk averse will not accept a fair gamble. The only gambles they will accept will
have a strictly positive expected payoff. The amount required to accept the gamble is the
risk premium. With risk aversion the value of a set of risky payoffs is always less than
the expected value. There is compelling evidence that in aggregate individuals are risk
averse. This is reﬂected by the fact that in ﬁnancial markets riskier assets (e.g., shares in
small companies) must offer a higher expected return that safer assets (e.g., government
bonds). Thisriskaversionshouldbereﬂectedinsocialpreferencesandembeddedwithin
CBA. Last, there is a potential tension between subjective and objective measurement
of risks. To illustrate this problem, Pollack (1998) told a story about Happyville where
the citizens became afraid of a possible contaminant in their drinking water. They
requested a chemical analysis of the water in order to have an objective evaluation of
the risk. It turned out that there was no risk to the quality of the water and that there was
no need for a puriﬁcation plant because it would cost money without creating a beneﬁt.
However, the citizens of Happyville did not trust the chemical analysis and they insisted
on having the puriﬁcation plant. Should we consider this demand based on subjective

865
Chapter 25: Cost–Beneﬁt Analysis
risk evaluation in the CBA, or should we favor the objective risk evaluation and not go
ahead with a puriﬁcation plant?
25.5
Valuing Life
There are many projects that may involve mortality. The construction of a new hos-
pital may help save lives through more readily accessible treatment. This reduction
in mortality should be included as a beneﬁt in a CBA of the hospital. However, the
construction of the hospital may prove to be hazardous and potentially expose the con-
struction workers to serious injury or death. The cost of this increased risk of mortality
should also be factored into the CBA calculation.
The logic of CBA requires that all mortality risks be given a monetary valuation.
Many noneconomists may have moral objections to this idea. But there are two counter-
arguments. First, if life is assumed to be beyond valuation, then no project that involves
even the slightest risk of death could ever be undertaken, or else unlimited resources
would be spent on any project that involves the slightest reduction in death risk. Both
are obviously ridiculous positions, and no society could function under these circum-
stances. Second, individuals in their own daily choices frequently place a valuation on
life. Consider a worker choosing between two jobs with different risks of death and in-
jury. How much of a wage premium do they require to accept the riskier job? Consider
an individual choosing how much to spend on safety equipment (e.g., a motorcycle
helmet). Is it worth purchasing the higher quality product? Consider the choice of a
car. Is it worth paying extra for additional safety bags or for stability control? In every
case the decision will weigh the value of life and the probability of death against the
additional cost.
A further justiﬁcation for valuing life follows from the consequences of not doing
so. In the absence of an explicit value, decisions will be made that imply different
valuations. Policy choices can be inconsistent, and limited funds will not be used
efﬁciently. For example, assume that it is decided to fund a road safety project that
costs $2 million and saves four lives but a medical treatment that costs $3 million and
saves twelve lives is not funded (the projects are mutually exclusive due to a budget
limit). The choice to fund the ﬁrst project implies that the value of life is at least $0.5
million, the choice not to fund the second project implies a value of life of less than
$0.25 million. Clearly, these choices are inconsistent, and their bearing on the choice
of project is incorrect. Such decision-making can be costly if it leads to a misallocation
of resources that results in lives being needlessly lost.

866
Part IX: Applications
The value of life is normally addressed in a setting where the increase or decrease in
mortalitycanonlybeexpressedasapossibility. Thisisdonetoavoidthemoralquestions
that would arise if it were known exactly whose life would be lost. The underlying
assumption is that the consequences of implementing a project are uncertain: it is not
known who will die or be saved, nor how many people will die or be saved. What is
known is the reduction (or increase) in the probability of mortality due to the project. For
example, a construction project may increase the probability of death for all workers,
while an irrigation project may reduce the probability of death through crop failure.
Theseconsiderationsgiverisetotheconceptofthevalueofstatisticallife(VSL), whichis
deﬁned as the beneﬁt arising from the expected saving of one life. We will now consider
the theory behind the VSL, and then proceed to methods of evaluation. Finally, we will
review some current estimates of the VSL.
The ﬁrst step to obtain a VSL is to consider the willingness to pay (WTP) for a
risk reduction that will extend the length of life. The WTP is deﬁned as the maximum
amount that a person is willing to pay to avoid a risk. Let U(M, a) denote the level
of utility with income M when the individual is alive, and U(M, d) the utility when
dead. The latter can either be zero or be interpreted as the utility derived from leaving
a bequest to descendents. If p is the probability of dying in the current period the level
of expected utility is
EU = [1 −p] U(M, a) + pU(M, d).
(25.6)
The willingness to pay to avoid the risk of death is deﬁned by the value of ρ that ensures
the utility of life with income M −ρ is equal to the expected utility with income M
but with a probability p of death
U(M −ρ, a) = [1 −p]U(M, a) + pU(M, d).
(25.7)
The VSL is the marginal value of a reduction in the risk of death, so is deﬁned as the
rate at which the WTP increases with p
VSL ≡∂WTP
∂p
= ∂ρ
∂p.
(25.8)
An equivalent deﬁnition of the VSL is the total WTP of a group of N people who
experience a uniform increase of 1
N in their risk of dying. For example, consider 1,000
individuals who each have a WTP of $500 to avoid an increase in the risk of dying of
1 in 1,000. The VSL is then the total WTP, which is $500,000.
The concept of value of a statistical life year (VOLY) is related to the VSL. Specif-
ically, assume that a VOLY is constant over the rest of a person’s remaining lifetime,

867
Chapter 25: Cost–Beneﬁt Analysis
and assume the person lives for T +1 years, including the present year. The VOLY and
the VSL are the related by
VSL =
T

t=0
(1 + d)−tVOLY,
(25.9)
where d is an appropriate discount rate. The notion of VOLY is used in policy analyses
in addition to (or instead of) that of VSL, but depending on the age of the people whose
lives are saved by the policy, VOLY can lead to recommendations in conﬂict with those
obtained by using VSL. Consider, for example, two alternative public programs that
both save 100 lives. With the ﬁrst program the lives that are saved are of young adults,
whereas with the second the lives saved are of elderly people. If the VOLY is constant
with respect to age, the longer life expectancy of young adults gives the program saving
young lives greater beneﬁts when the VOLY is used. In contrast, if there is a single
value of VSL for all people, then the two programs would give the same beneﬁt.
Medical treatments can have different outcomes in terms of the level of future health.
Some treatments can return a patient to full health, whereas others can prolong life but
with a reduced degree of functionality. It is accepted that a life lived with incapacity
or in pain is not as rewarding as a life lived in good health. The value assigned to a
treatment in a CBAshould reﬂect this fact. The concept that has been adopted in medical
applications is the quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Every treatment is assigned a
value q, 0 ≤q ≤1, that measures the quality of life for the patient after the treatment.
The variable q will equal 1 if the treatment restores the patient to full health and a value
close to 0 if it does little more than just sustain life. The VSL for that patient is then
given by qVSL, and this value should be used as the beneﬁt of treatment in CBA.
The VSL has clear conceptual foundations, but this does not make identifying a value
for it straightforward. One approach is to apply the ideas of section 25.4.4 to markets
in which actions reveal individual valuations of life. The labor market has proved
particularly useful since there are many different types of job available and these differ
in the probability of mortality at work. Many forms of employment have negligible
mortality risk but some, such as mining, ﬁshing, and construction, have signiﬁcant
risks. The theory of compensating differentials asserts that wages for different jobs
should reﬂect the characteristics of the jobs. Hence jobs with mortality risk should
have a wage premium to reﬂect that risk. The wage premium can then be used to
infer the VSL. Alternatively, it is possible to infer the VSL from the expenditure that
individuals make to reduce the risk of mortality. The amount spent on the purchase of
protective equipment, such as a motorcycle helmet or an optional safety aid on a car,

868
Part IX: Applications
coupled with the amount of risk reduction it secures provides evidence on the private
assessment of VSL. The fundamental problems faced by both these methods are the
behavioral anomalies identiﬁed in chapter 3. Individuals can suffer from optimism bias
and underestimate the probability of a poor outcome or have excessive belief in their
own skill levels. They can assess the outcomes using preferences that do not conform
with the expected utility assumption on which the VSL was constructed. There will
also be self-selection of the least risk-averse into risky occupations so that the wage
premium reﬂects the valuation of an extreme, not an average.
Table 25.1 provides some examples of the values estimated using the methods de-
scribed. The key point is that there is considerable variation in these estimates. It is
also interesting that some of the numbers are above the typical lifetime income. The
mean income in the United States in 2010, according the Census Bureau, is just short
of $70,000. For a working life of 45 years this gives total mean lifetime income of
$3.15 million. It seems inconsistent that the VSL can be signiﬁcantly above this. The
US Department of Transport is explicit about the value it uses. In January 1993 the De-
partment adopted a guidance memorandum, “Treatment of Value of Life and Injuries
in Preparing Economic Evaluations,” that stated the recommended value to be used
in Departmental regulatory and investment analyses. The initial value was set at $2.5
million and the last adjustment to $3.0 million was made on January 29, 2002.
One of the justiﬁcations for valuing life was to avoid the policy inconsistencies
that could arise if life was not explicitly valued. Inconsistencies can still arise even
with explicit values. As an example, different branches of the UK government apply
different values. The cost effectiveness of drugs supplied by the National Health Service
is determined in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland by the National Institute for
Clinical Excellence (NICE). NICE usually determines a treatment not to be value for

25.6
Valuing the Future
Many projects will have effects that last for many years. The construction of a major
infrastructural project might take 5 to 10 years, and once completed, it can be expected
to deliver beneﬁts for decades afterward. Some projects can have exceptionally long

870
Part IX: Applications
lives: the half-life of plutonium-239 in spent nuclear fuel rods is 24,110 years, so any
evaluation of a nuclear power plant must incorporate the very long-run costs of dealing
with this material. The value assigned to costs and beneﬁts occurring in the future
relative to those occurring in the present will be critical in calculating the NPV of a
long-lived project.
A basic economic fact is that when people are offered a choice between receiving
$1 today or receiving a $1 in a year’s time then the $1 today will be chosen. There are
three reasons proposed to explain this fact:
1. Pure time preference reﬂects a basic desire to consume in the present rather than
the future. This is closest to the general notion of impatience, which leads to a unit of
money today being preferred to a unit of money tomorrow.
2. Expectationofincomegrowthbuildsonthebeliefthattheindividualwillbewealthier
in the future. This implies that the marginal utility of consumption is expected to be
lower in the future, so that it is optimal to consume the additional $1 today when the
marginal utility is higher.
3. Uncertainty captures the possibility that if the receipt of the $1 is postponed for a
year, there may be some chance that it will not be received. Accepting it today ensures
that it is received and therefore is preferable.
These three reasons are not mutually exclusive so that all can operate simultaneously.
In total they imply that $1 in one year is valued by the individual as worth $
1
1+d today,
for some discount rate d > 0. The higher the value of d is, the lower the relative worth
of future dollars compared to current dollars. The issue in moving from this observation
about intertemporal preferences to a process that can be used in CBA is to determine
the correct value of the discount rate, d.
At this point it is worth stressing that different considerations apply to determining
the discount factor of an individual and determining the discount factor of a society. An
individual discount factor has to be compared to what “is,” whereas a social discount
factor is more an expression of what “ought to be.” The force of this distinction will
become clear as the argument proceeds.
25.6.1
Intertemporal Arbitrage
Consider an individual confronting a ﬁnancial market where there are opportunities
to borrow or invest at a rate of interest r per year. With this rate of interest, a $1

871
Chapter 25: Cost–Beneﬁt Analysis
invested for t years (or borrowed and paid back with interest after t years) becomes
$ [1 + r]t. This implies that $1 today is worth $ [1 + r] next year. Whenever r is
positive, any individual offered a choice between $1 today or $1 in a year will take the
money today: the dollar today can be spent immediately or invested for a year to give
$ [1 + r]. Since at least one of these alternatives is strictly better than waiting a year to
receive a dollar, the dollar today is strictly preferable. This argument can also be run
in reverse. If the individual wishes to have an extra $1 of consumption next year, the
most they need to give up is $ 1
1+r since investing this amount will deliver the extra
dollar. Hence, if the individual operates with any discount rate other that r, there will
be an arbitrage opportunity—meaning a transaction (borrowing or lending) that they
would ﬁnd beneﬁcial.
What we have deduced is that exponential discounting should apply so that the
value today of $1 at time t should be $
1
[1+r]t . Consequently the interest rate should
determine the individual discount rate, d, so that d = r. The natural question is to
wonder how this can incorporate individual differences in preference. The answer
is that the functioning of the market will ensure that the choices made according to
individual preferences will ensure that, in equilibrium, all consumers will agree on the
relative values of consumption in different time periods. The theoretical underpinning
for this statement are now demonstrated by reviewing the economics of intertemporal
choice.
Consider an economy that last for two periods. Time 0 is interpreted as the present
and time 1 as the future. The production possibilities for the economy are determined
by the production possibility frontier
G(X0, X1) = 0,
(25.10)
where Xt is output at time t. Now assume initially that there is a single consumer with
preferences given by
U = U (X0, X1) .
(25.11)
The optimal allocation of consumption for the economy is where the production possi-
bility frontier is tangential to the highest attainable indifference curve. This is illustrated
in ﬁgure 25.3. Let the gradient of the tangent to the indifference curve at the optimum
be given by −[1 + r]. Then, at the optimum,
∂U/∂X1
∂U/∂X0
= 1 + r,

(25.13)
Hence r has the property of a discount rate that relates the marginal utility of con-
sumption next period to the marginal utility this period. It is traditional to call this the
social time preference rate, since it governs the trade-off between present and future
consumption.
The optimum can be decentralized. Assume that there is a perfect capital market so
that borrowing and lending can be undertaken at the same rate of interest, r. Assume
also that there is no uncertainty so that all plans will be realized. Let production be
controlled by competitive ﬁrms. The consumer will allocate consumption across time
guided by the fact that reducing consumption today by 1 unit permits an increase of
1 + r units next year. Similarly ﬁrms will base their productions plans on the fact that
each unit borrowed today will require repayment of 1 + r units. The interest rate will
adjust until the plans of the consumers and the ﬁrms are in equilibrium, and the resulting
value r is the equilibrium rate of interest for the economy. This is just an intertemporal
version of argument concerning the Robinson Crusoe economy of chapter 2. The de-
centralization argument provides a direct link between the market rate of interest and
the social time preference rate: the nature of equilibrium guarantees that the two are
equal.

873
Chapter 25: Cost–Beneﬁt Analysis
25.6.2
The UK Green Book
A version of this reasoning is put forward by the UK Green Book as an explanation of
the proposed choice of a discount rate. The argument is presented in the following way:
For individuals, time preference can be measured by the real interest rate on money lent or borrowed.
Amongst other investments, people invest at ﬁxed, low risk rates, hoping to receive more in the future
(net of tax) to compensate for the deferral of consumption now. These real rates of return give some
indication of their individual pure time preference rate. Society, as a whole, also prefers to receive
goods and services sooner rather than later, and to defer costs to future generations. This is known as
“social time preference”; the “social time preference rate” (STPR) is the rate at which society values
the present competed to the future. (The Green Book 2003, p. 26, HM Treasury)
It may be suspected that there is an additional step involved in moving from the
analysis of a single-consumer economy to an economy with many consumers. With a
single consumer it is possible to talk unambiguously about the rate of time preference.
Is this still possible when there are many consumers with different preferences? The
answer is that it is because the interest rate is essentially a price: it measures the rate
at which present consumption can be transformed into future consumption. Under the
assumption of perfect capital markets each consumer faces the same market rate of
interest. The consumers adjust their consumption plans (the allocation across time)
to match this market rate. In equilibrium some consumers will be net lenders in the
ﬁrst period (which transfers consumption from time 0 to time 1) while others will be
borrowers (transferring consumption from 1 to 0). The interest rate r adjusts to achieve
an equilibrium where consumption plans match the production plan.At this equilibrium
the situation shown in ﬁgure 25.3 is satisﬁed for all consumers, so every consumer
agrees on the social time preference rate.
This logic justiﬁes the approach to calculating an NPV used in (25.1) with the market
rate of interest used as the discount rate. The basic cost–beneﬁt logic is then applied so
that a project is accepted if NPV > 0, since this ensures that implementation will raise
welfare. It is interesting to note the advice in the UK Green Book (Annex 6). The Green
Book (Section 5.49) adopts the value of r = 0.035 (3.5 percent). There is an issue with
the value of r = 0.035. Observe that at 3.5 percent $1,000 to be received 10 years into
the future is worth $708.92 today, the same amount in 20 years is worth $502.57 and in
50 years $179.05. The problem that this causes is that projects with beneﬁts that arrive
long in the future will not be accepted, while projects that incur costs in the distant
future will be accepted.
The nature of discounting favours projects delivering beneﬁts in the near future with
costs in the distant future. This means that we will choose not to deliver beneﬁts to future

874
Part IX: Applications
generations but will impose costs on them. The response to this is somewhat ad hoc in
practice. The UK Green Book recommends that the discount rate should gradually be
reduced the further into the future are the beneﬁts and costs of the project. The logic
given for this is increased uncertainty in the future, though this runs converse to the
normal treatment of risk that we discuss shortly. Even at the lower rates recommended
future ﬂows are heavily discounted (e.g., $100 in 100 years is worth $2.50 today when
discounted at 2.5 percent).
LONG-TERM DISCOUNT RATES. Where the appraisal of a proposal depends materially upon the
discounting of effects in the very long term, the received view is that a lower discount rate for the
longer term (beyond 30 years) should be used. The main rationale for declining long-term discount
rates results from uncertainty about the future. This uncertainty can be shown to cause declining
discount rates over time. In light of this evidence, it is recommended that for costs and beneﬁts
accruing more than 30 years into the future, appraisers use the schedule of discount rates provided in
Table 6.1 below.

There are three possible responses to these implications of discounting. The ﬁrst
is to accept what the method is delivering. The fact that it reduces future values so
signiﬁcantly relative to current values reﬂects how individuals behave. Society, as
the aggregate of individuals, should behave in the same way and be resigned to the
consequences. The second approach is to adopt the perspective of intergenerational
equity. The fact that individuals discount future ﬂows in their own decisions does not
imply that society should do the same. This is because society consists of different
generations of people, and the individual logic does not extend to discounting across
generations. Theextremeversionofthisargument—whichweexplorefurtherinchapter
26—uses a pure rate of time preference of zero, ignores the effect of decreasing marginal
utility of income, and discounts only for risk. The third approach is to appeal to the
implications of behavioral economics as described in chapter 3. There is evidence that
people behave as if they apply quasi-hyperbolic discounting. That is, choices in the near
term display signiﬁcant present bias (so there is heavy initial discounting), but choices
in the longer term seem to imply lower relative rates of discount. People are likely to

875
Chapter 25: Cost–Beneﬁt Analysis
prefer $100 today to $101 tomorrow, but they are also likely to prefer $101 in 1 year + 1
day compared to $100 in one year. Such a pattern of discounting is approximately what
is captured in the table reproduced from the UK Green Book. Despite what the notes
to the table in the Green Book claim, the numbers are justiﬁed by quasi-hyperbolic
discounting rather than risk.
25.6.3
Adjustment for Risk
The discounting rules that we have been discussing need to be modiﬁed when the project
being assessed is risky. We can think about the discount rate r that we have used so
far in the NPV formula as the interest rate paid on a safe bank account. Risky assets
always have higher rates of return to provide the inducement required for risk-averse
investors to hold them. The same argument leads to the conclusion that risky projects
should also have a higher discount rate, and so a smaller discount factor. A convenient
approach is to write the discount rate for a risky project as r + rp, where rpis the risk
premium. The NPV of the project is
NPV =
T

t=0
1

1 + r + rp
t [Bt −Ct] .
(25.14)
The issue now is to determining what the value of rp should be.
The answer to ﬁnding rp is to look at the return either required by the market for
projects with similar risk or offered on assets with similar risk. This works provided
that something similar can be found. Generally, we can use a model that predicts the
risk premium. The most popular model in ﬁnance is the capital asset pricing model
(CAPM). The key variable in CAPM is the beta of an asset, which is deﬁned by
βi ≡cov(ri, rm)
var(rm) ,
(25.15)
where cov (ri, rm) is the covariance of the return on the asset to the market, and var(rm)
is variance of the market return. At the equilibrium of the CAPM the expected return
on asset i is is given by
¯ri = r + βi[¯rm −r] ,
(25.16)
so that the risk premium is
rp = βi[¯rm −r] .
(25.17)

876
Part IX: Applications
The CAPM is a useful model because it provides a precise formula for the risk premium.
But it does require data to calculate βi, and it might not be clear how the return on
a project can be speciﬁed in these terms. The CAPM is also only one among many
models of ﬁnancial markets that will generate a value of the risk premium.
The most challenging critique to the CAPM model is the risk premium puzzle. In
a nutshell, the puzzle is this: why do stocks have a much higher long-term rate of
return than bonds? In theory, investors should demand a higher return on stocks, but
only enough to make up for the fact that stocks are riskier than bonds. In real life,
though, it turns out that even when you take risk into account, stocks still have higher
returns with, on average, an extra return about twice as high as what risk aversion
and the CAPM model would predict. Why? Robert Barro’s answer, building on a
solution proposed nearly two decades earlier by Thomas Rietz, is that investors are
fundamentally irrational: they overestimate the probability of unlikely but catastrophic
losses (i.e., the black swan), and this fear makes the demand for risk-free investments
larger than it rationally ought to be and thus drives down the return on bonds. It is
an explanation akin to prospect theory, which is based on the fact that people are not
so much risk-averse as loss-averse (see chapter 3). Consistent with prospect theory,
most people feel much more strongly about the probability of a loss than they do about
the probability of an equivalent gain, and it seems like this is partly what is going on
here. As a result a small increase in this kind of risk, such as due to the 2008 ﬁnancial
crisis, leads to a noticeable response of real interest rates. When this probability goes
up, the risk-free rate goes down because people put more of a premium on holding a
relatively safe asset. Correspondingly the risk premium gets augmented to reﬂect this
small-probability–big-loss event.
25.7
Theoretical Foundations of CBA
The fundamental principle guiding CBA is to let individual preferences be the (main)
determining factor in guiding the social decision on the implementation of a project. In
accord with this “democratic presumption” in CBA, only individual preferences should
count in any collective decision-making. The essential theoretical foundations of CBA
are that beneﬁts are deﬁned as increases in welfare and costs are deﬁned as reductions
in welfare. For a project or policy to qualify on cost–beneﬁt grounds, the social beneﬁts
it produces must exceed the accompanying social costs. We now make the link between
projects and social welfare explicit, and then consider methods of calculating whether
a project increases welfare.

Chapter 25: Cost–Beneﬁt Analysis
25.7.1
Social Welfare Evaluation
Cost–beneﬁt analysis seeks to determine which projects make society better off. These
projects can be identiﬁed by the fact that social welfare will increase if they are im-
plemented. This section identiﬁes what this means in the abstract and then proceeds to
examine how the direction of welfare change can be determined.
The general form of Bergson–Samuelson social welfare function can be written as
W(x) = W(U1(x1), U2(x2), . . . , UH(xH)),
(25.18)
where x =

x1, x2, . . . , xn
denote the consumption levels of both tangible and in-
tangible goods of individuals h = 1, 2, . . . , H, and Uh(xh) the resulting utility level
of individual h. Social welfare is assumed to be increasing and concave in individual
utility levels. Consider a project that, if it is implemented, will change the individual
consumption levels to x +  =

x1 + 1, x2 + 2, . . . , xH + H
. The new levels
of consumption produce social welfare
W(x + ) = W(U1(x1 + 1), U2(x2 + 2), . . . , UH(xH + H)).
(25.19)
For a given social welfare function, we can conclude that the project increases social
welfare if W(x + ) > W(x). If it does, then the project should be implemented. The
interesting issue is how to proceed if we do not know the social welfare function. More
speciﬁcally, when will a project increase welfare for every social welfare function?
This is an important question to ask, since CBA can be a considerably more powerful
tool when its recommendations are independent of the form of social welfare function.
A ﬁrst step is to apply the Pareto criterion to project evaluation. The criterion states
that social welfare will increase if nobody is worse off after the project is implemented
and at least some people are strictly better off. This occurs when Uh(xh + h) ≥
Uh(xh) for all h and Uh(xh + h) > Uh(xh) for at least one h. Clearly, if a project
beneﬁts everyone, then the Pareto criterion can be applied to conﬁrm that the project
will increase any social welfare function. The fundamental difﬁculty with this social
welfare evaluation occurs when there are losers (Uh(xh +h) < Uh(xh)) and gainers
(Uh(xh + h) > Uh(xh)) from the project. Whether or not the gains offset the losses
will then depend on the social welfare function. In fact, if there are some gainers and
some losers, it will always be possible to ﬁnd one social welfare function for which the
project increases welfare and an alternative social welfare function for which it reduces
welfare. This makes it clear that CBA can only provide an evaluation of projects in
such cases if it is adopts a method to trade off utility gains against utility losses.

to employ the compensation tests proposed independently by Kaldor (1939) and Hicks
(1939). These compensation tests are based on the idea that a project raises welfare if
the gainers are able to compensate the losers and still remain better off than without
the project. Consider the project introduced previously that changed the consumption
levels in the economy from

x1, x2, . . . , xH
to

x1 + 1, x2 + 2, . . . , xH + H
.
According to the Kaldor compensation principle, the project is desirable if it is hypo-
thetically possible to redistribute income (and hence consumption) so that everyone is
made better off with the project. This requires the gainers to compensate the losers.
Alternatively, according to Hicks’s compensation principle, the project is desirable if
it is not possible for the losers from the project to bribe the gainers to forgo the project.
Formally, consider the individual consumption bundle

xh, yh
, where yh disting-
uishes a numéraire good that is to be used for compensation. Suppose that the
individual utility functions are quasi-linear with respect to the numéraire good, so
that Uh(xh, yh) = v(xh) + yh. Deﬁne the set of compensation transfers as T =

(t1, . . . , tH)
(((
	H
h=1 th ≤0

. The two tests can then be stated:
Kaldor’s test
Can the gainers compensate the losers after the project is implemented?
This test implies the project is desirable if there exist transfers (t1, . . . , tH) ∈T such
that Uh(xh + h, yh + th) > Uh(xh, yh) for all h = 1, . . . , H.
Hicks’s test
Can the losers compensate the gainers to forgo the project?
Under this test, the project is desirable if there do not exist transfers (t1, . . . , tH) ∈T
such that Uh(xh, yh + th) > Uh(xh + h, yh) for all h = 1, . . . , H.
It is possible to combine these two tests. Doing so gives the Scitovsky test.
Scitovsky’s test
The project is desirable if both the Kaldor and Hicks tests are
satisﬁed.
The compensation tests demand those who gain to sufﬁciently compensate those
who lose so that they will accept the project or, alternatively, those who lose to bribe
those who gain so that they forgo the project. Both compensation tests are based on the
hypothesis that efﬁciency can be treated separately from the question of distribution.
This is because the tests treat all gains and loses identically, regardless of whom they
accrue to.

879
Chapter 25: Cost–Beneﬁt Analysis
The problem with these tests is the possibility of reversal: it is possible for a project
to pass the test, and then the opposite of the project (a move back to the original point)
to also pass the test. To illustrate this point, compare an existing state A with a new
state B that can be achieved after implementation of a project. The existing state A
generates the distribution of welfare between consumers 1 and 2 as represented in ﬁgure
25.4 by point A0 on the associated utility possibility frontier. Now consider state B
with a new distribution of welfare between the consumers represented by B0 on the
new utility possibility frontier. Clearly, implementing the project and moving from A0
to B0 makes consumer 2 better off and consumer 1 worse off, so it is not a Pareto
improvement. However, it is possible to compensate consumer 1 so as to reach point
B1 with the new project, at which point both consumers are better off and the project
will pass the compensation test. Note that we only need to verify that consumer 2 can
compensate consumer 1 to pass the test. Consumer 2 does not actually have to make
the transfer. The problem of reversal follows from observing that a move back to the
original state A will also pass the compensation test. To see this, consider moving back
to state A with compensation to move along the utility possibility curve from A0 to
A1. Again, both consumers will then prefer A1 to B0. So the reverse of the project will
also pass the test after the project is implemented. The fact that there can be cycles is
also called the Scitovsky reversal paradox. This reversal arises because the test is based
on the hypothetical allocations A1 and B1 achieved after compensation whereas only
allocations A0 and B0 are actually achievable.

Part IX: Applications
An alternative to the compensation tests is to obtain a value of the project from each
person that it affects. The value will be positive if the person gains from the project
but negative if they lose. Such values can be related to the concepts of compensating
variation and equivalent variation.
Using the same notation as above, let the consumption bundle of individual h
be

xh, yh
, where yh is the numéraire good, and assume utility is quasi-linear
Uh(xh, yh) = v(xh) + yh. Consider a project that changes the consumption levels
from

xh
0 , yh
0

to

xh
1 , yh
1

with respective utility levels Uh
0 and Uh
1 . The compensating
variation measures how much must be given to a person to compensate them for the
project being implemented. The compensating variation is deﬁned as
CVh((xh
0 , yh
0 ), (xh
1 , yh
1 )) = yh
1 −yh, Uh(xh
1 , yh) = Uh
0 .
(25.20)
Hence a project that raises utility must be compensated by a reduction in the consump-
tion of the numéraire good to maintain utility unchanged, so that CVh = yh
1 −yh > 0.
That is, a good project (xh
1 > xh
0 ) has a positive compensating variation. The com-
pensating variation is the willingness to pay (WTP) for the project. The equivalent
variation measures how much must be given to a person to forgo the project. The
equivalent variation is deﬁned as
EVh((xh
0 , yh
0 ), (xh
1 , yh
1 )) = yh −yh
0 ,
Uh(xh
0 , yh) = Uh
1 .
(25.21)
Hence a project that raises utility is equivalent to increasing the consumption of
numéraire good, so that EVh = yh −yh
0 > 0. That is, a good project (xh
1 > xh
0 ) has
a positive equivalent variation. The equivalent variation is the willingness to accept
(WTA) the project.
Note the difference between our deﬁnition of compensating variation over consump-
tion changes, and the more standard deﬁnition of compensating variation over price
changes. Indeed the compensating variation of a price change is deﬁned as CV =
E(p1, U0) −E(p0, U0), where the expenditure function E(p, U) is the minimal ex-
penditure at given prices p to reach the utility level U0. Thus the CV of a price change
from p0 to p1 is positive if this price change raises the cost of obtaining utility U0. So
a bad outcome (p1 > p0) has a positive CV. Similarly the equivalent variation of a
price change is deﬁned as EV = E(p1, U1) −E(p0, U1), which is again positive for
a bad outcome, p1 > p0. It is the income that can be taken off the person to give U1 at
initial prices p0.

881
Chapter 25: Cost–Beneﬁt Analysis
The notions of WTP and WTA are ﬁrmly grounded in the theory of welfare eco-
nomics and correspond to notions of compensating and equivalent variations. WTP
and WTA should not, according to theory, diverge very much. In practice, they appear
to diverge, often substantially, with WTA > WTP. Hence the choice of WTP or WTA
may be of importance when conducting a CBA. The difference between the WTP and
WTA can be highlighted by using these deﬁnitions to express the compensation tests as
follows:
Compensation tests
The Kaldor test is positive if and only if 	n
i=1 CVi > 0, and the
Hicks test is positive if and only if 	n
i=1 EVi > 0.
This is as far as we can proceed using this direct approach of welfare valuation
unless we specify a particular social welfare function. To do so, it is necessary to be
explicit about how society forms social preferences. “Society” is simply the sum of
individuals, so social welfare is obtained by aggregation of individual welfare. There
are two alternative philosophies for undertaking the aggregation of beneﬁts across
different social groups or nations. These philosophies imply very different approaches
to the calculation of welfare change.
The ﬁrst philosophy is that all beneﬁts and costs should be treated the same way.
Aggregation then involves simply summing the willingness to pay for beneﬁts, or
willingness to accept compensation for losses, regardless of the circumstances of the
beneﬁciaries or losers. This is precisely what we did with the WTP and WTA above. The
implication is that the evaluation of the project has been turned into a comparison that
involves a numéraire good. This numéraire can be thought of as money. That money is
given the same value for all people is to claim that “a dollar is a dollar” whoever receives
it or pays it. The validity of this claim has been widely debated. Using a welfare function
assumes that individuals have different marginal utilities of income and different social
welfare weights (unless the optimal distribution of welfare is reached). Then, by the
assumption of quasi-linearity, everyone is assigned the same marginal utility, and the
differences in social welfare weights are ignored in the compensation tests.
The second philosophy for aggregation requires that higher weights be given to
beneﬁts and costs accruing to disadvantaged or low-income groups. One rationale for
this second form is that marginal utilities of income will vary, by being higher for the
low-income groups. If this is accepted, the approach we have outlined in this section
cannot be applied. The next sections investigate what can be done.

25.7.2
Distributive Weights
We have previously noted that social welfare should be based on individual preferences.
Itisabasicrequirementofdemocracythatindividualpreferencesshouldcountforsocial
decisions. A second key requirement in social decision rules is that those individual
preferences should be weighted to reﬂect the existing distribution of income when
the distribution is not socially optimal. If a society cares about equity, then the social
decision rule will give more weight to the preferences of those with low incomes. When
undertaking CBA, the important issue of equity, or the distributional incidence of costs
and beneﬁts, should not be overlooked. Incorporating distributional concerns implies
initially identifying, and then possibly weighting, the costs and beneﬁts of individuals
and groups on the basis of differences in some characteristic of interest (e.g., income
or wealth).
Consider the following simple setting. Denote the (ordinary) demand function of in-
dividual h by xh = xh 
p, mh
, where p are the market prices of goods (identical for all
individuals) and mh is the income of h. This demand function can be substituted into the
utility function to obtain the indirect utility function (maximum utility level attainable
given income and price levels). Denote the indirect utility function for individual h as
V h(p, mh). Consider a project as equivalent to a policy change with marginal impact on
incomes and prices (dp, dmh). Then the welfare change of the project for individual h is
dVh = ∂V h
∂mh dmh + ∂V h
∂p dp,
(25.22)
where ∂V h
∂mh is the marginal utility of income of individual h. Dividing the utility change
by the marginal utility of income gives the willingness to pay for the project for
individual h:
WTPh = dmh + ∂V h/∂p
∂V h/∂mh .
(25.23)
The willingness to pay is the compensating variation, and the willingness to accept
is the equivalent variation. Both welfare evaluations of the policy change are the same
when the project is marginal (so CV = EV = WTP = WTA).
Now, to evaluate the social welfare change resulting from the project, consider a
general social welfare function W(V 1, . . . , V n). Then the social welfare change of the
project is

βhWTPh,
(25.24)
where βh = ∂W

∂V h
∂mi is the social marginal utility of income for individual h. Hence the
social welfare change of the project is the weighted sum of the individual willingness
to pay for the project where the weights are the the social marginal values of income for
different individuals. This is Meade’s formula for CBA. It follows that projects with
a change of allocation that favors individuals with greater social marginal value may
improve social welfare even if the total willingness to pay for the project is negative!
How is it possible to compute those social weights in practice? The common practice
is to adopt the function βh = K

mh−ε used in chapter 15 (see equation 15.28) where
the parameter ε > 1 represents the social aversion to inequality.
25.7.3
Market Prices and Shadow Prices
Cost–beneﬁt analysis is built on the assumption that the monetary valuation of a project
reﬂects the welfare consequences. In more formal terms, what we require is that the
implementation of a project with a positive NPV will increase social welfare, and that
any project that would raise social welfare has a positive NPV.
To explain what is involved, it is necessary to distinguish between two different
aspects of a project. The ﬁrst aspect is the real effects that the project will have. These
real effects are measured in terms of a change in quantities. For example, for a ﬂood
defense scheme the change in quantities would include the labor and materials that are
used, and the property that goes undamaged because of a successful defense. In formal
terms the change in quantities are the values  that enter (25.19). The second aspect is
the social value of these changes. We have so far considered the process of aggregating
individual values to ﬁnd social values. We now consider an alternative approach. This
approach uses prices to obtain a value for the quantity changes. If both quantity changes
and the prices are known, then multiplying the two will give the cost and beneﬁt values
to be inserted into the NPV equation.
As a starting point for our formal development of cost–beneﬁt analysis, we will
assume that we know the change in quantities that will arise due to the project. This is
helpful but not always realistic. The next chapter will discuss climate change, which is
the primary example of where we do not know with any degree of certainty what the
effects of alternative projects will be. Accepting this assumption for the present, what
remainstobedeterminedarethepricesthatshouldbeusedtovaluethequantitychanges.

884
Part IX: Applications
The natural solution is to use observed market prices. There are two problems that
arise immediately with this proposal. First, we have already observed that there may be
nonmarket goods, such as environmental quality, that do not have observable market
prices. We acknowledge this problem but assume that it can be resolved using the meth-
ods we have discussed earlier. The second problem is based on the role that we wish
prices to play. For the NPV to correspond to the change in welfare requires that the
prices used in the valuation capture social valuations. There are circumstances where
market prices have this property, as we now demonstrate, but this is not always the case.
Therelationshipbetweenmarketpricesandsocialvaluescanbeexploredbyreturning
to the competitive economy of chapter 2. The Two Theorems of Welfare Economics can
be summarized as saying that in the absence of market failure a competitive economy
is Pareto-efﬁcient, and that any Pareto-efﬁcient allocation can be decentralized as a
competitive equilibrium. Furthermore it was shown in chapter 13 that the application
of the decentralization invoked by the Second Theorem allowed the social optimum to
be obtained. The implications of these statements for CBA are now investigated in a
two-consumer, two-good economy.

(25.28)

885
Chapter 25: Cost–Beneﬁt Analysis
The equality in (25.28) is key to demonstrating that CBA can use market prices in this
setting.
Cancel pi from both sides of (25.28), and recall the deﬁnition of the marginal social
utility of income for h, βh ≡∂W
∂Uh αh; see (15.26). The equality in (25.28) shows that
β1 = β2 = β.
(25.29)
Hence, the marginal social utilities of income are equalized at the social optimum.
This equality implies the following observation: assume that the economy suddenly
discovers an extra amount dxi of good i (where this is meant to be interpreted as a very
small increase in the total quantity). The increase in social welfare if this is allocated
to consumer h is
∂W
∂Uh
∂Uh
∂xh
i
dxi = βpidxi,
(25.30)
which is the same for both consumers at the social optimum. The two features of the
social optimum (Pareto-efﬁciency and optimal distribution) combine to ensure that the
increase in social welfare will be the same regardless of how this extra unit is allocated
among the consumers.
The formal concept of a project is now introduced. For the purpose of the analysis
it is assumed that a project is “small,”so that it is appropriate to work with derivatives.
In practical applications of CBA many projects really are small when compared to the
economy as a whole. Some are clearly not, and the arguments have to be modiﬁed ac-
cordingly. Aproject is a change in the supply of the two commodities dx = (dx1, dx2).
For example, the project dx = (2, −3) would represent 3 units of good 2 being used as
inputs to produce an additional 2 units of good 1. Let the change in consumption levels
for h because of the project be


(25.32)
The project will raise welfare if

886
Part IX: Applications
dW = β [p1dx1 + p2dx2] > 0.
(25.33)
Since β > 0, (25.33) shows that dW > 0 if
NPV = p1dx1 + p2dx2 > 0
(25.34)
So the project has positive value at market prices. This is the central conclusion of the
analysis: at the social optimum the implementation of a project that has a positive NPV
computed using market prices will increase welfare.
Two points need to be made about this claim. First, the correspondence between NPV
and social welfare arises only because the correct prices have been used in the valuation.
In this case market prices could be used because we assumed a social optimum with
the optimal distribution of income and with no market failure. The correspondence
between NPV and social welfare will apply in other cases but only if the valuation is
conducted using the appropriate prices. We shortly explore this question in more detail.
Second, the fact that the distribution of the costs and beneﬁts of the project across
people does not matter needs closer inspection. The correct conclusion is that the alloca-
tion does not matter when the appropriate prices are used in the valuation. However,
the process of allocation will determine what those price are.
To explore the role of the allocation process in more detail, it is helpful to look again
at the analysis. The argument above required both the Pareto-efﬁciency of equilibrium
and the socially optimal distribution of income. So Pareto-efﬁciency alone is not enough
to ensure that market prices are used directly in a cost–beneﬁt analysis. If there is not
a socially optimal distribution of income, then the effect on social welfare of an extra
unit of the commodity will depend on who it is allocated to (the division of the costs
and beneﬁts of the project between people). When these assumptions do not hold—
and given their severity they are unlikely to do so—it is necessary to use what are
called shadow prices to calculate the NPV. Shadow prices have the property that they
represent the social value of a change in quantities. They can sometimes be equal to
market prices, but in most situations they are different. The key point is that when
shadow prices are used in a CBA calculation, the implementation of a project with a
positive NPV will necessarily raise welfare. As we will show, this correspondence is
achieved by directly linking the deﬁnition of shadow prices to an increase in welfare.
Deﬁnition
A set of shadow prices are such that any project with a positive NPV will
raise social welfare if it is implemented. Conversely, any project that will raise welfare
if implemented will have a positive NPV when evaluated using shadow prices.

887
Chapter 25: Cost–Beneﬁt Analysis
The process for obtaining the shadow prices can be explained by studying the welfare
effects of implementing a project. The setting for this is an economy with production.
The government chooses policies to maximize welfare. The demands for the private
sector are represented by an excess demand function; see (2.10). The level of excess
demand depends on the policy of the government, the distribution of the initial en-
dowment, and the resource allocation process. It is now demonstrated how the shadow
prices emerge naturally from the optimal choice of policy by the government.
Let s = (s1, . . . , sK) be the policy variables of government, z = (z1, . . . , zn) be
government net supplies of the n commodities, and ω = (ω1, . . . , ωn) be the initial
endowmentofcommodities. ThelevelofwelfareisafunctionW(s; ω)thatisdependent
on policy and endowment. There are H households and m ﬁrms. Let the excess demand
from the private sector for good i be Zi(s; ω), so that

where xi denotes the demand and yi the supply of good i. Equilibrium requires that
private excess demand minus government net supply be zero:
Zi(s; ω) −zi = 0.
(25.36)
The Lagrangian for the optimal choice of policy is

(25.37)

differentiation of the Lagrangian evaluated at the optimal policy gives
∂L (s∗; ω, z)
∂zi
= υi.
(25.39)

888
Part IX: Applications
The envelope theorem states that the effect on the Lagrangian of a change in z is the
same as the effect on maximum value, so that
∂W ∗(s∗; ω, z)
∂zi
= υi.
(25.40)
This produces the conclusion we require. If the shadow price is taken to be the Lagrange
multiplier on the resource constraint, then it follows that the price captures the welfare
effect of a marginal increase in government supply of good i.
This can be seen by observing that the NPV of a project dz at these shadow prices
is given by
V =

i=1
υidzi =

i=1
∂W ∗(s∗; ω, z)

(25.41)
The NPV is therefore just the total derivative of the welfare function, so there is a direct
correspondence between the two. By contrasting (25.33) and (25.41), we can see that
the shadow prices for the social optimum case are actually υi = βpi. The market prices
work as the shadow prices in this case because the constant of proportionality, β, is the
same for both goods.
The practical application of cost–beneﬁt analysis develops the insights of this general
theory into detailed conclusions for particular cases. The analysis of each of these cases
follows the logic that has been applied in this example. A project for the government
is a change in its net supply vector. The policy variables, s, are changed optimally to
match the new net supply. These two effects determine the new equilibrium allocation
via the operation of the market. The shadow prices, and the ultimate effect on welfare,
therefore depends on both the project and the policy variables that the government has
under its control. For example, a project implemented by a government that is able to
target the output of the project directly at some consumers (through a beneﬁt-in-kind
which is means tested) will have a different welfare effect than a project where the
output is placed on the open market. So policy is interlinked with shadow prices. The
key point is that available policies are interlinked with shadow prices.
There is one ﬁnal point to observe. The model that has just been described can be
given an intertemporal interpretation. This can be achieved by dating the commodities
(as discussed in chapter 2) and treating the individual utility functions as describing
intertemporal preferences. The shadow prices will then capture social preferences over
consumption at different points in time. Conceptually this is straightforward. In practice
it raises a number of issues as were discussed in section 25.6.

Conclusions
CBA is an evaluation procedure ﬁrmly grounded on solid theoretical foundations of
welfare economics. However, actual decisions may in practice be made on a very
different basis from this analytical approach. The reasons lie in the role played by
political forces rather than the social welfare functions of economics. First, there is
widespread distrust of, or disbelief in, measurement in monetary terms concerning
social costs and beneﬁts of different projects and policies. Second, there is the capture
of political processes by individuals not trained in economics. Third, there is the belief
that economics is equivalent to common sense and easily understood. Fourth, there is
a genuine mistrust of CBA and its theoretical foundations based on the debates that
continue within the CBA community and outside it. But explaining the gap between
actual and theoretical design is not an excuse to justify the gap. Economists need to
develop a far better understanding of the pressures that affect actual decisions and the
distributional impacts of the project for the many different stakeholders. But those who
make actual decisions perhaps also need a far better understanding of economics, and
it was the purpose of this chapter (as well as the rest of the textbook) to provide the
basic theory underlying public policies and their impact on social welfare.

Consider a project that costs $5 million and involves building a dam and canal to provide
water to irrigate desert land that has no other use. If irrigated, the land will be used to grow
cucumbers. Suppose that the demand function for cucumbers is known to be
q = 18 −0.1p,
where q is in units of millions of pounds per year and p is the price of cucumbers in cents per
pound. Suppose that the project produces 0.5 million pounds of cucumbers per year. Without
the project, the quantity of cucumbers available is 6 million pounds per year. With the project
the quantity is 6.5 million pounds per year.
Suppose that the only input required to produce cucumbers, besides the the land and wa-
ter, which have no opportunity cost, is labor, and each 10,000 pounds of cucumbers requires
1 person-year of labor. This means the project’s 0.5 million pounds of cucumbers require
50 person-years of labor. Suppose also that the supply function for labor in the area of the
project is
L = −20, 000 + 4w,
where L is person-years of labor supplied and w is the wage rate in dollars per person-years.
Without the project, the amount of labor utilized is 2,000 person-years. With the project, the
labor demand is 2,500 person-years.

b. What is the net beneﬁt of the project?

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is conducting a study on the efﬁciency of its
expenditures on environmental protection programs. You have been hired to work on the
analysis with the aim of deciding if money should be reallocated among the programs. You
are presented with the following information:
i.
$20 million is spent to reduce airborne particulates. This is estimated to save 2 people
from death and 1,000 from illness during periods with very low wind speeds; once wind
speeds increase, the particulates are dispersed with no lasting effects. Those affected are
primarily those with preexisting breathing problems and can be of any age.
ii.
$40 million is spent to reduce the exposure of children to radiation in schools. This is
estimated to prevent 20 children per year from developing cancers when they are middle-
aged. Then 40 percent of the cancer cases will be fatal; the remainder survive as normal after
treatment.
iii. $10 million is spent to reduce hormones levels in beef. This is estimated to save 20 people
from death and 1,000 from other complications. 60 percent of those affected are children.
iv. $4 million is spent to discourage people from jaywalking. This is expected to save 100
people from death and 200 from other serious injuries each year. There is no particular relation
between jaywalking and age.
a. If the value of a statistical life (V SL) is $3 million, and the value of avoiding a serious
injury or illness is $50,000, which of the programs has positive net beneﬁts?
b. Which program maximizes the saving of lives per dollar of expenditure?
c. Assume that the value assigned to serious injury or illness reﬂects quality-adjusted life
years (QALY). Which program saves the most QALYs?
d. What recommendation would you make on the reallocation of funding among these
programs?

In cost–beneﬁt analysis, we normally consider market prices as being good measures of

an approximate measure of a cost or beneﬁt. Explain why. Under what condition is such

Is this a realistic value for beneﬁts?
b. Assume that each visitor obtains beneﬁts of $50 from the center. Is it socially beneﬁcial
for the center to lay on an entertainment program that raises visitor numbers to 150,000 per

Economics of Climate Policy
26.1
Introduction
Climate change caused by human activity is possibly the most critical threat that the
world economy has ever faced. The continued accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO2)
and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is predicted to cause a signiﬁcant increase
in global temperatures and disruption to weather patterns worldwide. Rising temper-
atures will melt polar ice caps and low-lying areas will be ﬂooded due to rising sea
levels. Changing rainfall and snow patterns will cause widespread drought, particularly
in important agricultural regions. The shortage of food and water will lead to major
displacements of populations and civil unrest. Extreme weather events will become
more common and lead to frequent extensive damage to property and signiﬁcant loss
of life. The enormity of these effects has lead to calls for decisive and immediate action
to reduce emissions of CO2.
Not everyone agrees that all of these effects will occur. The scientiﬁc consensus is
that temperatures will rise and lead to damaging changes in weather patterns. Within
the consensus there is a range of opinion on precisely how strong the effects will be
and what level of policy response is required. The potential scale of the effects of
climate change does not necessarily imply that major sacriﬁces should be made now to
combat climate change. An economic analysis of climate policy should be based on the
same methods applied to other policy questions. The appropriate analytical tool is the
cost–beneﬁt analysis (CBA) we developed in chapter 25 and, in particular, the trade-off
between the cost of changing behavior now against the beneﬁts that will accrue in the
future. The issues involved in climate policy—notably the degree of uncertainty and
the timescale—raise important questions about the application of CBA.Any evaluation
process must assess the extent to which the climate will change and the damage that this
will cause. The assessment has to be guided by scientiﬁc input from other disciplines,
and utilize economists and political scientists to determine the economic and social
costs. The science is important since the appropriate policy response to anthropogenic
(human-made) climate change is very different to the response to climate change as
part of a natural cycle.
It needs to be acknowledged that the consensus opinion on climate change is not
universally accepted. Four separate arguments have been advanced through which
the consensus is disputed. First, the accumulation of CO2 may not be anthropogenic
but instead be part of a natural cycle. The high levels of atmospheric CO2 in the

896
Part IX: Applications
distant past are cited as support for this claim: for example, in the late Ordovician
period, approximately 444 million years ago, CO2 levels were around 5,000 parts per
million (in contrast, current CO2 levels are 400 parts per million). Second, it is possible
that the increase in atmospheric CO2 will not affect climate in any signiﬁcant way. If
temperatures do not rise, then weather patterns will not change, and none of the adverse
effects of climate change will occur. This argument revolves around the level of climate
sensitivity, which is a measure of how much temperature responds to accumulation of
greenhouse gases (we discuss this in more detail below). Third, even if CO2 does affect
climate it is perfectly possible that technological advancement will rapidly mitigate
the effects. There is already signiﬁcant development of “clean” energy sources and the
beginnings of a move toward alternative power sources for road vehicles. Fourth,
the evidence for warming is directly disputed by most recent measurements that show,
contrary to the warming hypothesis, average temperature is not increasing and that
reconstructions are open to doubt.
We make no effort here to provide an opinion on any of these debates. Instead,
we emphasize only that good science requires an open mind and the willingness to
continual questioning of the evidence, no matter how much support there currently is
foraparticularposition. NoscientistshouldforgetthatthePtolemaicsystemagreedwith
observations—until those observations were reﬁned (and that Galileo was sentenced to
a lifetime of house arrest by the Inquisition for supporting the alternative heliocentric
system). Similarly Newtonian mechanics ﬁtted every known observation until relativity
andquantummechanicsrevealeditslimitationsfortheveryfastandtheverysmall. With
this in mind, the point we want to stress is that the central issue is about policy design
when there is uncertainty about causes, effects, and consequences. There is no doubt
that CO2 levels are rising. The points at issue are what is causing this rise and what the
consequences of the rise will be. The current understanding of climate science points to
the answer but is by no means deﬁnitive. For an economist the limitation of the science is
compounded with the difﬁculties of linking climate change to economic consequences.
This is not a chapter about the science of climate change. We cover the science
only to the extent necessary to reveal the issues that economic policy formulation must
confront. It is a chapter about how economics should be applied given the current state
of the science and, especially, the limitations of the economic applications. The disputes
about the science are not the issue but instead are the backdrop to the economics. One
thing is clear: the doubts about the science ensure that there is little basis for making
economic predictions with any degree of conﬁdence. Moreover it is hard to see how to
even begin to correctly model what the economic effects will be. This has not prevented
people from trying and, in some cases, even making conﬁdent announcements about

897
Chapter 26: Economics of Climate Change
the economic costs. We will review the method of modeling the attempts to quantify
the economic costs as an illustration of how economics can be applied. If this does no
more than reveal the current limitations of the economic analysis, it will at least have
revealed the true situation behind the public facade.
This chapter is an application of economic ideas from earlier chapters to climate
change. It is intended to show how the economics can be used to address signiﬁcant
questions, even if the answers are not clear-cut. We begin with a discussion of what is
special about climate change compared to other economic problems. We then progress
to a very brief review of the science and note some of the disputes about this science.
This is followed by a review of how the interaction between climate and economics
has been modeled. An insight into the form of the models is essential for assessing
the predictions of economic damage from climate change and the gains from policy
intervention. Attention then turns to the application of cost–beneﬁt analysis to climate
change and, in particular, the choice of discount rate. The chapter is completed by a
review of current policies.
26.2
Special Features
Anthropogenic climate change can be categorized as the consequence of an economic
externality, albeit a very major one. Individual consumers and ﬁrms burn fossil fuels
and consume products that have fossil fuels as inputs in their production without taking
into account the external effects of these activities. Each individual contribution may
be small and inconsequential, but in aggregate they have a substantial effect. The
discussion of chapter 8 demonstrated that externality problems can be solved by using
either Pigouvian taxes or quantity controls. This section explores what is special about
climate change that justiﬁes an analysis beyond the application of these familiar policy
solutions.
Four features of climate change can be identiﬁed that distinguish it from other
externalities:
1. The problem is literally global in nature, so that an individual government can do
little to affect the process.
2. There is considerable uncertainty about the cause, the degree, the effects, and the
consequences of climate change.
3. The uncertainty about climate change feeds into even greater uncertainty about the
economic damage it will cause and the potential beneﬁts of policy intervention.
4. The process of climate change and the time scale of effects may be very long.

898
Part IX: Applications
Each of these points is now discussed in more detail.
The emission of greenhouse gases anywhere in the world adds to the stock that is
accumulated in the atmosphere, and dissipation of the gases throughout the atmosphere
ensures that local emissions have a global effect. Unilateral action by the European
Union, United Statets, and China could have a noticeable impact on the reduction
accumulation, but a reduction of emissions by most other countries will have a negligi-
ble effect. This makes international coordination necessary for any effective response.
The difﬁculties involved in achieving international agreements are readily illustrated.
The 1997 Kyoto Protocol was signed and ratiﬁed by 191 countries, of which 37 agreed
to reduce their collective emissions of the Kyoto gases by 5 percent from the 1990 level.
Signiﬁcantly, the largest single emitter of greenhouse gases—the United States—signed
the Kyoto Protocol but did not ratify it, so was not bound by the commitment to re-
duce emissions. The Copenhagen Accord of 2009 was expected to produce a more
rigorous successor to the Kyoto Protocol. The draft accord produced by the European
Union promised signiﬁcant reductions in emissions, but this was not accepted. The
Copenhagen Accord was ultimately drafted by the United States in agreement with the
BASIC countries (Brazil, South Africa, India, and China). It is not legally binding, nor
does it commit countries to agree to a binding successor to the Kyoto Protocol. Effec-
tively, the European Union was politically sidelined by China and the United States in
negotiations.
It is helpful to think of the emission reduction process as a prisoner’s dilemma.
If a country undertakes unilateral action to reduce emissions, it may beneﬁt a little
from the reduction in emissions but is likely to lose more due to the responses of
ﬁrms and consumers to the policy. Consider, for example, a country that is securing
a reduction in emissions by imposing a carbon tax on its domestic industries. This
will cause a loss of international competitiveness and give an incentive to ﬁrms to
relocate in other countries. These reactions impose costs that will almost certainly
outweigh the beneﬁt of a reduction in emissions. As a consequence unilateral action
to cut emissions is not privately rational. In contrast, collective action by all countries
can be socially rational. If a carbon tax is introduced by every country, then there
is no incentive for the relocation of production. The countries can then receive the
beneﬁts of cutting emissions without the additional costs. The problem in a prisoner’s
dilemma is sustaining the collective action: it will always be privately rational for a
country to renege on the collective policy and to abandon the carbon tax. A country
will gain directly when other countries cut emissions, and make a further indirect gain
from an increase in international competitiveness. The reason for the United States not
ratifying Kyoto, and the differences between Kyoto (which was a binding commitment)

899
Chapter 26: Economics of Climate Change
and Copenhagen (which was not), are obvious when set with in the framework of a
prisoners’ dilemma.
There is inarguably considerable uncertainty in predictions of future climate change
even if the level of greenhouse gases is taken as known. In section 26.3.3 we report on
attempts to quantify this uncertainty, but it should be stressed that all such estimates
should be treated cautiously. Climate is determined by a complex system, including a
range of components such as rainfall patterns, snow patterns, winds, solar energy, and
cloud patterns. All these elements interact to determine climate. Furthermore climate
predictions are forecasts for events that are outside previous experience. In economics
this is called “out-of-sample” prediction. No matter how well a forecasting model may
perform within the sample of observations, there is no guarantee that it will remain
successful out of sample. It should also be noted that numerical weather prediction
has developed only since 1950 which makes it a recent science. One contribution of
numerical weather prediction has been the contention that weather is chaotic (in the
formal sense of being sensitive to initial conditions). If so, weather necessarily becomes
less predictable further into the future. Climate prediction may not suffer from precisely
the same issues, but nonetheless, it remains a largely unsubstantiated science. Hence
there is considerable uncertainty in translating temperature changes into climate effects.
This uncertainty is important for the economic analysis of climate policy. Section
8.6 analyzed the difference between prices and quantities as policy instruments when
the outcome is uncertain. To apply that analysis, it is necessary to know how the
marginal cost and marginal beneﬁt curves are related to the uncertain variables. For
example, if the cost of abatement is uncertain, then the curves need to be known for each
possible value of abatement cost. It is also necessary to know the probability of different
realizations of the uncertain variable. These are demanding requirements. Normally,
we would accommodate the uncertainty by basing policy analysis on expected utility
theory, but this requires knowledge of probabilities. With climate change the situation
is more difﬁcult because policy has to be chosen when even this information is not
known: it is not even obvious that it is currently possible to say what future events
might occur. This negates any possibility that we can assign probabilities to the events.
From this perspective, the policy design is being done without beneﬁt of applicable
theory.
If there is to be an economic policy toward climate change, then it must be justiﬁed
on the basis of beneﬁts and costs. The uncertainties surrounding the effects of climate
change make it exceptionally difﬁcult to construct convincing estimate of the costs of
not making any attempt at mitigation (and equally of the beneﬁts of mitigation). In
fact, even if there were a perfect way to forecast climate change, there would still be

900
Part IX: Applications
exceptional difﬁculty in translating the effect on economic activity. It has been argued
that the potential costs of climate change are so large that serious action is necessary
even if the estimates later prove to have been exaggerated. This is a bad basis for a
policy. Over reaching policy is not applied in any other area and would lead to absurd
outcomes if it were. This does not mean we cannot or should not try to formulate policy,
but it does mean that the uncertainties have to be part of the policy formulation process.
We will describe below how these costs have been represented in economic models
involving climate change. It will become clear that climate change is an area in which
further development of technique is critically needed.
The effects of climate change are long term, so many future generations may be af-
fected. This raises the question of how decisions made in the present can accommodate
the interests of people who are not yet alive. Expressed differently, it is necessary to
consider what right those currently alive have to inﬂict costs upon those who follow
by not acting on climate change. The standard approach of cost–beneﬁt analysis is to
deﬁne a set of intertemporal preferences in which future utility ﬂows are discounted. If
this process is applied to long-term climate change the discounting effectively disen-
franchises future generations. This has lead to a re-assessment of what is appropriate
discounting in the context of climate change.
26.3
The Science of Global Warming
It is not possible to adequately address climate change, or to understand the issues
involved, without having some knowledge of the science involved. This section brieﬂy
reviews the science and presents a summary of the evidence that is used by the Interna-
tional Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to inform its conclusions. Some of the issues
concerning this evidence are then addressed. The section is completed by a review of
some predictions of temperature increases, but with a stress on their uncertainty as is
central to policy design questions.
26.3.1
Greenhouse Gases and Temperatures
The atmosphere is more permeable to incoming solar radiation than the outgoing in-
frared, which traps heat within the atmosphere. This process is illustrated in ﬁgure 26.1.
The amount of heat that is trapped depends on the composition of the atmosphere. There
are some atmospheric molecules that trap heat—these are called the greenhouse gases.
The basis of concerns about global warming is that human activity is increasing the
concentration of greenhouse gases and so will lead to increased global temperatures.

Seven classes of greenhouse gases that accumulate in the atmosphere have been
identiﬁed. These are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (NO), per-
ﬂuorocarbons (PFCs), hydroﬂuorocarbons (HFCs), sulphur hexaﬂouride (SF6), and
chloroﬂuorocarbon (CFCs). The ﬁrst six of these are regulated under the Kyoto Pro-
tocol so are known as the Kyoto gases. The emission of CFCs is regulated separately
under the 1989 Montreal Protocol. To allow easy comparisons, the quantities of the
gases are converted into a CO2 equivalent (CO2e). The equivalence is deﬁned by the
mixture of gases having the same degree of radiative forcing—the extent to which they
affect the balance between incoming and outgoing solar radiation—as the equivalent
amount of CO2. The quantity is then measured as the proportion of CO2e in the air and
expressed in parts per million (ppm) where
ppm = 1, 000, 000Mass of CO2e
Mass of air .
(26.1)
Figure 26.2 displays the quantity of greenhouse gases in CO2e from years 1750 to
2008. A sustained increase can be observed in the amount of CO2 and other green-
house gases. The pre-industrial level (taken as that in 1750) was 278 ppm. Since the
midnineteenth century atmospheric concentrations have grown from 290 ppm to about
470 ppm. This increase is attributed to human activities such as burning fossil fuels
and deforestation. Over the past decade concentrations have been growing at about 2.5
ppm a year. Forecasts prepared for the IPCC suggest that the concentration will rise
to over 600 ppm by the middle of this century and up to 900 ppm by the end of the
century.

Figure 26.3 shows data on measured global average temperatures for the period
1850 to 2011. The ﬁgure plots the annual difference of average near-surface temper-
atures from the average level in the period 1961 to 1990. The temperature data are
obtained from measurements of air temperature at a global network of land stations
and sea-surface temperatures measured from ships and buoys. The ﬁgure displays two
periods of warming: 1920 to 1940 and from the mid-1970s through to 2000. It is not
possible to determine whether temperatures are still increasing because short-term ﬂuc-
tuations conceal the long-term trend in the data from 2000 onward. However, on the
basis of this evidence it has been claimed that temperatures are rising at 0.2oC per
decade.
Figure 26.4 shows a plot of the difference from the normal level in the period 1961
to 1990 from 800 through to 2000 based on a reconstruction of temperature data.
This plot is reproduced from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Third
Assessment Report. It was very prominent in that report, since it shows relatively
constant temperatures in the pre-industrial period but a rapid, unprecedented rise since
1900 to current levels. The ﬁgure subsequently generated considerable controversy.
The basis for the controversy is the fact that the ﬁgure was reconstructed from proxies
(tree rings, corals, ice cores). There are serious scientiﬁc questions over whether the
method of reconstruction is statistically valid. Credible arguments have been given that
it is not, and that the ﬁgure is an artifact of the method used to construct it.

Controversies
There have been many objections to the science and the data that were just described. We
choose to focus primarily on the temperature data since this has attracted the attention
of economists. This is not surprising given the importance of the interpretation and
analysis of data in economics.
The one nonstatistical controversy we note concerns the list of greenhouse gases. It
is frequently argued that water vapor should be included because it has a substantial
greenhouse effect. Clouds are particularly responsible for trapping heat (a cloudy night
can be much warmer than a clear night) and so could have a large role in global heating.
One reason why water vapor is not included is because the human contribution cannot
be measured or distinguished from natural processes, and is probably negligible. But,
even if this is the case, any modeling of the warming process needs to take into account
cloud formation and the interaction of water vapor with the other greenhouse gases
(GHGs). This is acknowledged to be a difﬁcult task in climate modelling.
The temperature data in ﬁgure 26.3 show a process of warming that seems to stabilize
after 2000. This occurrence can be better understood by plotting the series in more detail
for later years. Figure 26.5 plots the monthly difference from normal for the period
1998/01 to 2011/07. Inspection of the ﬁgure shows no obvious trend, and this can be
conﬁrmed statistically. Hence the data since 1998/01 shows no increase or decrease over
the period. What can be concluded from this observation? The response favorable to the
climate change hypothesis is that these data series are too short to see what is happening
in the longrun. This explanation might be acceptable if it were not for the fact that the
climate change hypothesis is built on the claim of severe warming in the 50 years from
1950 to 2000 (see ﬁgure 26.3). The 13 years in ﬁgure 26.5 are not a small sample relative
to the period in which warming is observed. Furthermore the concentration of GHGs
reported in ﬁgure 26.2 show an ever increasing rate of accumulation. If there is a direct
link between temperature and GHGs, then recent temperature increases should be even
greater than in the past. The alternative response is that global warming has ceased,
and that there is not actually any link between GHGs and temperature. In summary, the
absence of a temperature increase in the recent past raises serious questions about the
climate change hypothesis, and no adequate explanation has been proposed so far.
The additional controversies we wish to discuss involve arguments that are more
formal and technical. It might seem surprising that academics from outside the ﬁeld of
climate change can make valid criticisms. However, outsiders have access to different
tools and a different way of looking at problems, whereas those within become wedded
to their own methods. It should also not be forgotten that economics has developed its

own set of advanced statistical methods that can be applied to the data. Doing so has
revealed some of the issues involved in interpreting measurement ﬁgures.
The ﬁrst set of questions focus around whether the reported average measurements
are comparable across time. To be comparable, the measurements must be obtained
under the same conditions and the sample should remain the same. There are two
related issues. First, over time the data have been obtained from a decreasing number
of measurement stations. This introduces a measurement bias if there is any consistent
process behind the reduction in number. Second, the measurement stations that remain
in the sample may be subject to changing conditions. It has been argued that many
of the measurement stations are located in areas that have been encroached upon by
urbanization. Since urban areas tend to be warmer than rural areas in otherwise similar
locations, this will lead to an increase in measured temperature. Tests using spatial
econometrics have shown that indexes of economic development are correlated with
the temperature increases even after GHG accumulation has been taken into account.
This evidence supports the urbanization argument.
The next criticism requires the introduction of some deﬁnitions from econometrics.
Time series data are said to be stationary when the mean, variance, and other distribu-
tional characteristics do not change. The time series for a variable that is growing over
time cannot be stationary because the mean is increasing. If the ﬁrst difference (the
value at time t minus that at t −1) of a nonstationary variable is stationary, then the

906
Part IX: Applications
variable is said to be integrated of order 1. It is integrated of order 2 if the ﬁrst difference
is also nonstationary but the second difference is stationary. Because of the different
growth characteristics, there cannot be a long-term relationship between two variables
with different orders of integration. Econometric analysis has shown that temperature
is integrated of order 1 but that the accumulation of GHGs is integrated of order 2. This
prevents any stable relationship from being established between the levels of the two
variables. If there is any causal effect from GHG accumulation to temperature, these
orders of integration imply instead that the temperature will fall if the rate of increase
of GHG accumulation slows.
The major controversy has been around the hockey stick in ﬁgure 26.4. To understand
the issues, it is important to know how it was constructed. The hockey stick is actually
composed of two separate parts. The early part of the data set is reconstructed from
observations of natural phenomena. The later part of the data is taken from measure-
ments of temperatures. The issues raised about the latter have already been discussed,
so the focus is now placed on the process of temperature reconstruction.
The process of reconstruction employs numerous separate data series on natural
phenomena that are believed to be related to temperature. For example, if trees grow
faster when the temperature is higher then the width of tree rings provides a record of
temperatures. Similarly ice cores, which reveal the depth of annual snow fall, indicate
temperatures if it snows less when temperature is higher. The data series are then
subjected to a principal components analysis in which a common “factor” is extracted
from different data series that provide a common explanation for the variation in the
data. This factor is interpreted as temperature. The factor extracted is calibrated to
temperature over a period for which measurements exist, and then the remainder of the
temperature series is inferred from the calibration.
This method has the obvious problem that it is not based on direct measurement
so incorrect inference may take place. At the very least, it requires that the extracted
factor is related to temperature (it need not be) and that the physical processes do have
a monotonic relationship with temperature. Since the growth of trees is stunted both
by low temperatures and by very high temperatures the latter is particularly doubtful.
There are other problems related to the actual implementation of the method. This
aspect has been the subject of considerable public dispute since the exact data and
programs used to produce the ﬁgure have not been made public. Whether the hockey
stick is right or wrong, it is clearly a poor practice in science to not make data available
to allow thorough academic scrutiny and permit reproducibility to be checked. What
little has been revealed appears to contain errors in method and in the actual data that
undermine the validity of the exercise. A re-estimation that corrects these errors has

907
Chapter 26: Economics of Climate Change
produced a very different ﬁgure. Furthermore the method used will produce a hockey-
stick shaped ﬁgure out of any data series that increases in the ﬁnal few years. It is
probably fair to say that there is a signiﬁcant body of evidence against the hockey
stick.
26.3.3
Predictions
The data show what has happened to the level of GHGs and, subject to the criticisms
noted, to temperatures. This is helpful, but what is necessary for policy-making is
information on the future path of temperatures and the effect that this will have on
climate. This is the role of climate prediction models. The results from such models
will now be reviewed. This also requires the introduction of two further important
concepts.
The standard analysis for judging the effect of GHG accumulation is to predict the
effect of a doubling of the level of CO2e from the pre-industrial level, that is, from
278 ppm to 550 ppm CO2e. The increase in temperature that is predicted is called
climate sensitivity. The degree of climate sensitivity is central to forecasting the effects
of GHGs. If climate sensitivity is very low, then the accumulation will have little effect
on climate and little need for policy. Conversely, if climate sensitivity is high, then
GHGs will pose a serious threat and immediate policy response is critical.
The estimates of climate sensitivity from a number of different studies are shown in
ﬁgure 26.6. The curves are the probability density functions (pdfs) for the predicted
distribution of climate sensitivity. Hence the area under the curve up to a given tem-
perature is the probability of an increase equal to, or less than, that temperature. The
bars show the 5 to 95 percent conﬁdence intervals for each estimate, and the dots are
the median estimates. It can be seen that the median estimates of climate sensitivity
typically fall in the range of 2◦C to 4◦C. The presentation of the estimates using pdfs
is a reminder that there is uncertainty about the value of climate sensitivity and that
these are estimates from models. The predictions are only as good as the models that
generated them.
The second concept that is used to describe the consequences of GHG accumulation
is that of stabilization. Stabilization is achieved when the level of GHGs in the atmo-
sphere is constant. The stabilization level of GHGs if the world continues on its current
course is unknown; this is apparent from the graphs in ﬁgure 26.2, which show no sign
of reaching a peak. Equally, it is not possible to predict the extent to which policies to
reduce the emission of GHGs will lower the stabilization level. This is a source
of uncertainty for policy-making.

Estimates of climate sensitivity
Despite these limitations on knowledge, the concept of stabilization can still provide
useful information. Table 26.1 reports estimates of the predicted level of warming for
a range of stabilization levels. It is clear that as the stabilization level rises so does
the increase in temperature. Furthermore the table shows that to achieve a stabilization
level below 550 ppm, it is necessary to make signiﬁcant reductions in emissions.
The temperature that will be achieved at any stabilization level is uncertain. One way
to express this uncertainty is to consider the probability of exceeding a given increase
in temperature. Table 26.2 presents a set of such estimates. It has to be stressed that
these probabilities are generated from a climate modeling exercise, so they represents
model predictions rather than facts. The estimates describe the probability of exceeding
a particular global temperature increases at different concentration levels of CO2e.
The temperature ﬁgures are expressed as global averages. This obscures the predic-
tion that climate change will result in very different local effects. Predictions for some
of these local effects are shown in ﬁgure 26.7. The ﬁgure shows the mean changes
in surface air temperature (oC, left), precipitation (mm per day, middle) and sea
level pressure (hPa, right) for northern winter (top) and northern summer (bottom).

of new and more efﬁcient technologies) for the period 2080 to 2099 relative to 1980 to
1999. The stippling denotes areas where the predictions have the greatest uncertainty.
The ﬁgure shows that higher latitudes and continental regions are predicted to expe-
rience greater temperature increases. The greatest increase is in the Arctic, which will
lead to a melting of the polar ice cap and a rise in sea levels. Rainfall patterns are also
predicted to change with the level of rainfall decreasing in the bands north and south
of the equator. These changes could lead to signiﬁcant water shortages across much of
the globe, including some important agricultural areas since much of Africa, southern
Europe, the United States, and Australia will see reduced rainfall.

Predicted changes in climate patterns
These ﬁgures summarize the predictions of the effects of GHG accumulation on
climate. It should be stressed again that they are predictions from models of cli-
mate. The predictions could be modiﬁed if the change in climate causes feedback
effects, such as damage to carbon-absorbing organisms in the oceans and the release
of methane from warming wetlands and permafrost, that add to the accumulation of
GHGs. There is considerable uncertainty, and the policy analysis has to work with this
uncertainty.
26.4
Integrating Economics and Climate
The emission of GHGs is at least partly a result of economic activity. This provides
a causal link from the economy to climate. Climate change from GHG accumulation
affects the level of economic activity through the changing climate patterns. This gives
a causal link from climate to the economy. Both of these processes operate over time—
quite possibly very long periods of time. To model this interaction, it is necessary to
employ an intertemporal model with feedbacks from economic activity to climate, and
from climate to economic activity. The purpose of this section is to review a leading
example of such a model. Before proceeding to the model, a brief summary will be
given of some of the predicted effects of climate change. By contrasting the predictions

911
Chapter 26: Economics of Climate Change
with the model, it is possible to assess the extent to which the modeling captures the
damage scenarios.
26.4.1
Sources of Damage
There are many potential sources of damage from climate change. Three of the most
important are the effects on water supply, food production, and energy use. In addition
there are the effects of extreme weather events. The consequences will differ across
countries: latitude and current climate are important determinants of the effects. It
should be stressed once again that uncertainty surrounds all current predictions.
The water supply at any location is affected by altered rainfall and runoff from
surrounding land. It is predicted that the supply may rise in higher latitudes but fall in
lower latitudes due to lower rainfall and less snow meltwater. More precisely, summer
water availability in southern Europe could fall by 20 to 30 percent, and the West Coast
of the United States would have erratic water supply as the snow pack decreases by
25 to 40 percent, if average temperatures rise by 2oC. Australia will become drier as
storms track farther south. Agriculture is directly affected by the supply of water and
by temperature change. At higher latitudes small temperature increases may increase
output due to more favorable conditions until the tolerance thresholds of the crops are
reached. At lower latitudes (southern Europe, western United States, westernAustralia)
water shortages will lead to declines in crop yields. There are two offsetting effects of
temperature increases on energy use: less heating in winter but more air conditioning
in summer. Climate change can also affect energy production, since warmer water
reduces the cooling capacity available for power production and reduced rainfall affects
production of hydroelectric power.
The location of developing countries in the lower latitudes and their dependence
on agriculture means that they will face the most serious costs. Many developing
economies, such as Bangladesh and the Maldives, also have low-lying coastal areas
that are vulnerable to ﬂooding if melting ice caps cause sea levels to rise. Developed
economies will suffer less because of their lower dependence on agriculture and location
in higher latitudes. Furthermore the developed economies have the resources to ensure
greater adaptive capacity. Small increases in temperature may actually be beneﬁcial for
some developed economies if it increases agricultural output. However, it is predicted
that an increase in temperature of 4oC to 5oC will have severe effects for all countries.
The effects of climate change will be unevenly distributed in the United States due
to its geographical diversity. There may be short-term beneﬁts in the north with bet-
ter conditions for agriculture and lower energy requirements for heating. Extensive

912
Part IX: Applications
damage is predicted in the south through reduced snowfall and shorter winters. This
will affect the water supply of the Paciﬁc coast, California, and the Mississippi basin.
The temperature changes will cause farm production to shift northward, with total out-
put falling once the temperature increase exceeds 3oC. In addition the south will face
increased energy use for cooling purposes.
The prediction for the United Kingdom is that infrastructural damage from ﬂooding
and storms will increase. Water availability will be constrained with more frequent
droughts. Milder winters will reduce energy use. Agricultural productivity may in-
crease, but this is dependent on the changes in water supply. These predictions are all
conditional on changes to the Gulf Stream, which is a ﬂow of warm water up the west
coast of the United Kingdom. This ﬂow is responsible for the United Kingdom having
much warmer winters than the Canadian east coast at the same latitude. If the Gulf
Stream were to slacken or cease, then the average winter temperature in the United
Kingdom would fall signiﬁcantly.
Australia is vulnerable to the impact of rising sea temperatures. More storms and
damage will occur in the northwest, whereas the east coast will suffer from longer
droughts and declining rainfall. The water supply available for cities will fall. Drier
and hotter summers will damage the rain forest, and sea temperatures will damage coral
reefs.
In addition to these effects there is predicted to be an increase in extreme weather
events and consequent damage to property and loss of life. Most areas of the world will
be at threat from these events. The consequence of the range of changes outlined could
be political and social unrest driven by hunger and thirst resulting from reductions
in agricultural output and water supply. An ensuing consequence could be signiﬁcant
displacement and migration of populations.
26.4.2
Modeling Economic Damage
The preceding comments have described some of what may happen. To make predic-
tions of economic damage, the purported changes need to be incorporated within an
economic model.
An Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) combines economic activity and climate
change in a single framework with feedback between the two: the economy affects
climate, and climate affects the economy. An IAM is a set of equations drawn from
economic analysis and climate modeling. The key equations for an IAM are those that
link economy and climate. The Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and Economy

913
Chapter 26: Economics of Climate Change
(DICE) produced by William Nordhaus at Yale is now used to illustrate a typical IAM.
We focus on this model because the equations are publicly and openly available.
The economic side of the DICE model adopts a standard form of growth through
capital accumulation (see chapter 24). It assumes that industrial production generates
emissions that affect temperature through accumulation of GHGs. The temperature
then determines the damage caused by climate change. The model incorporates twelve
regions: the United States, European Union, Other High Income, Russia, Eastern Eu-
rope, non–RussianformerSovietUnion, Japan, China, India, MiddleEast, Sub-Saharan
Africa, Latin America, and Other Asia. The countries that are modeled represent 97
percent of emissions and 94 percent of world output.
The economic side of the model describes production and welfare. The level of
industrial output is determined by a Cobb–Douglas production function
Y(t) = K(t)γ L(t)1−γ ,
(26.2)
where K(t) is the capital stock at time t and L(t) is the quantity of labor used. It is
assumed that all consumers supply one unit of labor, so L(t) is also the population size
at time t. Some of the output produced at t is used in the abatement of emission and
some is lost to damage through climate change. The net level of output after damage
((t)) and abatement cost ((t)) are taken into account is
Q(t) = (t)[1 −(t)]Y(t).
(26.3)
Per capita consumption, c(t), and gross investment, I(t), must satisfy
Q(t) = L(t)c(t) + I(t).
(26.4)
The level of investment determines the evolution of the capital stock
K(t) = I(t) + [1 −δK] K(t −1).
(26.5)
The time path of consumption (and hence of investment) is chosen to maximize the
social welfare function

The pure rate of social time preference, ρ, provides the welfare weights on the utilities
of different generations. With ρ > 0, this form of social welfare function implies a
discount on the economic well-being of future generations. Here α is the elasticity
with respect to consumption of the marginal utility of consumption. The parameters

914
Part IX: Applications
α and ρ are ultimately calibrated to match market data. This is explored further in
section 26.5.
The next set of equations describe the climate side of the model. The ﬁrst three
represent the carbon cycle and the transfer of carbon between three different locations
(or “sinks”). Carbon can be trapped in the atmosphere (AT ), the upper ocean (UP), and
the lower ocean (LO). Carbon is transferred slowly from the upper ocean to the lower
ocean, with the lower ocean modeled as a large sink that can store vast quantities of
carbon. The level of carbon in the atmosphere reservoir (AT ) is
MAT(t) = E(t) + φ11MAT(t −1) + φ21MUP(t −1).
(26.7)
In the upper oceans (UP),
MUP(t) = φ12MAT(t −1) + φ22MUP(t −1) + φ32MLO(t −1),
(26.8)
and in the lower oceans (LO),
MLO(t) = φ23MUP(t −1) + φ33MLO(t −1).
(26.9)
These three ﬁrst-order difference equations form a system that is driven by the quantity
of emissions, E(t). These accumulation equations are next linked to the degree of
radiative forcing that determines warming. The climate model for temperatures in the
atmosphere and in the lower oceans is a two-equation system. This system involves the
past values of temperature and an outside force, F(t), that drives change in temperature.
The outside force is determined by the radiative forcing equation
F(t) = η log2

MAT(t)
MAT(1750)

+ FEX(t),
(26.10)
where the ﬁrst term is the consequence of carbon accumulation and FEX(t) is exogenous
forcing. The temperature system is
TAT(t) = TAT(t −1) + ξ1 {F(t) −ξ2TAT(t −1)
−ξ3[TAT(t −1) −TLO(t −1)]} ,
(26.11)
TLO(t) = TLO(t −1) + ξ4[TAT(t −1) −TLO(t −1)].
(26.12)
If F(t) is constant, these equations have a steady state with constant temperatures. Only
if F(t) increases over time will the steady-state temperature levels increase.
The ﬁnal equations link the two systems. Production generates industrial emissions
of amount
EInd (t) = σ (t) [1 −μ (t)] Y(t).
(26.13)

915
Chapter 26: Economics of Climate Change
where σ (t) is the ratio of uncontrolled emissions to output and μ (t) is the emissions
control rate (the abatement). Total emissions are sum of industrial and land
E(t) = EInd(t) + ELand(t).
(26.14)
The abatement cost in (26.3) is related to the emissions reductions rate by
 (t) = χ (μ (t)).
(26.15)
The climate damage function (t) in (26.3) is assumed to depend on global mean
temperature change:
(t) =
1
1 + ψ1TAT(t) + ψ2TAT(t)2 .
(26.16)
This equation is constructed from damage estimates.
It can be seen that (26.16) is a macro-level representation of damage. In contrast to
the range of effects described in section 26.4.1, damage in the model is just a reduction
in the net level of output. This is a consequence of using an aggregate economic model
that has a single consumption good. Such models are adequate for addressing the
fundamentals of growth theory but limit the level of sophistication in modeling climate
damage. This is a criticism that applies not only to the DICE model—which represents
the frontier of economic modeling in this area—but to economic models of growth in
general. The need for developments to produce compelling models that can be used for
more detailed economic forecasting is clear.
26.4.3
Effects of Policy
Economic forecasting is about the prediction of future levels of economic activity. The
production of a forecast requires assumptions to be made on the values of exogenous
variables and a model that determines the values of endogenous variables. A standard
technique is to compare a baseline case—a particular assignment of values to exogenous
variables—to alternative cases conducted under different assumption. The baseline case
is often chosen to represent what would happen to the economy if there were no policy
intervention. This is often called “business as usual.” A policy intervention is a change
in the exogenous variables and the effect of policy is the change in the endogenous
variables. The predictions made by the DICE model are now reviewed. These give an
idea of the magnitude of the damage from climate change and the extent to which one
particular form of policy intervention can reduce these.

Industrial CO2 emissions: DICE and two IPCC scenarios
Figure 26.8 shows the time path of CO2 emissions for the baseline run of the DICE
model compared to the predictions from two Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) scenarios. The baseline run for DICE assumes that no climate-change policies
areimplemented. TheA1Bscenarioinvolvesveryrapideconomicgrowth, amidcentury
peak in global population followed by decline, and the rapid introduction of new and
more efﬁcient technologies. The A1F1 scenario has low population growth. The next
two sections will look in detail at the issues behind the choice of the key economic
parameters: the pure rate of social time preference, ρ, and the elasticity of the marginal
utility of consumption, α. It is therefore worth noting for later comparison that the
baseline run assumes the values ρ = 0.015 and α = 2. When contrasted to the two
IPCC scenarios, the DICE projection is the lowest of the three projections until the
mid–twenty-ﬁrst century but, unlike the A1B scenario, continues to rise. At the end of
this century the DICE projection is between the two IPCC scenarios.
The policy studied by the DICE model is a tax levied on the output of carbon. Table
26.3 shows the beneﬁt from the optimal policy and contrasts this to the alternatives of
limiting the increase in CO2 and limiting the increase in temperature. The key feature
of all the policies is that the carbon tax rises over time, and quite dramatically so, when
policy is designed to limit the increase in temperature to 2oC. The increase in the carbon
tax over time is a consequence of emissions in the baseline run rising over time. These
results suggest that limiting the temperature increase to 2oC may be costly. Compared

to the optimal policy, the abatement cost is high. The increase in temperature under
the optimal policy is 2.76oC, which shows that abatement costs rise quickly for small
reductions in temperature increase.

Competing Generations
Climate models predict that the current accumulation of GHGs will have consequences
that could last for hundreds of years into the future. At the very least any policy re-
sponse has to account for effects over the next two centuries. This section addresses
the implications of the very long run aspect of climate change. There are costs today if
we wish to mitigate climate change and there are potential costs for future generations
if we do not. The problem in the policy design area is how these two are balanced.
The standard approach to policy evaluation is to apply cost–beneﬁt analysis. Let the
beneﬁts of an emissions reduction policy at time t be B(t) and the costs of the policy
be C(t). The basic rule of cost–beneﬁt analysis is that the policy should be adopted if
the associated net present value (NPV) is positive, where
NPV =
∞

t=0
[1 + d]−t [B(t) −C(t)] .
(26.17)
Chapter 25 discussed the issues involved in calculating the beneﬁts and the costs. Those
issues are now assumed to be resolved, and we focus instead on the discount rate, d.
The effect of discounting when applied to long-run decisions is shown in ﬁgure 26.9.
This displays the present discounted value (pdv) of receiving $1,000 in the future
for four different discount rates. For example, $1,000 received in 20 years is worth

$500.66 today when the discount factor is 3.5 percent (the UK government discount
rate). Expressed differently, the society would be willing to pay $500.66 today to avoid
the loss of $1,000 in 20 years. If the loss occurs in 100 years, then the willingness to
pay is $31.46, and if in 200 years, $0.99. This last number summarizes the point of
these calculations: for a reasonable discount factor the willingness to pay today for
losses that occur in the distant future is close to zero. Applying cost–beneﬁt techniques
to climate policy, for this magnitude of discount factor, will require future generations
to suffer very major losses (relative to current costs) before a policy is approved by the
NPV criterion.
This raises the question of what discount rate should be used in climate policy. For the
purpose of the discussion that follows, two different discount rates need to be identiﬁed:
1. Discount rate in ﬁnancial markets, r
This discount rate can also be called the real return on capital, the real interest rate,
the real return, or the discount rate on goods. It is observable in the marketplace as the
real interest rate offered on risk-free securities. The closest assets to being risk-free are
the treasury bills (short-term government borrowing) of the major economies. Many
applications in ﬁnance use US Treasury bills as the practical equivalent of a risk-free
asset. The annual real return on these bills has averaged approximately 3 percent.Assets
that have greater degrees of risk have to offer higher expected returns, so corporate stock
have an average real return of 6.6 percent, and human capital an average real return in
the range 6 to 20 percent. As we observed in chapter 25, this discount rate is determined
by the equilibrium of supply and demand for assets in ﬁnancial markets.

Chapter 26: Economics of Climate Change
2. Relative weight of different generations in welfare, ρ
The relative weight assigned to different generations in the social welfare function
is the pure rate of social time preference or time discount rate of the social planner.
A value of zero for this discount rate means that the utility of different generations is
treated equally.Apositive value means that the utility of future generations is discounted
relative to that of the current generation.
If we treat (26.17) as a welfare calculation, then ρ should be used as the discount
rate. This raises the question of what should be the value of ρ. This question has
led to considerable debate in the literature on climate policy. Partly, this debate has
been about whether ρ can be freely chosen in a policy analysis or whether it has to
be consistent with the market interest rate, r. To a lesser extent there has also been a
debate about the correct value of ρ if it can be freely chosen. The chosen value has
signiﬁcant implications for the trade-off between present costs and future beneﬁts.
An understanding of how preferences are related to observable variables can be
obtained by using the Ramsey growth model. In this model a single individual has
to choose consumption and saving to maximize lifetime utility. The basic trade-off
in the choice is that increasing consumption in one period raises utility but reduces
saving. This leads to a lower capital stock in the next period, which reduces output and
therefore consumption and utility. The time path of consumption is chosen optimally
to accommodate this trade-off.
We now employ the derivation used in section 24.3.2 of chapter 24 to characterize
the optimal consumption path. The intertemporal preferences of the social planner are
described by the utility function
W =
∞

t=1
1
[1 + ρ]t
C1−γ
t
1 −γ ,
(26.18)
where ρ is the intergenerational discount rate. The social planner chooses the path {Ct}
over time to maximize utility. The standard condition for intertemporal choice must
hold for the optimization, so the ratio of the marginal utilities of consuming at t and at
t + 1 must equal the gross interest rate. Hence
∂W/∂Ct
∂W/∂Ct+1
≡[1 + ρ] C−γ
t
C−γ
t+1
= 1 + rt+1.
(26.19)
By solving for Ct+1
Ct
and then subtracting Ct
Ct from both sides of the resulting equation,
this optimality condition can be rewritten in terms of the growth rate of consumption.

920
Part IX: Applications
Thus
Ct+1 −Ct
Ct
=
1 + rt+1
1 + ρ
1/γ
−1.
(26.20)
Now deﬁne the growth rate of consumption gt+1 ≡Ct+1−Ct
Ct
. This gives
1 + gt+1 =
1 + rt+1
1 + ρ
1/γ
,
(26.21)
which is the relation between the chosen growth rate and the interest rate. For the usual
order of magnitude of these variables, a reasonable approximation is given by
rt+1 = ρ + γgt+1.
(26.22)
This result is the basic identity that links the equilibrium return on capital to the in-
tertemporal discount rate on the optimal path. It is usually called the Ramsey rule for
intertemporal consumption, since it describes the condition that must be met by the
optimal time path of consumption.
The two parameters in the social welfare function can be given a useful interpretation.
The discount rate ρ can be interpreted as aversion to inequality across generations, and
the elasticity γ as aversion to inequality within a generation (see the construction of the
Atkinson index in chapter 14). The implication of (26.22) is that the observed market
interest rate can only be used to infer the aversion to inequality across generations if
the aversion to inequality within generations and the optimal growth rates are known.
An alternative expression of the same statement is that it is not possible to choose ρ and
γ independently without reaching a contradiction to the observed data: if we observe
r and g, then either ρ or γ can be freely chosen, but not both.
It should be noted that the arguments just made were based on the assumption that
the social preferences in (26.18) align with the underlying individual preferences. If
they do not, the market and the social planner will choose different growth paths. The
observed market return on capital will be different from the return along the optimal
growth path and so cannot be used to relate ρ and γ . This is important to keep in mind
before taking the outcome of (26.22) literally.
Aternative analyses of climate policy have taken different approaches to selecting
values for ρ and γ . The approach followed by Nordhaus, when implementing the
DICE model, was to take observed values in the market and deduce the parameters. As
already noted, this assumes that the market outcome is optimal relative to social pref-
erences. The approach of the Stern Review (2007) was to adopt a welfarist perspective

921
Chapter 26: Economics of Climate Change
and to select values that the planner sees as ethically correct. This has the drawback
that the chosen social preferences may be inconsistent with individual preferences.
Furthermore there may be no consensus as to what the values should be because it is
perfectly acceptible for different people to have different ethical views. In the sense of
Arrow’s impossibility theorem of chapter 13 the welfare function must be dictatorial.
The implications of these observations are now explored in some detail.
The Stern Review applies the ethical philosophy of utilitarianism across generations
and so chooses a discount rate that is very close to zero.An appeal is made to underlying
uncertainty—in the example of the Review that the world may end by being struck by
an asteroid—to adopt a small but positive value of ρ. The more pragmatic reason for
not using a value that is exactly zero is to obtain a ﬁnite value for social welfare. The
Review uses a discounted utilitarian social welfare function of the form
W =
∞

t=0
1
[1 + ρ]t U(t)
(26.23)
(formally, the Review uses the continuous time analogue of equation 26.23). Since
U(t) > 0 for all t, this summation will be inﬁnite for ρ = 0. Hence the utilitarian phi-
losophy of ρ = 0 cannot be applied unmodiﬁed; otherwise, the level of social welfare
will be inﬁnite and comparison of policies will not be meaningful (every policy will
lead to inﬁnitely large welfare). The appeal to uncertainty is a device used to make the
philosophy of no intergenerational discounting consistent with a ﬁnite value of social
welfare over an inﬁnite horizon.
The Stern Review assumes that γ = 1 (so that utility is logarithmic) and g = 0.013
(1.3 percent). The implication of this choice of growth rate is that if per capita income
is $10,000 today, it will increase to $135,000 in two centuries. The value of the inter-
generational discount rate is taken as ρ = 0.001 (0.1 percent). The choices of γ and ρ
can be put into perspective by observing that
ln(10, 000) −ln(9, 389) =
1
(1.001)200 ln(135, 000)
−
1
(1.001)200 ln(125, 000),
(26.24)
meaning, the society will give up $611 of consumption today (reducing consumption
from $10,000 to $9,389) to avoid a $10,000 reduction in consumption (from $135,000
to $125,000) that would take place in 200 years. It is hard to believe that most, if any,
people alive today would agree that this is an acceptable trade-off. But an even more
extreme trade-off for a long-run future reduction in consumption may be considered:

922
Part IX: Applications
per capita consumption of $10,000 today would be reduced to effectively $23 for one
year to prevent a reduction of consumption from $135,000 to $134,000 starting in 200
years and continuing onward. That is,
∞

t=200

(1.001)t ln(135, 000) −
∞

t=200
1
(1.001)t ln(134, 000)
= ln(10,000) −ln(22.565).
(26.25)
This is obviously not an acceptable trade-off. The assumed values do not correspond
to any existing experimental or market setting. This is why the choices of the Stern
Review have to be treated as explicitly ethical judgments that do not represent any
values ever observed a market outcomes.
Using the Stern Review values for ρ and g in (26.22), we have a return on capital
of r = 0.014 (1.4 percent). This rate is below the market rate, making the values
inconsistent with market equilibrium. Interestingly, if a return on capital of r = 0.04
is assumed, then g = 0.013 and ρ = 0 imply γ = 3, which is a much higher rate of
within generation inequality aversion than the Review assumes. Alternatively, a value
of γ = 1 implies ρ = 0.027, which is close to the discount rate recommended in the UK
government cost–beneﬁt analysis.
In contrast, the baseline for the DICE model assumes γ = 2, g = 0.02, and r = 0.055.
The motivation for the value of r is that it is close to the long-term return on government
bonds. The value of g is consistent with what most major economies have achieved
over the past thirty years. Substituting these into (26.22) gives a growth rate of 0.015.
Moving from ρ = 0.001 to ρ = 0.015 causes a major shift in the valuation of future
consumption relative to present consumption. This is one of the reasons why the optimal
policy of the DICE model is a carbon tax that increases over time: this shifts the cost
of policy more into the future.
The discussion so far has not properly modeled or accommodated uncertainty. One
of the features of climate policy that we have continually stressed is the degree of
uncertainty involved. The consequences of uncertainty must be considered because
they are signiﬁcant for the value of the discount rate.
Uncertainty can be introduced by returning to the determination of the optimal path of
consumption and observing that uncertainty about future levels of consumption makes
the marginal social welfare of future consumption a random variable. It is therefore the
expected value of the marginal social welfare of future consumption that enters into
the optimality condition (26.19). If the interest rate is assumed to be constant, (26.19)
can be rewritten as

923
Chapter 26: Economics of Climate Change

E [∂W/∂Ct] = (1 + r)t.
(26.26)
Social welfare is the discounted value of utility so ∂W

to be expressed as

(26.31)
By combining (26.28), (26.30), and (26.31), we obtain the value of the discount rate
incorporating the uncertainty:
r = ρ + γg −0.5γ (γ + 1) σ 2.
(26.32)
Here ρ represents impatience, γg the wealth effect arising from the growth in wealth
between generations, and −0.5γ (γ + 1) σ 2 the precautionary effect due to the un-
certain future growth rate. Clearly, uncertainty over the growth rate of consumption
reduces the discount rate that should be applied in the CBA evaluation, and higher
uncertainty (higher σ 2) reduces it still more. It should be noted that it is possible for
g to be negative as consumption falls over time. This could be a relevant outcome if

924
Part IX: Applications
climate change has dramatic and damaging effects or the cost of combating change is
very high. The result in (26.32) shows that for a given value of r, a negative value of
g reduces ρ.
These observations reveal the issues involved in selecting the basic parameters of an
IAM. The standard discounting method implies that long-run climate change should
not be confronted if there is a signiﬁcant present cost in doing so. To get around this
fact, it is necessary to use, and justify, a much lower discount rate. One way to do so is
to treat the choice of discount rate as an ethical issue. However, though acceptable, it is
hard to reconcile market equilibrium with the implications of ethical principles. Either
approach to discounting can be justiﬁed, since there is no certain way to settle these
debates. Nevertheless, it is possible to combine the two approaches in a more general
framework, as we show next.
26.6
Ecological Discounting
Nordhaus (2007) and Stern (2007) offer contrasting approaches to the determination of
a discount rate. There has been considerable debate in the literature about the relative
merits of the two positions. While both appear to be based on very distinct sets of
arguments, it is still possible to achieve a reconciliation by accommodating both within
an extended framework. In doing so, we can gain an important insight into the that
allows a different perspective to be formed as to their relative merits.
The extended framework treats environmental quality as a distinct good that enters
the utility function. It then becomes possible to isolate a discount rate that can evaluate
changes in environmental quality from the discount rate for produced goods. The value
of the discount rate for environmental quality is based on society’s preferences for
environmental quality and for produced goods. Nordhaus and Stern apply as special
cases of this general result.
Let Ct denote the consumption of produced goods at time t, and Qt be environmental
quality in the same time period. Generation t, who are alive during period t only, have
preferences described by the constant elasticity of substitution utility function
u(Ct, Qt) =

C(μ−1)/μ
t
+ Q(μ−1)/μ
t
μ/(μ−1)
.
(26.33)
Here μ is the elasticity of substitution between goods and environment. This parameter
represents a measure of how easy it is to compensate for decreased environmental
quality by increasing the consumption of produced goods. When μ →∞, there is

925
Chapter 26: Economics of Climate Change
perfect substitutability, and when μ →0, there is no substitutability. The elasticity has
a key role in the analysis. The social planner cares about inequality across generations
values and applies a discount to future welfare. The social welfare function is
W =
∞

t=0
1
[1 + ρ]t
u(Ct, Qt)1−γ
1 −γ
.
(26.34)
Within this framework two different discount rates can be applied. Let U(Ct, Qt) ≡
u(Ct,Qt)1−γ
1−γ
. The discount rate for produced goods between periods t and t +1 is deﬁned
by the value of rt, which satisﬁes
1
1 + rt
=
1
1 + ρ
UC (Ct+1, Qt+1)
UC (Ct, Qt)
.
(26.35)
The value of rt measures the rate at which Ct has to be increased to compensate for a
reductions in Ct+1. Similarly the ecological discount rate, βt, between periods t and
t + 1 is deﬁned by
1
1 + βt
=
1
1 + ρ
UQ (Ct+1, Qt+1)
UQ (Ct, Qt)
,
(26.36)
where βt determines the rate at which environmental quality has to be increased in t to
compensate for a reduction of quality in t + 1.
Two simplifying assumptions can now made. First, the consumption of produced
goods grows at the constant rate g, so that
Ct+1 = [1 + g] Ct.
(26.37)
Second, the level of environment is ﬁxed at ¯Q. Damage to the environment can be
modeled as an exogenous reduction in ¯Q. Under these assumptions

The formula in (26.39) shows how the standard result on discount rates is affected
by environmental quality entering the utility function; see (26.22). The additional term
depends on the ratio of the consumption of produced goods to environmental quality.
From (26.36) and (26.38) it follows that
βt = rt −g
μ.
(26.42)
This result emphasizes the effect of the growth of private consumption on the ecolog-
ical discount rate: a higher rate of growth reduces the discount rate of environmental
quality. Hence more attention must be given to maintaining the future environ-
ment when consumption grows faster. Climate policy can be distinguished from
many other economic issues by the potentially long time period that is involved in
valuing policy interventions. This motivates the analysis of the discount rates for pro-
duced goods and for environmental quality as t increases without limit. The degree
of substitutability, μ, is critical in the determination of the discount factors in the
long run.
First, consider μ > 1. In this case the utility function can be written as
u(Ct, yt) =

C(μ−1)/μ

(26.43)
Because Ct is growing at a constant rate and μ−1
μ
> 0, it follows that
 ¯Q
Ct
(μ−1)/μ
tends
to zero as t increases. Hence the level of utility will grow at the same rate as consumption
of the produced good. Now use the expression r = ρ + γg + 1−μγ



tends to ln(1) = 0. This gives
r = ρ + γg.
(26.44)
The value of β is obtained by substituting (26.44) into (26.42) to obtain
β = ρ + g

γ −1

.
(26.45)
In this case the the produced good and environment are good substitutes, so increased
production can keep raising utility even for a ﬁxed environment. So the standard con-
siderations still apply in obtaining the long-run discount rate for goods. The limit value
of the ecological discount rate is signiﬁcantly below the value of the standard discount
rate (the difference is given by g
μ) but is above the intertemporal discount rate.
The consequences of this formula can be appreciated by working through an example.
Let the loss of environmental beneﬁt have loss of value L in every future period.
The present discounted value at time 0, if the loss occurs from time 1 with discount
rate d, is
pdv =
∞

t=1

(1 + d)t L = 1
d L.
With an interest rate of r = 0.03, the present discounted value from a standard cost–
beneﬁt calculation is
pdv = 1
r L = 33.3L.
To evaluate the ecological discounting formula, assume that σ = 1.5 and ρ = 0.001.
Figure 26.10 plots the value of 1
β as a function of μ for μ > 1. Note that the value of
1
β is considerably higher than that of 1

(26.47)
Because of the low degree of substitutability between the private good and the envi-
ronmental good, the standard discount rate for the produced good is adjusted. Then β
is obtained by substitution as
β = ρ.
(26.48)
In this case the value of the ecological discount rate depends only on the intertemporal
discount rate and does not depend on the rate of growth. The present discounted value
of a permanent loss, L, in environmental quality is
pdv = 1
ρ L.
The value used in the example above (ρ = 0.001) gives pdv = 1,000L. The loss of
environmental quality is very costly in this case.

929
Chapter 26: Economics of Climate Change
The main point of this discussion is that there does not need to be inconsistency
between using the Ramsey model to deduce the discount rate applied to the produced
goods and the intertemporal discount rate used to deduce the social welfare conse-
quences of change in environmental quality. Because environmental quality has a limit,
its increasingly high value will constrain the level of welfare that can be achieved at its
expense. The analysis, however, does not deﬁne what value should be used for ρ, so
the issues of debate in the previous section are still relevant but enlightened somewhat.
26.7
Climate Policy in Practice
Climate policy is primarily concerned with the reduction of harmful emissions. Re-
ductions can be achieved either through price controls or through direct controls of
the quantity of emissions. Price controls can take the form of carbon taxes or other
environmental taxes. Quantity controls can range from prohibitions of some emis-
sions or activities to requiring emissions permits. This section discusses the practical
implementation of these policy tools.
26.7.1
Pricing and Policies
In recent years policies to reduce emissions have proliferated. Often the policies are in-
adequately coordinated, and therefore emissions from different sectors are priced very
differently and inconsistently. The situation in the United Kingdom is used as an exam-
ple to illustrate this point, and then we consider what the efﬁcient outcome should be.
Large electricity producers in the United Kingdom need to hold emissions permits
under the EU ETS (Emissions Trading Scheme), so the trading price of permits can be
treated as a tax on emissions. Electricity from some sources is taxed under the climate
change levy (CCL) if used by industry. The CCL does not apply to electricity from
renewable sources or that used by domestic consumers. The Renewables Obligation
(RO) requires electricity suppliers to source a proportion of their electricity from re-
newable generation, which is more expensive than conventional generation. Table 26.4
summarizes this information and provides a calculation of the implicit tax per ton of
CO2 resulting from the set of policies. The ﬁrst column in the table is an estimate of
CO2 emissions per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of energy produced. For gas and electricity,
the second column is an estimate of the impact of the Renewables Obligation (RO)
on electricity prices per kWh. The third column is simply the 2009 to 2010 rate of the
climate change levy. For the EU ETS, the government’s central estimate of £22 per ton

of CO2 is used to estimate the cost of the EU ETS per kWh of electricity. The table
reveals the extent to which the implicit tax varies between gas and electricity, between
electricity from different sources, and between industrial and domestic users.
A similar situation occurs with the taxation of fuel used in transport. Fuel for road
transport is taxed through excise duties and the RoadTransport Fuel Obligation (RTFO),
which requires fuel suppliers to include a proportion of biofuel. Gasoline for aviation
is subject to fuel duty, but turbine fuel is not. The rates of these duties and the implied
taxes are reported in table 26.5. The combination of the policies again results in implied
taxes that vary considerably across sources of emissions.
As the tables demonstrate, the combination of policies in the United Kingdom toward
emissions creates different prices for different sources. Similar observations could be
made for other countries. The next question is whether this matters. An argument that
has been made is that all units of emissions are the same whatever their source, so

the price should be equal across sources. This position cannot be correct. The aim
of the taxes is to secure a reduction in emissions. The optimal design of the taxes
should be to secure the chosen level of reduction most efﬁciently. This is what is
behind the arguments in section 8.5. The optimal tax should reﬂect the ease with which
emissions can be reduced from each source and the welfare beneﬁt from a reduction.
This argument supports differentiation of the taxes, but it does not imply that the UK
differentiation is optimal. An alternative argument for uniformity of pricing is that it
reduces the incentive for political lobbying to obtain advantageous reductions. This
argument cannot be dismissed so lightly.
26.7.2
The EU Emissions Trading Scheme
TheEUETSwasestablishedin2005aspartoftheclimatepolicyoftheEuropeanUnion.
This is the ﬁrst major attempt at a widespread scheme to control carbon emissions.
The ﬁrst phase covered 2005 to 2007, the current second phase ﬁnishes in 2012,
and a planned third phase will run from 2013 until 2020. The scheme currently covers
more than 10,000 installations in the energy and industrial sectors that are collectively
responsible for about half of total emissions in the European Union and three quarters of
industrial emissions (see ﬁgure 26.11). The large emitters of CO2 within the European
Union must monitor emissions, provide an annual report on emissions, and return a
quantity of emissions allowances equivalent to the annual CO2 emissions. In the ﬁrst
two phases of the EU ETS, individual member states proposed national emissions caps
based on their assessment of national emissions levels. In the ﬁrst phase, the European
Union accepted the assessments, and there was a shortage of allowances in only a small
number of countries. The response of the European Union was to reject the caps initially
proposed by most member states in the second phase because they were judged too high.

Coverage of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme
When the national emissions caps were agreed, the initial allocation of allowances was
made to installations by the governments of member states. In the ﬁrst two phases this
wasdoneby“grandfathering”wherebyinstallationsweregivenaquantityofallowances
that reﬂected their past levels of emissions. A more centralized allocation mechanism
is proposed for the third phase. The allowances granted to installations can then be
traded, and this establishes a price for emissions and provides a ﬁnancial incentive to
reduce emissions.
The price of the tradable emissions allowances (EU allowances or EUAs) has ﬂuc-
tuated over time as shown in ﬁgure 26.12. It fell to zero in 2007 when the quantity of
allowances exceeded annual emissions. Enhanced price stability would assist invest-
ment decisions by energy and other companies. This could be achieved by expanding
the market for allowances across a broader range of activities and regions to make the
market deeper and more liquid.
The process of allocating national emissions caps on the basis of reports from member
states provided an incentive for overstatement of emissions. This was reﬂected in
the ﬁrst phase by the fact that there was a shortage of allowances in only a small
number of countries. The problem was partially resolved in the second phase when
the European Union rejected the proposed caps of most member states. For the third
phase the proposed centralized allocation mechanism should take away the issue of
overstatement, through the system will still be open to political lobbying. The process
of grandfathering allowances to ﬁrms on the basis of past emissions levels had the
advantage of making the EU ETS acceptable to ﬁrms. But it also opened a route for
windfall proﬁts to be earned through the sale of unwanted permits. It has been estimated

sector alone.
The EU ETS puts a cap on emissions across the European Union, which limits the
value of other policy instruments applied to the same emissions. Consider a member
state that imposes a second policy, such as an additional tax on a particular sector, that
reduces emissions from that sector. The sector will then be left with unused emissions
allowances. These can be traded to be used elsewhere in the European Union, so the
EU aggregate level of emissions will not fall. The second policy does not achieve any
reduction in emissions. This provides an additional factor to be taken into account when
member states formulate policy
When considering innovation, there is a crucial difference between taxation and the
use of emissions permits. One advantage of a tax is that ﬁrms will not have an incentive
to lobby against policy adjustments in response to innovation and technological change,
thereby making such adjustments easier. The basic intuition is illustrated in ﬁgure 26.13.
For a given time period, the optimal policy is to equalize the marginal damage from
emissions and the marginal cost of a reduction in emissions. Denoting the marginal
cost and damage curves MC and MD, respectively, the optimal policy is to emit Q0

tons of carbon at price P0. This can be achieved either by a carbon tax P0, or through
a permit trading scheme that sets an emissions cap Q0. In both cases the equilibrium
is (Q0, P0) before innovation takes place. Innovation would be expected to reduce
marginal abatement cost, and so shift the marginal cost curve MC downward to MC′.
In the absence of revision to the policy, the new equilibrium would be (Q′, P0) under a
tax (with quantity adjustment to Q′ < Q0) and (Q0, P ′) under permit trading (with price
adjustment to P ′ < P0). However, neither of these equilibria would be optimal, since
marginal damages and marginal costs would differ. Therefore the policy maker would
have an incentive to revise the policy to achieve the new optimum (Q1, P1). Under a
tax system, this would imply a reduction in the tax (P1 < P0), from which ﬁrms would
beneﬁt. Under permit trading, this would imply a tightening of the cap (Q1 < Q0) and an
increase in the emissions price (P1 > P ′), from which ﬁrms would lose, and which they
are therefore likely to oppose. Because the outcome of such lobbying may be uncertain,
policy revisions may be less predictable under permit trading than under a tax.
26.7.3
International Agreements
The international aspect of GHG emissions has been stressed frequently in this chapter.
The global nature of the problem has led to international agreements on emission
reductions. We describe the two major agreements and then explore why they have not
been entirely successful.

935
Chapter 26: Economics of Climate Change
The Kyoto Protocol is an agreement between countries that is linked to the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Protocol was adopted in
December 1997 and entered into force in February 2005. At the time of writing,
191 states have signed and ratiﬁed the Protocol. The only signatory not to have rat-
iﬁed the Protocol is the United States. The Protocol commits 37 countries (known
as the “Annex I countries”) to a reduction of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous ox-
ide, sulphur hexaﬂuoride, hydroﬂuorocarbons, and perﬂuorocarbons by 5.2 percent
from the 1990 level. International aviation and shipping are excluded from the agree-
ment. The Annex I countries are also required to submit an annual report of all GHGs
emissions.
The Protocol introduced several mechanisms through whichAnnex I countries could
meet their GHG emission reduction targets. Joint implementation in Article 6 of the
Protocol allows a country with an emission reduction or limitation commitment to
earn emission-reduction units from an emission-reduction or emission-removal project
in another similar country that can count toward its target. The Clean Development
Mechanism is deﬁned in Article 12. This allows a country with an emission-reduction
or emission-limitation commitment to implement an emission-reduction project in a
developing country to earn salable certiﬁed emission-reduction credits. Article 17 of
the Kyoto Protocol set out a process for emissions trading that allows countries with
unused emission permissions to sell to countries that are over target.
The Copenhagen Accord is a document that delegates at the 15th session of the
Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
agreed to “take note of” at the ﬁnal plenary meeting in December 2009. An initial draft
of theAccord was prepared by the European Union but was not accepted. The accepted
version was drafted by the United States and the BASIC countries (Brazil, SouthAfrica,
India and China). The limitation of the Accord is that it is not legally binding, nor does
it commit countries to agree to a binding successor to the Kyoto Protocol. It sets no
clear targets for reductions in emissions. It is fundamentally the outcome of a political
compromise that permits some major emitters of GHGs to continue without needing to
secure reductions.
An important aspect of the difﬁculties in achieving an international agreement can
be seen in ﬁgures 26.14 and 26.15. Figure 26.14 displays the total CO2 emissions of the
20 countries with the highest emissions. The United States and China have the highest
emissions, with India coming third. This should be contrasted with ﬁgure 26.15 in which
emissions per capita are given for the same 20 countries. As can be seen, although the
United States is still at top, it is now closely followed by Canada, Australia, and Saudi
Arabia. Both China and India are much further down the ranking. Total emissions are

a function of both size and level of per capita GDP. China and India can legitimately
claim that focus on total emissions provides a false impression and that expecting
them to reduce emissions would be damaging for their economic development. These
arguments for fair and equal treatment have made an effective international agreement
difﬁcult to secure.
The debates surrounding these agreements illustrate as much as anything that do-
mestic politics and international relations can still prevent the attainment of a beneﬁcial
outcome. Even when all the parties recognize what needs to be done, there is no guar-
antee that an agreement can be secured. This is in part due to the distinction between the
private and the social beneﬁts from an agreement. An agreement will only be secured
if it is a Pareto improvement, unless some mechanism is put into place to compensate
the losers. The effective control of GHG emissions requires international agreement,
but a truly global and binding agreement has not yet been secured.
The EU ETS is the primary example of a cap-and-trade system. A limited number of
emissions permits are issued (the cap), and these can be sold if not required (the trade).
In principle, this ensures an efﬁcient allocation of permits. There have been some initial

difﬁculties in the development of the system, but it has become an established method
of emissions control and probably a precursor to a broader system.
26.7.4
Prices or Quantities
Emissions are an externality. Chapter 8 showed that externalities can be controlled
by either price instruments (e.g., taxes) or quantity instruments (e.g., output quotas).
When the costs and beneﬁts of the emissions and the policies are known with certainty,
the instruments are equivalent: for any quantity control there is a price instrument that
achieves the same outcome, and vice versa. This equivalence makes the choice of
instrument unimportant.
Unfortunately, climate policy is characterized by several dimensions of uncertainty.
There is uncertainty about the process of climate change, uncertainty about the con-
sequences of climate change, and uncertainty about the effects of policy intervention.
When there is uncertainty, the equivalence between price instruments and quantity
controls no longer holds. This was explored in section 8.6. Which policy instrument is

938
Part IX: Applications
better depends on the precise set of circumstances. Consider expressing the costs and
beneﬁts of policy as functions of the level of abatement. By ﬁxing the marginal cost of
reducing GHG emissions, a tax gives some certainty about overall abatement costs, at
the price of uncertainty about the resulting level of total emissions. Insofar as abatement
costs are unknown to the policy maker or can be subject to shocks (e.g., to economic
growth, energy supply or technology) after policy has been set, a tax is a more efﬁcient
pollution control device than a quantity instrument, provided that the marginal cli-
mate impacts from lower emissions are less sensitive to emissions levels than marginal
abatement costs, and vice versa. It should be stressed that only shocks to (marginal)
abatement costs typically matter in this context. Shocks to (marginal) damages from
emissions will usually entail the same welfare loss under a price as under a quantity
instrument, since emissions will remain unchanged in both cases. Thus, following the
Weitzman rule, a tax should be preferred to a quantity instrument when the marginal
(climate) damage curve is “ﬂatter” than the marginal cost curve. This condition is likely
to be met in the case of climate change because the marginal damage from higher than
expected emissions is relatively constant in the short run. It is only cumulative—not
current—emissions that matter for the climate. This is true at least in the current situa-
tion where GHG concentration levels remain signiﬁcantly below thresholds that might
trigger extreme and irreversible events, for instance, the melting of the Greenland and
west Antarctic ice sheets. In this context, under a tax the overall economic cost of
unexpected shocks to (marginal) abatement costs will be mitigated by (less harmful)
increases in short-run emissions, whereas under an inﬂexible cap-and-trade scheme
emissions will remain ﬁxed and overall economic costs will be higher.
The choice between the instruments has to be related to feasibility. National govern-
ments currently levy a wide range of different taxes. The adoption of price controls for
emissions would just be an addition to the existing range. The same claim cannot be
made for an international price policy. There is currently no supra-national body with
the authority to levy taxes (even the European Union does not, currently, have the right
to levy taxes). An international tax policy would require either the establishment of
some new institution or coordinated policy by individual countries. The right to levy
taxation is a deﬁning characteristic of a sovereign state. Granting the right to levy taxes
to a supra-national body would constitute a partial transfer of sovereignty and would
raise signiﬁcant political questions. Leaving individual countries to set price controls
would present the problem that each country has an incentive to be the one not to impose
controls.
Apolicy of quantity control is more feasible from a political perspective, and practical
examples already exist. The EU ETS has created a market within Europe for trading

939
Chapter 26: Economics of Climate Change
emissions allowances between ﬁrms.Article 17 of the Kyoto Protocol was an attempt to
apply emissions trading between sovereign states. The Clean Development Mechanism
allows afﬂuent countries to implement a project in a developing country that reduces
emissions and earns salable certiﬁed emission reduction credits toward meeting the
Kyoto reduction target. There are two further arguments in favor of quantity controls.
The results reported in table 26.3 show an optimal carbon tax that increases over time.
If this were to become the expected time path of the carbon tax, an incentive would
be created for the early extraction and use of fossil fuels. This problem is avoided
if a quantity control is imposed. The ﬁnal argument relates again to the uncertainty
about climate change. The effects of a price control on the level of abatement will
be uncertain. In contrast, the outcome of quantity control is known. This observation
has been used to argue that if there is a possibility that the consequences of excessive
emissions are exceptionally serious, then quantity control is a better option. However,
observe that this argument is only valid if the quantity control is set to avoid excessive
emissions and excessive emissions are a possible outcome with price controls.
The global nature of the climate change problem requires an international solution.
Political issues are likely to rule out an international system of price control, and
individual incentives could undermine a decentralized system. These arguments point
toward an international version of the EU ETS cap-and-trade systems as the most likely
midterm policy solution.
26.7.5
Further Policies
If the government has access to sufﬁcient information (and can use this information cor-
rectly), then price and quantity controls will achieve optimal control of emissions even
in the presence of uncertainty. Unfortunately, information, such as the responsiveness
of ﬁrms and consumers to carbon taxes, is limited. This restricts the use of the instru-
ments. Policy choices are also limited by political feasibility and resistance to change.
For these reasons governments need to consider a range of policies to supplement the
basic interventions.
GHG emissions are generated from numerous sources and a wide variety of activi-
ties. The discussion of Pigouvian taxation in section 8.5 emphasized the importance of
differentiating taxes to achieve an efﬁcient outcome. Each tax must capture the ex-
ternality caused by the activity. This could potentially lead to the need for signiﬁcant
differentiation across sectors. In the case of climate change there is too little informa-
tion available to implement any degree of sophisticated differentiation. In other words,

940
Part IX: Applications
a uniform price or quantity control scheme may be too blunt for dealing with emis-
sions. This provides support for the introduction of regulations that can be more speciﬁc
to each activity. Governments currently use numerous regulatory policies to address
climate change. These include obligations on energy suppliers to improve the energy
efﬁciency of their customers, requirements on use of biofuels in petrol, and stringent
building regulations. These regulations should be seen as supporting the basic price or
quantity control.
An important component of any reduction in GHG emissions must be technological
advance. Government intervention to encourage technological change is justiﬁed only
if arguments can be advanced that market incentives are inadequate. There could be
several reasons for such market failure, including inability to appropriate gains and
asymmetric information. If market-driven change is too slow, then what is required is
support offered by governments to increase the rate of technology change. The problem
facing the government is knowing how to do this. There is a long history of mistakes
in government-sponsored technology projects. One prime example is the Concorde
project between the United Kingdom and France that developed a small, fast, expensive
aircraft just as the market was looking for large, economical aircraft to deliver cheaper
mass transport. It is clearly preferable to provide incentives for technological change,
such as tax breaks, and let the private sector ﬁnd the projects.
The discussion has explored a range of additional policies that can complement price
or quantity interventions. Two ﬁnal points can be made about policy choice. First, the
set policies need to be coherent and related to the speciﬁc market failures in each
case. Second, and more important, it is crucial that the set of policies operate in a
consistent way. For example, the European Union has the ETS, a 20 percent emissions
reduction target, a 20 percent renewables target for energy supply, and a 20 percent
energy efﬁciency target. These are all intended to be achieved in 2020. There is no
evidence that these are consistent targets, or that the policies designed to achieve them
will function coherently.
26.8
Conclusions
Writing a balanced chapter on the economics of climate policy is a challenging task.
The issue of climate change has polarized opinions with those on each side of the debate
taking entrenched positions. For some, climate change has become a dogma that accepts
no deviation from an agreed consensus. To these protagonists every unusual weather
event is further evidence of climate change and every academic study is behoven to

941
Chapter 26: Economics of Climate Change
discover evidence of climate damage. Any evidence that glaciers are not melting and
temperatures are not rising are simply inconvenient truths that cannot be allowed to
derail the climate bandwagon. Climate science can be likened to an industry engaged in
rent-seeking: the members of the industry need the hysteria to be sustained to continue
to receive ﬁnancial support. On the other side, the so-called deniers of climate change
are equally entrenched and vociferous with a blanket refusal to accept any evidence
whatsoever that supports the hypothesis of anthropogenic climate change.
The existence of these extremes does not assist the conduct of a balanced policy
debate. It is clearly correct to test the evidence on climate change; it is an academic
duty in fact to question any claim and subject it to the most rigorous scrutiny. This
is especially important when proposed policies could impose enormous present costs
in exchange for uncertain future returns. It has been suggested that the potential costs
of climate change are so large that we must act even though current knowledge is so
limited. But this is not the logic that economists would apply in any other area.
There is one point that is clear from our discussion of the economics of climate
policy. Economic analysis in this area is in the very early stages of development, and
much more work needs to be done to reﬁne predictions of economic costs. This will
be a difﬁcult task to perform with limited knowledge of how the climate will change
and how this change will affect economic activity. It is a task that needs completing
if policy is to be founded on a ﬁrm basis. The set of policy tools to secure emissions
reductions are known. What the analysis must do is secure international support for
their use and determine the level of intervention.

“My ﬁrst heresy says that all the fuss about global warming is grossly exaggerated. Here I am
opposing the holy brotherhood of climate model experts and the crowd of deluded citizens
who believe the numbers predicted by the climate models. Of course, they say, I have no
degree in meteorology and l am therefore not qualiﬁed to speak. But I have studied the climate
models and I know what they can do. The models solve the equations of ﬂuid dynamics, and
they do a very good job of describing the ﬂuid motions of the atmosphere and the oceans.
They do a very poor job of describing the clouds, the dust, the chemistry and the biology
of ﬁelds and farms and forests. They do not begin to describe the real world that we live
in.” (Freeman Dyson, theoretical physicist, 2009.) Discuss the relevance of these views for
planning a climate policy.
26.3
(Gollier) According to the Stern Review, if we don’t act quickly to reduce our emissions of
greenhouse gases, global warming will be damaging our economies by as much as 35 percent
of GDP by the year 2200. This cost includes reduced agricultural productivity, fatalities due
to natural catastrophes, damages to buildings, increased air conditioning, and the loss of
environmental assets. The Stern Review is much less optimistic than earlier studies on this
question. For example, Nordhaus (2007) estimated the cost of climate change at “only” 3
percent of global GDP, and a group of economists associated with Jorgenson predicted a net
beneﬁt of global warming for the US economy that could be as much as 1 percent of GDP
in some scenarios (Jorgenson et al. 2004). How do you explain such large differences in the
economic evaluations of the cost of global warming?
26.4
A project that will develop a very poor country provides beneﬁts of $5 million over the next
year (t = 0). However, the consequences will be severe environmental damage in 200 years
(t = 200). The present value of this damage evaluated at t = 200 is estimated to be $1 trillion
(1 followed by 12 zeros). There are no costs or beneﬁts between these two dates.
a. Is it worth undertaking the project at a 10 percent discount rate?
b. Is it worth undertaking the project at a 6 percent discount rate?
c. If 10 percent is the interest rate on private captial markets, is this the rate that should be
used?
d. What arguments can be made for using a lower discount rate?
e. Are these kinds of calculation the correct way to analyze the problem?
26.5
The socially efﬁcient discount rate in the Stern Review would be around 1.3 percent per year
(0.013). Would you ﬁnd such discount rate acceptable?
26.6
The Stern Review assumes that we are risk-averse, in that facing the risk of a loss is always
worse than incurring the mean loss with certainty. The difference between the two is the risk
premium (i.e., the willingness to pay to eliminate the risk). In the expected utility framework,
risk aversion is represented by a decreasing marginal utility of income, in that the chance of a
large positive deviation from the mean loss has a much larger negative effect on welfare than
the corresponding chance of a large negative deviation. What objections would you make to
the logarithmic utility of income used to determine the risk premium in the Stern Review?
26.7
Compute the discount factor
1
(1+r)t for values of the discount rate r = 1, 3.5, and 5 percent
interest rates and t = 20, 50, and 100 years. Do these computations show that the choice of
discount factor is important for the decision on whether to implement a (costly) policy now
that will only provide beneﬁts in the distant future?

Part IX: Applications
26.8
What are the implications of the the absence of scientiﬁc certainty about the impacts of
climate change on the optimal timing of the effort to curb emissions?
26.9
If global warming caused a 2 meter rise in worldwide sea level, what do you expect would
happen to the price of land? Could this be counted as a beneﬁt of climate change? What if
the rise in sea level was 20 meters?
26.10
Climate change involves intergenerational discounting to trade off costs and beneﬁts at dif-
ferent points in time. The theory of discounted utility is the most widely used approach to
make those intergenerational trade-offs. The commonly used discounting model assumes that
total utility can be decomposed into a weighted sum of utility in each period of time (Ramsey
1928):
Ut =
∞

τ=0
d(τ)ut+τ ,
where Ut is the total utility discounted from the perspective of the current time t, d(τ) is the
discount function, ut+τ is the instantaneous utility in period t + τ, and the ﬂow of utilities
is over an inﬁnite horizon for this intergenerational model. Time preferences are represented
by the rate at which the discount function declines, d′(τ) < 0.
a. The standard discount function is the exponential discount function d(τ) = δτ with
0 < δ < 1. In this case the discount factor, δ, is assumed to be independent of the time horizon.
Show that the exponential discount rate satisﬁes the property of dynamic consistency: that is,
preferences at one point in time do not change with the passage of time. To make your point,
consider a project that costs C at period t = 2 and produces a beneﬁt B at period t = 3.
Show that if the NP V of the project is positive at t = 0, then it will be positive at t = 1.
b. The exponential discount function is the only discount function that produces dynamically
consistent preferences. However, it fails to match some empirical regularities. Can you
provide some examples?
26.11
In making intertemporal trade-offs, people seem to be more impatient when making short-run
trade-offs (today vs. tomorrow) than when making long-run trade-offs (day 100 vs. day 101).
To match this empirical regularity, the following “generalized hyerbola” discount function
has been proposed:
d(τ) = (1 + ατ)−γ/α.
a. Show that this discount function displays a higher discount rate in the short run than in
the long run. For the special case of γ = α (so that d(τ) =
1
1+ατ ) plot the discount function
and compare it to exponential discounting.
b. Use a similar investment trade-off as in the previous exercise to show that such preferences
failtosatisfydynamicconsistency(i.e., thepassageoftimemaychangeaperson’spreferences
or change the NP V of a project from positive to negative).
26.12
Re-work the previous exercise with another non-exponential discount function. This is called
the quasi-hyperbolic discount function
d(τ) = 1
if τ = 0
= βδτ if τ = 1, 2 . . .
What is special about the case of β = 1?

26.13
(Geant, Guesnerie and Lasry, 2012) This exercise explores the role of the elasticity of sub-
stitution between goods and environment, μ, in the determination of the discount factor in
the long run. The utility function is given by
u(Ct, yt) =

C(μ−1)/μ
t
+ ¯Q(μ−1)/μμ/(μ−1).
where Ct is consumption at time t and ¯Q is the ﬁxed level of environmental quality.
Consumption, Ct, is assumed to grow at a constant rate
a. Consider the case of μ > 1. Write utility in terms of Ct and
¯Q
Ct . What happens to the
value of
 ¯Q
Ct
(μ−1)/μ
as t increases? What will happen to the level of utility as t in-
creases?
b. Now consider μ < 1. Write the utility function in terms of ¯Q and
¯Q
Ct . What happens to
the value of
 ¯Q
Ct
(1−μ)/μ
as t increases? What happens to the value of utility?
c. Explain the policy implications of these different results.
26.14
(Environmental Kuznets curve) The relation between environmenal quality and GDPis called
the environmental Kuznets curve. Such a curve can be drawn for a general measure of
environmental quality and for each pollutant separately.
a. Do you expect there to be a positive or a negative relationship between the gross domestic
product (GDP) of a country and environmental quality? Does the answer depend on whether
the country is developing or developed?
b. Will all pollutants for a given country have the same environmental Kuznets curves? If
so, what will their shapes be? As the country develops, will all pollutants be at the same point
on their curves?
c. If increased GDP is associated with improved environmental quality, does this imply that
a cleaner environment comes at no cost? If so, how can you explain the frequent objections
to the imposition of environmental regulations?
26.15
The idea behind “emission reduction” is that rather than deal with the consquences of emis-
sions, businesses should avoid the creation of emissions in the ﬁrst place by changing
production processes.
a. Firmscanusecarbon-capturetechnologiestocapturecarbonthatwouldotherwiseenterthe
atmosphere. It is valid to argue that emissions represent waste, so should reducing emissions
reduce costs?
b. A ﬁrm is observed to reduce costs and increase proﬁts through emission reduction. Is
the only explanation for this observation that the ﬁrm was operating inefﬁciently before
implementing emission reduction?
26.16
An economy has two industries, i = 1, 2. One industry is competitive, the other industry
is a monopoly. The demand functions for the products of the industries are described as
pi = a −byi, where yi is the output of industry i. There are constant returns to scale in
both industries, with a marginal cost constant at c. Each ﬁrm produces emissions equal to its
level of output. Each unit of emissions causes a loss in consumer welfare of egi. In order to
produce, a ﬁrm must have a quantity of pollution permits equal to the quantity of emissions.
The government chooses to make a quantity of permits, Z, available.

946
Part IX: Applications
a. If the permits are allocated by the government directly to ﬁrms with no trading permitted,
what is the efﬁcient allocation of licences?
b. If the permits are allocated but can then be traded, what is the efﬁcient allocation and the
resulting allocation after trade?
c. If the permits are auctioned, what is the resulting allocation?
d. Which process for allocating permits is most efﬁcient?
