Screenwriting 101
Mastering the Art of Story
T
he goal of this course is to teach you how to write any kind of 
feature film or TV pilot script by using a  technique employed 
by scriptwriters from Shakespeare to Pixar: reverse engineering. 
Aristotle outlined this technique in the ancient world. It remains at the 
center of the empirical method used by modern story scientists to 
analyze narratives today.
The opening two lectures cover the basic two-step process for applying 
reverse engineering to film and TV scripts:
First, identify as precisely as possible the unique emotion, mood, 
or other psychological effect generated by the script. Does the 
script generate wonder, suspense, romance, or something else?
Second, work back to isolate the unique blend of story 
components that create this psychological effect, just like a chef 
works back from a particular flavor to identify the unique mix of 
ingredients that produced it.
The next four lectures organize the ingredients of scripts into four major 
story components: story world, character, plot, and tone. You will learn 
to create new story worlds by modifying the rules of comedy, tragedy, 
horror, and any other kind of story genre. You will learn how to establish 
main characters, minor characters, and antagonists, and how to create 
their action and dialogue. You will see how to plot scenes and full-
length scripts by starting from the final scene and working back. And 
you will learn how to wield a screenwriter’s most powerful tool, tone, by 
creating a narrator who helps the reader see just how the script should 
be filmed.

2
Course Scope
In the following 12 lectures on film, you will practice the course’s method 
for analyzing and writing scripts by applying it to a dozen film scripts 
that have been selected by the Writers’ Guild of America as some of 
the best of all time. In each case, the lecture will identify the special 
psychological effect of each script and trace it back to its own special 
blueprint of story world, character, plot, and tone. This provides you 
with a blueprint to produce work like each script yourself. More broadly, 
it gives you a general method for writing like any script you choose.
In the next five lectures on TV, you will learn about the major innovation 
of TV writing: a story engine that allows TV writers to generate hour 
after hour of consistent material without ever falling into formulaic plots. 
You will see the general qualities of all TV engines and then learn the 
specific features of the TV engines that drive cable dramas like Game 
of Thrones, sitcoms like The Simpsons, procedurals like CSI, and prime-
time soap operas like Grey’s Anatomy.
The final lecture provides some practical tips for using this course to 
increase your appreciation of films and TV, for honing your own personal 
storytelling style, and for writing a film or TV script and getting it out 
into the world.■

LECTURE 1
THINKING LIKE 
A SCREENWRITER
T
here are three main benefits to studying scripts. The first is that 
studying scripts can boost your storytelling powers. The second 
is that it deepens your appreciation of films and TV. The third 
benefit is that studying scripts can help you learn how to write them 
yourself. This course is designed to help you gain all three of these 
benefits. They all start from the same place: breaking down scripts to 
see how they work.

﻿Lecture 1   •   Thinking like a Screenwriter
EFFECTIVE STORIES
n   
n
To grasp the secret of an effective story, let go of the widely peddled 
cliché that there’s a universal set of formulas for all great stories. 
Story structure is not a  preprogrammed, eternal piece of neural 
hardware. It’s better understood as a flexible form of software that 
your brain uses to map the world and imagine different pathways 
through it.
n   
n
Since the world is tremendously big and forever changing, and 
since the possibilities for human action are open-ended and always 
increasing, your brain is capable of deploying an endless number 
of story forms and structures.
n   
n
This diversity is exciting and liberating. But it also poses 
a  major practical challenge: If there isn’t one master narrative 
for every good story, then how do you learn to become a more 
effective storyteller?
n   
n
To discover your own most effective stories, use the technique 
known as reverse engineering. It goes all the way back to the 
ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle. In his Poetics, Aristotle 
gathered up the most popular scripts of his time and decided to 
figure out the nuts and bolts of how they worked.
n   
n
To do that, he started by observing that tragedies had a  pair of 
cognitive effects on audiences. The two cognitive effects were pity 
and fear. Aristotle then traced these two neural outcomes back 
to a specific plot event called an anagnorisis, in which a character 
has a tragic epiphany. An example is the moment when Oedipus 
suddenly realizes that he has fulfilled the ancient prophecy that 
he’s tried to escape all his life: that he’ll kill his father and sleep with 
his mother.

5
﻿Lecture 1   •   Thinking like a Screenwriter
n   
n
Aristotle’s analysis of Oedipus is the most ancient example of the 
simple two-step process of reverse engineering a script. First, you 
identify the script’s cognitive effect. A cognitive effect is anything 
that happens in the brain: emotions, feelings, moods, attitudes, 
and perceptions.
n   
n
Second, once you’ve identified the script’s cognitive effect, you 
trace it back to the particular story structure in the script that 
causes that effect. Aristotle identified two cognitive effects, fear 
and pity, and traced them back to specific features of the plot.
n   
n
Aristotle’s method of reverse engineering stories is still going 
strong today. It’s used by theorists and by practitioners like the 
screenwriters in the story labs of Pixar. Whether you want to analyze 
stories or create them, Aristotle’s ancient method is still very much 
on the cutting edge.
BENEFITS OF REVERSE ENGINEERING
n   
n
From a screenwriter’s perspective, the value of reverse engineering 
is that it allows you to recreate the brilliant effects of your favorite 
scripts without plagiarizing them. If you use reverse engineering 
to go beneath the script’s surface, you can discover its deeper 
creative logic, coming to understand why the author made the 
choices that she did.
n   
n
Reverse engineering will also allow you to develop your own original 
voice. It gives you the freedom to choose your own storytelling 
models because the premise of reverse engineering is that there 
are endless ways to write a good story.
n   
n
Lastly, reverse engineering helps you glimpse the deeper intentions 
of the authors you emulate, allowing you to do what those authors 
did while making your own unique story choices and innovations.

7
FORMATTING
n   
n
Before this course moves on into the specifics 
of screenwriting, it’s important to cover one 
practical thing you’ll need to learn to start 
writing screenplays yourself: formatting. The 
format of scripts can seem like a  daunting 
technical exercise, but don’t let it intimidate you.
n   
n
Back in the days of the old studio system, 
there were a  lot of hard and fast rules about 
formatting. The margins needed to be just so, 
one page of screenplay needed to translate to 
one minute of screen time, and so on. That’s 
because everyone at the studio spoke the same 
language; every film was made by the same 
people, working on the same assembly line.
n   
n
But the 1970s, that assembly line was broken 
apart. The talent agencies pulled the actors, 
the directors, and the writers out of studio 
contracts. Now, story development, financing, 
and even production are increasingly done 
outside the studios.
n   
n
Occasionally, studios still develop, finance, 
produce, and distribute a  movie from start 
to finish. But most of the time, they partner 
with outside producers and financiers. As 
a  result, the rules for formatting have 
become looser. So don’t worry too much 
about the byzantine intricacies of formatting. 
Since your first script will almost certainly be 
read more for the story than for anything else, 
focus on communicating that story, not on 
getting your margins exactly right.

8
﻿Lecture 1   •   Thinking like a Screenwriter
n   
n
But even so, there are a  few basic rules that almost every 
script observes. The first rule of formatting is to get yourself 
a  screenwriting program. This will do most of the formatting 
automatically, saving you endless wasted time and effort. Current 
examples include programs from Google Docs, Amazon Storywriter, 
and Final Draft (the industry standard); many more are out there.
n   
n
Now for writing a  scene. Each scene begins with a  slugline, and 
each slugline has three main parts. The first part of the slugline 
is EXT. for exterior if the scene is outside or INT. for interior if 
it’s inside. Sometimes, EXT/INT is appropriate if the scene shifts 
between the two.
n   
n
The second part of the slugline is the physical location, like Andy’s 
Bedroom or Fargo, North Dakota. The final part of the slugline is 
the time mark. This is often DAY or NIGHT, to let the crew know 
whether they need to prep the set for noon or midnight.
n   
n
The time mark can also be CONT. for continuous if it follows 
immediately after the scene before. And it can also be: MOMENTS 
LATER or MINUTES LATER or NEXT DAY if that’s the best way to 
communicate the time at which it happens.
n   
n
After the slugline, there are two big types of script content. The first 
kind of content is scene descriptions or action beats. An example: 
“A car bursts through the curtain of snow.”
n   
n
Action is always in the present tense, and you can use capital letters 
to highlight important beats or objects in the action or descriptions: 
“A car BURSTS through the curtain of snow.” Just don’t overdo it 
with the capital letters.
n   
n
The second kind of script content is dialogue. The first dialogue 
component you’ll enter is the character’s name in capital letters. 
In many programs, to begin this step, just hit tab to enter the 
character’s name. You’ll then hit return and enter their words. (Note: 
These instructions may vary between programs.)

9
﻿Lecture 1   •   Thinking like a Screenwriter
n   
n
In general, don’t explain what the camera does; that’s the director’s 
job. Your job is to describe the scene with enough visual flair that 
the director can see what the camera should see.
n   
n
To begin your script, you can write instructions like FADE IN or 
COLD OPEN. Alternately, you can just start without any of those 
directions, allowing the director to make the call.
n   
n
If you have more technical formatting questions, study a few of your 
favorite screenplays and crib from them. If you can’t find an answer 
to your formatting question in these screenplays, the chances are 
it’s not that big of a deal. In that case, do whatever makes most 
sense to you.
 
EXERCISE
1	
Obtain a  screenwriting program. Practice formatting 
a scene, starting with a slugline and including several scene 
descriptions or action beats and some dialogue.
2	
Get a  copy of one of your favorite scripts. Then, retype 
its opening scene in Final Draft or your own screenwriting 
program to get a  feel for how the format works. Second, 
rewatch part of the final film onscreen, and then type up 
another scene. Next, compare it with the original script.

LECTURE 2
REVERSE 
ENGINEERING 
SUCCESSFUL SCRIPTS
I
f you want to become a more effective storyteller, the first step is 
to learn to differentiate between all the different cognitive effects 
that stories can create. The second step is to trace these differences 
back to their own special forms of story structure, the unique recipes 
that make them work. By repeating the two-step process of tracing 
cognitive effects back to story structures, you can reverse engineer 
a  huge catalog of blueprints for moving people’s hearts and minds. 
To get you started on this personal guide, this lecture goes back to 
the dawn of scriptwriting to reverse engineer three major storytelling 
innovations from Greek tragedy and comedy.

ANCIENT ATHENS
n   
n
Ancient Athens is as far back as the recorded history of scripts 
goes. Athenians can seem rather traditional today, but they were 
incredible, dynamic innovators. The innovations of ancient Greek 
playwrights continue to form the basis for a huge variety of scripts 
today. Therefore, the Greeks can teach some enduring recipes for 
story. They can also show how to innovate.
n   
n
There is one major difference between the cognitive effects that 
these ancient plays cause. Some of the scripts make people smile. 
The others make people weep. The Greeks called the first kind 
comedy and the second kind tragedy.
n   
n
Human brains are primordially wired to separate the world into 
sources of pleasure and pain, and so it’s revealing that the most 
ancient forms of scripts were developed to carry people toward 
both of these destinations.
n   
n
This is the earliest empirical evidence that there isn’t one best kind 
of script, because scripts have worked from the very beginning to 
touch the full capacity of human experience. They don’t privilege 
good experiences over bad. They engage with all that human 
minds can do.
n   
n
When the ancients wanted to write tragedies, they told stories 
about the crushing power of the heavens. For example, sometimes 
gods like Dionysus would literally impose themselves upon the 
characters onstage.
n   
n
Since comedies elicit the opposite cognitive effect from tragedies, 
one would expect them to flip the plot structure of tragedy. In fact, 
that’s what the earliest comic scripts do. Instead of imposing the 
heavens down on the earth, they imprint earth up on the heavens. 
For example, the ancient comedy Frogs bestows a case of intestinal 
diarrhea upon immortal Dionysus. In other words, it inflicts a human 
condition up onto a god.
n   
n
These stories are inverted tragedies. Instead of crushing down 
human life, they let it burst heavenward, which is why these stories 
bring pleasure, not pain.
n   
n
That, in its broadest form, is the method of reverse engineering: 
taking a  body of scripts, discriminating between their cognitive 
effects, and tracing those effects back to differences in their 
story structure.

14
﻿Lecture 2  •  Reverse Engineering Successful Scripts
INNOVATION IN OEDIPUS
n   
n
This lecture now turns to the first of three Greek innovations by 
reverse engineering perhaps the most iconic of all Greek tragedies: 
Oedipus. The end of Oedipus has an instructional final cognitive 
effect. The chorus at the end of Oedipus reveals that the story has 
been a reminder that people should temper their joy because at 
any moment, life can deliver unhappy shocks.
n   
n
The next step in reverse engineering it to ask: How does Oedipus’s 
script carry people into a  more restrained emotional state? One 
way the script creates this effect is with its plot twist.

15
﻿Lecture 2  •  Reverse Engineering Successful Scripts
n   
n
The original prophecy is that Oedipus will kill his father and sleep 
with his mother. But nothing in the prophecy prepares people for 
when Oedipus realizes that he’s done these things: He grabs his 
mother’s broaches and plunges them, per the script, “straight into 
his eyeballs.”
n   
n
This grisly detail doesn’t exist in the ancient prophecy, and it 
also doesn’t exist in the earlier Homeric story about Oedipus. 
The writer, Sophocles, specifically decided to include it in his script. 
This choice is a powerful way to generate the final cognitive effect 
that his script was aiming for.
INNOVATION IN THE BACCHAE
n   
n
The second of this lecture’s innovations comes from Euripides’s 
script, The Bacchae. Unlike the other scripts of its time, which either 
stimulated pleasure or pain, The Bacchae did both. It was half 
tragedy but also half comedy—a tragicomedy.
n   
n
What story innovation allowed Euripides to create this new 
cognitive effect? The answer lies in the ending. The Bacchae tells 
the story of how the divinely intoxicated worshippers of the god 
Dionysus tear a skeptical king into pieces with their bare hands.
n   
n
One of the intoxicated worshippers who rips apart the king’s body 
is his own mother. In the final moments of the play, she appears 
on stage, triumphantly holding his head. On the other side of the 
stage, her father enters, holding the king’s arms and legs and 
weeping for the death of his grandson.
n   
n
The same situation gives one character joy and another character 
misery. There’s pain on one side of the stage and pleasure on 
the other. Because the audience sees both sides of the stage 
simultaneously, they experience pleasure and pain coming from 
a single story event: the death of the king.

16
﻿Lecture 2  •  Reverse Engineering Successful Scripts
n   
n
The innovation: Euripides built a  plot that split the audience’s 
perspective between two main characters. On one side was 
a  traditional male of Thebes, who saw the world as he always 
had. On the other was a female worshipper of Dionysus, who saw 
everything the opposite. To her, violence was love, femininity was 
power, and human loss was divine redemption.
n   
n
This split paved the way for an ending where one character saw 
tragedy as tragedy and the other character saw tragedy as 
comedy. A  new scriptwriting technique was born. If you want to 
create a tragicomic effect in your own scripts, imitate the structure 
of The Bacchae and create two main characters who experience 
the same thing oppositely, giving the audience two ways to see it 
too. An example of a modern work that does this is the film Eternal 
Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.

17
﻿Lecture 2  •  Reverse Engineering Successful Scripts
INNOVATION IN COMEDY
n   
n
At around the time that Alexander the Great pacified Athens in 
335 BCE, scriptwriters started penning comic plays whose happy 
endings had a  very different cognitive effect from the original 
comedies crafted in the days of Athenian democracy. The happy 
endings of the older comedies had triggered an almost manic 
sense of euphoria. The happy endings of the newer comedies were 
more sedate, generating a feeling of satisfied contentment.
n   
n
What was the big innovation in story structure that caused this? 
Speaking broadly, the big difference between the two kinds of 
comedy is the problem or crisis that initiates the plot. In older 
comedies, of which the surviving examples are all written by 
Aristophanes, the plot begins with an apparently intractable real-
world problem like war or famine or civic corruption.
n   
n
These problems are so daunting that most sensible members of 
the audience have already despaired of solving them. Therefore, 
the comedies involve a  slightly lunatic main character: Only 
such a  character would tackle a  problem that everyone else has 
abandoned as unsolvable. The manic character then sets off 
to solve this problem in a  highly eccentric way, for example by 
building a city in the clouds or by journeying into the underworld.
n   
n
And as the absurd solution grows more detailed and intricate, it 
gradually pushes aside the real world with its own zany laws of 
physics, until anything seems possible and the original problem is 
solved not literally but imaginatively. For example, at the end of the 
script for Frogs, the hero rescues a dead playwright from hell. At 
the end of Lysistrata, the inveterate foes of Athens and Sparta join 
in a dance. At the end of Birds, a man sprouts wings and becomes 
king of the gods.
n   
n
Step by step by step, the plots of these scripts shatter normal 
sense of logic, catapulting the audience into a  place of fantasy 
where anything seems possible. This is why these older comedies 
generate a cognitive effect of manic euphoria.

18
﻿Lecture 2  •  Reverse Engineering Successful Scripts
n   
n
In contrast, the structure of the newer comedies—the most popular 
of which were written by the playwright Menander—have plots 
aren’t initiated by an impossible problem. They’re set in motion 
by a problem that the audience knows can be easily solved. For 
example, these scripts begin with a  misunderstanding, a  rash 
promise, or some other instance of personal cluelessness where 
an otherwise normal individual drags himself or herself into an 
unnecessary mistake.
n   
n
Normally, in the case of a  small error, people should just admit 
the mistake and move one. But sometimes they’re too proud or 
embarrassed to do that, so they keep going, compounding the 
error. Finally, the whole unnecessary problem becomes such a big 
headache that people throw up our hands, admit they messed up, 
and ask for forgiveness from everyone they inconvenienced.
n   
n
That is the plot of the newer Greek comedies: A  minor mistake 
gets compounded out of vanity or shame, until at last, the 
person admits their error, everybody forgives them, and there’s 
a closing celebration.
n   
n
This newer plot isn’t about motivating audiences to believe that 
the impossible is possible. It’s about encouraging people to stop 
mucking up their lives unnecessarily. The psychological experience 
of the newer comedy is a feeling of things getting back to way they 
should be. Instead of being a  delirious triumph, it’s a  humbling 
sense of relief.
n   
n
This new kind of comedy proved so popular that it has become the 
basis of most modern sitcoms and romantic comedies. For example, 
there’s The 40-Year-Old Virgin. Here, the unnecessary problem 
is that the main character is too embarrassed to confess his total 
lack of sexual experience. The more he won’t admit it, the more 
ridiculous his difficulties become. Finally, at the end, he confesses, 
and the problem of his virginity dissolves.

effect that makes it different from other films that are 
similar, but not quite the same? Can you create your own 
original story ending that gives you that same distinct 
cognitive effect?
2	
Make a list of two or three of your favorite endings. What 
do they not have in common? What’s special or unique 
about the way they make you feel? Can you connect those 
differences to a difference in their plot or story structure?

LECTURE 3
BUILDING YOUR 
STORY WORLD
T
his lecture covers where most scripts start: the story world, or 
world for short. In a  superficial sense, the story world is the 
physical space where the story occurs. That’s why many movies 
begin with an establishing shot of a  city or a  wild outback or some 
other geographical place. But the real world of a story is much deeper 
than just this physical space. The real world of a story is the rules of 
this space, which govern what kinds of action happen here. There are 
endless story worlds that scripts can create. But the one thing they all 
have in common is that their rules are established crisply and clearly 
at the beginning of the story. These rules provide the context for the 
audience to appreciate what follows.

22
﻿Lecture 3  •  Building Your Story World
THE RULES
n   
n
To figure out how to help your audience orient, think of the rules of 
a story world as the rules of a game. You’ll want to keep the rules 
simple. This allows audiences to jump right in. Think, for example, 
of tic-tac-toe. The rules are so simple they take only a few moments 
to learn.
n   
n
Writers need to balance the simplicity of their rules with some 
open-endedness. The action has to be able to surprise. But 
crucially, this does not mean that writers can create the rules as 
they go along. The goal is to lay out a few simple rules that allow 
for complex, unpredictable outcomes so that your audience never 
feels trapped or bored.
n   
n
If you introduce the rules of your world in the opening few pages of 
your script, audiences will always accept them. They’ll accept that 
superheroes can die or that cartoons can come alive.
n   
n
Think about the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark, when Indiana Jones 
rides on a submarine toward a secret island where the Nazis have the 
Biblical chest containing the remnants of the Ten Commandments. 
This is not a  very plausible scene, yet the audience’s hearts race 
in genuine suspense for Indiana’s situation. That’s because in the 
opening moments of the script, we’ve seen that he inhabits a world 
where brilliant supervillians meddle with archaeological treasures in 
exotic locales.
n   
n
Keep in mind that you don’t have to create your story worlds from 
scratch. You can borrow the rules of an existing story genre that 
lays down the basic rules for superheroes, secret agents, fairytale 
princesses, and all sorts of other exotic characters.
n   
n
You simply have to begin your script by signaling that it’s part of 
a preexisting story genre, allowing you to import the big rules of 
that story world into your own. Then, illustrate the one way in which 
your story world is different.

23
﻿Lecture 3  •  Building Your Story World
n   
n
Three huge archetypes—the tragic, comic, and heroic—provide 
the deep foundation for the story worlds of most film scripts today. 
The remainder of this lecture will focus on those.
TRAGEDY
n   
n
The most ancient complete tragedy available is Aeschylus’s 
Oresteia. Although readers can’t say exactly what the story world 
of tragedy looked like before the Oresteia, it certainly emphasized 
the power of the gods over the mortals beneath. The script for the 
Oresteia adopts this basic genre rule by beginning with a  night 
watchman who looks up at the almighty heavens and bemoans his 
helpless lot below.
n   
n
The script adds its own special twist to the existing rules of 
tragedy by revealing the particular form of the watchman’s earthly 
helplessness: He’s stuck on a castle roof, waiting for a signal. That 
signal will be conveyed by a row of signal stations that stretch from 
Troy to Greece, so that a chain of signal lights will reach across the 
known world, telling the watchman what to do.
n   
n
The simple dramatic action of the signal lights immediately 
suggests that the new rule of this story world is that no action is 
arbitrary. It’s part of a chain reaction where the actions of the past 
return in the present and echo into the future, just like those signal 
lights repeat.
n   
n
And this chain reaction is in fact exactly what happens in the script. 
First, a  king murders his daughter to get good sailing winds for 
Troy. Then, the king returns from Troy and is murdered by his wife, 
who is then in turn killed by her avenging son. One family killing 
begets another.
n   
n
Therein lies the two-step method for establishing a story world. First, 
the Oresteia aligns itself with an established genre or subgenre: 
tragedy. Second, it creates its own new rule: the cascading actions.

25
﻿Lecture 3  •  Building Your Story World
n   
n
After Aeschylus innovated tragedy with his 
leaping 
signal 
lights, 
subsequent 
Greek 
scriptwriters used the same two-step method 
to create their own new directions for tragedy.
n   
n
The enormous effectiveness of this two-step 
method has led to its use by every single Oscar-
winning tragic script that Hollywood has ever 
produced. Take perhaps the most legendary 
tragedy in Hollywood history: the script for 
Citizen Kane.
n   
n
The opening scene of Kane introduces a “great 
castle,” just like the great castles walked by 
the opening watchmen of the Oresteia. And 
just like the Oresteia, the story world of Kane 
reechoes the crimes of the past in the present, 
as the willingness of Kane senior to trade family 
for money repeats itself in his son’s destruction 
of his own relationships.
n   
n
But then the opening of Kane adds its own twist 
to this preexisting story world by revealing that 
Kane’s castle differs in one crucial way from the 
castles of previous tragic scripts. Kane’s castle 
has not been handed down from generation to 
generation. Instead, one man has built Kane’s 
castle from scratch in a single generation.
n   
n
The script for Kane reveals that the new rule 
of its story world will be that individuals can 
achieve an enormous power that carries them 
beyond being kings into becoming gods, 
achieving spectacular, self-wrought forms of 
destruction. Their wealth unlocks their most 
personal desires, which return ironically to 
demolish them.

26
﻿Lecture 3  •  Building Your Story World
COMEDY
n   
n
Comedy, like tragedy, comes in endless flavors and subgenres, 
the most popular of which has proven to be romantic comedy. 
Romantic comedy has existed since the 4th century BCE, and since 
its inception, its usual ending has been a wedding. To make that 
wedding seem a plausible and a happy ending, romantic comedies 
almost always begin by introducing the lovers as adult children, 
that is, as the explicit offspring of a previous marriage.
n   
n
This opening establishes marriage as the deep rule that brought 
the lovers into being and that will allow them to bring forth children 
of their own, creating a story world where love triumphs generation 
after generation after generation.
n   
n
This rule of romantic comedy has been successfully repeated 
for thousands of years, inspiring writers from the ancient Greeks 
to Shakespeare to Oscar Wilde to begin their scripts with adult 
children. But here and there, scriptwriters have found clever ways 
to tweak that opening rule. This opens new story worlds that allow 
for happy endings that depart from the old traditional wedding.
n   
n
For example, the script for Shakespeare in Love starts with a clever 
scene where a gang of men torture a theater owner with hot coals, 
until the theater owner saves his skin by claiming to have a  new 
comedy by William Shakespeare that promises: “Mistaken identities, 
a shipwreck, a pirate king, a bit with a dog, and love triumphant!”
n   
n
This opening beat establishes that the old comic rule of triumphant 
love still exists in the script’s cynical story world of greed and 
violence. But it also establishes that the rule exists in a new form: 
Triumphant love isn’t to be found in marriage. It’s to be found in the 
words and performances of the stage.

27
﻿Lecture 3  •  Building Your Story World
n   
n
With this new rule, the script for Shakespeare in Love opens up 
a  new story world where lovers can experience a  consummation 
in art that can’t exist in marriage. This allows for an ending where 
two characters who are married to other people nevertheless join 
hearts onstage. By making one opening tweak to the rules, the 
script finds an original way for love to reign triumphant.
HEROIC
n   
n
The two-step method allows you to innovate any genre you want. 
But you also use this method to bring whole new genres into being. 
The most spectacular historical example of this creative possibility 
is the heroic genre. The heroic genre emerged after comedy and 
tragedy in opposition to them.
n   
n
In comedy and tragedy, the main 
characters are eventually forced by the 
action of the plot to conform to the big 
rules of their story world. But in heroic 
scripts, the opposite happens: The 
main characters change the world.
n   
n
At the end of the 16th century, the 
English writer Christopher Marlowe 
wrote several tragic scripts about 
rebels with seductively forward-
looking beliefs. Marlowe’s tragic 
hero Tamburlaine challenges the 
feudal belief that a  peasant must 
always remain a  peasant. And 
Marlowe’s anti-hero Doctor Faustus 
makes a demonic pact out of disgust 
with the outdated dogma of medieval 
schools. But Marlowe’s rebel characters 
were still doomed to destruction because 
they inhabited tragic story worlds that treated 
innovation as impossible.

28
﻿Lecture 3  •  Building Your Story World
n   
n
A few years after Marlowe, Shakespeare changed the rules. In 
Henry IV, he introduced a man who made himself king and then 
passed his crown onto his son, altering the old tragic rule that the 
present must echo the past. In the old story world, individuals 
were a product of their environment. In the new story world, their 
environment would be a product of them.
n   
n
With this one simple change to the previous rules of tragedy, 
Shakespeare ushered in a whole new genre, the heroic. It inspired 
modern Hollywood scripts as varied as Casablanca, Die Hard, and 
Pulp Fiction.
n   
n
Heroic story worlds can be established and innovated through the 
two-part method of importing preexisting genre rules and then 
establishing a new rule. The one difference is that the new heroic 
rule isn’t there from the get-go of the story world. Instead, it’s 
added to the story world over the course of the plot by the actions 
of a hero or heroes.
n   
n
Here’s how it works in Lawrence of Arabia. The script opens 
on Lawrence’s death and subsequent funeral, where men who 
never knew him dismiss his achievements. This script begins 
by summoning up Hamlet’s old tragic rule that men die and are 
forgotten.
n   
n
But after the funeral, Lawrence challenges this tragic rule by 
returning from the dead in an extended flashback that becomes 
the rest of the movie. As Lawrence acts in more and more 
unforgettable ways in the flashback, he transforms himself into an 
enduring legend, until finally, at the end of the script, he meets the 
one man who spoke well of him in the opening scene of Lawrence’s 
future funeral.
n   
n
This is the first occasion in their lives that the two men have ever 
met—but somehow Lawrence remembers the other man. How 
could this possibly be? Lawrence’s chronology-busting memory is 
the script’s way of telling us that Lawrence has seen the opening 
scene of the script. He was there at his own funeral, and so really, 
this has not been a flashback.

29
﻿Lecture 3  •  Building Your Story World
n   
n
This has been a resurrection, because Lawrence has lived beyond 
death, changing the tragic rule of individual destruction into 
a heroic rule of time-defying immortality, as if Hamlet had risen to 
life to recount his own story at the end of Shakespeare’s script.

LECTURE 4
DEVELOPING YOUR 
CHARACTERS
C
haracters are the key ingredients to most successful stories. If 
you create an engaging character, audiences will follow them 
anywhere. Characters set something apart, and scripts typically 
introduce world before they introduce character. The world is the 
standard state of affairs and the way things usually work. By laying out 
the story world first, a script provides the norm against which characters 
can establish their own uniqueness. In this lecture, you’ll discover the 
recipe for creating compelling characters and putting them in your 
scripts. The recipe has three ingredient techniques. Two are essential 
for every character, and the third is an optional but powerful technique.

32
﻿Lecture 4  •  Developing Your Characters
CONFLICT
n   
n
The first technique for creating a  character is to establish the 
character through conflict with something else. Since you want your 
main characters to stick out most of all, their conflict should be with 
the entire story world.
n   
n
The bigness of this conflict signals the character’s own importance, 
which is why the traditional two-step beginning for a script is an 
opening scene where minor characters introduce the rules of a story 
world and a  second scene that introduces the main character in 
conflict with one of those rules.
n   
n
An example: The first scene of Hamlet introduces the tragic rule 
of its story world through Horatio and the watchmen. The second 
scene introduces the title character as he challenges the story 
world’s rote action with his own independent thought.
n   
n
This means that to locate your main character’s conflict, you 
can reverse engineer back from the rules of your story world to 
create a character who opposes one or more of these rules. For 
example, if you have a  story world of conquering male knights, 
the reverse-engineered main character could be a  female who 
dismisses chivalry as a load of empty posturing. That’s Beatrice in 
Shakespeare’s Much Ado about Nothing.
n   
n
Alternately, if you’d prefer to come up with your main character 
before you design your story world, flip the process and reverse 
engineer the rules of your story world to oppose your main 
character. However you get there, the important thing is the conflict.
n   
n
This conflict causes characters to resist their world, consciously 
or unconsciously, and then either to change it or be changed by 
it. The conflict between the main characters and the story world 
generates the plot.

33
﻿Lecture 4  •  Developing Your Characters
n   
n
To establish smaller characters, you reverse engineer their conflicts 
as well. Antagonists are reverse engineered to be in conflict with 
the main character, which is to say that antagonists embody the 
rule of the story world that the main character opposes. Meanwhile, 
minor characters typically share the main character’s conflict with 
the story world, only to a lesser degree.

34
﻿Lecture 4  •  Developing Your Characters
FEAR
n   
n
The second big technique is to reverse engineer the deep fear that 
drives the character into conflict. Fear is the deepest psychological 
level of every character; it’s the force that propels them to act as 
they do.
n   
n
This might seem a rather dark view of characters. But when you’re 
building your characters, you want to think of them primarily as 
creatures of fear for two biological reasons.
  
 
First, fears are the most powerful drivers of human behavior. 
Our hopes and desires are essential for us to thrive, but before 
we can thrive, we first need to stay alive. And because our fears 
are our guardians against death and destruction, they motivate 
our most revealing, urgent, and extraordinary acts.
  
 The second reason to build your characters out of their fears is 
because these fears are what cognitively bonds audiences to 
characters, making them care.
n   
n
After you reverse-engineer your character’s conflict, the next step is 
to reverse-engineer their deep fear. For example, what kind of fear 
could drive a man to hate a time of love? He would be afraid that 
his physical appearance makes him unlovable. That’s Shakespeare’s 
Richard III.
  
 
What kind of fear could drive a slave to disobey his master? 
A fear of losing his own self-respect. That’s the comic character 
Pseudolus.
  
 
What kind of fear could drive a woman to mock male courtesy? 
A  fear of having her heart broken again by empty promises. 
That’s Beatrice in Much Ado About Nothing.

35
﻿Lecture 4  •  Developing Your Characters
n   
n
Then after you reverse engineer this deep fear, lay a  quick beat 
into your script to reveal it right after you introduce your character. 
A  simple gesture or moment of dialogue is enough to establish 
the fear.
SOLILOQUIES
n   
n
The first two techniques encourage audiences to feel for a character. 
That is, they encourage what story scientists call empathy. The 
optional third technique encourages audiences to identify with 
a character. It goes beyond empathy and into what story scientists 
call sympathy.
n   
n
Empathy and sympathy have colloquial meanings, but these 
lectures use the two terms in a rigorous, technical sense. Empathy 
is when you feel for a character. Sympathy is when you feel with 
a  character. For example, imagine that a  character feels fear. If 
you have empathy for the character, then you feel sorrow or pity 
or outrage for her fear. But if you have sympathy for the character, 
then you literally feel her fear.
n   
n
Sympathy is the most powerful kind of psychological connection 
a script can engineer. The secret blueprint to doing it is to write 
a  soliloquy. In these lectures, a  soliloquy is when a  character 
expresses a conflict between two deep fears.
n   
n
A soliloquy is both a dialogue and a monologue; it’s a back-and-
forth that one character has as their two deepest fears vie against 
each other. So a soliloquy shows that a character isn’t just afraid of 
one thing—the character is caught between two things he fears.
n   
n
To create these moments of sympathy, modern scripts occasionally 
include full-blown, traditional soliloquies, like in the Oscar-winning 
script for Birdman. The character Riggan argues with his superhero 
alter ego, torn between his fear that he won’t be respected as an 
artist and his fear of being a nobody.

36
﻿Lecture 4  •  Developing Your Characters
n   
n
But modern scripts are also filled with clever ways to mimic 
soliloquies, like The Sopranos does with Tony’s therapy sessions, 
or like Sex and the City does with voiceovers. Voiceovers are often 
mistakenly accused of being a  writer’s crutch, but they are an 
incredibly useful tool for generating sympathy. Watch an episode 
of The Wonder Years or Scrubs or My So-Called Life for examples.
n   
n
Scripts can also simulate soliloquies simply by showing a character 
acting in a conflicted way. If a character hesitates outside a door, 
or buys a gift and then throws it out, or goes on dates with two 
very different people, that can prompt the viewer to imagine 
the unspoken conflict of fears in the character’s mind, triggering 
a moment of identification.

37
﻿Lecture 4  •  Developing Your Characters
n   
n
Since soliloquies are so powerful, you might be tempted to use 
them all the time. But more sympathy isn’t always better, and 
many powerful scripts don’t use sympathy at all. The reason: 
Sympathy is less effective than simple empathy at generating 
certain other cognitive effects. So don’t fall into the trap of thinking 
that sympathy is always better than empathy. From a storytelling 
perspective, they’re just different tools with different uses.
DIALOGUE
n   
n
Creating and introducing a character is only the beginning. After 
that comes every action they have to perform and every word they 
have to say. So how do you write all those story beats and their 
accompanying dialogue?
n   
n
To write these beats and dialogue, return to the three big 
techniques. To know what your characters will do or say in any 
given moment, you have to enter their minds. And the way to enter 
a character’s mind is to experience their deep conflicts by tapping 
into the fears that drive them.
n   
n
By tapping into a  character’s fears, you can also imagine all of 
their dialogue. That dialogue contains two broad elements. The 
first is the underlying intention of the dialogue. The second is the 
particular nouns and verbs and other words that the character uses 
to put that intention into effect.
n   
n
You can find both of these dialogue elements by tapping into your 
character’s fears. The first element of dialogue, the character’s 
intention, is an action like any other action. It’s an attempt to push 
away some bad outcome with another better one.

38
﻿Lecture 4  •  Developing Your Characters
n   
n
Regarding your character’s particular word choices: Some of 
these words are carefully selected by characters to achieve their 
immediate objectives. By tapping into your characters’ fears, 
you can discover what words they’ll use or avoid when they’re 
concerned about incriminating themselves, or antagonizing 
someone, or revealing how they secretly feel.
n   
n
Then there are the less conscious parts of your character’s speech, 
like vocabulary and diction. For example, a character’s vocabulary 
and diction and patterns of speech may reflect a kind of anxious 
overcompensation. A character who’s afraid of being an academic 
failure will talk with an eccentrically outsized vocabulary learned 
through secret hours of study. A  character who’s afraid of being 
inauthentic will talk with a more of a local dialect. A character who’s 
afraid of being uncool will have a mind filled with archaeological 
layers of slang.
n   
n
As an example of how this works, take the cop Edmund Exley in 
the script for L.A. Confidential. His conscious fear is not measuring 
up to his dad, who was a legend on the force, so he goes out of his 
way to do everything by the book.
n   
n
Long before the story began, Exley trained himself to talk in 
bloodless language, like a typed report. Other characters around 
him use colorful expressions like: “Guy’s got a pole so far up his 
ass, every time he farts the flag waves.” But Exley uses dull and 
colorless vocabulary and syntax.
n   
n
But then later in the script, as he becomes more and more afraid 
that his by-the-book approach is hurting his ability to be a good 
cop, he puts on a  tough-guy act in an interrogation and begins 
cursing. And at the end of the script, when he thinks he’s about 
to get killed, he quietly curses. In that moment, his primal fear of 
death overwhelms the professional anxieties that led him to talk so 
religiously by the book.

39
﻿Lecture 4  •  Developing Your Characters
n   
n
In that microexample, you can see how a  character’s deep fears 
shape every element of their speech, from their usual vocabulary, 
to their conscious performances, and finally to their unguarded 
emotional utterances.
	
EXERCISE
1	
Imagine a conflict between a person and their story world. 
Maybe the person is a questioner in a totalitarian society, 
or a liar in the halls of truth, or a rationalist in a culture of 
feeling. Now, outline a scene where you draw attention to 
this character by dramatizing the conflict.
2	
Write a  short scene that reveals the fear that drives your 
character’s conflict, or if you want to be more ambitious, 
the two fears that the character is pulled between. Tap into 
the fear or fears to help you craft the character’s conscious 
verbal intentions, their unconscious dialect, and every other 
aspect of their dialogue. Once you’ve made one character, 
make more. Of all the things you can create, nothing will 
give your audience more meaning or delight.

LECTURE 5
TONE: THE 
SCREENWRITER’S 
LENS
T
one is the way a  story is told. It’s the voice of the storyteller, 
real or implied. And it’s so powerful that you can flip an entire 
story simply by changing the tone. There are endless ways to 
modulate a  story’s tone. You can communicate any perspective, no 
matter how subtle or strange, if you strike the right tone.
This lecture explores how to use tone to put your script in the best 
position to get its unique voice across. First, you’ll learn the main tool 
that screenwriters use to establish tone. And second, you’ll learn the 
fundamentals of four popular screenwriting tones: the god’s eye, the 
ironic, the comic, and the sentimental.

42
﻿Lecture 5  •  Tone: The Screenwriter’s Lens
THE NARRATOR
n   
n
Tone is a cognitive effect that exists in the minds of audiences. Like 
every effect, it has a cause: a literary device known as the narrator. 
The narrator is the person who tells you the story. Sometimes 
that storyteller is explicit, like when Moby Dick begins: “Call me 
Ishmael.” Sometimes that storyteller is implied, like when A Tale of 
Two Cities announces out of nowhere: “It was the best of times, it 
was the worst of times.”
n   
n
In scripts, narrators are usually hidden out of sight, glimpsed 
indirectly through ripples in the text. But even in scripts, the 
narrator is everywhere. Every story beat, scene, character 
description, action, and transition has to be voiced by someone. 
And that someone is the narrator you create.
n   
n
There are many ways that your narrator can shape the tone, but 
from a screenwriting perspective, the two most important ways are 
what your narrator focuses on and how they focus on it.
n   
n
Beginning with the what: When a  narrator describes a  physical 
space, he or she chooses what to focus on by emphasizing certain 
objects and deemphasizing or ignoring others. For example, 
if a  narrator describes a  home, they won’t give equal time to all 
the rooms in that home. They might emphasize the living room or 
the kitchen, styling the house as a  space of family togetherness. 
Or they might emphasize the spare bedroom or a  study in the 
attic, instead subtly portraying the home as a place of solitude or 
even apartness.
n   
n
The same goes for the people in the rooms. If a narrator focuses 
on a person’s clothes, it creates a public sense of social place. If 
a  narrator focuses on a  person’s eyes, it creates a  more private 
sense of intimacy.

43
﻿Lecture 5  •  Tone: The Screenwriter’s Lens
n   
n
When you’re writing a  screenplay, don’t describe everything in 
every room and on every character. Carefully choose what you 
include. When you’re analyzing a  piece of writing to borrow its 
tone, take notice of what places and objects the narrative records 
and what it ignores. If you make similar choices in your own writing, 
you’ll generate the same tone.
n   
n
Now for the other part: the how. This is the way you describe the 
objects you focus on. Do you use technical terms or slang? Do 
you use warmer adjectives or cooler ones? Do you avoid adverbs 
entirely and opt for a more laconic style? Do you make your verbs 
more active or passive? Do you describe objects as they are or as 
your characters see them? All of these factors affect the tone.
THE GOD’S-EYE TONE
n   
n
The first major tone this lecture will focus on is known as the god’s-
eye. A  god’s-eye narrator has the properties of a  divine eye, all 
seeing and all knowing. It’s above the things it describes. It sees 
into their essence and has dominion over them.
n   
n
In the Old Testament, examples abound of a detached, all-powerful 
narrator who focuses on only the largest objects (like heaven and 
earth). But here’s how a  slightly different narrator works in the 
opening lines of Homer’s Iliad:
Sing goddess, of the all-a-damaging anger of Achilles born of 
Peleus, that brought countless pains to men, sending many stout 
souls to Hades before their time, making heroes into food for 
dogs and vultures.
n   
n
Some of what the narrator focuses on is still very big objects: Hades 
and a  goddess. But there are also smaller objects like food and 
dogs and vultures. And many of these objects are plural: pains and 
men and souls and heroes. Moreover, in keeping with the Greeks’ 
polytheism, this god’s eye is one among many. It communicates 
a sense of strength without insisting upon its own totality.

THE IRONIC NARRATOR
n   
n
The ironic narrator goes back thousands of 
years to ancient Greek and Roman satire. The 
ironic narrator gently deflates and undercuts 
the things he or she describes. The ironic 
narrator wryly suggests that things are less 
important than we tend to think.
n   
n
There’s no better example of this kind of 
narrator than the novels of Jane Austen. Take 
the opening lines of Pride and Prejudice:
It is a  truth universally acknowledged, that 
a single man in possession of a good fortune, 
must be in want of a  wife. However little 
known the feelings or views of such a  man 
may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, 
this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the 
surrounding families, that he is considered 
the rightful property of some one or other of 
their daughters.
n   
n
Like the god’s-eye narrator, Austen’s ironic 
narrator gives us the big things of the cosmos, 
like “truth” and “man.” But the narrator also 
focuses on the low drama of furniture and 
country marriages and all the other trivial 
things of human life.
n   
n
If you want to recreate Austen’s tone of light 
irony, follow her narrator’s method of dry 
understatement. Here’s how the script for The 
Big Short does it in its opening lines: “A bunch 
of FAT BOND TRADERS eat deli sandwiches 
and smoke cigarettes on the Solomon Brothers 
Bond Trading floor. It’s not exactly Michael 
Douglas in Wall Street.”

THE COMIC NARRATOR
n   
n
The comic narrator is sometimes confused with the ironic because 
it can contain lightly satiric elements. But unlike the ironic, the 
primary purpose of the comic is not to tear down. Instead, it’s to lift 
up and celebrate the little curiosities of life.
n   
n
One classic comic narrator who’s had a huge influence on film and 
TV is Huck Finn from Mark Twain’s The Adventures of Huckleberry 
Finn. Here’s how Huck tells a story:
All the streets and lanes was just mud; they warn’t nothing 
else but mud—mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in 
some places, and two or three inches deep in all the places.  The 
hogs loafed and grunted around everywheres.   You’d see 
a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come lazying along the street 
and whollop herself right down in the way, as happy as if she was 
on salary.
n   
n
The what of this narrator 
is an intimate focus on 
the humblest of things. 
The narrator doesn’t just 
mention the mud. He 
gets down low enough to 
describe its exact color 
and inches.

47
﻿Lecture 5  •  Tone: The Screenwriter’s Lens
n   
n
Almost every sitcom or romantic comedy uses a comic narrator. You 
can find one fantastic model in the script for Little Miss Sunshine, 
which begins with a happy catalogue of grungy characters.
  
 The script opens by introducing six-year-old Olive, with her 
“frizzy hair” and “black-rimmed glasses,” as she “earnestly” 
imitates Miss America’s wave.
  
 Then the script hops to 40-something Sheryl as she inhales 
nicotine and promises to pick up a bucket of chicken. Then, it 
hops to 80-year-old Grandpa as he snorts heroin and relaxes 
on the toilet, and then it hops to 15-year-old Dwayne as he 
pumps iron and reads Nietzsche. Just like Huck Finn, the 
narrator of Little Miss Sunshine gets up close and personal with 
a rich cast of lowly folk.
THE SENTIMENTAL NARRATOR
n   
n
Historically, the sentimental narrator is the most common kind of 
narrator in screenwriting. The aim of the sentimental narrator is to 
speak the language of the heart, and since different hearts feel 
different things in different intensities and degrees, there’s a huge 
variety in sentimental narrators.
n   
n
To give you a taste of the possibilities available, here’s the narrator 
from Toni Morrison’s Pulitzer-winning Beloved:
First he stands in the back, near the cold house, amazed by 
the riot of late-summer flowers where vegetables should be 
growing. Sweet william, morning glory, chrysanthemums. The 
odd placement of cans jammed with the rotting stems of things, 
the blossoms shriveled like sores. Dead ivy twines around bean 
poles and door handles. Faded newspaper pictures are nailed 
to the outhouse and on trees. A rope too short for anything but 
skip-jumping lies discarded near the washtub; and jars and jars 
of dead lightning bugs. Like a child’s house; the house of a very 
tall child.

48
﻿Lecture 5  •  Tone: The Screenwriter’s Lens
n   
n
The what of this narrator is the ordinary material things of life: 
the planted flowers, the newspapers, and the outhouse. To 
communicate a  sense of intimacy—the how—the sentimental 
narrator uses richly specific adjectives like “odd” and “rotting” and 
“faded,” and the narrator also uses personifications to imply that 
inanimate objects have animate minds.
n   
n
Like the comic narrator, the sentimental narrator emphasizes 
the importance of human life. But unlike the comic narrator, the 
sentimental narrator focuses on more serious emotions: sadness, 
love, nostalgia, hope, etc. Where the comic narrator wants us to 
delight in our wild variety, the sentimental narrator wants us to feel 
a deeper empathy for one special beating heart.
n   
n
You can find an example of a sentimental narrator in the script for 
Precious, which paints the title character’s feelings onto the world 
with lines like: “The door closing behind Precious might as well be 
to a prison cell block.”
CONCLUSION
n   
n
This list of narrators isn’t meant as an exhaustive catalog. There are 
many sub-varieties within each broad type of narrator, and there 
are many other types out there for you to discover.
n   
n
To expand your library of possibilities, you can also splice together 
different narrators. Romantic comedies, for example, often use 
a more comic tone in the beginning and a more sentimental tone 
at the end.
n   
n
But these four big blueprints can get you started on developing 
your own screenwriting voice, enabling you to take control of the 
What and the How of storytelling, injecting subtle forms of mood 
and atmosphere into scene descriptions, actions, and even plot 
and dialogue.

LECTURE 6
PLOTTING YOUR 
STORY BEATS
H
umans brains are naturally good at plotting; that’s why humans 
are the planet’s dominant species. But if that’s the case, then 
why do so many first-time screenwriters get lost or stranded or 
swamped with subplots that just won’t converge? And why do so many 
professionals struggle too? The answer is that writers make the mistake 
of plowing forward from the start. As this lecture shows, when you plot, 
it’s much easier to do it backward. Reverse engineering is all you need 
to plot your next film script.

52
﻿Lecture 6  •  Plotting Your Story Beats
A SHAKESPEAREAN EXAMPLE
n   
n
Although Shakespeare never uses the term reverse engineering, he 
was trained in this method from childhood because it was a staple 
of Renaissance and classical manuals on rhetoric. Shakespeare 
reveals how nuanced and flexible this method of building scenes 
can be.
n   
n
For the purposes of this lecture, pretend you’re a  young 
Shakespeare, and you want to write a play about Richard III. And 
early on in your script, you want a scene where your nefarious hero 
amazes the audience with his devilish powers.
n   
n
What if your hero did something darkly magical, without the aid 
of dark magic? To that end, what amazing spell could your hero 
cast? The biggest miracle in the Bible is the resurrection, so what 
if Richard III did his own demonic version of a resurrection, turning 
something dead into something alive? What if he showed up at 
a funeral and turned it into a wedding?
n   
n
History books tell you that Richard III married Lady Anne. They also 
tell you that Richard murdered a number of Anne’s family members. 
What if you wrote a scene where Richard turned up to a funeral 
for Anne’s murdered relative and convinced the angry and grieving 
Anne to marry him and start a new family? That would definitely 
astonish audiences with Richard’s devilish powers of speech.
n   
n
The method of reverse engineering is turning plotting into an 
exercise in asking story questions and then solving them. You ask 
a question, then you find a story solution.
n   
n
Back to your scene: How could Richard convince the relative of one 
of his victims to marry him? The most straightforward approach 
would be to convince her that the killing was done out of love. That 
way, what seems an act of hate would be transformed into a kind 
of valentine.

53
﻿Lecture 6  •  Plotting Your Story Beats
n   
n
And that’s exactly what Shakespeare does in act 1, scene 2 of 
Richard III. When Anne accuses Richard of having killed her family 
member, Richard insists that it was an act of love. He saw a good 
man so he sent him to heaven, where good men belong.
n   
n
Anne is skeptical, but Richard continues to insist that his apparent 
acts of hate were in fact acts of devotion, swearing that he killed 
Anne’s husband because he loved her, and declaring that he will kill 
himself if Anne desires it.
n   
n
Slowly, Anne becomes unmoored from her old certainties about 
Richard. She starts to believe that maybe there can be a kind of 
love in hate. And if Richard’s hate is love, then perhaps her hate 
for Richard can be a kind of love as well—allowing for a funeral to 
become a wedding.
n   
n
Now that you’ve reverse engineered your scene’s story structure, 
how do you back-build an opening conflict to set this plot in 
motion? In this lecture’s example, to maximize the demonic magic 
of Richard’s spell, Anne should begin the scene on the side of God 
and the saints, having no doubt that Richard and his deeds are 
absolutely evil.
n   
n
Then Richard should flip her moral universe by suggesting that bad 
things can be good. The conflict will be between Anne’s world of 
moral certainty and Richard’s character of moral inversion.
n   
n
To establish that conflict, you can have Anne utter moral 
pronouncements that Richard then flips through his dark arts of 
wordplay. Anne will snap: “Villain, thou knowst not law of God nor 
man; No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.” To which 
Richard will respond: “But I know none and therefore am no beast.”
n   
n
Richard’s double meanings will muddy Anne’s clear divide between 
right and wrong, suggesting that the two aren’t in fact so easy to 
disentangle. Maybe wrong is right, down is up, and death is life. 
Richard can then convince Anne that a funeral can be a wedding. 
Success!

﻿Lecture 6  •  Plotting Your Story Beats
n   
n
You started with your ending, which was a  cognitive effect of 
devilish wonder. Then you reverse engineered your middle, 
which was a  story structure that transformed a  holy funeral into 
a demonic wedding. Then you finished with your beginning, which 
was a  conflict between a  story world of moral absolutism and 
a character of moral ambiguity.

55
﻿Lecture 6  •  Plotting Your Story Beats
THE MIDDLE
n   
n
The trickiest part of the reverse-engineering sequence is the 
middle, that is, the part where you settle on the right story structure 
to generate your desired cognitive effect. You can build these 
story structures from scratch, but it usually helps to have a rough 
historical blueprint to work from.
n   
n
When you’re not writing, always make time to mine your favorite 
scripts for general story structures that generate cognitive effects 
you like, creating your own mental library of story structures to 
tweak, adapt, and refine.
n   
n
And if you ever find yourself stuck at this middle part of the process, 
here’s a guideline that might help: The overarching story structure 
of most scenes is usually a  change in one character’s emotions 
or understanding or perception of the world. Start by identifying 
the character who needs to change and then put yourself in that 
character’s place, asking: What would alter my mind?
n   
n
One simple plot trick is to give the character an emotionally 
charged object, for example, in Birdman when the method actor 
Mike Shiner is handed a  gin bottle full of water. Another simple 
plot trick is to give the character a new piece of information, like 
when the customs agent at the end of The Usual Suspect realizes 
the identity of Keyser Söze.
n   
n
These deeper character conversions often drive the main turning 
points of plots. If you ever run dry of ideas on how to achieve 
them, you can always use Shakespeare’s favorite techniques for 
converting characters: the mirror scene.
n   
n
In a  mirror scene, one character serves as another character’s 
mirror, reflecting their behavior back in a way that causes them to 
criticize themselves and change. Examples include when Laertes 
serves as a mirror for Hamlet and when Beatrice serves as a mirror 
for Benedick.

56
﻿Lecture 6  •  Plotting Your Story Beats
n   
n
This mirror technique is flexible enough to be used in almost any 
situation, no matter how far removed from Shakespearean England 
you might be. In Spike Jonze’s futuristic script for Her, Theodore 
Twombly falls in love with his computer operating system—and then 
meets Amy, who mirrors back Theodore’s situation by revealing 
that she’s romantically involved with her computer too.
A FULL PLOT
n   
n
After learning how to reverse engineer a scene, the next step is to 
see how this same method can be used to build a full-length plot. 
For your first full screenplay plot, the best way to learn is to adapt 
a  story from a  novel, short story, comic book, memoir, or some 
other preexisting narrative that you love and no other screenwriter 
has adapted yet.
n   
n
That way, you’re starting with a proven plot structure, and you can 
learn from the story choices that the original author made. This 
can seem derivative, but Shakespeare adapted almost all of his 
scripts, and every year the Academy gives out an Oscar for best 
adapted screenplay.
n   
n
Even though this method allows you to harness the strengths of 
a preexisting plot, it still gives you two major opportunities to be 
original. First, out of all the millions of un-adapted stories out there, 
you choose the one that fits with your vision. And second, you cut 
and shape your source material to bring out the specific story you 
see in it. Good source material can be adapted in endless ways to 
emphasize different effects.
n   
n
When you adapt, don’t just blindly copy a plot you like. Use reverse 
engineering to select a  specific plot that has untapped script 
potential, and then use the same reverse-engineering method to 
refine and tailor the plot to achieve your intended effect.

57
﻿Lecture 6  •  Plotting Your Story Beats

EXERCISE
1	
Find a  neglected novel, short story, fairytale, or other 
narrative to adapt. Identify the feeling, mood, or other 
cognitive effect that the original source material creates in 
you, then go back and circle the moments in the plot that 
most generate this cognitive effect. Now turn one of these 
moments into your own dramatic scene, drawing out and 
emphasizing the story structure that creates the cognitive 
effect you like.
2	
Identify the conflict between character and story world that 
drives your new dramatic scene forward. Next, write the 
opening two scenes of your whole screenplay, establishing 
the story world with minor characters in the first scene, and 
establishing the main character in the second scene. At 
this point, you have the beginning conflict of your script, 
a key middle scene, and the final cognitive effect you want 
to create. That’s the beginning, middle, and end; you can 
reverse engineer the remaining parts from here.

LECTURE 7
SENTIMENTAL 
RETURN: CASABLANCA
T
his is the first of 12 lectures on specific movie scripts, each 
picked by the Writer’s Guild of America as one of the best of 
all time. Each is a  different story genre, and each opens the 
door to a different cognitive experience. To get the most out of each 
lecture, it’s advisable to watch each movie or read the full script first. 
This lecture kicks off the 12 movies with Golden Age Hollywood’s most 
celebrated script: Casablanca. It will contain spoilers and a discussion 
of the ending, so if you haven’t read the script or watched the film and 
want to avoid spoilers, do so before reading further.

THE ENDING
n   
n
The step in reverse engineering a script’s blueprint is to turn to its 
ending and isolate its distinct cognitive effect. Casablanca ends 
after the hero, nightclub owner Rick Blaine, has been reunited 
in Nazi-occupied Casablanca with the love of his life, Ilsa, who 
unfortunately for Rick happens to be married to Laszlo, the heroic 
leader of the Czech resistance.
n   
n
To preserve Ilsa’s marriage and Laszlo’s fight against Hitler, Rick 
gives them his own plane tickets to freedom. Then Rick releases the 
Nazi collaborator, Renault, who he’s been holding at gunpoint, and 
heads south with him to join the resistance, cheerfully remarking: “I 
think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.”
n   
n
Critics often complain that this ending is utterly illogical. But Rick 
isn’t ashamed of being an illogical sentimentalist. In fact, he sees 
his illogic as a way to fight back a Nazi advance that, at the moment 
Casablanca was written, seemed poised to envelop the world. Rick 
places this enormous confidence in his illogical decisions because 
his sentimentalism has deep roots that go back to a  time when 
being a romantic wasn’t seen as a bad thing.
n   
n
That time was the high-water mark of Romanticism in the mid-
19th century, when poets, painters, and thinkers from across 
Europe and the Americas had come to agree that reason was an 
unhealthy state of mind that had helped sever human life from 
the original goodness of nature. The romantics of the 19th century 
leveraged art’s emotional power to overthrow the logical parts 
of human brains that had rationalized violence and inequality as 
necessary evils.
n   
n
The broad goal of Romantic art is to return people to their old 
sentimental nature, restoring the utopian togetherness they had 
before. And this feeling of sentimental return is exactly what 
Casablanca’s ending provides.
60
Lecture 7  •  Sentimental Return: Casablanca

61
Lecture 7  •  Sentimental Return: Casablanca
n   
n
As Rick puts it to Ilsa: “We’ll always have Paris. We’d lost it until you 
came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.” Rick has thrown off 
the artificial restraints of the logical present to return back to the 
illogical love of the past. That love is his true nature, the original 
goodness suppressed by the Nazi’s machine-world of rational order.
n   
n
Rick, like all romantics, believes that this deep love lies in their pasts, 
and his final actions help Casablanca get back to its old self too. By 
killing the Nazi officer who invades Casablanca at the beginning of 
the script, by generously sacrificing his own happiness to save Ilsa’s 
marriage, and by walking off arm-in-arm with his old foe Renault, 
Rick returns the world to its ancient ways of generosity.
CASABLANCA’S STORY WORLD
n   
n
Casablanca’s script opens with a  narration that briskly explains 
the history of Casablanca’s occupation by the Nazis. To introduce 
its own story rules, Casablanca’s script begins with a short scene 
where two policeman mechanically shoot a  civilian in the back, 
aligning the story world with tragedy. And the script then adds its 
own twist to this classic story world by showing the modern force 
that’s driving the tragic in Casablanca.
n   
n
That modern force is the Nazi’s regime of law and order. And the 
opening beats of Casablanca demonstrate the special menace of 
this regime by showing that it’s destroyed the civilian’s humanity 
long before cops shoot him.
n   
n
In these opening beats, the civilian is reduced to a series of lies and 
obfuscations. He claims not to have his papers when he knows he 
does, and he then tries to bluff the cops by producing papers that 
he knows are expired. These pathetic efforts at lying and cheating 
reveal that the Nazis haven’t just physically conquered Casablanca. 
They’ve conquered it psychologically. 
n   
n
But this story isn’t a  tragedy. It’s a  heroic narrative. After 
introducing the tragic heartlessness of its story world, the script 
then introduces the heroic characters who will battle this rule and 
eventually overturn it with a rule of their own, restoring sympathy 
to Casablanca.

CHARACTERS
n   
n
Of those heroic characters, the main one is Rick. The script crisply 
establishes Rick’s conflict with the story world through a  little 
vignette where a rival bar owner asks Rick to buy his musician. Rick 
replies: “I don’t buy or sell human beings.” The rival remarks in dry 
surprise: “That’s too bad. That’s Casablanca’s leading commodity.”
n   
n
But part of the brilliance of Casablanca’s script is that it doesn’t 
immediately introduce Rick’s sentimental nature. Instead, it begins 
by making Rick seem as heartless as the Nazis he’ll oppose.
n   
n
In the opening beats of the script, before Rick’s refusal to sell his 
musician, Rick is cool to everyone. He plays chess by himself. He 
never drinks with the customers. He speaks coldly to the black-
market hustler Ugarte and is called “very cynical” by him.
n   
n
In heroic scripts, this kind of opening feint is a common reverse-
engineering move because it has two powerful psychological 
consequences. First, it establishes just how oppressive the story 
world is by showing that even our hero is struggling to be himself. 
Second, this feint establishes a conflict within the main character. It 
shows Rick as a man at war with himself.
n   
n
This ongoing inner conflict is the special third technique discussed 
back in the introductory lecture on character. It reveals that Rick 
has two deep fears, first, of becoming as heartless as the fascists 
he hates and second, that his heart will get himself or others hurt.
n   
n
From here, Casablanca’s script then introduces a  series of other 
characters who are also closet sentimentalists. There’s Ilsa, who’s 
had to suppress her feelings for Rick in order to help her husband 
Laszlo fight for the resistance. And there’s Laszlo himself, who 
remarks to Rick: “Apparently you think of me only as the leader of 
a cause. Well, I am also a human being.” Renault, who turns on the 
Nazis in the end, is himself a closet sentimentalist.
62
Lecture 7  •  Sentimental Return: Casablanca

63
n   
n
Because the script portrays Ilsa, Laszlo, and Renault as closet 
sentimentalists caught in the same inner struggle as Rick, it deploys 
the special third technique for character to generate sympathy for 
all of them.
n   
n
The lesson here is that if you want your audience to experience 
a feeling of sentimental return, populate your script with plenty of 
minor romantics. Use the third technique for writing characters to 
make all these minor characters, including one of the antagonists, 
sympathetic. If you do this in other kinds of stories, it’ll backfire. 
But if you’re trying to recreate Casablanca’s cognitive effect, it’s 
the blueprint.
Lecture 7  •  Sentimental Return: Casablanca

65
PLOT
n   
n
The core action of sentimentalism is a release from 
the artificial constraints of logic into the free rush of 
feeling. To generate this experience in the audience, 
the first 90 percent of Casablanca’s script is designed 
to manufacture an increasingly restless waiting in the 
audience’s minds, prompting them to chafe against 
the restraints placed on their emotions and making 
them increasingly aggrieved with the cold logic of 
the story world.
n   
n
When the restraints are released at the end of the 
script, the audience throws off reason and abandons 
themselves to romance. This process of generating 
and then releasing suppressed feeling is driven by 
a number of different plotlines, but the main one is 
Rick’s relationship with Ilsa.
n   
n
When Sam plays Rick and Ilsa’s old song, “As Time 
Goes By,” the script reveals that there’s a  deep, 
buried romance at its heart. And when Rick begins 
drinking with his customers and the story flashes 
back to Ilsa and Rick’s love in Paris, the script makes it 
seem like this romance will be quickly and powerfully 
restored.
n   
n
But then the tragic logic of the story world reasserts 
itself. Paris is gone. Casablanca is a cold place. Rick 
and Ilsa’s love is impossible. She’s married and her 
husband is a good man who needs her.
n   
n
For almost two hours, the plot forces the audience to 
sit in a state of waiting. Finally, Rick and Ilsa kiss, and 
in the script’s final 16 pages, the plot’s slow simmer 
suddenly becomes a white-hot thriller.

n   
n
The Germans close in, Rick apparently betrays Laszlo, then double-
crosses Renault, then gives up the love of his life, then shoots 
a Nazi leader in broad daylight, and then escapes Casablanca. The 
artificial constraints break and the true emotions burst through.
n   
n
This unusually back-loaded plot structure is beautifully reverse 
engineered to make the audience feel the experience of a romantic 
awakening. By providing a  quick taste of Paris and then sharply 
reinstituting the coldness of Casablanca, the plot puts the audience 
in the same position as Rick and Isla, making them feel the ache of 
a lost time of feeling. 
66
Lecture 7  •  Sentimental Return: Casablanca

67
n   
n
And the longer the plot refuses to reunite Rick and Ilsa, the more 
it makes the audience feel like their hearts are being artificially 
bent against their nature. When the restraints are released on 
the final pages, the audience’s romantic sentiments spring back 
immediately and forcibly. 
n   
n
Casablanca’s specific cognitive goals mean that its back-loaded 
plot is not a  universal formula for all stories. It’s engineered to 
support a precise cognitive effect which is just one of many, many 
different feelings that scripts can generate. 
n   
n
That doesn’t mean you can’t adapt the plot of Casablanca in your 
own scripts. Because if you want to give audiences the feeling of 
sentimental return, the plot of Casablanca is a great one to imitate: 
An extremely slow build to a  release in the final 10 percent of 
the script.
TONE
n   
n
Since the overall cognitive effect of Casablanca is the chaining 
of romantic sentiment, the tone of its script is generally highly 
restrained. The action and scene descriptions are terse, and the 
characters famously contribute to the mood with their hard-
boiled dialogue. 
n   
n
But to stir a feeling of sentimental resistance in the audience, the 
script offers careful hints of the deep feelings locked in the story 
world beneath. Its primary narrative technique for doing so is to 
use its scene and action descriptions to offer sharp glimpses of the 
characters’ hidden fears. For example, when Ilsa requests her old 
song from Sam, the scene descriptions abruptly reveal that there’s 
some deeper “mystery” here that prompts a “funny fear,” making 
Sam “nervous” and “uncomfortable” and “scared.”
n   
n
To write a script with the tone of Casablanca, you want to create 
a special kind of sentimental narrator. Like Rick, the narrator should 
be a closet sentimentalist, so that its action and scene descriptions 
are generally matter-of-fact and even dryly ironic. That lasts until 
the key story beats: The narrator’s heart breaks through, focusing 
empathetically on the characters’ deep fears and vulnerabilities.
Lecture 7  •  Sentimental Return: Casablanca

SCENES
n   
n
To reverse engineer the cognitive effect of sentimental return, the 
screenwriters realized that they had to craft two different kinds of 
scenes. The first kind of scene makes the audience feel as though 
their hearts are being artificially constrained, prompting them to 
yearn for unfettered feeling. The second kind of scene then throws 
off the constraints and achieves emotional release.
n   
n
The script is packed full of examples of the first kind of scene. 
Perhaps the most memorable is the one where Laszlo attempts 
to extract the truth from Ilsa. That scene makes the audience feel 
sympathetic for both Isla and Laszlo by dramatizing both of their 
individual conflicts of fears. 
  
 
Laszlo is afraid of losing Isla, but he’s also afraid of forcing her 
heart, because that wouldn’t be love. 
  
 
Meanwhile, Ilsa is afraid of hurting Laszlo by concealing the 
truth, but she’s also afraid of hurting him worse by telling him 
the truth.
n   
n
By using Ilsa and Laszlo’s soliloquized conflicts to create sympathetic 
identification for two characters who both want different things, the 
scene ensures that the audience will end up emotionally frustrated. 
From a screenwriter’s perspective, the lesson to pick up here is that 
you can generate a  powerful experience of repressed feeling in 
audiences by portraying two sympathetic characters in conflict. 
n   
n
Once you’ve generated this deep emotional ache in your audience’s 
hearts, you can then engineer its release. That is what Casablanca’s 
script does in the scene in which Ilsa meets with Rick, addressing 
him as Richard, the name he used back in Paris. As history returns, 
the characters get closer to their old nature and the level of feeling 
increases, until things finally escalate to Ilsa drawing a gun.

n   
n
But Ilsa knows that to kill Rick would be to end her own dreams 
of love. And losing this love is her deepest fear. Rick and Ilsa are 
brought back together by their shared fear of living without love. 
And when Rick and Ilsa throw off reason to recover their original 
feelings, this scene urges the audience to do the same. In Ilsa’s 
last beat of dialogue before the kiss, she reminds us that love 
never fades.

THE TRAGIC SUBLIME: 
THE GODFATHER 
T
o American audiences in the 1970s, The Godfather felt like a very 
fresh kind of story. But its origins were in fact very old. By telling 
a  story about larger-than-life passions that collide in a  dark 
and frightening world, The Godfather was reviving one of the ancient 
experiences of tragedy, giving American audiences their own version 
of Hamlet or Oedipus. And the result was an enormous success. The 
Godfather became the highest grossing film up to that point in history, 
beating out Gone with the Wind and The Sound of Music in worldwide 
receipts; it became an American classic, endlessly quoted and imitated. 
This lecture studies The Godfather’s blueprint for reviving the cognitive 
experience of ancient tragedy, enabling you to write a modern tragedy 
of your own. If you haven’t read the script or watched the film, do so 
before proceeding.

ENDING
n   
n
Following the method of reverse engineering, the first step in 
deriving The Godfather’s blueprint will be to turn to the script’s 
ending and isolate its distinct cognitive effect. The script ends with 
the ascension of Don Corleone’s son, Michael, to his father’s throne. 
n   
n
But just as Michael prepares to become the new godfather, his 
wife, Kay, confronts him. She has been told that Michael has had 
his sister Connie’s husband murdered. Michael responds at first by 
blowing Kay off, ordering her not to ask him about his business, but 
as Kay persists, he loses his temper.
n   
n
The last thing the audiences sees is a group of people lining up to 
kiss Michael’s hand and call him by his father’s name as the door 
closes on Kay, shutting her out from the throne. As the audience 
watches with Kay, Michael vanishes into the darkness.
n   
n
His power has made him into the kind of god worshipped by his 
more ancient, Italian ancestors: the Romans. They believed that 
a man with the power of a Caesar could literally make himself a deity. 
n   
n
The most powerful god in the Roman pantheon was not a kind god 
or an honest god. He was Jupiter, a  god of violence and sexual 
conquest, who took what he wanted through murder and rape. He 
had no interest in being equal partners with his wife or treating 
her honestly.
n   
n
How did the Romans feel when they imagined this god? They 
experienced a  cognitive effect called the tragic sublime; it’s 
terror mixed with wonder. And it’s the feeling produced at the 
end of The Godfather. The audience catches a glimpse of a great 
inhuman force that shuts them out before they can rationalize or 
understand it. 
72
Lecture 8  •  The Tragic Sublime: The Godfather 

73
Lecture 8  •  The Tragic Sublime: The Godfather 
STORY WORLD
n   
n
The world at the beginning of The Godfather’s script is very like 
the world at the end, because in tragic scripts, the story world of 
tragedy defeats the hero, returning in the final scene to where it 
started. Therefore, the same way that The Godfather’s script ends 
on a note of sublime power, it begins on a note of sublime power.
n   
n
To convey this world-building rule, the script begins on the face of 
the minor character Bonasera, who has come to visit Don Corelone, 
the original godfather. But the audience doesn’t see Don Corleone 
at first—only Bonasera. That’s because the way to preserve a sense 
of majesty is to hide the god from view. 
n   
n
The script then heightens this mood of the tragic sublime by having 
Bonasera tell a story about the American dream. It turned out to 
be a lie. In good, democratic fashion, Bonasera gave his daughter 
her “freedom.” But the result of freedom was not a happy one. His 
daughter was treated “like an animal” by men who tried to satisfy 
their lust on her. So now Bonasera has come to Don Corelone for 
one thing. He has come “for justice.”
n   
n
The Godfather takes the Roman view that humans are by nature 
animals of lust and violence. And in this wild of nature, the only 
thing that can save people from destruction is a strong patriarch: 
the godfather.
CONFLICT 
n   
n
Right after the script establishes its story world, it introduces 
Michael, a tragic hero in conflict with its story world. Michael is Don 
Corleone’s son, a full-blooded member of the family. But instead of 
introducing Michael as a son who has submitted to his father’s rule, 
the script carefully introduces Michael as an outsider in conflict with 
his family.

n   
n
The first hint of Michael’s conflict is introduced right after the 
opening scene, when Don Corleone is organizing a family photo 
at his daughter’s wedding. The only problem is that Michael isn’t 
there, leading Don Corleone to dismiss the photographer. 
n   
n
The script then continues to emphasize Michael’s apartness by 
later having him arrive at the wedding in a Marine Corps uniform. 
Michael’s choice of clothes aligns Michael with a longstanding effort 
to destroy the family loyalties that perpetuate the Don’s authority.
n   
n
By signing up to be a Marine, Michael has sworn a deep commitment 
to democracy. He’s put his life on the line for something bigger 
than his family. He’s gone to war in the service of people with whom 
he has no direct blood ties, fellow Americans he’ll never meet. This 
military service on behalf of American democracy is the deepest 
possible threat to his father’s power, which relies entirely on the 
primordial culture of family bonds. 
n   
n
But of course, Michael will become his father. In tragedy, the main 
character’s deepest fears always come true. 
74
Lecture 8  •  The Tragic Sublime: The Godfather 

75
PLOT
n   
n
In the case of The Godfather, the plot has to turn Michael into his 
father, pulling him back into his family and making him an old-
world patriarch. And the script does this simply and elegantly 
through revenge. 
n   
n
The plot of The Godfather uses the blood cycle of revenge to break 
democracy. To accomplish this, The Godfather reverse engineers 
a sequence of plot points that draw Michael step-by-step into the 
code of revenge, severing his connection to American democratic 
justice and pulling him back into his family.
n   
n
Revenge begins when someone in a family is made a victim, and 
since the script for The Godfather wants Michael to become his 
father, it starts its reverse engineer by making Michael’s father into 
a victim. 
n   
n
The method: Don Corleone takes a  stand against organized 
narcotics, transforming himself from a predatory thug into a civic-
minded hero. Don Corleone then becomes a  victim when the 
script has him attacked for his resistance to the narcotics business, 
reigniting Michael’s dormant family loyalties.
n   
n
From here, the script reverse engineers an escalation in Michael’s 
loyal behavior by having him visit the hospital at a moment when 
some corrupt cops have dismissed his father’s bodyguards. 
n   
n
From here, it’s a short step from passively defending his family to 
actively defending them, and Michael will soon gun down the drug 
baron who shot his father. With that, Michael gets pulled into the 
ancient vortex of revenge. 
n   
n
The remainder of the plot is then reverse engineered to pull him 
deeper and deeper: Michael’s new wife is murdered by a car bomb. 
Michael’s older brother Sonny is killed in his car. Michael responds 
with more and more violence. He is not the winner; the original 
story world is.
Lecture 8  •  The Tragic Sublime: The Godfather 

77
TONE
n   
n
The Godfather employs a special kind of god’s-
eye narrator that combines a  mood of divine 
power with an attention to human feeling. This 
tone infuses every beat of every scene, but it’s 
also there in a subtler feature of the narrative: 
the transitions between scenes.
n   
n
Take for example the transition that follows 
Sonny’s violent revenge on Carlo for beating 
Connie. Sonny has just punched and kicked and 
bit Carlo, smashed his head with a garbage can 
lid, and finally loomed over Carlo’s unconscious 
body with the threat: “Touch my sister again, 
I’ll kill ya.” 
n   
n
Then, the narrative transitions to Michael’s 
wedding, the sound of church music, and 
a  priest chanting in the mysterious ancient 
language of Rome. By connecting Sonny’s 
revenge to Michael’s wedding, the narrative 
establishes the yoking together of worldly 
violence and otherworldly awe that defines the 
tragic sublime. 
n   
n
The more general screenwriting lesson here is 
to remember that one of the most powerful 
ways you can generate tone is through your 
scene transitions. Carefully choose where 
you stop your scenes and where you cut to 
next, so that you establish juxtapositions that 
communicate the deeper mood or atmosphere 
you want to create. 

SCENE
n   
n
The script’s most important scene is the one where Michael finally 
crosses over, leaving democracy to become his father’s son. To 
accomplish Michael’s transition from democrat to demagogue, the 
script first needs to create an opening for Michael to insert himself 
into the godfather’s realm. 
n   
n
It does this by reverse engineering a conflict within the godfather’s 
story world, as embodied in the conflict between Sonny and Hagen, 
the Don’s lawyerly consigliere. Hagen is cool-headed and clear-
minded. Sonny is the opposite: passionate, impulsive, and taking 
everything personally. 
n   
n
When Don Corleone ends up in the hospital, the script reverse 
engineers a crisis in the family by having Sonny and Hagen disagree 
over how to handle the situation. Sonny argues for blood revenge. 
Meanwhile, Hagen insists that an all-out war will destroy the family’s 
business interests.
n   
n
This creates an opening for Michael to step in and save the 
family, and no less importantly, it creates a motive for Michael to 
act. Michael’s plan marries Sonny’s passion to Hagen’s reason. It 
involves killing a  cop out of revenge—and then cool-headedly 
using the family’s resources to contain the blowback.
n   
n
This scene provides a  simple two-part blueprint for scripting 
your own hero’s tragic conversion to the rule they oppose. First, 
establish a conflict between two sides of your story world’s tragic 
rule, each voiced by a  different character, creating sympathy for 
the story world in the hero’s heart. Then show your tragic hero 
resolving the conflict. In acting with heroic sympathy, the hero is 
ironically helping to restore the story world that will consume them. 
78
Lecture 8  •  The Tragic Sublime: The Godfather 

79
n   
n
If you want to evoke the tragic sublime in your audience’s mind, you 
can’t find a better blueprint than The Godfather’s script. Adopt the 
tone of an omnipotent sentimental narrator and give your audience 
a  hero who steadfastly opposes the core rule of his story world. 
And then back-build a plot that pulls in the hero, bit by bit, until 
they ironically become the rule.
 
EXERCISE
1	
Imagine a story world ruled by an older way of life. Then, 
imagine a character with a newer perspective. Now, reverse 
engineer the main strokes of a  plot where the character 
comes into conflict with the story world, and then is drawn 
step-by-step into abandoning their new perspective for the 
older ways of living.
2	
Write a conversion scene like the argument between Sonny 
and Hagen, where the old way of life splits between two 
opposite fears, generating sympathy in the heart of your 
tragic hero, and drawing them into ironically saving the 
story world they once defied.

LECTURE 9
ROMANTIC 
SATISFACTION: WHEN 
HARRY MET SALLY…
T
he film When Harry Met Sally offers a  blueprint for the third 
of the three classic genres discussed in the earlier lecture on 
story world. Those three are the heroic, discussed through 
Casablanca; the tragic, discussed through The Godfather; and the 
comic, discussed in this lecture. Unlike the characters of classic heroic 
narratives, the characters of comedies don’t succeed in changing their 
story world. Instead, just like in classic tragedies, the characters start 
out at odds with the rule of the story world and end up submitting to it. 
But in comedies, the characters’ submission to the world is a source 
of joy. As always, if you haven’t read the script or watched the film, it’s 
advised to do so before proceeding with this lecture.

ENDING
n   
n
The script of When Harry Met Sally ends by giving Harry and Sally 
exactly what they want. Harry and Sally have spent over a decade 
flirting and fighting and dating other people, but never finding what 
they really want: someone who loves them for their imperfections, 
freeing them from their fears and anxieties, and allowing them 
to know the blissful peace of the older couples who pop into the 
movie on a loveseat to tell their true stories of love. 
n   
n
At the end of the movie, Harry and Sally sit on that loveseat 
together, describing their wedding. This ending gives a sense of 
completion. Its cognitive effect is known as romantic satisfaction. 
STORY WORLD
n   
n
When Harry Met Sally begins exactly where it ends: on the love 
seat. There, a man sitting with his wife gives an opening vignette. 
With this opening vignette, the script establishes the core rule of 
its story world. That rule is this: Love seems a crazy and impossible 
dream, but it’s real and it can last forever.
n   
n
Romantic comedies traditionally begin by introducing their lovers 
as adult children. When Harry Met Sally does that in a scene that 
shows Harry and Sally graduating from college.
n   
n
And although the script doesn’t show us Harry and Sally’s 
actual parents, the opening vignette with the love seat gives 
a metaphorical glimpse. The couple on the couch is a reminder of 
everyone’s parents. They tell the audience: Love can happen. 
82
Lecture 9  •  Romantic Satisfaction: When Harry Met Sally…

83
CHARACTER
n   
n
Now this lecture turns to how the script establishes its two 
main characters, Harry and Sally. When Harry and Sally are first 
introduced, they seem very different from each other. But in one 
key way, Harry and Sally are identical: They both think they have all 
the answers.
n   
n
Sally says up front: “I have this all figured out.” At the beginning 
of the script, the characters of romantic comedies always believe 
they’ve got everything figured out. 
n   
n
Harry is older than Sally, but he’s an even worse know-it-all. He 
has slept with 10 women, so he’s sure that he’s seen deep into the 
female mind. He’s been to law school, where he’s picked up the 
answers to everything. And he’s absolutely certain that there are 
no happily-ever-afters.
n   
n
The rule of the comic story world is the rule of true love. Harry 
and Sally’s shared conflict with this rule is that they think that true 
love is a naïve old fiction. Harry knows that love is really about sex. 
And Sally is sure that the point of Casablanca is that women are 
too “practical” to fall in love. Ingrid Bergman gets on the plane 
because she’d rather be in a passionless marriage as the first lady 
of Czechoslovakia.
n   
n
With these introductions of Harry and Sally, the script reveals the 
two big lessons for introducing main characters into a  comedy. 
First, if you want to write a classic comedy, create a character who 
deludes himself or herself into thinking they know more than their 
parents and their generation. And second, if you want to write 
a  classic romantic comedy, create two characters who delude 
themselves into thinking they know more than their parents.
Lecture 9  •  Romantic Satisfaction: When Harry Met Sally…

85
PLOT
n   
n
The basic plot of all classic romantic comedies 
is the same. The two main characters are 
successively humbled, coming to realize that 
they didn’t have it figured out after all. Comedy 
needs to humble the characters’ certainty in 
order to reward them with a  happiness they 
thought was impossible. That reward is what 
makes the plot of comedies different from 
tragedies. After the characters of comedy are 
humbled, they don’t end up broken and alone. 
They find completeness in each other.
n   
n
To reverse engineer a modern comic plot, you 
therefore have to establish that your main 
characters are emotionally complementary, so 
that if they got together, they’d make each other 
whole. Then you need to establish that there’s 
only one thing keeping the characters apart. 
In ancient comedies, that one thing is usually 
the characters’ parents. In modern comedies, 
that one thing is usually the character’s more 
psychological guardians: their fears.
n   
n
The plot of a  romantic comedy works by 
slowly dialing up the egoistic fears that keep 
the characters from taking the risky plunge 
into love. The script for When Harry Met Sally 
begins on a road trip that exposes all of Harry 
and Sally’s youthful insecurities. The script 
continues to intensify their anxieties and 
vulnerabilities, until finally, Harry and Sally’s 
different concerns about getting hurt merge 
into the same big fear: If they get together and 
it doesn’t work, then they really will have no 
one. They’ll be totally and permanently alone.

n   
n
To then get Harry and Sally over this shared fear and bring them 
together, the script follows the second part of the romantic-comedy 
recipe by having the characters humbly admit that they didn’t have 
things all figured out like they thought they did. 
  
 
Harry shakes off his god-like contempt for human mortality by 
confessing that it’s the ephemeral things that he loves about 
Sally the most: the peculiar way she orders food, the way she’s 
always cold, the little crinkle on her nose. 
  
 
Sally confesses that Harry breaks all her rules of practical logic: 
“You say things like that and you make it impossible for me to 
hate you. And I hate you Harry. … I really hate you.”
n   
n
This puts Harry and Sally in the terrifying position of giving up 
everything they thought they knew. But when they let go of their 
fears and step out of themselves, they make each other complete.
n   
n
If you want to craft a classic romantic comedy, this is the way to 
build your plot. Have your characters start by clinging to self-
protective fears. Then, keep them clinging for page after page after 
page until they bravely humble themselves at the very end.
n   
n
Since this plot structure is essentially an extended tease, the 
hardest part is to keep your audience intrigued and hopeful, so 
they don’t stalk off in the middle. One of When Harry Met Sally’s 
metanarrative tricks for getting its audience to sweetly torture 
themselves is the plot device of emphasizing Harry and Sally’s 
converging lives. 
86
Lecture 9  •  Romantic Satisfaction: When Harry Met Sally…

87
n   
n
First, Harry and Sally go on the same trip to New York. In the next 
vignette, they once again travel to the same place, on the same 
plane. When they land, they proceed to walk in exactly the same 
direction on the same motorized walkway. Then, both Harry and 
Sally’s relationships end together; they start healing and going 
on first dates with other people at the same time. Then their best 
friends get together, and so on.
Lecture 9  •  Romantic Satisfaction: When Harry Met Sally…

n   
n
The more the script keeps up this device of showing Harry and Sally 
on convergent paths, the more it seems inevitable that their hearts 
will finally come together, prompting the audience’s minds to keep 
leaping ahead to envision the couple together. The ultimate effect 
of this extended flirt is to intensify the romantic satisfaction of the 
script’s conclusion. 
n   
n
The lesson: Use your plot to build the audience’s sense of longing 
by showing the main characters get closer and closer and closer, 
and even sleeping together, but never becoming one. Make your 
audience imagine how happy the main characters would be by 
showing other couples getting together and finding happiness, 
again and again and again. 
n   
n
Eventually, the audience wants the main characters to get together 
so badly that they think they can’t take it anymore. When your 
audience feels that deep romantic ache, they won’t feel like your 
happy ending is an empty cliché. They’ll celebrate it as the perfect 
way to satisfy their hearts.
TONE
n   
n
Like the plot of When Harry Met Sally, the tone is reverse 
engineered to humble the audience’s certainty. The narrator of 
When Harry Met Sally is a comic narrator who shows the audience 
life through the main characters’ eyes. And crucially, the particular 
part of life that the narrator of When Harry Met Sally shows is their 
moments of ironic discovery.
n   
n
For example, the script gives this action description in its opening 
beats: “Harry spits a  grape seed out the window, which doesn’t 
happen to be down.” As written, this description shows the reader 
the world exactly through Harry’s eyes, leading the reader to 
repeat Harry’s mistake of thinking the window is open: “Harry spits 
a grape seed out the window.” 
88
Lecture 9  •  Romantic Satisfaction: When Harry Met Sally…

89
Lecture 9  •  Romantic Satisfaction: When Harry Met Sally…

n   
n
By involving the audience in the characters’ point-of-view as they 
undergo these moments of ironic discovery, this style of comic 
narration debunks old romantic clichés while maintaining the 
audience’s connection to the characters’ perspective.
n   
n
You can create the same authentic tone in your own scripts by 
using a  comic narrator. Win your audience’s trust with a  narrator 
who doesn’t fall for the old lies and clichés, but honestly depicts 
the real world. When your script shows two regular people falling in 
love, the audience will buy it.
SCENE
n   
n
The cognitive effect of romantic satisfaction is reverse engineered 
by first creating a  deep heartache in the audience. The script 
simultaneously withholds true love while making the audience 
crave it. An example is the split-screen phone scene in When Harry 
Met Sally.
n   
n
In that scene, both characters are revealed in the inner sanctums 
of their bedrooms, and both of them are still afraid of admitting 
that they don’t have it all figured out. Harry plays the wise guy and 
mocks Sally for her youthful opinions. Sally denies that she ever felt 
that way.
n   
n
By revealing Harry and Sally’s fears, this scene follows the old recipe 
for empathy, making the audience care for the couple and desire 
their happiness. And to intensify this desire, the scene continues 
by showing that the characters have regressed all the way back into 
their deepest, teenage insecurities.
n   
n
As they lie in their beds, their hearts exposed and vulnerable, 
they’ve never been closer. And so Sally reaches out, asking Harry: 
“What will you do?” But instead of taking the opportunity to ask 
Sally to be with him, Harry cracks a joke. They hang up the phones, 
still friends but unable to admit they secretly want something more.
90
Lecture 9  •  Romantic Satisfaction: When Harry Met Sally…

91
Lecture 9  •  Romantic Satisfaction: When Harry Met Sally…
n   
n
This approach marries authenticity with empathy, creating 
a genuine sense of heartache in your audience that you can deepen 
by never quite allowing the characters to give up their fears until at 
last, at the end of the script, the split-screen dissolves, and the two 
beds become one.

SUSPENSE AND 
RELIEF: JAWS
T
he blockbuster Jaws’s overall structure and cognitive effect 
confirms the value of reverse-engineering. That’s because when 
director Steven Spielberg first read the novel on which the script 
would be based, the one thing he knew for certain was that he liked 
the ending. Spielberg, in other words, wanted to keep the ending and 
reverse engineer the rest. Spoiler alert: If you haven’t watched the film 
or read the script yet, you’ll want to do so before proceeding.

ENDING
n   
n
The novel ends with the main character, Martin Brody, watching 
as the wounded shark approaches him; doom seems apparent, 
but the fish dies. The key phrase from the ending is: “Nothing 
happened.” The reader is tensed in expectation, waiting for a shark 
to kill Brody—and then nothing. This allows an exhausted Brody to 
kick toward the shore.
n   
n
The feeling is not one of triumph, although Brody does defeat the 
shark. Instead it’s a feeling of relief. The bad thing the audience is 
afraid of doesn’t occur.
n   
n
Spielberg wanted the movie script to end just like this, and it does. 
After a great white shark launches a series of terrifying attacks in 
the waters of New England summer beach town, the new police 
chief, Brody, recruits oceanographer Matt Hooper and a local shark 
hunter to search for the great white in the middle of the ocean. 
n   
n
The shark rams their boat, killing the hunter and trapping Brody and 
Hooper. But just when it seems like Brody and Hooper are doomed, 
Brody finally kills the shark. In an instant, the terror is gone. Brody 
and Hooper swim back to shore, exhausted and relieved.
STORY WORLD
n   
n
The script begins by immediately establishing the core rule of its 
story world in its opening lines, which place the reader looking 
out through the razor teeth of the shark’s gigantic jaw. With this 
opening, the script communicates that the story world of Jaws is 
like a shark: blind, devouring, and selfish. 
n   
n
To reinforce this rule of action, the script then moves from the 
shark’s belly to a summer beach party fueled with alcohol and the 
hope of casual romantic hook-ups. This is the human version of the 
shark’s belly.

In the final beats of this scene, a young couple run drunkenly toward 
the ocean as the shark pulls toward the shore. The couple wants the 
feeling of salt water on their bodies. The shark wants something to 
fill its hungry stomach. And as blood fills the water and a human leg 
drifts down to the ocean floor, the script viscerally communicates 
the dark side of this story world of animal consumption.
n   
n
That dark side is that the appetites of different animal natures will 
inevitably conflict. And when they do, the result is violence.

n   
n
The grandmaster of movie suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, once 
remarked that the way that movies create suspense is by showing 
a bomb under a table. Once the audience sees the bomb, they’re 
just waiting for it to go off. The longer the audience waits, the more 
tense they get.
n   
n
The world of Jaws is reverse engineered to be a bomb. By itself, 
a shark can’t kill anyone. But what about when that shark is floating 
off the shore of a town where vacationers want to feel the pleasures 
of the water and where the greedy locals are determined to keep 
the beaches open to line their pockets? The big lesson here is that 
if you’re writing horror, engineer a core rule for your story world 
that works like a bomb.

CHARACTER
n   
n
A main character is usually established in conflict with story world. 
So how would you reverse-engineer a character in conflict with the 
animal world of Jaws? The character would have to be the opposite 
of an animal, one who’s out of touch with nature. Their deep fear 
would be the pain that natural appetites can cause. That character 
is the film’s protagonist, Brody, a former city man who feels out of 
place in nature.
n   
n
Since Brody feels out of place in nature, he can’t fully trust his 
instincts. He’s more cautious than everyone else around. When 
Brody’s son runs in bleeding from his hand, Brody reminds the 
boy in exasperation that he told him not to use the swing until he 
fixed it. In the little contrast between Brody and his son, his central 
conflict with the world emerges.
n   
n
As for the script’s antagonist: Sharks and other non-verbal 
entities don’t make good antagonists because the only way 
the main character can oppose them is through blunt physical 
action. Suspense scripts typically include a  human, or at least 
a speaking, antagonist.
n   
n
Antagonists embody the core rule of the story world, so the 
antagonist in Jaws is a  human shark with a  blind appetite: Larry 
Vaughn. Larry is the town’s mayor, and he attacks and bullies Brody 
for closing the beaches. He wants the money from beach season, 
regardless of the consequences.
Lecture 10  •  Suspense and Relief: Jaws

99
PLOT
n   
n
The plot for Jaws follows a two-part recipe. First, it 
dials up the pressure by constraining the physical 
space available to the characters, making Brody and 
his companion Hooper feel increasingly trapped, 
and creating a growing sense of claustrophobia.
n   
n
This shrinking of space begins in earnest when 
Hooper and Brody set out on the ocean to hunt 
Jaws. The moment they push off from the dock, the 
world is reduced to the size of their little boat.
n   
n
Then, their little boat becomes disabled, so their 
available room shrinks again. Before, Brody and 
Hooper could at least move around the ocean, but 
now they’re stuck in place.
n   
n
Next, Hooper ends up in the shark cage and Brody 
ends up in the sinking cabin. The world tightens 
around them, closer and closer and closer.
n   
n
Jaws then follows the second part of the recipe 
by creating moments of false hope. One of these 
moments of false hope occurs when some fishermen 
catch a  tiger shark. They stand triumphantly with 
the big creature, posing with “Beach Closed” signs 
while even the usually cautious Brody lets down his 
guard, convinced that the nightmare is over.
n   
n
That lasts until Hooper starts worrying: The 
tiger shark’s tooth radius doesn’t seem quite 
like the one from the killer shark. Slowly, relief is 
replaced by a  gnawing doubt. This use of false 
hope is another classic suspense technique. 
Stephen King uses it frequently, and the more 
moments of false hope you can salt into the script, 
the more the audience comes to distrust any 
positive signs. 

TONE
n   
n
When Spielberg read Jaws the novel, he immediately disliked its 
tone, finding it too grim. If a story is consistently bleak, then the 
violence becomes expected. The viewers quickly become numb, 
unable to feel suspense.
n   
n
Spielberg reverse engineered the tone to be violence-free. Instead 
of being harsh and difficult, the tone is light, playful, and fun. It 
constantly seduces the viewer into relaxing before providing 
a shocking jolt.
100
Lecture 10  •  Suspense and Relief: Jaws

101
n   
n
Spielberg achieved this tone by hiring a  sitcom writer to take 
a  final pass on the script, making the dialogue bantering and 
light. Take the dialogue given to Quint, a professional shark hunter. 
That’s a  serious business. But Quint is a  man who likes apricot 
brandy. He raises his glass to swimming with bow-legged women. 
And he sees Hooper’s shark cage and launches into an ode to fair 
Spanish ladies.
n   
n
The effect of this lightness of tone is to ward off numbness and an 
oversaturation of horror, making the serious intrusions of violence 
feel more shocking. The big lesson here is to try incorporating two 
very different kinds of tone into your suspense scripts: a  lighter, 
warmer tone that dominates, setting your audience up for sudden 
pivots into the heartless dark.
SCENE
n   
n
The key to creating relief is to reverse engineer suspense, and 
the most effective way to reverse engineer suspense is to put the 
audience’s minds into anxious overdrive. An example of a  scene 
that accomplishes this in Jaws is the one with Alex Kitner, the 
young boy who paddles out into the ocean on his raft. The scene 
begins by reestablishing the conflict between the story world of 
animal appetite and a thoughtful, Brody-like character.
n   
n
Just like the teen swimmers at the beginning of the movie, Alex 
loves the water. It’s a visceral, animal pleasure for him. He’s been in 
the sea so long that his fingers are starting to prune. But he doesn’t 
care; he can’t wait to get back on his raft. Alex reintroduces the 
audience to the core rule of the story world: a  world filled with 
material appetites. 
n   
n
In conflict with Alex is his mother. She notices his pruning fingers 
and sets a time limit on his water play. The mother is a mini-version 
of Brody. She’s the vigilant, thoughtful character who worries about 
our appetites and where they might lead.
Lecture 10  •  Suspense and Relief: Jaws

n   
n
From here, the script introduces a light and unserious tone through 
comic routines like the councilman who approaches Brody: “Hey, 
Marty. We got a  lot of problems downtown but I got a  lot of 
problems at the house I wish you could take care of. One, I’ve 
got some cats parking in front of the house, I can’t get down to 
the office. And that garbage truck, next to the office, has got to 
be moved.”
n   
n
It’s like a sitcom: The world is suddenly one where people’s greatest 
concern is who’s parking the garbage truck where. This tone is 
infectious. Even Brody, who begins the scene fidgeting nervously, 
is encouraged to join in the banter with the locals and his wife.
n   
n
By boosting the urgency with its opening conflict, and then relaxing 
the mood with its unserious tone, the scene sends a mixed signal 
to the audience’s brains: Is there an active threat here or not?
n   
n
To further scramble the audience, the scene repeats this dynamic of 
building up tension and then releasing it by layering in a sequence 
of fake shocks. First, Brody mistakes a black bathing cap for the 
shark. Then, he mistakes a  couple wrestling in the water for the 
victims of an attack. Finally, accepting that his mind is playing tricks 
on him, Brody relaxes and lets the kids go out and swim.
n   
n
As Brody enjoys a massage from his wife, the film eases out into 
a  relaxed wide shot of the ocean—when terror strikes. The dog 
disappears. The shark’s point of view appears. Brody, who hates 
the water, is trapped on the shore, unable to help the kids. And the 
scene creates a sense of claustrophobia in the audience’s minds by 
increasingly anchoring its gaze in Brody’s point of view, boxing the 
audience in. 
n   
n
At last, everyone gets out of the water. This turns out to be 
a moment of false hope: The script shows Alex’s mother, weeping 
mournfully on the beach, unable to find her son. Making us realize 
that we can never relax, even when we’re out of the water.
102
Lecture 10  •  Suspense and Relief: Jaws

103
n   
n
The lesson here is to reverse engineer your own scenes to do the 
same thing to your audience’s minds, building tension by sending 
mixed signals about whether things are dangerous or carefree. 
Finally, end on a beat where your audience exhales, only to realize 
it was too soon.

Imagine a  story world that’s like a  bomb waiting to go 
off. Something about the deep laws of the world make it 
inevitable that violence will erupt. Now, back-build a plot

LECTURE 11
ROMANTIC LONGING: 
ANNIE HALL
W
oody Allen’s film Annie Hall promises comedy and delivers 
tragedy. But the script’s journey in and out of dream shows 
the audience a  deeper fact about the nature of their lives: 
People’s most profound sense of meaning comes not from happiness 
but from desire. If you want to fill audiences with the life-affirming sense 
of longing, Annie Hall can give you a  blueprint to chase. As always, 
check out the film’s script or watch the movie before proceeding to get 
the most out of this lecture.

ENDING
n   
n
The ending of Annie Hall almost didn’t happen. It was created 
after the movie had wrapped and was already in previews. This 
late-stage creation of the ending seems to run against the method 
of reverse engineering. But in fact, Woody Allen knew his ending 
all along.
n   
n
From the beginning, Allen knew exactly what he wanted for the 
cognitive effect of the ending. It was there in his original title for 
the movie: Anhedonia, which means a feeling of emotional want. 
That certainty about his desired cognitive effect enabled him to at 
last reverse engineer a  plot ending that generates anhedonia in 
audience’s minds.
106
Lecture 11  •  Romantic Longing: Annie Hall

107
Lecture 11  •  Romantic Longing: Annie Hall
n   
n
The script for Annie Hall chronicles Alvy Singer’s attempts to come 
to terms with the end of his relationship with the title character, 
Annie Hall. And after jumping backward and forward through Alvy 
and Annie’s lives, the film comes to a close with their last moments 
together, as the characters embrace and say goodbye. Annie 
crosses the street, and Alvy watches her go. Then Alvy leaves too. 
Only his voiceover lingers behind. 
n   
n
Put in cognitive terms, this ending splits the audience’s minds in 
two. The part of the mind fed by visual senses has the experience 
of a  physical present in which love does not exist and Alvy and 
Annie are gone. But the part fed by the mind’s eye of memories has 
the experience of a love that did exist and might exist again. 
n   
n
This inner mental division between an ironic detachment and 
a sentimental immediacy creates a longing to be whole again. The 
feeling of Romantic Longing is the ultimate cognitive effect of 
Annie Hall’s script. 
STORY WORLD
n   
n
The script begins by introducing the core rule of its story world 
through a monologue by Alvy. The world is a place of rampant self-
absorption. To establish that this self-absorption is the essential 
rule of the entire story world, the script cuts right into a  scene 
where young Alvy is dragged by his mother to see a doctor. 
n   
n
That scene shows that to Alvy’s mother, nothing’s bigger than 
Brooklyn—even the universe. All the characters in the script are 
trapped within their own first-person worlds, creating a story world 
filled with unrequited desire.
n   
n
Again and again, the characters of Annie Hall make efforts at love, 
trying to find something outside to complete them. But because 
the characters are all egocentrics who can never really get past 
themselves, they inevitably end up returning to their own self-
involved expectations, still yearning for something more.

n   
n
If you want to create romantic longing in your next script, try 
borrowing Annie Hall’s blueprint for establishing a  tragic story 
world of constant, unfulfilled desire. Begin with one monologue, 
followed by another and another and another, until the script 
becomes a tapestry of overlaid voices. 
n   
n
To maintain this cognitive effect through to the end of your script, 
keep the monologues coming, until you conclude, like Annie Hall, 
with a monologue by the same character who began at the start.
CHARACTER
n   
n
The typical way for scripts to establish their main characters is 
through their conflict with the story world. But if Alvy is himself his 
own world, how can he be in conflict with it?
n   
n
The answer is that Alvy is in conflict with himself; he’s at war 
with his own mind, desires, insecurities, hopes, and fears. This is 
a clever twist on the usual way of establishing the conflict between 
character and story world.
n   
n
Alvy is not at war with the Nazis or the Feds or a shark. Instead, he’s 
at war with his own mind, his own desires, his own insecurities, his 
own hopes and fears. For example, in one dialogic monologue (or 
soliloquy), past Alvy and present Alvy disagree with each other.
PLOT
n   
n
Woody Allen’s goal from the beginning was to create a story that 
generated romantic longing, an unrequited desire in the heart 
for love. The plot is reverse engineered to generate a feeling of 
endless yearning by repeating the same mini-narrative of hope and 
disappointment over and over. It catches Annie and Alvy in a circle 
of desire and frustration, never bringing them full satisfaction, but 
also never letting them give up.
108
Lecture 11  •  Romantic Longing: Annie Hall

Woody Allen
109
n   
n
The script begins with the failure of Alvy and Annie’s relationship, 
showing their romance as it comes apart. But it then swiftly 
flashes back to the beginnings of their relationship and slowly 
chronicles the blooming of their affections. The plot starts with 
a disappointment, and then withdraws back into itself, returning to 
an earlier moment of hope.
Lecture 11  •  Romantic Longing: Annie Hall

n   
n
The script also juxtaposes Annie against Alvy’s earlier romantic 
partners, Allison and Robyn, establishing a  doomed pattern of 
tragic repetition that Annie seems to shatter. The plot conjures 
tragedy and then appears to break it with the introduction of Annie, 
convincing the audience, as tragedies always ironically do, that this 
time it’ll be different.
n   
n
Annie and Alvy’s relationship is weird, idiosyncratic, and magical. It 
gives the audience the feeling of discovering a remarkable person 
they couldn’t have dreamt up. Alvy and Annie forget their old 
selves and their previous expectations, and they find love.
n   
n
But then the plot spirals back. Annie and Alvy’s relationship frays 
apart and the mood reverts to what it was at the beginning of 
the script. The script showed the audience at the start that things 
went bad.
n   
n
Just when it seems like the relationship will disintegrate, there’s 
one more burst of hope. Annie invites Alvy over. He kills a spider. 
They reconcile. It seems like it’s going to be different—and then it 
falls apart, just like before. Yet even so, when the movie ends and 
the relationship is finally over, the script uses its final voiceover to 
make sure the audience doesn’t forget the original dream of love.
n   
n
If you want to write a script that generates this same aching sense 
of romantic longing, you can engineer your plot the same way. Start 
your script with the collapse of a character’s dream, then flash back 
for an in-depth account of the heady days of hope when the dream 
first began, showing your audience all the ways that this dream is 
different from previous dreams that didn’t work out. 
n   
n
Then, when the story finally catches back up to the failure that 
kicked off the start of the script, introduce a moment of false hope 
before the dream collapses one more time. Even as the fantasy falls 
apart, end your script on the promise of a future dream.
110
Lecture 11  •  Romantic Longing: Annie Hall

111
TONE
n   
n
To create a  mood of unrequited yearning, Annie Hall is narrated 
from a split perspective that constantly mingles authentic feeling 
with ironic meta-commentary. This style of narration leads the 
audience to feel two states of mind at once: passionate and wise, 
making the audience want to bring these two states together. But 
the split perspective never quite makes it to the altar.
n   
n
A dramatic splitting of the tone between authentic emotion and 
ironic meta-commentary occurs in the scene where Annie and Alvy 
are kissing in bed. Alvy abruptly stops, complaining that Annie 
feels removed. 
n   
n
At that point, Annie’s mind separates from her body, like a ghost, 
and sits down in a  chair to draw. Her body remains in the bed, 
locked in an embrace with Alvy. In a single instant, the audience 
sees both the honest truth about how Annie really feels, and the 
greater irony in it.
n   
n
Like the other meta-narrative devices of Annie Hall, these divided 
selves point you to the deeper, more subtle method that the script 
uses in all of its beats to create its special tone. The script has its 
characters honestly contradict themselves. Annie Hall’s famous 
lobster scene shows how it works.
n   
n
At first, Alvy is scared of a  lobster, and Annie thinks he’s being 
silly. But when Annie finally catches the lobster, Annie and Alvy’s 
perspectives flip. Annie turns serious and Alvy begins joking.
n   
n
Even though the core of the scene remains the honest emotions 
of the characters, the audience’s minds are spurred into a  meta-
commentary state by the realization that Annie and Alvy have just 
swapped roles.
n   
n
If you want to recreate Annie Hall’s tone, have your main characters 
earnestly contradict themselves again and again. Make the 
audience feel that their actions are at once authentic and ironic.
Lecture 11  •  Romantic Longing: Annie Hall

113
SCENE
n   
n
Next, this lecture will flesh out the script’s 
blueprint for romantic longing by looking 
at one of its key scenes. The way to create 
romantic longing is to have two soliloquizing 
characters fall in love and then go around and 
around in ironically earnest plot circles. Since 
a  soliloquy is a  conflict of fears, what should 
those characters’ two deepest fears be?
n   
n
It’ll boost the irony, both comic and tragic, if 
both main characters share exactly the same 
two fears. And since the characters are looking 
for love, their first fear would naturally be 
a fear of romantic rejection. And their second 
fear would be a  fear of getting trapped in 
a relationship with the wrong person. 
n   
n
When 
the 
two 
characters 
meet, 
they’ll 
tragicomically soliloquize the same two fears: 
one, that the other person won’t love them, 
and two, that the other person will love them 
for the wrong reason.
n   
n
This is exactly how Annie Hall establishes 
Annie and Alvy’s relationship in its famous 
terrace scene. In that scene, the subtitles 
tell the audience that Alvy and Annie aren’t 
really communicating with each other. They’re 
soliloquizing to themselves, caught in the same 
two fears. 
n   
n
Sometimes Alvy and Annie are afraid that the 
other person will think that they’re stupid or 
shallow, so they put on an act to impress them, 
like when Alvy pontificates about aesthetic 

criteria. But at other times, they’re afraid this act will get them into 
an empty relationship with someone who doesn’t know them, like 
when Annie worries that she’s attracting a schmuck.
n   
n
To learn to use this subtext yourself, all you need to do is write 
a  line of dialogue that expresses one of a  character’s two fears, 
then follow it with an unspoken action beat that expresses the 
character’s opposite fear. Then, for the character’s next line of 
dialogue, express that opposite fear, and follow it with another 
unspoken line of subtext that reverts back to the original fear. 
Continue this cycle.
n   
n
If the transitions between fears feel too abrupt, slow them down, 
so that the fears more gradually wax and wane. And once the 
dialogue is working, you can erase the lines of subtext. It was just 
scaffolding to keep the structure clear in your mind. That’s what 
Annie Hall’s scene does in its second half when it drops its subtitles; 
the cognitive effect of romantic longing remains.
114
Lecture 11  •  Romantic Longing: Annie Hall

115
n   
n
And to wrap your scene, do what this scene does when Annie and 
Alvy agree to go to the same place for opposite reasons. Annie 
wants to go to a club to sing naturally and be herself; she doesn’t 
want any more bad relationships with people who want her to be 
somebody else. Alvy goes to win a kiss. She’s afraid of being loved 
by the wrong person. He’s afraid of being rejected.

LECTURE 12
BIG WONDER: 
STAR WARS
G
eorge Lucas wrote the script for the original smash-hit Star Wars 
film over many years and many different drafts with input from 
many other creative partners. It was a self-conscious attempt to 
create a universal myth that would resonate with audiences everywhere. 
Note: For brevity, this lecture will refer to the film as simply Star Wars, 
though its official title is now Star Wars: Episode IV—A New Hope. 
You’ll get the most out of this lecture (and avoid spoilers) if you’ve 
watched the film or read the script before proceeding.

THE HERO’S JOURNEY
n   
n
Lucas credited the influence of Joseph Campbell, who about 25 
years earlier had studied the myths of dozens of ancient cultures 
and arrived at the conclusion that they were all faces of the same 
primordial myth, an idea he called the Hero’s Journey. The basic 
idea is that a  hero goes across a  threshold into the unknown, is 
helped through trials and temptations, then undergoes death, 
atonement, rebirth, revelation, and finally battles his way back to 
the known world.
n   
n
To explain how cultures who’d never interacted could all have 
arrived at this complex, multi-stage story, Campbell adopted Carl 
Jung’s view that all human brains shared a  deep story language 
made up of universal archetypes. This idea is enormously influential, 
but hasn’t managed to live up to its promise. 
n   
n
Hollywood has commissioned thousands of Hero’s Journey films, 
most of which have failed, and none of which have repeated the 
miracle feat of Star Wars. And amateur writers have produced 
millions of Hero’s Journey scripts, almost all of which have vanished 
without a sound.
n   
n
One problem: Everything about Campbell’s theory has been 
debunked by modern neuroscientists. There are no eternal 
archetypes in the human mind. Nor are there universal myths 
shared by all human cultures. Anthropologists, folklorists, and 
literary scholars have shown that there’s enormous variety in 
the stories that different cultures tell. Yet even so, there remains 
the undeniable fact that Lucas set out to create a  global story 
and succeeded.

ENDING
n   
n
At the end of Star Wars, Luke Skywalker manages to save the Rebel 
Alliance from the evil Galactic Empire by destroying the Death 
Star. As the script tells us: “The Death Star bursts into a supernova, 
creating a spectacular heavenly display.”
n   
n
The Death Star’s nirvanic explosion is achieved through Luke’s 
use of the Force, the mystic power that unites the cosmos. It’s 
a spiritual, immaterial power that helps destroy the Death Star—not 
Luke’s heroic human qualities like courage or determination.
n   
n
This spiritual feeling is relentlessly emphasized in the final scene 
of the script. After Han Solo returns from helping Luke, Leia 
praises him for having left behind his crude materialism: “I knew 
there was more to you than money.” Then Han and Luke embrace, 
putting aside their romantic competition over Leia to display 
a brotherly love. 
n   
n
This turn toward the spiritual is the distinct, cognitive effect of Star 
Wars. The ending of the script encourages the audience to believe 
that there is a  heavenly wonder beyond. Terms for this effect 
include spiritual awe or big wonder.
n   
n
Most subsequent Hollywood executives and screenwriters have 
located the secret to Star Wars in the plot and the characters that 
Lucas borrowed from Campbell’s Hero’s Journey. But science 
reveals that the success of Star Wars is due to a  different story 
element than plot or character. That story element is tone.

121
TONE
n   
n
A script’s tone tells the reader how to see the 
story world. The script for Star Wars uses its 
opening lines to tells us exactly how it wants 
us to see: “A long time ago, in a  galaxy far, 
far away…” A  vast sea of stars serves as the 
backdrop for the main title. A  rollup slowly 
crawls into infinity. 
n   
n
The crawl goes on to reveal that the rebels have 
stolen the plans for the Death Star. Princess 
Leia is fleeing with those plans so that she 
can “save her people and restore freedom to 
the galaxy.”
n   
n
Lucas borrowed the idea for the crawl from 
his favorite childhood movie, which made 
him feel a  sense of spiritual awe. That movie 
was the 1940 serial Flash Gordon Conquers 
the Universe.
n   
n
When Lucas saw Flash Gordon as a  child, it 
inspired an enormous sense of wonder. But 
when he went back and rewatched it later as 
an adult, the film seemed a  little ridiculous. 
Therefore, Lucas took the pulp details of Flash 
Gordon and invested them with a heightened, 
mythic tone. 
n   
n
He does that in three ways in his opening 
crawl. First, instead of setting his story in Flash 
Gordon’s sci-fi future, Lucas sets it in the long 
ago past, instantly giving the plot a mythic feel. 

n   
n
Second, Lucas distills the idiosyncratic details of Flash Gordon 
into simpler, more general concepts. For example, instead of Flash 
Gordon’s Ming the Merciless, Star Wars has the Empire. Ming the 
Merciless has never been seen by anyone, but everyone knows 
what an empire is.
n   
n
Third, Lucas uses the opening crawl to invest everything with 
a sense of bigness. The script tells us that the words pass over “a 
vast sea of stars,” that drums “echo through the heavens,” and 
that the words disappear into “infinity.” This sense of bigness is 
the primordial feeling of spiritual awakening; the audience sees 
something so vast that it exceeds their ability to count.

Star Wars opens on a  chase scene that crisply reveals the story 
world’s core rule of action:
A tiny silver spacecraft, a  Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers 
from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursued by 
a  giant Imperial Star Destroyer. Hundreds of deadly laserbolts 
streak from the Imperial Star Destroyer, causing the main solar fin 
of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.
n   
n
Here a giant imperial ship, so massive that it’s earned the name 
Star Destroyer, attacks a tiny rebel spacecraft that’s designed not 
to fight, but to flee. The world of the story is governed by power. 
n   
n
The Empire is bigger than everyone else, and it uses its power not 
to protect the weak but to crush them. That’s the big rule that 
defines the story world of Star Wars: Might makes right.
CHARACTER
n   
n
In conflict with this story world are the film’s three main characters, 
Luke, Leia, and Han Solo. This part of the lecture will focus on Luke 
and his antagonist, Darth Vader. Here’s how Luke is introduced: 
122
Lecture 12  •  Big Wonder: Star Wars

123
“A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a large 
battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the desert floor 
much like an oil pipe with valves.”
n   
n
The audience’s first glimpse of Luke is as a  kind of repairman. 
And the particular object that the script shows Luke servicing 
isn’t mighty and impressive. It’s an old bit of equipment on some 
outback farm. And that’s how the script establishes Luke as the 
opposite of the Empire. The Empire lords over everyone; Luke 
modestly bends down to help.
n   
n
The script is equally efficient in its introduction of the main 
antagonist, Darth Vader.
The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his 
way into the blinding light of the main passageway. […] Everyone 
instinctively backs away from the imposing warrior and a deathly 
quiet sweeps through the Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel 
troops break and run in a frenzied panic.
n   
n
Vader is the human equivalent of the Star Destroyer. He embodies 
power with his sheer size. Like all antagonists, he’s the embodiment 
of the story world’s central rule.
PLOT
n   
n
There are some major story points of Star Wars that match 
Campbell’s narrative of the Hero’s Journey, for example, Luke’s 
refusal of the call when he initially refuses to learn from Obi-Wan. 
But the script also ignores many stages of the Hero’s Journey and 
draws heavily on other sources like Akira Kurosawa’s 1958 peasant-
princess adventure The Hidden Fortress. It also draws on Flash 
Gordon, which begins with a  death ship that’s been sent to kill 
a whole planet and draws to a close when the hero pilots his ship 
into the enemy’s fortress, exploding it.
Lecture 12  •  Big Wonder: Star Wars

n   
n
Like Flash Gordon, which was released in 12 different episodes, 
Star Wars was not meant to be a standalone film. It was supposed 
to have multiple, serial episodes. And like Flash Gordon and other 
TV shows, Star Wars doesn’t have one single hero. It has three: Luke, 
Leia, and Han.
n   
n
If you want to recreate the plot of Star Wars, start by sequentially 
introducing three heroes. Don’t write a script about a single hero 
on a journey. It will come off flat, especially since different audience 
members connect more to different heroes. 
n   
n
To generate an experience of a  spiritual awakening, your plot 
needs to make the audience look at the same thing twice. The first 
time, the thing will seem familiar. The second time, it will brim with 
a higher meaning.
n   
n
In plot terms, this means that the story should be reverse 
engineered as a giant loop, ending on a sacred return to a place 
that had previously embodied the regular rule of the story world. 
That is exactly what happens in the “heavenly” moment at the end 
of Star Wars when Luke returns in his X-wing to the Death Star that 
he had previously escaped in the Millennium Falcon.
n   
n
In your own script, you can similarly choose any point to begin and 
end your story loop. The important thing is simply to bring your 
audience back to an ordinary place that they can reexperience with 
new spiritual belief.
SCENE
n   
n
The secret to creating big wonder in the minds of an audience is to 
lead them through their own conversion experience. The audience’s 
brains have to be prepared for belief, and the crucial step in doing 
that is to create doubt about whatever it believed before.
124
Lecture 12  •  Big Wonder: Star Wars

125
Lecture 12  •  Big Wonder: Star Wars

n   
n
Star Wars has a number of scenes that do this, but the most critical 
part of the process occurs in the Millennium Falcon scene where 
Luke learns to find the Force. Luke is training with his lightsaber 
when Obi-Wan almost faints from what he calls “a great disturbance 
in the Force … as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror 
and were suddenly silenced.” 
n   
n
With this beat, the scene reestablishes the dramatic stakes by 
refreshing the core rule of the story world, reminding the audience 
of an imperial power that can kill millions in an instant. This 
tremendous, imperial menace in turn prompts an urgent question: 
How are the characters supposed to defeat the Empire? 
n   
n
The script provides its best answer in the form of Obi-Wan, who 
solemnly informs Luke that the path to victory is to join with the 
Jedi and believe in the Force. In 1977, audience members likely 
would have found this hokey: a  half-baked spiritualism totally at 
odds with the darker, skeptical, post-Vietnam ethos of the 1975 
Oscar-winner One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest and the 1976 
Cannes Film Festival winner Taxi Driver.
n   
n
The script for Star Wars includes a  clever device to ease the 
audience out of skepticism. The script inserts Han Solo into this 
scene to explicitly call out the Force for being a hokey religion. The 
cognitive effect: The audience drops its guard.
n   
n
Then the script illustrates the uglier side of being a skeptic. It notes 
that Han Solo has an air of “smugness,” which is not a great look. 
When Luke can’t find the Force, he flails around “blindly” with his 
lightsaber, which isn’t a great look either. This scene acts as a mirror 
for the audience’s jaded unbelief. 
n   
n
That lasts until the last beats of the scene, when Luke lets go of his 
own doubts and suddenly succeeds. This made the 1970s audience 
wonder what would happen if they dropped smugness and gave 
belief a chance.
126
Lecture 12  •  Big Wonder: Star Wars

127
n   
n
If you want to convert your audience to big wonder at the end 
of your script, reverse engineer an earlier scene that operates as 
a mirror to their own skepticism. End that earlier scene with a quick 
pivot that illustrates the promised land of belief, showing your 
audience what they’re missing and preparing them for the later 
story beat where you convert them into the big wonder of full belief.

LECTURE 13
CHARM: THE 
PRINCESS BRIDE
T
he Princess Bride was not a  blockbuster. In fact, it was the 
41st-highest-grossing film of 1987. Though it wasn’t an instant 
hit with audiences, it became a sleeper hit after its release on 
home video and grew into one of the most beloved films of all time. 
The reason: It became a secret treasure shared between people. This 
lecture takes a look at how that happened. To get the most out of it and 
avoid spoilers, read the movie’s script or watch it before proceeding.

ENDING
n   
n
The Princess Bride is a fairytale of true love read by a grandfather to 
his sick grandson. At the conclusion of the script, both the fairytale 
and its framing story of the grandfather reading to his grandson 
are finished But the last lines of the script reveal that neither 
story is really over. The grandfather will come back tomorrow 
and read the story again because he and the child have made 
a special connection. 
n   
n
The script’s final line is an in-joke: “As you wish…” In the secret 
language shared by the characters in the fairytale, “As you wish” 
means “I love you.” Now this secret language is shared by the 
child, his grandfather, and the audience. The technical term for this 
cognitive effect is charm: the forming of a secret connection and 
special sense of pleasure.
n   
n
This feeling of sharing a  secret is why The Princess Bride is 
considered so quotable. To smile at its off-beat quotes is to 
participate in a secret community.
STORY WORLD
n   
n
Unlike the previous scripts covered in this course, The Princess 
Bride seems to have two worlds: the framing or “real” world of the 
grandfather and the child and the fairytale world of Florin. But both 
worlds are really extensions of the same underlying story world.
n   
n
Early on, the script establishes that the rule of the framing world 
is an unhealthy loneliness: A sickly coughing kid is playing a video 
game by himself.  Likewise, the fairytale world is introduced with 
the character Buttercup playing her own solitary games, riding by 
herself and bossing a character named Westley around. 
n   
n
Like the child, Buttercup gets a kind of pleasure from these lonely 
pursuits. But it’s not a  deep and lasting satisfaction. It’s just 
a passing ego trip.
130
Lecture 13  •  Charm: The Princess Bride

131
Lecture 13  •  Charm: The Princess Bride
n   
n
The main antagonist in The Princess Bride is Crown Prince 
Humperdinck. He’s self-centered, forcing Buttercup to marry him 
as a pawn in a geopolitical chess game he has constructed in his 
head and is playing by himself. This is the same rule of action: 
unhealthy self-centeredness.
n   
n
The general screenwriting lesson here is that if you have multiple 
worlds within a  single script, they all should be part of one big 
story world. The more specific screenwriting trick is that if you want 
to generate charm, begin your script with two worlds that seem 
totally different but are really the same—the structure of a riddle. 
CHARACTER
n   
n
The first main character to be established is the grandfather, 
originally introduced as an oddball. He arrives with a  wrapped 
book to read to the child; the fact that the grandfather bothered to 
wrap it shows it’s a secret to be shared. The script continues in this 
vein when the grandfather reveals that his book has helped create 
a secret little community.

n   
n
The grandfather’s father read this book to him, and then he read 
it to the child’s father. This book isn’t a best-seller that the whole 
world knows about. It’s a hidden gem, passed down by people in 
the know. Now, the audience members get to be in the know, too.
n   
n
The script’s next main character, Westley, is similarly introduced as 
a maker of a special togetherness. Like the grandfather, Westley is 
portrayed as kooky and marginal at first. He does only two things. 
First, he obeys all of Buttercup’s orders. And second, he endlessly 
repeats the same phrase, “As you wish.”
n   
n
But slowly, the more this pattern repeats itself, the more a hidden 
meaning becomes clear. Eventually, Buttercup realizes the words 
mean, “I love you.” And to Buttercup’s surprise, she then realizes 
that she loves Westley back.
132
Lecture 13  •  Charm: The Princess Bride

133
n   
n
If you want to create the The Princess Bride’s same cognitive effect 
of charm, you can follow its blueprint. First, portray a main character 
as weird. Then, reveal that there’s something more beneath the 
character’s surface. Finally, turn that something more into a mutual 
affection between two characters. What initially seemed odd 
becomes a source of charm.
TONE
n   
n
Charm heavily relies on tone. The Princess Bride’s tone is gently 
intriguing. The script achieves this by infusing every beat of action 
with the lightest hint of irony. An example is the beat between the 
assassin Inigo and Westley, now wrapped in special packaging as 
the man in black.
n   
n
In a script filled with quirky moments, this is one of the quirkiest. 
Two men are about to duel to the death, when Inigo asks the other 
if he has an extra digit on his right hand. It seems utterly random. 
It’s funny, but only in the sense of being peculiar.
n   
n
But then the man in black’s response converts this feeling 
of strangeness into a  genuine smile: “Do you always begin 
conversations this way?” The man in black’s question to Inigo 
implies the sense of a  hidden meaning to life. He suggests that 
Inigo’s random question is not actually random. It reflects some 
deeper, hidden truth.
n   
n
Perhaps this truth is that Inigo has an unusual way of starting 
conversations. Or perhaps the truth is just that everyone in Florin is 
completely insane. Either way, it’s ironic.
n   
n
If you want to establish a  tone that charms your reader, follow 
the lead of The Princess Bride’s ironic narrator. Make gentle 
juxtapositions between the serious and the silly that hint at 
something more beneath the surface. Bundle every beat of action 
and dialogue in delicate layers of irony that hold the promise of 
a special connection, a chance to join a community sharing in the 
same secret gift.
Lecture 13  •  Charm: The Princess Bride

135
PLOT
n   
n
The plot of The Princess Bride is reverse 
engineered to create an air of secrets. It works 
like a  constant exercise in posing riddles. 
Violent assassins somehow turn out to be 
thoughtful and even humane. Married women 
somehow turn out not to be so married. Men 
who duel with their left hand somehow turn out 
not to be so left-handed. The dead somehow 
turn out not to be so dead.
n   
n
The more times the script does this, the more 
it encourages a sense of puzzles and mysteries 
everywhere, even when they’re not explicitly 
announced. And the script continues this tactic 
of spinning plot riddles right up to the very end.
n   
n
This constantly repeated technique, more than 
any overall plot structure, is how the plot of The 
Princess Bride, like the plot of many fairytales, 
generates charm. Fairytales are often rambling, 
baggy, and episodic in their narratives. Their 
charm does not come from an overarching 
plot. It comes from lots of little episodic riddles, 
each with its own quirky answer.
n   
n
If you want to charm, don’t make your plot 
too linear. Build it around lots and lots of 
little riddle-moments that the characters have 
to solve. Charm isn’t about a  clear, public 
purpose. It’s about endless, unexpected secret 
discoveries along the way.

SCENES
n   
n
Even though the overall script isn’t tightly plotted, its individual 
scenes are. If you want to write a  script that charms, copy the 
model of the two individual scenes in this section, and then string 
them together.
n   
n
The most powerful sources of charm are things that the entire 
world has written off as ugly but that your eye reclaims. The the 
script is able to make even its undistinguished minor antagonists, 
the assassins Inigo and Fezzik, into charmers. Their breakthrough 
occurs in a  scene where they quietly rebel against their leader 
Vizzini, telling him that they think there’s something wrong with 
killing Buttercup, since she’s innocent.
n   
n
This scene begins by introducing the core rule of the story world. 
The rule is that each person is unhealthily stuck on our own 
private island. That’s what Vizzini threatens to do quite literally to 
Fezzik: send him back, friendless and hopeless, to Greenland.
n   
n
Individual scenes often create their own miniarcs and ministakes 
by refreshing the story world in their opening beats, like Vizzini 
does when he mentions Greenland. The conflict intensifies when 
Inigo resists.
n   
n
The way the scene portrays Inigo’s resistance is crucial. Inigo 
reaches out with riddle-words that mean more than they seem on 
the surface. After a  moment, Fezzik cracks the secret code and 
joins in until both of them are playing a rhyming game together.
n   
n
The second scene is perhaps the most legendary moment in The 
Princess Bride: the battle of wits. After the man in black puts poison 
in one of two goblets, Vizzini must choose which one to drink.
n   
n
Vizzini grows in confidence until he selects a goblet, drains it with 
a knowing smile on his face, and promptly dies. The man in black 
turns to Buttercup and explains: “They were both poisoned. I spent 
the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.”
136
Lecture 13  •  Charm: The Princess Bride

137
n   
n
Just like the other scene discussed in this section, this scene first 
refreshes the stakes by reestablishing the rule of the world. It 
shows Vizzini’s unhealthy self-centeredness taking over everything.
n   
n
Vizzini vanishes into a vortex of his own point of view, becoming 
more and convinced of the correctness of his own personal 
perspective. He gets so far from the path of a healthy mind that 
it literally kills him. Then, the man in black reveals the secret of the 
wine to Buttercup, binding the two in a community of charm.

LECTURE 14
ALIENATION EFFECT: 
DO THE RIGHT THING 
S
pike Lee’s scripts are designed to make audiences think deeply 
and critically. His drive to make audiences think is why Lee 
wrote the script for Do the Right Thing, which became a cultural 
phenomenon and a box-office sensation, earning a nomination for an 
Academy Award for best original screenplay. This lecture looks at Spike 
Lee’s special recipe for making people think. Read the script or watch 
Do the Right Thing before proceeding.

ENDING
n   
n
Spike Lee’s script chronicles a  hot day in Brooklyn, where racial 
tensions between African-American residents and the Italian-
American proprietors of a local pizzeria escalate into a brawl that 
leads to a police killing of an unarmed resident, which in turn incites 
a crowd to burn down the pizzeria. 
n   
n
The script draws to a close with two quotes, one from Dr. Martin 
Luther King and one from Malcolm X. Here’s a shortened version of 
King’s quote: “Violence as a way of achieving racial justice is both 
impractical and immoral. […] Violence ends up defeating itself. It 
creates bitterness in the survivors and brutality in the destroyers.”
n   
n
Here’s the end of Malcolm X’s quote: “…I am not against using 
violence in self-defense. I don’t even call it violence when it’s self-
defense, I call it intelligence.” King, in other words, utterly rejects 
violence, while Malcolm X calls it smart. It’s up to the audience to 
figure out which is right. 
n   
n
The technical literary term for this experience of getting woken 
by a script is the alienation effect. That is the most usual English 
translation of Verfremdungseffekt, a term coined by the German 
playwright Bertolt Brecht. 
n   
n
During the rise of Nazi Germany, Brecht used the alienation effect 
in scripts that spurred people to think critically about what the 
Nazis were doing. This was a counterpoint to Joseph Goebbels’s 
use of pro-Nazi propaganda, which shut off people’s minds by 
drenching them in fear, hate, and other strong emotions.
n   
n
Brecht was writing and producing scripts in Germany at the time 
of the Nazi rise to power. And Brecht saw that a huge part of the 
Nazis’ political success was due to Joseph Goebbels’s theories 
about propaganda.

Lecture 14  •  Alienation Effect: Do the Right Thing 
n   
n
Lee gravitated to Brecht’s techniques because he had come to 
the conclusion that Hollywood was itself cranking out a  form of 
propaganda. Hollywood was so financially invested in pleasing 
audiences that it preferred to offer them mental comfort food, 
so that instead of doing the hard and honest work of serious art, 
Hollywood catered to audiences with sentimental escapism.

STORY WORLD
n   
n
The premise of the alienation effect is that humans live in an 
artificial world of propaganda and media fictions. Do the Right 
Thing begins with a radio performance that starts out sounding like 
a call to revolution: “Wake up, wake up, wake up.”
n   
n
But quickly, the style overtakes the substance. It becomes more 
about the cleverness of wordplay and the intricacy of sound: “The 
platters that matter, the matters they platter.” This sounds stylish 
and cool, but it doesn’t mean much. 
n   
n
That’s how the script establishes the world. It’s a world of media 
patter that seems so smooth, yet is really just an empty surface. If 
you want to create your own alienating story world, you can follow 
Do the Right Thing’s blueprint. Find the most convincingly cool 
piece of propaganda you can. Then, let it play a few beats too long 
so that it loses its gloss and its freshness, revealing its superficiality 
and making your audience suddenly question.
CHARACTERS
n   
n
Do the Right Thing’s main character is Mookie, although there’s 
not the usual hierarchy between main and minor characters in 
this script. To maximize the alienation effect, it’s much more of an 
ensemble piece.
n   
n
The script introduces Mookie as the opposite of cool. He’s revealed 
in a hot, steamy room that feels like the underbelly of the world. 
And his first action is to be an irritant. He slips over to a sleeping 
woman, tickling her lips to wake her up. And the sleeping woman 
is not amused. This is her only day to sleep in, and Mookie has 
ruined it.
142
Lecture 14  •  Alienation Effect: Do the Right Thing 

143
n   
n
To emphasize Mookie’s disruptive potential, the script adds 
a clever alienation effect by withholding the fact that Mookie is the 
sleeping woman’s brother. The audience only learns of their sibling 
relationship after he has crawled into bed and played with her lips.
n   
n
At first glance, the scene has an almost erotic feel. And when the 
revelation of Mookie’s true intentions comes, it’s startling to the 
audience, because their feelings were wrong.
n   
n
Other characters introduced as irritants include the mayor, who 
squabbles with a store clerk, and Radio Raheem, who walks around 
with his music annoyingly loud. The big point here is that the 
script introduces many characters in conflict, and shows them all 
experiencing the conflict with equal intensity, so none of them can 
be subordinated to each other.
n   
n
By doing so, it busts up the traditional Hollywood story of a hero 
who changes the system. The real truth is that people can’t sit 
around dreaming of a hero to save them. They have to wake up and 
realize that the only way to fix their problems is to join forces with 
other people who are in the same bind.
n   
n
The script then departs further from the usual Hollywood model in 
its depiction of the characters’ motivations. The script invests each 
character with a mix of motives. For example, Mookie is portrayed 
as a  nuisance, then a  hustler, then a  father, then an opportunist, 
then a  social conscience. This begs the questions: What is he 
fighting for? What does he most deeply believe? 
n   
n
The antagonist—in this case, Sal—is usually a physical embodiment 
of the story world’s core rule. At first, that’s what Sal is: the human 
face of propaganda cool. Sal drives up to his pizzeria in his stylish 
car, wearing equally stylish clothes. When conflict and raw emotion 
arise, Sal immediately smoothes them over.
Lecture 14  •  Alienation Effect: Do the Right Thing 

145
n   
n
But eventually, the script blows Sal’s cool apart. 
Sal’s final line in the scene is a heated cry from 
the heart: “I’m gonna kill somebody today.” So 
the antagonist has his own hot conflict with the 
story world, which makes the audience start to 
question: Is anybody happy here? 
n   
n
Here’s the big, three-part blueprint that you 
can borrow for writing characters who create 
an alienation effect:
  
 
First, 
create 
an 
ensemble 
of 
main 
characters, all of whom rupture the smooth, 
superficial cool of the propaganda world. 
  
 
Second, give your characters an ironic 
mix of heroic and ignoble motives, so the 
audience has to think it out themselves.
  
 Third, introduce an antagonist who seems 
to be the face of the world’s propaganda 
cool, but is then revealed to hate it. Even 
if viewers identify at first more with the 
antagonist than with the ensemble main 
characters, they quickly feel alienated too.
PLOT
n   
n
The classic method for using plot to create an 
alienation effect is laid out by Bertolt Brecht 
in his script Mother Courage and Her Children, 
which portrays the title character as she makes 
the same mistake over and over. 

n   
n
Mother Courage lives in a  world where money is everything, so 
each time she gets involved in a financial transaction, she haggles. 
And every time she haggles, another of her children dies. So even 
though the audience starts out feeling empathetic for Mother 
Courage’s situation, the repetition of the same error, again and 
again and again, makes the audience start to experience it less 
emotionally and analyze it more critically.
n   
n
Likewise, the whole plot of Do the Right Thing is filled with identical 
loops, repeating the same basic story beats over and over. An 
example: Racial conflicts flare up, then die down, then flare up, and 
then die down.
n   
n
The story world, in other words, isn’t going to change of its own 
accord. The plot will keep going around and around—unless the 
audience wakes up and starts to question. As Mookie’s sister Jade 
puts it: “I don’t mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct 
your energies in a more useful way.”
n   
n
If you want to craft a plot that encourages your audience to direct 
their energies more usefully, try following Do the Right Thing’s 
Brechtian blueprint. Give your audience a story where a negative 
situation repeats itself over and over. Keep it going until your 
audience’s brains wake up and decide to critically intervene. 
TONE
n   
n
Since alienation is driven by an unresolved conflict within the 
audience, the tone of Do the Right Thing is reverse engineered 
to make the audience feel two conflicting things at once. Half the 
time, the tone of the script is matter-of-fact realism. The other half 
of the time, it’s a heightened style that seems like a self-conscious 
performance. Each of these tones disrupts the other, making the 
audience wonder which one is true. 
146

For example, in Do the Right Thing’s opening titles, the character 
Tina is first shown in a dress, which feels more realistic. But then 
she’s shown in boxing gloves, which is more costume performance. 
Then she’s back in the dress before switching back to the 
boxing gloves.

Another example is how the script describes Mookie counting 
his bills in his opening scene: “This isn’t any ordinary counting of 
money, he’s straightening out all the corners of the bills, arranging 
them so the bills—actually the ‘dead presidents’—are facing the 
same way.”
n   
n
Here, the script’s narrator does a little double take. Mookie’s bills 
are bills, and then they’re not. They’re dead presidents.
n   
n
If you want to establish the same tone in your next script, you can 
follow Do the Right Thing and create a narrator that sees with two 
different gods’ eyes. One set sees the truth, and the other sees 
another, conflicting truth. Then speak both truths, like Malcolm X 
and King.
SCENES
n   
n
Do the Right Thing is filled with scenes that generate alienation, 
from the shocking destruction of the pizzeria to the moment where 
characters break the fourth wall to spit racial slurs. But none of its 
scenes better creates a feeling of deep and unresolved emotion 
than the one where Sal gives a special slice to Mookie’s sister.
n   
n
On the surface, everything seems cool. But underneath the 
propaganda chill is a  violent collision of unresolved emotions. 
An older white man is making special food for a  younger black 
woman and then staring creepily as she eats it. The audience feels 
unsettled.
n   
n
Their emotional discomfort is heightened by the way that the 
scene includes the family members of the older white male and the 
younger black woman. They see what’s happening, but they feel 
powerless to speak up or intervene.
148
Lecture 14  •  Alienation Effect: Do the Right Thing 

149
n   
n
And finally, in a classic Brechtian move, the scene ends with a line 
that reveals it’s all going to happen again: “Don’t wait too long 
to come back.” The plot is stuck in a circle, unless the audience 
questions what they’ve just seen.
n   
n
If you want to prompt Do the Right Thing’s effect of critical thinking 
in your audience, study Lee’s script and learn from its blueprint. 
Write an unresolved ending, a  superficial world, an ensemble 
of irritant characters with ironically mixed motives, a  conflicted 
antagonist, a  double-talking tone, and a  circular plot filled with 
equally circular subplots that go around and around.

LECTURE 15
REDEMPTION: 
UNFORGIVEN
I
f you want to write a  Western, Unforgiven is a  great model to 
work from. But it also offers a  lesson in something bigger: how 
to reclaim any story that Hollywood has left out in the cold. The 
world is full of classic genres that Hollywood has forgotten: courtroom 
dramas, historical epics, political thrillers, and so on. This lecture 
examines how the script for Unforgiven revived the gritty soul of the 
Western to give you a blueprint for bringing your own favorite lost story 
back. If you haven’t watched Unforgiven or read the script, take a look 
before proceeding.

ENDING
n   
n
Unforgiven tells the story of reformed gunslinger, William Munny, 
who’s sworn off his old ways of drinking and killing for his now-
departed wife, only to be lured back for one last murderous 
rampage to revenge a cut-up prostitute in Big Whiskey, Wyoming.
n   
n
In the last moments of Unforgiven’s script, Munny’s silhouette walks 
towards his wife’s grave at dusk. This is accompanied by a crawl 
of words:
Some years later, Mrs. Ansonia Feathers made the arduous 
journey to Hodgeman County to visit the last resting place of her 
only daughter. 
William Munny had long since disappeared with the children … 
some said to San Francisco where it was rumored he prospered 
in dry goods. 
And there was nothing on the marker to explain to Mrs. Feathers 
why her only daughter had married a known thief and murderer, 
a man of notoriously vicious and intemperate disposition.
n   
n
The script ends by posing a question: Why would a good woman 
marry William Munny? Her mother never understands it. But at 
the end of the script, the audience feels they do: They’ve seen 
Munny do terrible things, but he did them to stop worse things 
from happening.
n   
n
Many heroes of Westerns aren’t heroes at all. Instead, they’re 
antiheroes. Unlike a regular hero, the antihero has a monster in his 
heart. And in his hands, he carries the same dark instruments as 
the bad guys. The only thing that absolves his behavior is that the 
people he murders are worse than he is.
152
Lecture 15  •  Redemption: Unforgiven

153
Lecture 15  •  Redemption: Unforgiven
n   
n
The popularity of antiheroes in American storytelling touches 
on something even deeper in the American psyche: the belief in 
second chances. The term for this cognitive effect is redemption, 
and even if you don’t want to write a Western, this effect can help 
you resurrect your audience’s belief in romance, or the Rust Belt, or 
justice, or some other worn and battered thing.
STORY WORLD
n   
n
The script for Unforgiven begins its journey into redemption by 
establishing a thoroughly disenchanted story world. First, the script 
relates the story of a young woman who marries a brute and dies 
of smallpox. 

n   
n
Then, it introduces a  brothel where an act of rough sex is 
interrupted by screams from the next room, where two men 
hold down a  woman and cut her face with a  hunting knife until 
the manager puts a gun to their heads. This is a world of death 
and disease, where sex is an animal act and where people cruelly 
butcher one another.
n   
n
The local sheriff, Little Bill, arrives and promises to dispense 
justice. The brothel’s owner complains that his “property” has been 
damaged. The sheriff agrees, declaring that justice can be done 
by exchanging one piece of property for another. In this case, he 
reckons that a woman is worth seven ponies.
n   
n
The other women react in horror to Little Bill’s decision, but Little 
Bill responds by defending the woman’s attackers. To Little Bill, 
the men with the knife are actually more virtuous than the woman 
they cut. 
n   
n
That’s what passes for justice in this story world. And it reveals 
that the core law of Unforgiven’s story world is a deep and ugly 
dishonesty. Little Bill talks in lofty, moral tones, but instead of 
enforcing justice, he excuses a horrific crime, sets the attackers free, 
and then blames the victims.
n   
n
The lesson here is that if you want to lead your audience into 
redemption, begin your script by introducing a story world where 
the belief you want to redeem is dead. This meets the audience 
in their current state of disenchantment, and it paints the grim 
consequences of living in a place where that belief is gone.
CHARACTER
n   
n
After Unforgiven establishes its story world of dishonest men, it 
then introduces its antihero, William Munny. The script introduces 
Munny as he’s wrangling pigs in the mud with his children. He’s 
approached by the bedraggled gunslinger known as the Kid. 
154
Lecture 15  •  Redemption: Unforgiven

155
n   
n
The scene tells us that Munny has remained true to his wife’s 
memory. He’s stuck with his kids and his hogs, doing his best to 
save the healthy by separating out the sick.
n   
n
And the script then emphasizes the remarkable nature of Munny’s 
new life by showing us that, underneath, Munny hasn’t really 
reformed at all. A  few beats later, it becomes clear that Munny 
plays dumb in response to the Kid’s questions in case the Kid is 
an assassin.
n   
n
With this, the script reveals that the cunning old thief and murderer 
still lives in Munny. Honesty isn’t automatic to him. It’s just that he 
wakes up every morning determined to work on it.
n   
n
By juxtaposing Munny and Little Bill in its opening scenes, 
Unforgiven’s script lays out the first and third steps of its three-step 
blueprint for establishing an antihero. The first step is to introduce 
a false hero like Little Bill. If you want audiences to put their faith 
in a self-proclaimed bad man who does good, it helps to start by 
showing them a self-proclaimed good man who does bad.
n   
n
The third step is for you to introduce your antihero as a character 
who accepts the fallen ways of the world. Unlike a true hero, the 
antihero doesn’t try to change the disenchanted rule of the 
story world. 
n   
n
The second step can be found in the scene between the 
introductions of Little Bill and Munny involving Alice and the 
women of the brothel. When Faith reveals she has twice as much 
money as anyone, Alice remarks: “Jesus, Faith. You’ve been giving 
Skinny something special?” 
n   
n
The more cash the women have, the more unspeakable the acts 
they’ve done, which is to say, that the women have been engaged 
in their own form of dishonesty. They’ve acted in ways they haven’t 
admitted, even to each other, aligning them with the tragic rule of 
their fallen story world.
Lecture 15  •  Redemption: Unforgiven

n   
n
Yet this scene also reveals that the women’s dishonesty serves 
a  good cause. They’re banding together to resist Little Bill and 
get justice. 
n   
n
That completes the three-step blueprint for introducing an antihero 
that you can steal from Unforgiven. First, introduce a  false hero. 
Second, introduce a  group of minor antiheroes who resist the 
false hero. And third, have your main antihero come to assist those 
minor antiheroes.
PLOT
n   
n
Unforgiven begins with a clear injustice, the cutting of Delilah’s face, 
that kicks off a classic Western storyline: the hunt for fugitives that 
culminates in a showdown. And then it shows the futility of heroism 
by having Munny act well and accomplish no good. First, Little Bill 
savagely beats the sober and noble-minded Munny. Then, Munny 
falls into a delirium and thinks of heaven. Then he admits that he 
doesn’t want to kill anyone.
156
Lecture 15  •  Redemption: Unforgiven

157
n   
n
The script shows Munny on his best behavior. And it also shows that 
his best behavior doesn’t make the world any better. This makes 
the audience slowly wish that Munny would drop his good-guy 
routine and start to act a little more bad.
n   
n
To feed the audience’s desire to see more of the bad William 
Munny, the script ramps up the dark actions of the false heroes. 
And to kick off those dark actions, it introduces English Bob, who 
has a hack writer, Beauchamp, follow him around to mythologize 
his achievements. However, Little Bill viciously beats down English 
Bob and steals Bob’s writer to mythologize his own lies.
n   
n
This is the old writing trick of having one shark get swallowed by 
another shark. That’s how you know the second shark is really bad: 
He snacks on other predators.
n   
n
Once the script has established Little Bill as the walking 
embodiment of the old lies, it then amplifies his crimes by having 
him commit another horrific injustice. He kills and tortures Munny’s 
old partner Ned, then claims it as an act of law and order.
n   
n
With this story beat, the script tells the audience: the longer that 
Munny keeps his hands clean, the more innocents will die. The 
only way to fix things is for the antihero to do good by once again 
acting bad.
n   
n
In the closing beats of the story, the script unleashes the antihero. 
But Munny is far worse than the audience expects: He kills in a haze 
of drunkenness, later remarking: “I’ve always been lucky when it 
comes to killing folks.” And he doesn’t just defeat the antagonist in 
a shootout. He executes Little Bill in cold blood, while Little Bill lies 
wounded and defenseless on the floor. 
n   
n
Then as Munny is walking out, he cruelly murders another wounded 
man. And Munny’s behavior becomes even more ugly from here. 
He flees town before he can die, threatening civilians on the way. 
Munny’s actions combine the worst, most animal impulses: cruelty, 
blind fury, and fear. Yet the result makes the world a little less bad.
Lecture 15  •  Redemption: Unforgiven

159
TONE
n   
n
Unforgiven adopts a special kind of god’s-eye 
narrator. The narrator shows the unvarnished 
reality of being a  cowboy when a  man starts 
shooting at Ned and Munny, and Munny ends 
up on the ground, his face bloodied. But it’s 
not because Munny was hit by a rival gunslinger. 
He just banged his head falling off his horse.
n   
n
Then, the narrative reveals that the man 
shooting was the Kid. The Kid is so blind that 
he didn’t realize it was Munny; he was never 
a threat because he can’t hit the side of a barn.
n   
n
The effect of this honesty: When the audience 
sees a glimmer of good in the actions of an old 
cowboy, they can trust it’s not a  fantasy. It’s 
the truth. If you want your script to generate 
a  feeling of redemption in audiences, you’ll 
want to use this kind of god’s-eye narrator too. 
SCENE
n   
n
Unforgiven’s two-part recipe for redemption 
begins by demolishing the old clichés. For 
example, a  demolition of the old cowboy 
fantasies occurs in the jailhouse scene where 
Little Bill reads Beauchamp’s saga of English 
Bob. Little Bill misreads “Duke of Death” 
as “Duck of Death” and from there continues 
to send the whole legend of English Bob 
dissolving into absurdity. Little Bill also tells 
his version of the story, omitting details that 
cast him in a bad light, setting him up as the 
dishonest antagonist after at first appearing to 
be a hero.

n   
n
The second and final part of the script’s recipe for redemption is 
the doubling down on the one true myth. And there’s no better 
example of this than the moment where Munny talks to Delilah, the 
woman cut up in the brothel.
n   
n
Munny begins by wallowing in his own fears: “I thought I was gone. 
I thought I was dying for sure.” So like everyone else in this story 
world, Munny admits that the focus of all his thoughts was on his 
own survival.
n   
n
But instead of making Munny angry or desperate or cruel, this 
worldly self-interest makes Munny see something bigger than 
himself. As he says: “I wouldn’t normally pay no notice to high 
country like this. Trees. But I sure notice them now.” 
n   
n
Out of Munny’s selfish fear of dying comes a glimpse of something 
greater. The remainder of the scene then deepens this action of 
good-from-bad when Delilah nervously offers Munny a “free one.” 
Munny declines, prompting Delilah to blush.
n   
n
Delilah’s dialogue reestablishes the story world of the script as 
a world of animal desires and free advances, a world where men 
see only surface things. That is, until Munny reveals that he does 
see the deep beauty inside her, just like he sees it in the trees.
n   
n
For a  moment, Munny seems almost heroic. And then the script 
reminds the audience of who Munny really is. To avoid either 
sleeping with Delilah or hurting her feelings, Munny lies. When 
Munny mentions his wife, Delilah thinks he means his wife is still 
alive. So Munny dishonestly tells Delilah that his wife is back in 
Kansas, watching over his “young ones.”
160
Lecture 15  •  Redemption: Unforgiven

161
n   
n
Once again, Munny doesn’t challenge the tragic rule of the world’s 
dishonesty. Instead, he lives by it. But Munny doesn’t follow Little 
Bill in using the lies of the world for his own craven gain. Instead, he 
repurposes the world’s dishonesty for a social cause, putting the 
hearts of both Delilah and his dead wife at peace. 
n   
n
With that, the scene shows you how to double-down on the old 
myth of the antihero. Give the audience a character whose selfish 
fear of death opens their eyes to the greater world. Give the 
audience a character who turns the bad rule of the world into an 
unexpected kind of good.

LECTURE 16
SURREAL 
CONNECTION: 
PULP FICTION
P
ulp Fiction ushered in the indie movie revolution of the 1990s. 
It became the first independent film to gross over $100 million 
at the American box office, and it went on to earn an Oscar for 
its two screenwriters, Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary. The film 
has its own clear cognitive purpose, and its core story techniques are 
derived from a clearly defined artistic tradition that stretches back to 
the early 20th century. The film’s script provides a blueprint for making 
new stories feel accessible. As always, you’ll get the most out of this 
lecture—and avoid spoilers—if you read the script or watch the film 
before proceeding.

ENDING
n   
n
Pulp Fiction chronicles the adventures of a  pair of Los Angeles 
hitmen, Vincent and Jules, who are sent on various errands—like 
retrieving a briefcase and escorting the boss’s wife, Mia—before 
they witness a minor robbery in a coffee shop and then go their 
separate ways. One goes to walk the earth for God, the other to 
get killed on another petty criminal mission.
n   
n
One is about to be dead and the other has just seen the light. 
They’re wearing swim trunks and crazy t-shirts; they have guns 
stuffed into their waistbands. Then they step out into the sunshine 
with a mysterious briefcase.
n   
n
This ending doesn’t make much sense unless it’s considered with 
the script’s other endings: The script is broken into three discrete 
chapters, each with its own conclusion.
n   
n
The first chapter ends with Mia and Vincent shaking hands and 
sharing a private joke. The second chapter ends with two former 
enemies hugging and having the exchange: 
“So we’re cool?” 
“Yeah, man, we’re cool.” 
n   
n
And the third chapter ends with four desperados getting together 
for a group photo. All of these endings are moments of friendship. 
To experience the end of Pulp Fiction is to feel like you’ve just 
made a friend. The movie provides a goofy sense of exuberance—
though it’s almost haphazard and illogical.
n   
n
There are many different ways that stories can communicate 
a feeling of friendship. Pulp Fiction does so in a particularly bold 
way. To emphasize both the unreason and the eternity of its friend 
connections, the script’s final scene of the two hitmen in flip-flops 
employs an artistic technique named collage, which has its roots in 
a 20th-century art movement known as surrealism.
164
Lecture 16  •  Surreal Connection: Pulp Fiction

165
Lecture 16  •  Surreal Connection: Pulp Fiction
n   
n
For the purposes of understanding Pulp Fiction and its use of 
collage, the key feature of surrealism is its effort to locate the 
deep patterns of life in something other than emotion or reason: 
the imagination.
n   
n
In a collage, different scraps of pop culture are arranged together 
into a striking new whole. Cuttings from newspaper ads might be 
juxtaposed with magazine engravings or ticket stubs or photos to 
create unexpected moments of imaginative togetherness.
n   
n
Pulp Fiction brilliantly employs this same technique in the final beat 
of its script. That beat is filled with scraps of pop culture: the “I’m 
with stupid” t-shirts, the gangsters, the briefcase of money, and 
the other cheesy genre clichés.
n   
n
Yet these scraps don’t feel random. They’re carefully arranged into 
an imaginative pattern that makes them feel at one with each other. 
That’s surreal connection.
STORY WORLD
n   
n
Although Pulp Fiction is an indie script, it starts in traditional 
fashion by establishing the core rule of its story world. In the 
opening scene, the audience meets a young man and woman in 
a Los Angeles coffee shop. The man is English, and “like his fellow 
countrymen, smokes cigarettes like they’re going out of style.” The 
woman is “impossible” to place: “Everything she does contradicts 
something she did.”
n   
n
Immediately, the script establishes a  story world whose rule 
is that meaning has disintegrated into tiny subcultures, where 
the English have their own random quirks and Los Angeles 
has its own idiosyncratic breakfast routines. The result of this 
fragmentation is that it’s impossible to achieve a global sense of 
what anything means. 

166
n   
n
The screenwriting lesson here is that if you want to convert your 
audience to a  new aesthetic like surrealist collage, begin by 
establishing a story world that suffers from the cultural crisis 
that the new aesthetic was invented to remedy, attuning 
your audience to the need for a heroic artistic intervention. 
CHARACTER
n   
n
Some critics have complained that Pulp Fiction’s 
characters aren’t very well rounded. Pulp 
Fiction introduces its characters in conflict 
with the nihilist fragmentation of 
its story world by portraying 
these 
characters 
as 
they 
create deeper moments of 
imaginative connection.
n   
n
For example, chapter one of the 
script is crammed with moments 
of 
imaginative 
connection 
by 
Jules and Vincent, perhaps most 
famously when Jules cut-and-pastes 
Ezekiel’s Old Testament “And you 
will know my name is the Lord” onto 
his and Vincent’s payback killing. 
n   
n
Although this Biblical fragment is torn 
from an entirely different historical time 
and place, the imaginative force of 
the association is so powerful that it 
prompts Jules and Vincent to open 
fire simultaneously, bringing them 
suddenly together.

n   
n
Contrary to the objections of critics, the characters of Pulp Fiction 
are carefully and appropriately constructed in conflict with the 
story world. In fact, the very qualities of Pulp Fiction’s characters 
to which critics have objected are what make these characters 
appropriately surreal. 
n   
n
The surrealist-influenced fiction of writers like William S. 
Burroughs, Alice Carter, Gabriel García Márquez, and 
Salman Rushdie contains characters that can also lack 
a certain psychological depth. Instead, they feel more 
like cultural fragments or snapshots from a dream.
n   
n
The screenwriting takeaway here is to not get 
waylaid by supposedly universal aesthetic criteria 
like the need for well-rounded characters. If you 
want to write an indie script like Pulp Fiction, you 
have to be prepared to follow the logic of your 
own revolutionary aesthetic, even if it breaks 
the art world’s supposedly unbreakable rules.
PLOT
n   
n
The screenwriters of Pulp Fiction 
started with a  classic, linear, pulp 
gangster 
tragedy 
about 
Vincent 
and his various escapades. Vincent 
retrieves a briefcase for his boss, then 
accidentally shoots a man and has to go 
to the Wolf to get the mess cleaned up. 
Next, he ends up in the coffee shop while 
it’s being robbed, then goes to take care of 
a  double-crossing boxer, and then gets killed 
by the boxer, who keeps the pulp serial going by 
embarking on his own adventure.
167
Lecture 16  •  Surreal Connection: Pulp Fiction

n   
n
Having created this classic, linear story, the screenwriters broke 
it up into fragments that they rearranged into a surrealist collage. 
This out-of-order collage prompts us in the audience to keep 
making imaginative connections between the different plot lines.
n   
n
And this Surrealist effect is powerfully reinforced when the narrative 
ends where it began, back in the robbery of the LA coffee shop. 
To come back to this scene is to suddenly understand all the plot 
beats you didn’t get before. 
n   
n
The big lesson here is that the way to write a surrealist plot is to 
start by writing any regular genre plot. Then cut it into pieces and 
arrange it into a collage. Make sure that the final story fragment 
completes the first fragment, so that your plot ends on a note of 
coming together.
168
Lecture 16  •  Surreal Connection: Pulp Fiction

169
TONE
n   
n
At first, the tone of Pulp Fiction seems all over the place. It’s 
a  mashup of different pulp genres, by turns poetic and harsh, 
violent and philosophical, nightmarish and absurd.
n   
n
But there is an overall consistency that binds the whole together. 
That binding is the tone that the surrealists found in dream. Dreams 
can go all over the place. They can drift from gentleness to horror 
in an instant, and yet they always have that same special dream-
like feel.
n   
n
The key to creating a dream feel in writing lies in the transitions 
between different tonal moments. Although the script of Pulp 
Fiction mixes together all sorts of different pulp fragments, its 
narrator maintains a  consistent tone by smoothing out the 
transitions between them. 
n   
n
The major way the narrative smooths these transitions is through 
its use of odd couples. No major shifts of tone ever happen to one 
character alone. They always happen to two strange friends at once. 
The friends discuss the change as it happens, and as the friends 
talk about it, they reinforce the connection by continually repeating 
each other’s words. For example: “My little black medical book” is 
replied to with “I never saw no medical book.”
n   
n
By recycling each other’s words, the characters bind each moment 
to the next, so that their odd-couple conversations become the 
thread that stitches the whole collage together.
n   
n
If you want to create a surreal tone in your writing, this is a great 
technique to steal. Smooth the transitions between your collage 
fragments by having them experienced simultaneously by two 
characters who blend together into one by talking the same.
Lecture 16  •  Surreal Connection: Pulp Fiction

171
﻿Lecture 16  •  Surreal Connection: Pulp Fiction
SCENES
n   
n
Traditional 
Hollywood 
movies 
engage 
audiences using two big devices: empathy 
for the characters and suspense generated 
by the plot. But surrealism weakens both 
of those normal narrative hooks by using 
interchangeable characters and dream stories 
that soften the stakes and give their ending 
away.
n   
n
Reverse engineering can solve this story 
problem. If the goal is to make the audience go 
on the same strange journey as the characters, 
the audience’s brains must undergo the 
same cognitive trip as the characters. Since 
sympathetic identification is unavailable, it’s 
necessary to engineer each scene on two levels 
at once. 
n   
n
The first level will involve the plot-journey 
taken by the characters in the story, which 
is a  movement from nihilism to surrealist 
togetherness. The second level will layer in 
extra story structures that are specifically 
designed to guide the audience’s mind on the 
same journey in parallel.
n   
n
This double layering of story structure is exactly 
what Pulp Fiction’s script does. For example, 
take the infamous accidental shooting scene. 
In this scene, Jules has just had a  religious 
conversion, coming to believe that God 
intervened and stopped bullets from killing him. 
Vincent is skeptical. Holding his .45 casually, he 
turns to Marvin, the guy in the back of the car, 
to ask his opinion.
171

n   
n
In the world of the story, Vincent and Jules are spiraling into 
nihilism because one of them has found religion while the other 
hasn’t. They’re coming apart, like the post-modern world. But 
the scene’s unexpected gunshot plunges the audience into 
the same experience of shock and chaos, so that instead of just 
witnessing Vincent and Jules’s transition into a  state of mental 
fragmentation, the audience viscerally undergoes that journey into 
disorientation too.
n   
n
The lesson here is that if you want to create the same surreal 
effect as Pulp Fiction, you have to introduce sharp shocks like the 
unexpected gunshot into your script. The cognitive precondition 
for surreal connection is the feeling that all reason has been blown 
apart, and so to put your audience in the right frame of mind to get 
surreal, you have to give them shellshock.
n   
n
From here, the next step is to continue the double story structure 
by laying in an element that guides your audience’s minds out of 
shock into surreal connection. That is what the accidental shooting 
scene does by transitioning into a moment of collage. Here’s how 
it works.
n   
n
As Jules panics about getting pulled over by the cops with blood 
everywhere, Vincent tries to reassure him. This scene is thick with 
the devices of collage. The characters stop arguing and go back to 
repeating each other’s words: “Friendly places … friendly places …
Toluca Lake … Toluca Lake.” Jules brings unexpected parts of the 
world into juxtaposition through the phone call. He and Vincent 
make a new friend in Jimmie. 
n   
n
That’s the two-part blueprint for engaging your audience with 
surrealism. First, put in story beats where your characters argue, 
and punctuate those beats of disconnection with sharp shocks 
that make the audience feel fractured too. Second, bring your 
characters together in moments of surreal connection, and 
172
Lecture 16  •  Surreal Connection: Pulp Fiction

173
reinforce those moments of connection with the techniques of 
imaginative collage, so that your audience travels side by side with 
the characters into dream.
n   
n
After you write one scene like this, do what the screenwriters for 
Pulp Fiction did and write more. Because when you leave behind 
the plot techniques that traditional Hollywood scripts use to keep 
the audience’s attention taut, you need to continually recreate 
a sense of narrative urgency and dramatic stakes by refreshing the 
cognitive conflict between nihilism and surreal connection.

LECTURE 17
BIG SYMPATHY: 
TOY STORY
T
o keep the business going, Hollywood studios have a  huge 
incentive to make writing as mechanized and reliable as 
possible. Rather than encouraging writers to develop creative 
and innovative new stories, studios instead ask them to take the less 
risky approach of copying what has worked in the past. But the success 
of the 1995 movie Toy Story reveals that even within this industrial 
storytelling machine, there’s still room to innovate. Pixar, the film’s 
parent studio, cast away the current Hollywood formulas for children’s 
movies and then identified a specific cognitive effect that audiences 
craved but that Hollywood had been neglecting. Reminder: To avoid 
spoilers and get the most out of this lecture, read the script or watch 
the film before proceeding.

ENDING
n   
n
Toy Story chronicles the adventures of a  pull-string cowboy doll 
named Woody who was once the favorite plaything of his owner, 
six-year-old Andy, but who gets replaced by a new space ranger 
toy named Buzz Lightyear.
n   
n
For most of the script, Woody tries to get rid of Buzz and reclaim 
his old place in Andy’s affections, until at the end, the two toys 
open their hearts to each other and become buddies. They join 
forces to escape the clutches of the toy-destroying neighbor, Sid, 
and make their way home.
n   
n
In the final beats of the script, Buzz and Woody sit together as 
Andy opens his Christmas presents. The first present is a  Mrs. 
Potato Head, and the toys all cheer and congratulate Mr. Potato 
Head on his new life partner. But the script doesn’t end on this 
upbeat moment. Instead, there’s one more present left for Andy to 
open—which turns out to be a toy-chewing puppy.
n   
n
Even though Buzz and Woody do their best to laugh, this is not the 
ending they were hoping for. The script began with Woody being 
replaced by a new plaything, and the script now ends with both 
Woody and Buzz being replaced. 
n   
n
The key difference: Buzz may have arrived exactly back where 
Woody was, but now there are two of them sitting in Andy’s 
bedroom, grimacing and smiling weakly together. Woody no longer 
needs to look alone into the tragic truth that time is passing. Buzz 
feels sympathy for Woody, and Woody feels sympathy for Buzz. 
n   
n
Instead of moving in one direction, the sympathy moves reciprocally 
between two characters. The audience joins in, too, because 
people realize that someday, the world will move on without them. 
176
Lecture 17  •  Big Sympathy: Toy Story

177
Lecture 17  •  Big Sympathy: Toy Story
n   
n
At the time that Toy Story was produced, Disney’s studio machine 
didn’t believe there was a  great deal of profit to be made from 
this honest exploration of earthly mortality. But Pixar realized that 
children know about death. They see it and they want to talk about 
it. Toy Story shows that there can be enormous positive power in 
unbottling the dark truth of mortality. 
n   
n
The audience’s awareness of their fleeting lives is what creates the 
circle of sympathy that joins them to Buzz and to Woody at the end 
of Toy Story’s script. This is what swells regular sympathy into the 
cognitive effect of big sympathy.

STORY WORLD
n   
n
The very first thing the script shows is a  row of moving boxes. 
This signals that this is a  story world of transitions and change. 
The second thing the script shows us is that the world doesn’t 
acknowledge these changes as upsetting. Instead, it does its best 
to pretend they’re no big deal.
n   
n
That’s why the moving boxes are decorated with crayon and 
incorporated into a game. And why the game is a goofy Western 
spoof where Mr. Potato Head terrorizes other toys for “Money. 
Money. Money.” The reason for this emphasis on money is that 
money is the moment childhood ends: Children don’t understand 
money as adults do.
n   
n
Yet the story world of Toy Story’s script doesn’t acknowledge this 
dark side of money. Instead, through the buffoonery of Mr. Potato 
Head, it makes the audience laugh past it.
n   
n
The bigger lesson here is that if you’re writing a  children’s story, 
try creating a story world with a deep problem that it refuses to 
acknowledge. That’s the world that children know: a world of dark 
conflicts and difficulties that adults keep hurrying them past, telling 
them not to look.
CHARACTER
n   
n
Against its story world of smiling change, Toy Story juxtaposes two 
main characters, Woody and Buzz. Woody sees the future coming 
and he does his best to stop it. Buzz doesn’t see the future and he 
crashes on, unchanging.
n   
n
Each of these characters resist different aspects of the story 
world. Woody resists the world’s insistence that change is normal. 
Buzz, meanwhile, resists the idea that change has to happen at all, 
clutching his cardboard packaging as though it will last forever.
178
Lecture 17  •  Big Sympathy: Toy Story

179
n   
n
But even though Woody and Buzz 
are different on the surface, they’re 
really two sides of the same 
coin. This is how all people 
resist difficult changes in their 
lives: 
They 
simultaneously 
fret about the changes and 
deny that they’re occurring.
n   
n
The general trick you can 
pick up from Woody and Buzz 
is a  technique for creating 
multiple heroes. Give them 
the same root conflict and 
fear, but have them battle 
their fear in different and 
even 
conflicting 
ways. 
They 
seem rivals on the surface, but 
eventually reveal themselves to be 
brothers in the fight.
Lecture 17  •  Big Sympathy: Toy Story

PLOT
n   
n
Reverse engineering involves adapting a preexisting story structure 
that generates the rough cognitive effect you want, and that’s 
exactly what Toy Story does with Hamlet. 
n   
n
Shakespeare’s play has a  five-act structure, and Hamlet himself 
goes on a five-part journey. 
  
 The five-part structure involves first bereaving the character 
(Hamlet loses his father). 
  
 Then comes external conflict (Hamlet feuds with the world, 
killing his mother, for example). 
  
 
Next comes inner conflict (which manifests in Hamlet’s “To be, 
or not to be” soliloquy). 
  
 
After that comes inner resolution (Hamlet realizes he is not 
alone). 
  
 The final step is bereaving the audience (Hamlet dies).
n   
n
The script of Toy Story follows this same five-part structure. Here’s 
how it works.
  
 The first part is when Woody is confronted by the arrival of 
Buzz. This displaces Woody.
  
 The second part occurs when Woody throws a temper tantrum 
that ends with Buzz being knocked out the window. 
  
 The third part is when Buzz and Woody fight. As they fight, 
they drag themselves into deeper and deeper problems. 
  
 The fourth part is when Buzz and Woody stop fighting and 
recognize their shared mortality. Buzz finally realizes that he is 
just a toy, and although this is a brutally disillusioning moment, 
it enables him and Woody to reconcile. 
180
Lecture 17  •  Big Sympathy: Toy Story

181
  
 The fifth part is when Woody and Buzz are replaced by the 
puppy. They don’t literally die like Hamlet does, but they’re 
about to get chewed.
n   
n
If you want to generate big sympathy in audiences, you won’t find 
a more time-tested model than Hamlet and Toy Story’s five-part 
plot. Write a plot about someone who suffers a loss, driving them 
to rage against the world and themselves, before they see that 
others have suffered the same loss. In the very last moment, they’re 
lost themselves.
TONE
n   
n
To reverse engineer a tone that creates big sympathy, Toy Story’s 
script alternates between a  sentimental and a  comic narrator. 
This has the effect of turning the entire script into a  soliloquy 
between the perspectives of Woody and Buzz. When the narrator 
is sentimental, the tone is anxious, worried, and dark, like Woody. 
When the narrator is comic, it’s playful, carefree, and joyfully 
oblivious, like Buzz.
n   
n
One of the dark, Woody moments occurs when Sid blows up the 
toys’ friend Combat Carl with a  firecracker, prompting the script 
to bleakly intone: “A large black scorch mark is all that remains 
where Combat Carl once stood.” This terrifyingly solemn moment 
literalizes the ultimate horror that Woody worries about. Childhood 
will end, and the toys will be destroyed. 
n   
n
At the opposite end of the spectrum are the comic moments of 
narration where the script breathes with Buzz’s oblivious sense of 
joy. An example is when Buzz and Woody are about to be blown up 
like Combat Carl, until Buzz activates his toy wings and they escape. 
The moment is so joyful even Woody forgets to worry.
n   
n
This back-and-forth tone permeates the whole script. If you want 
to create big sympathy, try this technique of alternating between 
a  comic and a  sentimental narrator. The goal is to move your 
audience’s mind through a big, script-length soliloquy.
Lecture 17  •  Big Sympathy: Toy Story

SCENES
n   
n
The most challenging kind of scene to write in a  script like Toy 
Story’s is the one where sympathy is generated between two 
previously opposed characters. This is the crucial moment where 
regular old sympathy becomes a circle of reciprocal sympathy that 
draws the audience in. 
n   
n
The most straightforward way to accomplish this is with the trick of 
the mirror scene. Toy Story uses a mirror scene to make Buzz and 
Woody sympathetic for each other. The scene begins with Woody 
trapped in a milk crate, asking Buzz for help. At first, Buzz is too 
dejected to help, but eventually, Buzz grows up. 
n   
n
Woody tries to talk Buzz out of his funk, telling him how great and 
important it is to be a toy. But Buzz can’t go back to being a child. 
He finally sees what Woody sees, grasping his own mortality.
n   
n
This seems to be the end of the line for Buzz and Woody. They 
finally agree—but unfortunately, what they agree on is that being 
a toy is hopeless. And then suddenly, Buzz leaps into action. He 
hoists the milk crate off Woody and the two of them join forces to 
get back to Andy.
n   
n
A moment of mirroring is what causes Buzz to shake off his despair. 
When Buzz glimpses his own feelings of insignificance in Woody, 
he loses his sense of tragic isolation. He realizes that someone 
else feels exactly like him, and so he experiences a deep sense of 
sympathy that bonds him and Woody together.
n   
n
If you want to create big sympathy in your next script, write a mirror 
scene like this. Have your main character see the reflection of their 
own condition in their great rival, finding a moment of sympathy. 
Then, snatch both characters away to a fate that mirrors back the 
audience’s own future doom.

LECTURE 18
EXISTENTIAL 
MEANING: FARGO
F
argo was the Coen brothers’ sixth film, shot modestly on an indie 
budget. Expectations were low. But it became an international 
hit and earned an Oscar for best original screenplay. However, 
everything about the script is a little odd. Which raises the question: 
How does something so peculiar become so popular? A  place like 
Fargo, North Dakota, has its special charms, but most people don’t live 
there. This lecture explores how Fargo negotiates this paradox. To get 
the most out of it and avoid spoilers, read the script or watch the movie 
before proceeding.

ENDING
n   
n
At the end of the film, after the failed arch-villain Jerry is dragged 
away weeping in his underwear, Fargo’s script closes with an 
intimate domestic scene of Brainerd, Minnesota, police chief Marge 
Gunderson and her husband Norm in bed together.
n   
n
The scene shows that a three-cent stamp with a mallard duck on it is 
very important to Norm; he painted it. The scene also shows Marge 
is devoted to Norm. She sees something special in his eccentric 
ways. She makes the effort to say something to make Norm feel 
good about his tiny victory. 
n   
n
In the same way that Norm cherishes his duck and Marge 
cherishes Norm, fans cherish Fargo for its eccentricities. The 
broader, philosophical term for this feeling of personal meaning 
is existentialism.
n   
n
The feeling of existential meaning is the cognitive effect that the 
ending of Fargo guides the audience into. It provides an answer 
to the bleak meaninglessness of modern life by revealing that the 
answer is that every person can give it meaning. The fact that other 
people might not understand is exactly what makes it special.
STORY WORLD
n   
n
The script starts by establishing the world as it exists without 
existentialism. The opening beat of the script establishes a story 
world devoid of meaning. The world is presented as a nothing but 
white on white, void of lines or color, an empty canvas.
n   
n
For the existentialist, this empty canvas is an opportunity to make 
meaning, like Norm when he sits down with his paints. But as the 
script goes on to make clear in its next few beats, this liberating 
sense of possibility doesn’t exist within the normal day-to-day of 
Fargo’s story world. 
186
Lecture 18  •  Existential Meaning: Fargo

187
Lecture 18  •  Existential Meaning: Fargo
n   
n
Most of the people in this story world don’t see its blank 
nothingness as a source of freedom. Instead, they feel trapped and 
oppressed by the infinite white. An example is Jerry Lundegaard. 
As one of the film’s antagonists, he puts a human face on the core 
rule of the story world. 
n   
n
In the film’s opening scene, Jerry arrives in a dive bar with a plan to 
take control of his life. He’s going to hire a couple of men to kidnap 
his wife and extort a hefty ransom from his bullying father-in-law. 
But no sooner has Jerry met the prospective kidnappers than he 
promptly finds himself out of his depth.
n   
n
When the world doesn’t turn out like Jerry wants, he becomes 
exasperated and panicked and angry. He eventually attacks his 
own car with an ice scraper. He tries to get the money he thinks 
is his due by lying to his father-in-law and double-crossing the 
kidnappers.
n   
n
Jerry, in other words, tries to impose his will on the world. But 
instead, he only adds to the chaos and the conflict.
CHARACTER
n   
n
The alternative to this story world is an existential stance. To be 
an existentialist is to step back from the fight. It’s to acknowledge 
that life can mean different, even opposite, things at once. And it’s 
to find meaning in one’s own personal interpretation of the world, 
while permitting others to do the same.
n   
n
In Fargo, the character who most embodies this alternative to 
the story world is Marge. It’s more accurate to refer to her as an 
alternative to the story world than as in conflict with the story world 
because the world of Fargo is itself conflict. 
n   
n
The script introduces Marge by showing her as she’s woken up in 
the middle of the night by a phone call. With this little story beat, 
the script crisply establishes what it’s like to live in a world that you 
can’t control. You want to sleep. The world wants you awake.

n   
n
One might expect Marge to get upset when her sleep is disrupted. 
But instead, her response is “OK. There in a jiff.” She doesn’t fight 
the world; she rolls with it.
PLOT
n   
n
Marge’s nature begs the question: Since Marge is a source not of 
conflict but of peace, how does the film have a  plot? One bold 
method: The script waits a  very long time to introduce Marge—
almost 30 pages. The script spends an unprecedented amount of 
time with Jerry, stoking up the world.
n   
n
A second method: The script makes Marge a detective. Rather than 
being the source of the conflict that moves the plot forward, Marge 
is a cop who tries to eliminate that conflict and restore the peace.
n   
n
Having put these two plot elements in motion, the script then builds 
them out into a simple, two-part story structure. First, the script 
ramps up the nihilist conflict. Jerry and his various confederates 
all hatch schemes to bend the world to their will, only to see these 
schemes backfire. 
n   
n
The second big action is Marge’s discovery of her own personal 
meaning. She makes this discovery not by trying to bend the world 
into alignment with her own will, but by interpreting what it means 
to her.
n   
n
The script accomplishes most of this work by introducing Mike 
Yanagita, an old friend of Marge’s who has no necessary relationship 
to the rest of the plot. This is another daring move by the script, 
but like the script’s other bold choices, it’s a logical consequence 
of its existential aims.
188
Lecture 18  •  Existential Meaning: Fargo

189
n   
n
By introducing a random individual into the story, the script gives 
Marge a dramatic opportunity to take her own meaning from the 
chaos of the world. Marge does this initially by rebuffing Yanagita’s 
attempts to seduce her. She has made her personal choice, and 
that’s Norm.
n   
n
Then Marge takes her existentialism a step further. When she learns 
that Yanagita was lying about his wife, she revisits Jerry, thinking 
that perhaps he was lying about his wife too. There’s no strict 
reason the two men’s behavior should be connected. But Marge 
follows her hunch, and it pays off for her.
n   
n
An important point: Marge doesn’t confuse her own personal 
sense of meaning with the greater way of things. As she says to 
the last remaining kidnapper when she apprehends him: “And 
here y’are. And it’s a beautiful day. Well. I just don’t understand it.” 
That’s existentialism: to find your own way in a world that you never 
piece together.
TONE
n   
n
The tone of Fargo’s script generates an experience of existential 
meaning by cleverly merging the god’s-eye and the ironic narrators. 
This combination of the ironic and the god’s eye is established in 
the script’s opening title card, which reads: 
This is a true story. The events depicted in this film took place 
in Minnesota in 1987. At the request of the survivors, the names 
have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has 
been told exactly as it occurred.
n   
n
Like a  god’s-eye narrator, this narrator declares that it sees 
the absolute truth. But like an ironic narrator, this narrator also 
juxtaposes the cosmic with the trivial, putting the mountain of 
absolute truth next to the pebble of Minnesota in 1987.
Lecture 18  •  Existential Meaning: Fargo

n   
n
This combination of the ironic and the god’s-
eye has the immediately noticeable effect of 
making everything in the script feel at once 
absolutely serious and ironically absurd. This 
hands the audience the existential power to 
choose which way to see things.
SCENE
n   
n
Fargo’s innovative cognitive goal distances it 
from the usual Hollywood hooks of empathy 
and suspense. In an existential world, there can 
be no real empathy, because the audience can 
never know other people. And there also can’t 
be real suspense, because meaning exists in 
the here and now, independent of the future.
n   
n
Taking a  page from Pulp Fiction, the script 
for Fargo solves this storytelling challenge by 
continually refreshing its own indie cognitive 
effect, which it does by cycling continually 
between scenes of intense nihilism and scenes 
of existential discovery. 
n   
n
The first kind of scene destroys meaning. An 
example is the character Carl’s scene with 
a parking-lot attendant. Prior to this scene, Carl 
has driven the Cutlass Ciera all over the place, 
leaving an easy trail for the cops to follow, until 
he finally makes a  half-hearted attempt to 
cover his tracks by driving to the Minneapolis 
International Airport and stealing license plates 
from a car in long-term parking.
191

n   
n
Then, as Carl tries to leave the parking garage, he has an exchange 
with the attendant. In the attendant, Carl is presented with the 
mirror of his own condition: a  minor enforcer of someone else’s 
grand money scheme. But Carl has no epiphany. Instead, he howls 
in fury at his reflection, getting into a public spat over $4.00 when 
he’s trying to lay low in order to earn $40,000.
n   
n
This episode doesn’t lead the cops to Carl or cause any plot 
developments to occur. It seems significant but turns out to be 
meaningless. That’s how you write the first kind of scene, making 
your audience feel a vacuum of meaning. 
n   
n
The other type of scene replaces this vacuum with an experience 
of existential discovery. Instead of creating a  mirror scene that 
fails, you’ll want to put two people together who have nothing in 
common and have one of them gain an existential insight. That’s 
what the script does when Marge visits the strip club. 
n   
n
The women of the strip club are about as opposite from Marge as 
you can get. They have casual sex with men they can’t remember. 
Marge is in a committed relationship with a man she never forgets.
n   
n
The audience’s expectation in this scene is that there’ll be a clash 
of personalities, and the script does everything to feed this 
expectation by making the women of the strip club as grating as 
the parking attendant. 
n   
n
Like the attendant, the women are absurdly caught up in their own 
little worlds, frustrating Marge’s hunt for clues by relating details 
that matter to them but have no bearing on anything else. But 
unlike Carl, Marge isn’t filled with violent frustration and despair 
by this situation. Instead, she patiently accepts it as the way of 
the  world. 
192
Lecture 18  •  Existential Meaning: Fargo

193
n   
n
Rather than mocking the women or giving up in exasperation, 
Marge keeps plugging on, until finally, the scene ends with an 
exchange that gives Marge a glimpse of something that matters to 
her investigation. In the chaos, she finds a hint of personal meaning. 
n   
n
That is how to write the second kind of scene: Have your existential 
character meet their polar opposite and discover their own private 
meaning mirrored back. When you put these two scene types 
together, you have the blueprint for writing your own Fargo and 
carrying your audience into existentialism.

Imagine a  world in chaos. Now imagine someone in that 
world who doesn’t judge the things around her, but simply 
accepts and chronicles them. Maybe she’s a  marriage 
counselor, or a reporter dropped into a combat zone. Plot 
a little story in which your character gets drawn deeper and 
deeper into the pointless mayhem. Then imagine one way 
that she finds her own meaning in it.

Write a scene using an ironic god’s-eye narrator who lets 
your audience decide whether the tone is serious or absurd. 
You can describe a  murder, a  wedding, or anything else. 
The choice is up to you.

LECTURE 19
FILM VERSUS 
TELEVISION: MASH 
AND M*A*S*H
T
his lecture explores key differences between film and TV by 
tracing them back to a  single innovation in the way that TV 
handles conflict. Then, it explores what this innovation means 
from a writer’s perspective. This will set up the next four lectures, which 
look at how to write for TV.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FILM AND TV
n   
n
The most obvious difference between film and TV is quantity. 
An average movie is two hours. An average TV series is designed 
to run for 100 hours or more. Generating all those hours of content 
presents a  challenge, which writers answer by developing an 
engine to power the show for season after season.
n   
n
There are different ways to build a  TV engine, but the most 
straightforward is by establishing a deep conflict in the story world. 
Conflict pushes the plot. The deeper and more substantial the 
conflict, the more story you can get out of it.
n   
n
By rooting conflict in the story world, TV writers allow for two key 
things needed to please audiences for hundreds of hours. First, 
they keep the plot going, and second, they keep the viewing 
experience consistent. For example, no matter what episode of 
Law & Order you watch, the show’s engine always generates the 
same cognitive mixture of intrigue and suspense.
n   
n
The big lesson here is that when you’re writing a TV series, you want 
to focus on the deep conflict in the story world, not on superficial 
plot formulas. Audiences don’t tune in for plot formulas. They want 
psychological consistency, not story-beat predictability. And in 
fact, if your plots become predictable, audiences will quickly get 
bored and tune out.
n   
n
Films have a  one-off conflict between story world and character. 
TV requires an engine of ongoing conflict within the story world 
that keeps the plot going and the viewing experience constant.
M*A*S*H AND MASH
n

In terms of raw audience share, the most successful American TV 
series of all time was M*A*S*H, which ran on CBS from 1972 to 
1983. Its finale is a helpful example to study because the show has 
a companion movie, stylized MASH. If you haven’t read the scripts 
or watched the film and the show’s season finale, it’s best to do so 
before proceeding.

ENDINGS
n   
n
On a superficial level, the endings of MASH the film and M*A*S*H 
the TV series seem the same. In both, a pair of doctors working in 
a MASH unit during the Korean War pack up their medical kits and 
return to America. But the cognitive effects of these two endings 
are very different.
n   
n
In the film, the two main doctors drive away in the jeep they stole at 
the beginning, as a loudspeaker blares out an ironic final comment 
on the movie: 
Attention. Tonight’s movie has been MASH. Follow the zany 
antics of our combat surgeons as they cut and stitch their way 
along the front lines. […] Starring Donald Sutherland, Elliot Gould, 
Tom Skerritt, Sally Kellerman, Robert Duvall. […] That is all.
n   
n
This borrows directly from Bertolt Brecht, the originator of the 
alienation effect, discussed back in the lecture on Do the Right 
Thing. Brecht used to have his actors change their costumes 
onstage to call attention to the fact that it was all just a show, and 
the loudspeaker in MASH has exactly the same effect. 
n   
n
And like the loops in Mother Courage and All Her Children, MASH 
ends with the doctors driving away in the same jeep they came 
in. The war continues on just as it was. This makes the audience 
uncomfortably aware that the horror of war is persisting unabated, 
encouraging them to stand up and make changes to the world. 
n   
n
M*A*S*H the TV show ends with a very different cognitive effect. 
The final episode of the TV series concludes with B.J. and Hawkeye 
parting company after the war has already ended.
n   
n
Then Hawkeye and B.J. hug. And as Hawkeye looks down from his 
chopper, he sees that B.J. has written out a message for him. It’s 
the word “Goodbye,” spelled out in stones on the chopper pad.
n   
n
Unlike in the film, the conflict here in the TV series isn’t 
a straightforward conflict against the war, because there are things 
about the war that the doctors will miss.

n   
n
Instead, the TV conflict is a  conflict within the world of the war. 
In this TV world, war isn’t a  single bad thing. It’s two opposites, 
good and bad. There are the pointless deaths, the heartbreak, the 
human cruelty, and the futility. But there are also the friendships 
and the daily triumphs.
n   
n
Whereas the doctors of MASH the film are in conflict with the world 
of war, the characters of M*A*S*H the TV show are windows into 
the deeper conflict of the world. Though they all bring unique 
viewpoints, the fact that all of the characters of a TV series offer 
windows into the same deep conflict means they can always be 
swapped out and exchanged. 
n   
n
The role of TV characters as windows into the more enduring 
conflict in the story world also means that antagonists work very 
differently in TV than in film. In film, the antagonist is the human 
face of the world that the hero fights against. In TV, the antagonist 
is instead an expression of the same world conflict that beats 
inside the heroes’ hearts. And so rather than simply encouraging 
negative feelings in the audience, most antagonists will, as the 
series progresses, inspire increasing amounts of sympathy.
n   
n
In MASH the film, the antagonist is Major Burns, an incompetent 
and repulsively smug doctor who endangers the lives of his patients 
and pompously bullies the other medical staff. Burns meets his end 
when he is humiliated by Hawkeye for his private relationship with 
the character Hot Lips. 
n   
n
Burns responds to this attack by punching Hawkeye, leading 
Hawkeye to humiliate him further: “Frank Burns has gone nuts!” 
Burns is shoved in a straitjacket and hauled away. Everything about 
this scene is constructed to turn the audience against Burns. 
n   
n
In contrast, in the final episode of M*A*S*H the TV show, the main 
antagonist is made an object of sympathy. This antagonist is Major 
Charles Winchester, the season six replacement for Frank Burns.

n
In the final episode, after Winchester has tried to teach five Chinese 
POWs to play Mozart, he sees them loaded on a truck. Rushing out, 
he’s told that the POWs are being collected for a prisoner swap. 
Winchester desperately tries to stop the exchange. He’s come so 
close to teaching the POWs to play Mozart, giving him a  ray of 
hope. But Winchester is overruled, and the truck pulls away.

n   
n
But the Chinese musicians take out their 
instruments and play the Mozart exactly the 
way that Winchester had been trying to teach 
them. So as Winchester watches the musicians 
leave, his anguish melts away. And at the same 
time, the PA announces the end of the war, and 
everyone explodes with joy. 
n   
n
The script makes clear that Winchester’s sense 
of happiness is shared by everyone. Instead 
of being in conflict with the main characters, 
Winchester feels exactly like them.
n   
n
A few scenes later, Winchester is in the 
operating room, trying to save the final victims 
of the war, when he comes upon a  hopeless 
case: a  patient missing half his chest. To his 
horror, Winchester realizes that the patient is 
the Chinese flutist.
n   
n
In shock, Winchester says, “He wasn’t even 
a soldier. He was a musician. What happened 
to the other people in the truck with him?” To 
which a corpsman replies: “He’s the only one 
that made it this far.”
n   
n
Winchester is shattered by this revelation, and 
he staggers back to his tent. He puts on his 
record player, listening to a  few bars of the 
Mozart he taught to the Chinese musicians, and 
then grabs the record and smashes it in despair.
n   
n
Like Major Burns when he’s dragged away in 
a  straitjacket in the film, Winchester has just 
had the limits of his power crushingly exposed. 
Yet the audience is feeling with him rather than 
smirking at him. 
201

n   
n
That is the difference between antagonists in film and in TV. In 
film, the antagonist is opposed by the main characters. In TV, the 
antagonist is one of the main characters, a window into the same 
conflict as everyone else. In TV, instead of hating the antagonists, 
the audience eventually comes to identify with them, too.
STORY WORLD
n   
n
This lecture will conclude by turning to the pilot for M*A*S*H to 
see how it establishes a conflict in its story world that generates 
a bittersweet sense of the entwined good and bad of war.
n   
n
The pilot begins with a series of vignettes. Hawkeye and Trapper 
John drink martinis and play golf in a  minefield. Hot Lips and 
Frank Burns read the Bible and the U.S. Army manual while they 
play footsie in bed. Commander Henry Blake works with surgical 
concentration to open a bottle of champagne.
n   
n
Suddenly, the air rescue siren sounds and the PA blares: “Attention, 
all personnel. Report immediately to admitting ward and operating 
room.” This concludes the pilot’s two-step recipe for establishing 
the conflict of its story world.
n   
n
You can copy this model for your own pilot: Show little snippets of 
both sides of the conflict in your story world, cutting back and forth 
between your main heroes and your antagonists. Then, show that 
in this world, both your heroes and your antagonists have to work 
together, on the same mission, to do the same thing.
CHARACTER
n   
n
The first character that the script introduces in depth is Hawkeye. 
This introduction makes clear that, unlike in the film, Hawkeye is not 
in conflict against the world of the war. Instead, he’s a window for 
the audience to see into the world and feel with it.
202
Lecture 19  •  Film versus Television: MASH and M*A*S*H

203
n   
n
The pilot accomplishes this task by giving Hawkeye a  voiceover 
where he describes his job to his father. This voiceover serves quite 
literally as a first-person window into Hawkeye’s world. He’s honest 
about the shortcomings of his job and admits he can sound callous. 
But he also sees his work as good and important: It helps save 
human lives.
n   
n
This is another simple technique you can try when writing your next 
pilot. After you’ve introduced the big conflict in your story world, 
introduce your first main character through a voiceover where they 
explore both the good and bad of that conflict. This will generate 
a soliloquy that encourages the audience to identify with both that 
character and the world of the series as a whole.

Lecture 19  •  Film versus Television: MASH and M*A*S*H

PLOT
n   
n
The plot of the pilot is similarly reverse engineered to convey the 
experience of the story world’s tragicomic conflict. Its main action 
is a scheme that Hawkeye concocts with Trapper John. The scheme 
is to get their Korean houseboy, Ho-Jon, the money he needs to go 
to college. 
n   
n
To pull off this scheme, the two doctors concoct a  plan to host 
a debauched party, raffle off a weekend with a nurse, and then rig 
the raffle. The plot, in short, is a tale of doing good by doing bad. 
ENDING
n   
n
At the end of the pilot, Hawkeye’s plan seems to be ruined by 
a  general who tries to send him home immediately. But then 
the general witnesses Hawkeye operate and reverses his earlier 
decision. 
n   
n
Even though the general seems like a bad guy, the pilot reveals 
that he isn’t. Like everyone in the war, the general sees that the 
good always comes mixed with the bad, and so he pardons the 
doctors’ bad behavior to preserve their good surgical skills.
n   
n
This moment in the pilot is in direct contrast to the film, where 
after Hawkeye performs an unauthorized operation on a child, he’s 
charged by the hospital commander for misusing resources and is 
forced to blackmail the commander to escape.
n   
n
The TV pilot breaks sharply with the film by culminating in a moment 
where both Hawkeye and his antagonist become faces of the same 
world. In doing so, it once again establishes that the TV series will 
be about a conflict within that story world. The characters will all 
be windows into it.

LECTURE 20
WRITING 
A TELEVISION PILOT: 
GAME OF THRONES
T
he pilot episode of a TV series begins the series, but a good one 
also provides the engine that sustains the series for seasons to 
come, all the way to the show’s end. To give you a blueprint for 
how pilots establish their engines from beginning to end, through plot 
and character and tone, this lecture focuses on the pilot for the wildly 
successful series Game of Thrones. But that’s not the focus just because 
the pilot was a success; at first, it failed, bombing with test audiences 
until it was restructured. If you haven’t seen the episode or read the 
script, do so before proceeding to avoid spoilers and maximize your 
enjoyment of this lecture.

ENDING
n   
n
The ending is where a pilot opens up to full throttle, establishing 
the cognitive effect that’ll be the hallmark of subsequent episodes. 
Whenever you want to understand how a particular TV series works, 
turn to the final beats of its pilot. 
n   
n
The pilot for Game of Thrones introduces the fantasy realm 
of Westeros, a  violent place of political machinations and 
dynastic struggles based loosely on the War of the Roses of 15th-
century England.
n   
n
At the end of the pilot, 10-year-old Bran begins to climb a tower in 
the northern castle he calls home. Eventually, Bran looks through 
a window and sees a man and a woman in a carnal embrace. The 
pair is Jaime and Cersei—the queen and her twin brother, in an 
incestuously adulterous relationship.
n   
n
Cersei catches sight of Bran. In a panic, she insists that her brother 
do something to bury their dark secret. But Jaime instead asks 
Bran his age. “Ten,” Bran replies. And Jaime repeats it: “Ten.”
n   
n
Jaime turns away from the window, and Bran exhales, relieved to 
have escaped. Abruptly, Jaime sighs: “The things I do for love.” He 
causally shoves Bran out of the window.
n   
n
The cognitive effect is of the destruction of innocence. Bran wants 
to peer inside the tower’s dark secrets. The knowledge shatters 
him, literally. It also shatters the audience’s innocence.
n   
n
The story engine that drives this experience is a painful contradiction 
in the nature of power. Power brings people pleasure, but power 
also destroys people. For example, take the king of Westeros, who 
admits his royalty-fed vices are destroying him. Power has ruined 
the king by giving him everything that he wants.

209
Lecture 20  •  Writing a Television Pilot: Game of Thrones
n   
n
In Game of Thrones, knowledge is the utmost power. To know other 
people’s secrets is to control them. To know the ways of the world 
is to master it. The downside: Knowledge makes people powerful 
but also breaks their innocence.
BEGINNING
n   
n
The pilot opens with three rangers leaving the Wall for the 
wilderness beyond. They discover bodies, which strangely 
disappear, leaving only a scrap of red cloth. Eventually, a shadowy 
creature with blue eyes appears and decapitates two of the rangers 
before tossing one of their heads to the survivor.
n   
n
This opening scene encapsulates in miniature the double 
experience of all of Game of Thrones. First, the scene creates 
a deepening sense of mystery, channeling the audience’s attention 
to the scrap of red cloth. This little clue holds out the promise of 
knowledge and the pleasure of having the answers. But as the 
monster pounces, the audience goes from one face of power to 
the other: from the pleasure to the pain. 
n   
n
Comparing the successful Game of Thrones pilot with the failed 
pilot, the failed pilot doesn’t make this double move as effectively. 
In the successful pilot, the ranger Will’s first line is: “I’ve never seen 
wildlings do a thing like this. I’ve never seen a thing like this, not 
ever in my life.” In the failed pilot, Will’s first line is: “We should 
start back. They’re all dead.”
n   
n
The successful pilot immediately builds a  sense of dark and 
enormous mystery. The failed pilot begins by telling the audience 
it’s all wrapped up. So it doesn’t entice us in the same way.
n   
n
This isn’t the right move for every pilot. But this intriguing seduction 
into pain is exactly the right move for Game of Thrones because 
it perfectly establishes the core cognitive effect that drives the 
whole series. It makes you want to know. And then it makes you 
suffer for it.

CHARACTER
n   
n
From here, the pilot then introduces a series of characters. They all 
get a generous chunk of screen time, and they are all presented as 
important. Because pilots introduce a lot of characters, the danger 
is that the pilot’s plot can start to feel confusing and overwhelming.
210
Lecture 20  •  Writing a Television Pilot: Game of Thrones

211
n   
n
There are two keys to making these sequential character 
introductions. First, each character should be introduced as 
a window into some part of the underlying conflict in the story world. 
Each character should offer their own different angle on this conflict 
while still being reflections of the same conflict in the story world. 
n   
n
Second, the first two main character introductions should establish 
characters who are in conflict with each other. In other words, the 
first main character should embody more of one side of the story 
world conflict, and the second main character should embody 
more of the other side. This reinforces the conflict in the story 
world and sets in motion a plot that draws the main characters into 
relationship with each other.
n   
n
In Game of Thrones, the first set of characters to be introduced is 
the Starks. The general tone is set with Bran. The audience watches 
through Bran’s eyes as he witnesses the execution of the surviving 
ranger by his father.
n   
n
For Bran to ascend in the world, he must learn what death looks 
like. He forces himself to watch the execution. But in gaining this 
knowledge of what death looks like, Bran also discovers the other 
less happy side of power: It’s jolting to watch the end of a man’s 
life. And so as Bran learns, he simultaneously suffers as part of his 
innocence dies.
n   
n
The world’s conflict spans from an inexperienced curiosity on one 
side to an experienced suffering on the other. Bran is clearly on the 
side of inexperience; he has only begun to suffer.
n   
n
The next main characters the audience meets are the Lannister 
twins, Cersei and Jaime. I know, they’re actually two characters. 
In the pilot, the Lannister twins are introduced as they watch the 
funeral procession of the king’s former right-hand man. 
Lecture 20  •  Writing a Television Pilot: Game of Thrones

n   
n
This prompts Cersei to fret that the dead man 
“told someone” before he died. Cersei’s brother 
responds: “If he told the king, both our heads 
would be skewered on the city gates by now.” 
n   
n
The Lannisters have knowledge, which is 
power—but also the thing that threatens to kill 
them. And by introducing the Lannisters as the 
keepers of a dark secret, the pilot establishes 
a  conflict between the Lannisters and the 
Starks that will fuel the show’s engine.
PLOT
n   
n
The plot, as we’ve just seen, is driven by 
a conflict between the Starks’ drive to know and 
the Lannisters’ efforts to conceal. To heighten 
this, the overall goal of the plot is to insert Ned 
Stark in the heart of the king’s palace.
n   
n
The pilot does this by getting rid of the king’s 
right-hand man. This gives the king an excuse 
to invite Ned Stark to become the new right 
hand, where he’ll be immersed in the dark 
shadows of the court.
n   
n
The next step of the plot is for the king to make 
his formal request by visiting Ned. This brings 
the Lannisters into the Starks’ home, so it gives 
the audience a  taste of the bigger conflict 
that will come when the Starks get into the 
Lannisters’ lair.
213

n   
n
And the final big step of the plot comes just before Ned Stark 
leaves to journey to the palace. Here, the script includes a scene 
where Ned’s wife reads a note from her sister, informing Ned that 
the king’s right-hand man “was murdered. By the Lannisters.” The 
scene is crucial because it ramps up the conflict between the Starks 
and the Lannisters by giving Ned a reason to pry into Cersei and 
Jamie’s affairs. 
214
Lecture 20  •  Writing a Television Pilot: Game of Thrones

215
n   
n
Those are the big strokes of the main storyline. But there is one 
other key part of the plot: scenes set over the sea in Essos. These 
scenes are by far the most shocking and bizarre ones in the pilot. In 
fact, they caused the original pilot to bomb.
n   
n
That’s because in the original pilot, these scenes were introduced 
right after the initial scenes with the Starks. This followed the 
structure of the show’s source novel, but gave the impression of 
another random set of characters in another random place, causing 
test audiences to lose interest and tune out.
n   
n
In the later, successful pilot, the writers departed from the structure 
of the novel and delayed the introduction of Essos. They waited 
until after they had established conflict between the Starks and 
the Lannisters and after the king had asked Ned Stark back to 
his palace.
n   
n
The big lesson here is that the world of a  TV show is not its 
geographical places. It’s the core conflict. To establish the story 
world, don’t rush into showing all of its physical locales. Instead, 
focus on establishing the deeper world-conflict by showing two 
main characters in opposition.
TONE
n   
n
The tone of Game of Thrones is visually enticing, filled with 
mysterious and intriguing objects like dragon’s eggs and nude 
bodies wreathed in shadow. It’s also filled with the constant patter 
of secrets. An example is when Ned remarks: “I don’t fight in 
tournaments because when I fight a man for real, I don’t want him 
to know what I can do.”
n   
n
The show’s tone is engineered to draw the viewers into the trap of 
curiosity, whispering of new things for them to see.
Lecture 20  •  Writing a Television Pilot: Game of Thrones

SCENES
n   
n
An important comparison can be drawn between the scenes where 
the failed pilot and the successful pilot introduce the popular 
character Tyrion Lannister. The failed pilot introduces Tyrion as he 
receives, in the actual words of the script, “oral pleasure” from “a 
redheaded whore.” The failed pilot creates absolutely no sense of 
mystery. It’s unsubtle, frank, and crass.
n   
n
The successful pilot instead introduces Tyrion through a little scene 
where Catelyn Stark lays out candles for his bedroom because 
she’s heard he likes to read all night. The character Luwin retorts 
that he’s heard that Tyrion drinks all night. 
n   
n
A surprised Catelyn replies that even if Tyrion does drink all night, 
surely Tyrion couldn’t possibly consume the eight barrels of ale that 
Luwin has just brought up from the cellars.
n   
n
This revised scene works because it immediately establishes the 
core engine of the pilot: a sense of dark secrets. Who is Tyrion? Is 
he a reader or a drinker? 
n   
n
When the audience does meet Tyrion and the redhead in the 
successful pilot, Tyrion yells for the door to be closed, preserving 
a sense that something remains hidden. And finally, the pilot drives 
home Tyrion’s character in a moment when Tyrion declares to Jon 
Snow: “Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what 
you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it 
can never be used to hurt you.”
n   
n
Here again is the core conflict of the world. Tyrion has gained 
knowledge through suffering. He wishes that the world were 
otherwise. He has been hurt by its cruelty. But he also knows he 
has to make the best of the nightmare he’s been born into.
216
Lecture 20  •  Writing a Television Pilot: Game of Thrones

217
n   
n
The failed pilot treated Tyrion more like the antagonist of a  film, 
making him more unlikeable and direct. The successful pilot made 
Tyrion a reflection of its engine, making him mysterious, conflicted, 
and sympathetic.

LECTURE 21
THE SITCOM: THE 
SIMPSONS
T
o focus on sitcom writing, this lecture takes a  look at The 
Simpsons. In addition to being the most successful sitcom ever, 
The Simpsons is also really clever. It has won 32 Emmys, which is 
more than Seinfeld or The Mary Tyler Moore Show or even Cheers. This 
lecture examines a popular episode from the show’s prime in season 
four. That episode is “Duffless,” where Homer tries to give up alcohol 
and Lisa tries to win the science fair. If you haven’t seen it yet or read 
the script, check them out before proceeding. 

ENDING
n   
n “Duffless” ends when Homer leaves his drinking buddies to go on 
a date with Marge. And as Homer rides off into the sunset, with 
Marge on the handlebars of his bicycle, he rings the bike’s bell 
and chortles. This ending gives an example of the two married 
cognitive experiences of modern sitcom episodes.
n   
n
The first is the experience of togetherness: Homer and Marge are 
united again. The second is the experience of personal kookiness: 
Homer can’t pedal off into his happily-ever-after without indulging 
in a  little private joke. He has to ring the bell and giggle, even 
though his wife doesn’t find it funny at all.
n   
n
These two opposite feelings of comic individuality and sentimental 
togetherness point toward the engine that makes The Simpsons 
and virtually every other modern sitcom go.
ENGINE
n   
n
The sitcom engine is the conflict between the individual and the 
society. Individual is a literal term when it comes to sitcoms: Every 
character is a  one-of-a-kind individual, filled with rogue desires 
and dreams.
n   
n
Sitcoms generate enormous variety by tweaking the specific 
characteristics of the individual and the social aspects of the show. 
In Frasier, the tweak is that the individuals are highly neurotic 
psychiatrists. In Cheers, the tweak is that the society is a bar where 
everyone is trying to escape the other society outside.
n   
n
In other words, there are two basic ways to invent your own original 
sitcom. The first is to focus on a unique subculture of individuals, 
like Broad City does with female college grads in New York City. 
The second is to focus on a  unique kind of social togetherness, 
like Modern Family does with post-divorce American families, or 
Seinfeld does with the special bond between misanthropes.
220
Lecture 21  •  The Sitcom: The Simpsons

221
Lecture 21  •  The Sitcom: The Simpsons
n   
n
Since the engine of sitcoms is the running conflict between the 
individual and the society, sitcoms never imply that one is absolutely 
better than the other. If they did, that would kill the engine. Instead, 
sitcom episodes go back and forth between mocking the individual 
from the perspective of the society and mocking the society from 
the perspective of the individual.
n   
n
In “Duffless,” one of the many mocks of individuals occurs when 
Police Chief Wiggum terrifies Marge by telling her that Homer is 
DOA, only to then chuckle and say: “Oh, I always mix up DOA with 
DWI.” In this case, the police chief is the menace to society.
n   
n
But there are also many, many moments where the society is the 
menace to the individual. An example is when all the students at 
Lisa’s school hoot and cheer when the tomato that would end world 
hunger is instead used as a projectile to slime the school principal.
OPENING SCENE OF “DUFFLESS”
n   
n “Duffless” opens on a dream. It’s Bart’s dream, and in it, he invents 
something called a  Go-Go Ray, which makes all the teachers 
dance. This is the quintessential sitcom opener. Not every sitcom 
should open with a literal dream, but the starting point for most 
sitcom episodes is a figurative dream where one or more characters 
is caught in their own private world.
n   
n
That’s why after Bart physically wakes up, the episode goes on to 
show the other members of Bart’s family as they remain psychically 
marooned in their own waking dreams. When Homer is asked to 
help Lisa on her science fair project, he responds: “Yeah. Syrup is 
better than jelly.”
n   
n
Meanwhile, Lisa announces that she’s grown a futuristic tomato by 
fertilizing it with anabolic steroids. This is another kind of dream. 
In Lisa’s daydream, a  third-world family has erected a  shrine 
to her, worshipping her as their tomato savior. The real point of 
Lisa’s invention isn’t so much to improve other people’s lives as to 
improve her own celebrity. 

n   
n
The two dreams that the episode introduces in this beginning scene 
are the ones that will drive the remaining plot. Homer’s dreamy 
immersion in his own gut appetites brings him into opposition 
with Marge, creating the conflict that will lead to his extravagant 
efforts to give up beer. Lisa’s dream of scientific glory will lead to 
her equally extravagant efforts to turn Bart into her lab rat. 
CHARACTER
n   
n
In the world of sitcoms, a  clown is any character locked 
within their own private worldview—that is, any character 
who mistakes their dreams for reality. There are 
many different ways to create a sitcom clown. 
One is to give the clown an uncontrollably 
strong emotion or passion. 
n   
n
Another 
technique 
for 
clown 
making is to make the clown 
a  professional stereotype. For 
example, all the soldier-clowns 
in ancient comedies are cowards, 
while all the courtesan-clowns are crafty. You 
can see vestiges of this ancient technique in The 
Simpsons’ lazy cops, its ineffectually pompous 
school principal, and its glibly dishonest lawyer.
n   
n
You can also make the weirdness of your clowns more 
deeply personal. In this episode of The Simpsons, 
Chief Wiggum makes home videos of himself in 
a  splash pool. Lisa decides that the key food for 
ending world hunger is a  tomato. Bart teaches 
a hamster to fly. This is a step beyond stereotypes into 
the deeply idiosyncratic strangeness of individual minds.
222
Lecture 21  •  The Sitcom: The Simpsons

223
n   
n
However you choose to make your clowns, remember this golden 
rule: Make your clowns harmlessly eccentric, their oddness a danger 
only to themselves. The comedy in a sitcom comes from harmlessly 
eccentric clown characters. It doesn’t come from writing jokes.
n   
n
Instead of writing jokes, create a  character with a  slightly 
offbeat mind. Then imagine what that atypical character 
would typically do. Whatever it is will automatically be 
funny, unless it mortally threatens your audience. 
In that case, dial it back.
n   
n
To create your first 
clown character, it 
can help to start 
with some of your 
own peculiarities. Or 
study 
the 
people 
around you for their 
deep eccentricities. 
As much as you can, try 
to keep the weirdness of your clowns 
simple, because all the zany behavior of 
each sitcom character can always be traced 
back to its own single psychological root. 
Homer is a glutton. Lisa is superior. Bart 
is attention-seeking. Marge is anxious.
n   
n
The absolute minimum for a sitcom 
is two main clowns, and most 
sitcoms have three or four. Often 
they can have five or six. Sitcoms 
are like clown cars: There’s always 
room for one more.
Lecture 21  •  The Sitcom: The Simpsons

PLOT
n   
n
Sitcom plots are set in motion by a problem that 
characters create for themselves. And clowns 
are always creating problems for themselves. 
In the case of “Duffless,” two of the characters 
create problems for themselves, resulting in an 
A-plot and a B-plot.
n   
n
In the A-plot, Homer’s lust for alcohol gets him 
locked up for drunk driving, bringing him in 
conflict with Marge. In the B-plot, Lisa’s desire 
to be praised for her intelligence leads her on 
a quest to win the school science fair, bringing 
her in conflict with Bart.
n   
n
The key here is that in both plots, the clowns’ 
normal psychological drives lead them to create 
a problem that then puts them in conflict with 
another character. That conflict with another 
character then leads to an escalation.
n   
n
In the case of Homer, the escalation is his 
increasingly desperate attempts to avoid 
alcohol. He tries to distract himself at the 
science fair. He tries to distract himself with 
TV. He tries to distract himself at a Tupperware 
party. On each of these occasions, his inner 
struggle becomes more and more absurdly 
heightened, 
until 
he’s 
fantasizing 
about 
murdering everyone at the Tupperware party 
for one drop of beer.
n   
n
In the case of Lisa, she comes up with 
increasingly sophisticated ways to manipulate 
Bart, placing treats just out of his reach, 
electrocuting cupcakes, and finally outsmarting 
Bart and his villain act.
225

n   
n
Toward the end of the episode, the A and B plots intersect when 
Homer goes to the science fair. In the episode’s final beats, each 
of the plots resolves itself. Lisa loses the science fair, crushing her 
dreams of glory. And Homer realizes that he actually likes spending 
time with Marge, so he finds a painless way to be sober.
n   
n
At the end, the important thing is that the characters finally stop 
making their self-inflicted problem worse. Maybe they give up. 
Maybe the world crushes them. Maybe the other characters rescue 
them. It’s up to you and what you want your audience to feel.
n   
n
Not all sitcoms have two plots, but most tend to. That’s partly 
because it’s hard to stretch a  single plotline out for an entire 
episode. And having two plots also adds to the comic richness of 
the world by involving more characters and more weird problems. 
Some even have a third plot.
TONE
n   
n
There are two simple ways to generate a comic tone. First, focus 
on everyday people and objects. Second, describe the world in 
multiple voices. The Simpsons shows how both of these are done.
n   
n
First, everything in the episode is drawn from daily life. The 
audience sees the insides of schools, workplaces, bars, churches, 
and living rooms. Almost all sitcoms stick to these everyday places, 
and even sitcoms that go a  little further afield create their own 
sense of regular life by returning to the same communal locations 
again and again.
n   
n
Second, each character in the episode has his or her own voice. The 
Simpsons is a smorgasbord of different dialects. Bart says things 
like “Ay Carumba” and “Eat my shorts.” Lisa says things like: “The 
hamster has learned a valuable lesson—beware the hand of man.”
n   
n
When you’re writing your first sitcom, set it somewhere ordinary. And 
give each of your clowns a little of their own extraordinary dialect.
226
Lecture 21  •  The Sitcom: The Simpsons

227
SCENES
n   
n
A crisp example of The Simpson’s sitcom blueprint is the scene 
where Homer attends an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. The 
meeting begins with Ned Flanders shuddering in horror at the time 
he had a  blackberry schnapps. Then, the world’s oldest-looking 
man confesses that drinking has ruined his life. He is, in fact, only 31. 
n   
n
Then Homer grouchily informs everyone that he’s there because 
a judge made him come. Which leads the Reverend to reach out 
sympathetically: “Homer, with our help, you’ll never touch a beer 
again.” This prompts Homer to shriek and jump out the window.
n   
n
So this scene offers an elegant mini-blueprint of the endless 
conflict between the individual and the social that drives every 
beat of every sitcom. First comes a sequence of totally eccentric 
characters, each driven by their own weird and distinct psychology 
to make a problem for themselves. But then they all come together 
in the shared moment of the AA confession, so that for an instant, 
the individual and the social merge. In the final beat, Homer’s 
rogue psychology busts it all apart.

LECTURE 22
THE PROCEDURAL: CSI
E
very sitcom begins with a problem that the main character creates. 
That problem gets worse and worse, leading to more disasters 
and complications, until at the end, the character capitulates 
and things go back to normal. In the procedural genre, it’s the inverse. 
Every episode begins with a problem that the main character sets out 
to solve. That problem is unraveled piece by piece through a series of 
breakthroughs and discoveries, until at the end, the character triumphs 
and things go back to normal. To expand that basic engine into a more 
detailed blueprint, this lecture reverse engineers the pilot episode of 
the successful and influential procedural CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.
The show has a  two-part pilot episode, which was split into the first 
two episodes of season one, titled “Pilot” and “Cool Change.” For 
the purposes of this lecture, both “Pilot” and “Cool Change” will be 
referred to together as the pilot. The end of the pilot means the end of 
“Cool Change.” If you haven’t seen the two-part pilot for CSI or read the 
scripts, take the time to check them out.

ENDING
n   
n
The pilot to CSI has a  two-part ending. In the first part of the 
ending, Gil Grissom, the lead crime scene investigator, solves 
a casino crime. In the second part, the CSI team forgives a member 
of their unit for making a human mistake.
n   
n
Each part of the ending has its own cognitive effect, which together 
make up the total experience of CSI. Grissom wraps this case in 
spectacular fashion: He turns back time to witness a murder as it 
actually happened, and he sees something that he wasn’t there to 
see. The point is that Grissom seems like a god. That’s the first half 
of CSI’s cognitive effect: a feeling of euphoric omniscience when 
the audience discovers solution to the crime. 
n   
n
The second half of the pilot’s cognitive effect is less intoxicating. 
In the final beats, CSI member Warrick Brown tries to resign, 
confessing to Grissom that he has a  gambling addiction that 
inadvertently led to a trainee agent’s death. But Grissom refuses 
to accept Brown’s resignation, insisting that if Brown messed up, so 
did every member of his unit. “We’re all culpable in this,” Grissom 
says. Handing Brown back his badge, Grissom welcomes him back 
onto the team.
n   
n
But instead of ending with a tidy sitcom reconciliation, the pilot for 
CSI carries on for one more beat. And in that beat, unlike at the end 
of The Simpsons or Friends, the characters don’t go home together. 
Instead, each of them goes home on their own. This leaves Brown 
in the parking lot, alone.
n   
n
This is a story world where people try to reform and try to forgive 
and forget. But as much as the characters of CSI all do their best, at 
the end of the day, people still end up alone. This is the other face 
of CSI: not the solving of problems but the making of problems.
230
Lecture 22  •  The Procedural: CSI

231
Lecture 22  •  The Procedural: CSI
ENGINE
n   
n
The show’s dual cognitive effect points to the special engine of CSI. 
The engine of every procedural is broadly the same: The conflict is 
between the forces that generate the problem and the procedures 
that solve it.
n   
n
But a vast number of different procedural shows have been built 
out of this basic engine by modifying one side of the conflict or the 
other. In the case of CSI, the innovation is to make the problem the 
fallenness of human nature and to make the procedure the god’s 
eye of science. The problem is sin city. And the solution is forensic 
omniscience.
n   
n
The pilot’s first full-length crime is introduced at the beginning of 
its second half. Things begin when a lucky casino-goer wins $40 
million and is led to the presidential suite with his girlfriend. Thrilled 
to be rich, his girlfriend steps out onto the balcony—at which point 
the big winner tells her: “Come on, I’m a  millionaire now. Why 
would I want to waste any more time with you?”
n   
n
Here’s the ugly side of Las Vegas: Money changes everything. 
And then the ugliness gets uglier. The man’s girlfriend murders 
him in revenge. And when she’s asked later whether she feels any 
remorse, she says she doesn’t. The pilot doesn’t show hardened 
criminals. It shows ordinary people who come to Vegas and have 
their subterranean desires exposed, for example, by a $40 million 
payout.
n   
n
Against the problem of human nature, the pilot then pits the other 
half of its engine: the problem-solving procedure of the scientific 
method. Grissom’s forensic method is to reverse engineer history 
through an analysis of the physical data that remains. Grissom 
doesn’t just speculate about the past. He can see it exactly.

n   
n
Grissom’s method takes forensic science to a  level far beyond 
procedurals like Dragnet or Sherlock Holmes. In those earlier 
procedurals, the detectives always took the time to interview 
witnesses and people of interest. But according to Grissom, that 
was a mistake. It introduced a human fallibility into science.
232
Lecture 22  •  The Procedural: CSI

233
n   
n
The procedures of the show’s CSI unit leave the imperfect 
memories and self-interested distortions of witnesses behind. They 
achieve Grissom’s god’s eye by freeing themselves entirely from 
human nature. With this innovation in crime solving, CSI cleanly 
establishes its core conflict. On one side is human nature and 
the errors that it breeds. On the other is science and the divine 
omniscience it permits.
CHARACTER
n   
n
The audience first meets Grissom when he’s deducing a  victim’s 
time of death by examining the size of a  maggot, after which 
Grissom goes back to his office to break in a  new recruit. The 
recruit confesses to feeling lightheaded, so Grissom reaches into 
his refrigerator and grabs a jar of bugs. He then hands a bug to the 
recruit, promising that it will boost her blood sugar and take away 
her lightheadedness. And to prove his point, Grissom pops a bug 
in his own mouth and chews.
n   
n
With this scene, Grissom establishes that his only god is science. 
Sure, your stomach might turn at the thought of eating a bug. But 
that’s the problem with human nature: It’s irrational. It doesn’t 
know that bugs are good for its blood sugar. Grissom is firmly on 
one side of the show’s central conflict. He’s on the side of science.
n   
n
The next main character introduced by the CSI Pilot is Brown. He’s 
on the opposite side of the show’s central conflict from Grissom, 
creating a  clash between the two characters. Where Grissom is 
cool and scientifically calculating, Brown is so hot for his promotion 
that he gets entangled with a corrupt judge. Brown shows human 
nature, with all its faults and follies. The other CSI personnel all fall 
somewhere in between Brown and Grissom. 
Lecture 22  •  The Procedural: CSI

235
PLOT
n   
n
The way to plot a  procedural is to reverse 
engineer it, starting with the answer to 
a  problem, and then building back the steps 
you need to get there. So in the case of 
a  typical episode of CSI, the writers imagine 
an ingenious crime and then build back all 
the evidence needed to solve it, planting that 
evidence in earlier scenes.
n   
n
To take an example from the pilot, one crime 
involves female prostitutes putting a knockout 
drug on their nipples, allowing them to 
incapacitate and rob their unsuspecting male 
clients. Different scenes show an unconscious 
male victim with discoloration on his mouth, 
an 
unconscious 
female 
victim 
with 
no 
discoloration on her mouth, and a third scene 
where doctors examine the female victim 
and discover discoloration on her nipples. 
She’s a  perpetrator—not the victim—and she 
accidentally knocked herself out.
n   
n
This isn’t the only kind of reverse engineering 
that CSI employs. If it was all just clues and 
fitting them together, the show would get 
predictable. The writers also reverse engineer 
red herrings and misdirections and other 
story delays. An example of a delay is to plant 
inconclusive evidence, like an ineffective mouth 
swab that doesn’t yield the data that the 
investigators need. 
n   
n
The process of creating the plot for each 
episode is simply to imagine an ingenious 
crime or medical mystery or some other 
problem. Then, reverse engineer the evidence, 
dispensing it drip by drip. Also reverse engineer 

delays and complications as needed. If one problem isn’t enough 
to keep the plot interesting, imagine one or two more, so that you 
have multiple plotlines going at once.
TONE
n   
n
In CSI, the tone is reverse engineered to heighten the show’s 
cognitive mix of divine euphoria and human emptiness. The 
tone heightens the first half of this cognitive effect, the divine 
euphoria, by playing up the extraordinary nature of its crime-
solving procedures. These procedures are portrayed as colorful, 
dazzling, even gorgeous. They offer a holy glimpse into the hidden 
mystery of things, and CSI has won multiple Emmys for its beautiful 
special effects.
n   
n
The tone of CSI heightens the second half of the show’s cognitive 
effect, human emptiness, though its dark and grimy crime scenes. 
The show is set at night, allowing shadows to permeate everything, 
making the world feel lonely and grim.
SCENE
n   
n
Next, this lecture turns to a scene that captures the whole engine 
of CSI in miniature. In this scene, Grissom is brooding over the 
physical evidence retrieved from the casino. That evidence doesn’t 
add up. The casino security has no record of the electronic lock to 
the victim’s room being triggered, so the evidence suggests that 
the victim left his room and died elsewhere. 
n   
n
But Grissom has found carpet fibers from the room in the victim’s 
watchband, so that evidence suggests that the victim was in fact 
killed in the room and dragged across the floor. The evidence 
seems to point in two directions at once. 
236
Lecture 22  •  The Procedural: CSI

237
n   
n
But then Grissom has a  realization that resolves the apparent 
conflict in the evidence: There must be a tiny bug in the casino’s 
security system. Specifically, if a key is inserted in a door lock when 
the door is open, then left in the lock while the door is closed, and 
then later removed after the door is reopened, the security system 
must fail to record the door opening the second time.
n   
n
This is an incredibly complicated sequence of events to intuit, 
and Grissom has no special knowledge of casino doors. But the 
evidence tells him it must be true, and when he conducts a little 
experiment with the casino staff, they confirm it. 
n   
n
With this scene, the pilot illustrates both the method and the 
miracle of the CSI procedure. By following science exactly, it does 
what no mortal eye can do and sees into tomorrow.

LECTURE 23
THE PRIME-TIME 
SOAP: GREY’S ANATOMY
S
oap operas can help people work through emotions they don’t 
want to feel as much. Or they can help people intensify feelings 
they see as important. Or they can just help people feel more 
comfortable and happy, offering respite from a  modern world that’s 
often too busy to acknowledge how people feel. This lecture looks at 
how you can launch your own soap opera by studying the pilot episode 
of the most popular prime-time soap of the past decade: ABC’s Grey’s 
Anatomy. If you haven’t had a  chance to watch or read the pilot for 
Gray’s Anatomy, enjoy before proceeding.

ENDING
n   
n
In the final scene of Grey’s Anatomy’s pilot, Meredith visits her 
mom in a nursing home to tell her that she’s decided not to sell the 
house. “It’s home, you know?” To which her mom blankly responds: 
“Are you the doctor?”
n   
n
With this sharp twist, the scene reveals that Meredith’s mother 
has Alzheimer’s. She doesn’t know her own child. This ending is 
a heartbreaker. And it breaks your heart in a very specific way: It 
makes you feel what it is to have a mother and not have a mother all 
at the same time. It’s a feeling of being home and being a stranger 
at the same time.
n   
n
In the case of Grey’s Anatomy, the story engine is the conflict 
between a  person’s desire to belong and their anxiety that they 
don’t. Everyone in the pilot of Gray’s Anatomy is constantly striving 
to be accepted. Yet no one ever quite manages to feel that they 
belong. They feel constantly like strangers in their own homes.
OPENING
n   
n
The pilot establishes that conflict on its opening page. It begins 
with a voiceover in which Meredith remarks: “The game. They say 
either a person has what it takes to play, or they don’t. My mother 
was one of the greats. Me, on the other hand…”
n   
n
This voiceover is a  mini-blueprint for Grey’s Anatomy’s whole 
engine. There’s a  game that people were born to play. Their 
parents are in the game’s hall of fame, yet people feel like they 
don’t even belong on the field.
n   
n
The pilot’s following scene dramatizes this conflict between 
belonging and not belonging in a starkly intimate way. Meredith 
wakes up in her bed, naked. There’s a  man next to her. He’s 
naked, too, but he doesn’t know her name. Meredith feels 
instantly humiliated.
240
﻿Lecture 23  •  The Prime-Time Soap: Grey’s Anatomy

241
﻿Lecture 23  •  The Prime-Time Soap: Grey’s Anatomy
n   
n
The naked man is pleasant. He’s sympathetic about Meredith’s 
mother. But to Meredith, it all feels like an illusion. She asks him to 
leave, and then she quickly flees herself.
n   
n
The engine for Gray’s Anatomy is a conflict in the heart. If you want 
to create your own soap, try coming up with your own original spin 
on a conflict inside the heart.
CHARACTER
n   
n
Grey’s main characters are dispersed across the full spectrum of the 
story world’s root conflict, some more on one side of the conflict, 
some more on the other. Like procedurals and serial dramas, the 
pilot emphasizes its core conflict by opening on a character who’s 
on one extreme of the conflict and then immediately introducing 
a character on the other extreme.
n   
n
The first character is Meredith, who feels strongly on the side of 
not belonging. Right after Meredith’s introduction, the pilot cuts 
to a speech delivered in the heart of the hospital by Dr. Richard 
Webber, the chief of surgery.
n   
n
Webber is presented as the ultimate insider. He belongs about 
as much as anyone can belong. And his speech to new interns 
reinforces the point: “Each of you comes here hopeful. Wanting in 
on the game. […] But eight of you will switch to an easier specialty. 
Five of you will crack under the pressure. Two of you will be asked 
to leave.” With this, Webber instantly makes the interns feel like 
imposters. 
n   
n
Everyone else in the episode falls somewhere on the spectrum 
between Meredith and Webber. For example, the female interns 
feel superior to the ex-model Izzie. And a male intern, George, is 
mocked by the other interns, pitied by the doctors, and picked as 
a scapegoat by Burke.

243
PLOT
n   
n
Every plot line is about a character striving to 
fit in with some group but, in the end, failing 
to make it completely. One of the most 
spectacular instances of these plotlines is 
George’s interaction with a  worried family 
whose father is going to have heart surgery. 
George bonds with the family by promising that 
their father will make it through surgery alive.
n   
n
With this beat, the script establishes that 
George finally feels like he belongs. Then, the 
plot rips this feeling of belonging away by 
showing the father flatlining in surgery. This 
forces George to inform the family that he’s 
dead. Their response: “Thank you. Please … go 
away.” George is back on the outside; he was 
part of the family, and now he isn’t anymore.
n   
n
The point here is that the purpose of a  soap 
is to keep returning to the same emotional 
conflict over and over. To reverse engineer 
those returns, take each of your characters 
and create little challenges for them that hold 
out the promise of resolving the conflict. Then, 
interrupt your characters’ moments of triumph 
with a sharp plot twist that plunges them back 
into their original dilemma so that the show’s 
engine goes on.
n   
n
To give yourself a little more plot to work with, 
you can also bake in one of the procedural 
elements discussed in the lecture on CSI, 
like the pilot for Grey’s Anatomy does by 
introducing the need to solve difficult hospital 

mysteries. Note: For a soap to be a soap and not a procedural, the 
soap engine always needs to govern the action of the procedural 
element. 
n   
n
Here’s how it works in the pilot of Gray’s Anatomy: Derek kicks off 
the problem solving by asking the interns for help. He has a patient 
who is a “mystery.” Her labs are clean, her scans are pure, but she’s 
having life-threatening seizures. 
n   
n
Derek tells the interns: “I need you to play detective, I need you 
to find out why [she’s] having seizures.” Over the episode, the 
detective-playing interns go at it, trying to crack the case. But 
in the end, the solution is not achieved through some rigorous, 
scientific method, like in CSI or House. Instead, the solution comes 
from an emotional intuition.
n   
n
Meredith and Cristina approach Derek in the elevator and tell him 
that they have a hunch. Derek responds by pointing out that their 
hunch is wildly unlikely. But the doctors do a scan, and to Derek’s 
surprise, the hunch is correct. Emotion is the logic of the world 
of Grey’s.
TONE
n   
n
The tone of soap operas is always sentimental. Everything in the 
world is portrayed from the perspective of how the characters feel 
about it. In Grey’s Anatomy, the pilot’s most powerful technique for 
creating this sentimental tone is Meredith’s voiceover.
n   
n
In Meredith’s opening soliloquy, she expresses her conflict 
between wanting to play the game and feeling like she can’t. The 
same voiceover technique injects sympathy into the final beats 
of the pilot. Here, Meredith says: “The other interns are all good 
people, you’d like them. I think. I don’t know. Maybe. I like them.” 
Her unsure tone shows that Meredith is torn.
244
﻿Lecture 23  •  The Prime-Time Soap: Grey’s Anatomy

245
n   
n
If you’re writing a soap, there’s no better way to build a sentimental 
tone than through voiceovers like this. Don’t use voiceover just 
to express what your characters think. Use it to express the deep 
emotional conflict in your characters’ hearts. 
﻿Lecture 23  •  The Prime-Time Soap: Grey’s Anatomy

SCENE
n   
n
One particular scene captures the whole engine of Grey’s Anatomy 
at work. The scene is right at the end of the pilot, when Dr. Webber 
humiliates Alex for failing to diagnose a patient. After Alex and all 
the other interns stammer helplessly in response to Dr. Webber’s 
questions, Meredith steps in and nails the diagnosis. Webber reacts 
by telling Alex: “I want you off the case.” Then he tells Meredith: 
“Welcome to the gang.”
n   
n
This is an enormously satisfying scene because it’s a prime instance 
of poetic justice. The script has repeatedly marked Alex out as 
a bad guy—he’s condescending to nurses and doesn’t care about 
his patients. When Alex gets his comeuppance, the audience 
loves it.
n   
n
Morevoer, the scene also fuels the specific engine that makes 
Grey’s Anatomy its own special soap. First of all, this scene reveals 
that in the story world of this soap, belonging always has to be 
paired with a  feeling of not belonging. Meredith only becomes 
part of “the gang” when Alex is kicked off the case. Otherwise, if it 
was possible for all the characters to belong at once, the conflict in 
the story world would weaken and the show’s engine would sputter.
n   
n
Second, this scene brilliantly sets up the pilot’s closing twist—the 
reveal that Meredith’s mother has Alzheimer’s. When Webber 
welcomes Meredith into the gang, this is really just to set Meredith 
up for the emotional reverse of the final scene, where she ends up 
feeling like a stranger to her own mother.
n   
n
This story beat with Dr. Webber is classic reverse engineering. To 
make the final scene of not belonging really hurt, the script builds 
back this scene where, for a  moment, the character finally feels 
she fits in. It has Meredith drop her guard before the last punch 
comes in.

EXERCISES
1	
Watch an episode of your favorite soap. Identify its engine. 
And then tweak it slightly, modifying the deep conflict in 
the heart.
2	
Create two characters to act as windows into your new 
engine. The first should be on one side of the conflict and 
the second should be on the opposite. Then, write an 
opening scene where the audience meets the first character 
and a second scene where the two characters collide.

LECTURE 24
 BECOMING 
A SCREENWRITER
T
his final lecture asks you to choose where you want the story of 
this course to end. By learning how scripts work throughout this 
course, you’ve been learning how narrative works. And there’s 
almost no end to the things that you can do with narrative. There’s no 
better way to enlarge your own narrative skills than by practicing the 
three goals of this course, which were to help you appreciate more 
films and TV, tell better stories, and write your own scripts.

250
﻿Lecture 24  •  Becoming a Screenwriter
APPRECIATING TV AND FILM 
n   
n
With a TV show, if you can appreciate the pilot, you can appreciate 
any episode. And the core conflict of the pilot should be there in 
the opening scene. Rewatch that scene to find it. If it’s a procedural, 
what’s the problem and what’s the problem solver? If it’s a soap, 
what’s the core emotional struggle?
n   
n
Once you’ve found the conflict, try to imagine feeling it in your own 
life. And watch the show, honing in on that feeling of conflict until 
the story takes you away.
n   
n
You can do the same basic thing with films. Watch the first few 
minutes carefully to identify the core conflict between the character 
and their story world. If you can’t find it, rewatch the first two 
scenes. It’s there the vast majority of the time.
n   
n
Or you can ask the person you’re watching the film with: What’s the 
character fighting against? What are they most afraid of happening? 
Then ask yourself: Have I ever had a similar fear? If you can feel that 
fear, you can feel for the character and their conflict. Then you’ll be 
in, and the story will start to flow.
EFFECTIVE STORYTELLING
n   
n
There isn’t one right way to tell stories. Everyone has their own 
storytelling style, and you don’t want to lose that. But you can 
improve your stories in the same organic way that you can improve 
a script, simply by reverse engineering.
n   
n
If you have a particular story that’s not working quite right, think 
about what you want that story to do. Then think about another 
story you’ve got that achieves that intended effect and ask yourself: 
What story beat or narrative twist or other plot structure does my 
effective story have that my less effective story doesn’t?

251
﻿Lecture 24  •  Becoming a Screenwriter
n   
n
For example, you might notice that your best stories begin with 
you making a little self-deprecating remark about yourself, or that 
your best stories have a little ironic twist at the end, or that your 
best stories have a logic of the heart to them. That’s one of your 
distinctive personal ingredients for good stories, so import it into 
any of your stories that isn’t working so well.
n   
n
If you don’t already have a strong, personal storytelling style, or 
you want to branch out and enrich your narrative repertoire, don’t 
worry. All you have to do is identify a story that that has a cognitive 
effect you want to replicate, then reverse engineer it and borrow its 
hidden recipe. 
n   
n
If you want to charm like The Princess Bride, practice telling your 
stories with a  light irony. If you want to create wonder like Star 
Wars, start with an ordinary thing that suddenly offers a glimpse of 
a much bigger something beyond.

252
﻿Lecture 24  •  Becoming a Screenwriter
n   
n
And if your stories still aren’t working quite right, there are two 
simple scriptwriting tricks you can use to troubleshoot. First, the 
one thing that almost all good scripts do is generate suspense, 
which they do by setting the stage with a conflict between a person 
and their world. 
n   
n
The second broad scriptwriting trick for troubleshooting your 
stories is to enrich them with a deeper human interest so that your 
audience cares more about what happens to the characters. To 
do this, remember that the secret recipe for empathy is to reveal 
a  character’s fears. For example, when you tell stories about 
yourself, go ahead and let the audience see your vulnerabilities 
and anxieties. 
SCRIPTWRITING
n   
n
The better you can appreciate films and tell stories, the better 
you can write a script. Always work to develop those two skills. Be 
a dedicated student of the scripts and stories you admire and tell 
stories at every opportunity.
n   
n
As for writing itself: If you like one or more of the blueprints covered 
in this course, that’s great. You can steal them. But if you don’t like 
any of the blueprints, don’t worry. Since the purpose of this course 
isn’t to force you to stick to any single plot structure, the important 
thing is not the blueprints themselves. 
n   
n
The important thing is the method for making these blueprints. 
Reverse engineering can guide you to whatever blueprint you need 
to create your next script. Start by getting a copy of a script you 
admire and identifying the cognitive effect of the script’s ending, 
as precisely as you can, using any language to describe it that 
works for you. Then go through the script, isolating the different 
story elements that generate this cognitive effect. 

253
﻿Lecture 24  •  Becoming a Screenwriter
n   
n
If it’s a TV pilot, the key story element is the engine, or conflict in 
the world. You’ll find it clearly established in both the first and final 
scenes of the pilot, and it’ll also be the conflict between the first 
two main characters to be introduced. You’ll know you’ve found 
the engine because when you imagine its conflict, it’ll immediately 
make you feel the cognitive effect of the entire series.

254
﻿Lecture 24  •  Becoming a Screenwriter
n   
n
If you’re instead reverse engineering a  film script, begin by 
identifying the special rule of the story world, which you can locate 
either in the opening scene or in the antagonist’s behavior. Next, 
determine the main character’s conflict with this world rule. Isolate 
the fear that fuels the conflict.
n   
n
Then, move on to the plot. Write down the main story beats—
the moments in the plot where something major changes—so 
you summarize the plot’s whole action with the minimum steps 
needed. If you go through these beats in reverse, from the end to 
the beginning, reviewing the author’s story choices, you’ll discover 
the deep storytelling logic that connects them. Steal that deep 
storytelling logic and leave the story beats behind.
n   
n
Finally, identify the what and the how of the tone. What parts of the 
story world and the characters does the script focus on? And how 
does it talk about them—with a god’s-eye tone, irony, sentiment, 
comic generosity, or something else entirely?
n   
n
The more you practice this, the faster you’ll get. Reading one script 
a week will give you 52 blueprints over the course of a year.
n   
n
Once you’ve picked your blueprint, start with your ending. For your 
first few scripts, that ending should be similar in its broad outlines 
to the ending in your blueprint. For example, if your blueprint is 
Toy Story, have two strangers bond as they overcome a common 
life challenge, only to end by seeing the challenge resurface. 
n   
n
If you’re writing a pilot, your next step is to reverse engineer your 
engine. What deep conflict in a story world would produce your 
chosen cognitive effect? How can you put your own unique twist 
on that conflict if it seems too similar to another TV series that you 
know? Then, write a pilot that relentlessly establishes this engine 
through its opening scene.

255
﻿Lecture 24  •  Becoming a Screenwriter
n   
n
If you’re instead reverse engineering a  film, first figure out the 
tone of your ending. Whoever talks in that tone is your narrator. 
Next, reverse engineer your world-character conflict, which again 
you can do by building back from your ending. First, ask yourself 
whether the story world in your final scene is the same as it was at 
the beginning. 
n   
n
If it is, you first reverse engineer your story world and then go 
back and build your character in conflict. If it isn’t, do the opposite. 
Reverse engineer your character first, then build a  story word 
in conflict.
n   
n
Once you’ve got your characters and your story world, rough 
out your plot by working back from your final scene to create the 
action beats you need to get you there. If you get stuck or lost, ask 
yourself questions like: What would make my character more afraid 
than anything? What would threaten the big rule of my story world 
more than anything? 
FEEDBACK
n   
n
After you’ve written your first script, you’ll want to share it. The 
point of a story is to connect with an audience, so you’ll want to see 
how effectively you’ve connected.
n   
n
If you want honest feedback that doesn’t wreck your current 
relationships, it’s best to build a group of writing friends. Listen to 
their notes. But remember, writing groups are better at identifying 
problems with your stories than giving you solutions. When 
someone tells you that something in your script doesn’t work, 
accept their criticism of what’s broken, but try to fix it your own way.
n   
n
Go back to your ending and remember what cognitive effect 
you’re trying to accomplish. And stick to your blueprint when you 
troubleshoot so that you’re working with a plan in mind.

256
﻿Lecture 24  •  Becoming a Screenwriter
BREAKING IN
n   
n
When you feel pretty good about one of your scripts, it’s time to 
get it out into the world. One way to get your script out there is to 
get it made into an indie film so it can be screened at film festivals. 
n   
n
Before you make your script into a film, attend a film festival or two, 
meet people, enjoy films, and get a sense of how the festival works. 
Then, get together with some people you met there 
and create and submit your own film. If your film 
takes off on the festival circuit, you’ll 
touch a  huge audience, you’ll meet 
new friends and collaborators, and 
you’ll get to make more films.
n   
n
If you’re looking to break more directly 
into 
the 
industry 
without 
getting 
involved in production, one way is 
through a  script contest. The two top 
film script contests are The Academy 
Nicholl Fellowship and The Sundance 
Institute Lab Program. You can find the 
applications online. 
n   
n
If you’re writing TV scripts instead, many of the 
major television networks have their own script 
contests. Apply to those. They’ll open a lot of 
doors if you win.
n   
n
One other way into Hollywood is through 
a development company. These are companies 
that develop, package, and produce scripts. 
If you don’t know anyone at a  development 
company, look up some that have made TV series 
or films that you’ve liked. You can use a site called 
IMDBPro.com to find all their credits and their 
contact info.

257
﻿Lecture 24  •  Becoming a Screenwriter
PITCHING
n   
n
Once you figure out how to get your foot in the door, the secret to 
getting further is to learn how to pitch. Young screenwriters often 
think that a good pitch should condense their script down to a tidy 
plot summary, like a kind of snappy logline. 
n   
n
But the key to a good pitch is subtler than that. Rather than handing 
your audience a  finished story, you want to hand them a  catchy 
beginning, kicking off a narrative chain reaction in their brains so 
that they start telling your story themselves.
n   
n
Plot summaries don’t build intrigue. Instead, they kill the suspense 
by revealing too much. When you’re preparing a pitch, think about 
how you can hook your audience the same way that the first page 
of a script hooks a reader. 
n   
n
Some writers are just naturally good at pitching. But if you want to 
get better, the best way to start is by studying the beginnings of 
your favorite scripts and identifying the precise method they use 
to hook you. For example, sometimes they grab your curiosity by 
posing a puzzle or a mystery. Sometimes they forge an emotional 
bond by showing a character in a moment of crisis. Sometimes they 
create wonder by opening the prospect of a new world.
n   
n
But even the best pitch will only get you so far. There has to be 
a script behind it that lives up to expectations. To ensure that your 
audience-pleasing pitches aren’t just empty promises, never stop 
writing. Get a screenwriting program and write for an hour each 
day—because the world can always use more good stories.

extraordinary.
Hitchcock, Alfred. Psycho. A masterpiece of suspense. After you watch 
it, read the 1959 novel on which it was based, and ask yourself: Why 
does the film script depart from the novel by choosing to open on 
Marion?

work, you can’t find a more elegant blueprint.
Loncraine, Richard. Richard III (film), 1995. Young Shakespeare’s classic 
tragedy, with a stunning performance by Ian McKellan. Provides the 
basic blueprint for tragedy and debunks the old fiction of the tragic 
flaw—because like all tragic heroes, Richard is undone by his greatest 
strength.
Paik, Karen. To Infinity and Beyond: The Story of Pixar Animation 
Studios. A brilliant insider’s look at the early days of Pixar.
Search for Tomorrow, season two, 1952–1953. The most popular 
daytime American soap opera in history, focused on a kind-hearted 
and determined widow. How would you update its recipe today?
Whedon, Joss. Much Ado About Nothing (film), 2012. With its witty, 
slang-talking female lead, this movie provides the blueprint for modern 
romantic comedy. This version fills in the backstory often missed by 
viewers of the stage play.
