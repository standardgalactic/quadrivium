In memory of Thomas L. Floyd
Author, educator, and friend
The first edition of Principles of Electric Circuits, released in 1981, was a breakthrough 
text that featured Tom Floyd’s unique ability to present electronics clearly and pre-
cisely. As electronics evolved, Tom improved and updated this best-selling text through 
several editions, and it continued to be one of the most popular basic electronics books 
on the market. Although his health intervened with writing, Tom outlined changes he 
thought should be made to the text and asked me to implement his ideas in this new 
edition. I am honored for the opportunity and hope I succeeded in that endeavor.

In the years that have passed since the last edition of this classic text, there have been 
many changes in technology. Fundamental circuit laws and components remain the 
focus of the text but with updated instruments and methods including new computer 
simulations with both Multisim and LTSpice. One important change to this edition is 
illustrated steps for solving problems with simultaneous equations and complex math-
ematics using a graphing calculator. Graphing calculators have increased capabilities 
and are much more affordable, so are an important tool in basic electronics. The nu-
merous pedagogical features that have been hallmarks of this book have been retained 
and expanded. This includes practical application of basic concepts, basic trouble-
shooting, and use of instruments.
The entire text has been reviewed with an eye for improving and updating it. 
Every example has been reworked and checked. In that process, the full resolu-
tion of a calculator was kept until the end before final roundoff to three digits. 
This has improved round-off errors from previous editions. The entire text was 
also reviewed for improving readability and clarity, with many modifications. Our 
effort has been to continue the tradition of having the best introduction to basic 
electronics on the market.

Student Resources
Digital Resources (www.pearsonhighered.com/careersresources/) This section offers 
students an online study guide that they can check for conceptual understanding 
of key topics. Also available on the student resources website are multiple-choice, 
true/false, fill-in-the-blanks, and circuit analysis tests that can be used for additional 
reinforcement of your grasp of the topics in the textbook.
Circuit Simulations (www.pearsonhighered.com/careersresources/) These online 
files include simulation circuits in Multisim® 14 and LT Spice IV for selected ex-
amples, troubleshooting sections, and selected problems in the text. Circuit files 
with prefix E are example circuits and files with prefix P are problem circuits. 
These circuits were created for use with Multisim® or LT Spice software. These 
circuit simulation programs are widely regarded as excellent for classroom and 
laboratory learning.
MultiSIM and LTSpice odd answers are shown with the results that the simulations 
actually show, so they are not rounded off as are other answers.
In order to use the Multisim circuit files, you must have Multisim software installed 
on your computer. Multisim software is available at Ni.com/Multisim. Although 
the Multisim circuit files are intended to complement classroom, textbook, and 
laboratory study, these files are not essential to successfully using Principles of 
Electric Circuits, Tenth Edition.

INTRODUCTION
You have learned about the resistor and the capacitor. In this 
chapter, you will learn about a third type of basic passive 
component, the inductor, and study its characteristics.
The basic construction and electrical properties of induc-
tors are discussed, and the eﬀects of connecting them in 
series and in parallel are analyzed. How an inductor works in 
both dc and ac circuits is an important part of this coverage 
and forms the basis for the study of reactive circuits in terms 
of both frequency response and time response. You will also 
learn how to check for a faulty inductor.
The inductor, which is basically a coil of wire, is based 
on the principle of electromagnetic induction, which you 
studied in Chapter 10. Inductance is the property of a coil 
of wire that opposes a change in current. The basis for 
inductance is the electromagnetic ﬁeld that surrounds any 
conductor when there is current through it. The electrical 
component designed to have the property of inductance 
is called an inductor, coil, or in certain high-frequency 
applications a choke. All of these terms refer to the same 
type of device.

The Wheatstone bridge circuit 
was introduced in  Chapter 7 
and expanded in this chapter to include the use of Thevenin’s 
theorem. In Chapter 7, the circuit application used a thermistor in 
one arm of the bridge to sense temperature. The bridge was used 
to compare the resistance of the thermistor with the resistance of 
a rheostat, which set the temperature at which the output would 
switch from one polarity to the opposite for turning on a heater 
in a tank ﬁlled with a liquid. In this application activity, you will 
work with a similar circuit, but this time it will be used to monitor 
the temperature in the tank to provide a visual indication that the 
temperature is within a speciﬁed range.
The Temperature Monitor
The basic measuring circuit in the temperature monitor is 
a Wheatstone bridge with an ammeter and a series resis-
tor acting as the load. The meter is an analog panel meter 
with a sensitivity of 50 mA full scale. The Wheatstone bridge 
 temperature-measuring circuit is shown in Figure 8–69(a), 
and the meter panel is shown in Figure 8–69(b).
The Thermistor
The thermistor is the same one used in the circuit application of 
Chapter 7, speciﬁcally a Thermometrics RL2006-13.3K-140-D1 
thermistor with a speciﬁed resistance of 25 kΩ at 25°C and a 
b of 4615K. Recall that b  is a constant supplied by the manu-
facturer that indicates the shape of the  temperature-resistance 
characteristic. As given in Chapter 7, the exponential equation 
for the resistance of a thermistor is approximated by
RT = R0e
ba
T0 - T
T0T b
where:
RT =  the resistance at a given temperature
R0 =  the resistance at a reference temperature
T0 =   the reference temperature in K (typically  
298 K, which is 25°C)
Application Activity
 
T =  temperature (K)
b =  a constant (K) provided by the manufacturer
A plot of this equation was given previously in Figure 7–59. 
You can conﬁrm that your thermistor resistance calcula-
tions in this circuit application are in reasonable agreement 
with this plot.
If you have a graphing calculator such as the TI-84 Plus 
CE, you can easily reproduce the plot by entering the equation 
for it after pressing the 
y=  key. Figure 8–70 shows the plot 
on a TI-84 Plus CE calculator. The equation is shown at the 
top of the plot. R represents the resistance in ohms at the refer-
ence temperature (R0), T represents the reference temperature 
in K, and B represents b in K. Pressing the trace  button 
allows you to position the cursor along the graph to read val-
ues. Another way to see values is to press 
trace
2nd
, which 
brings up a table of values. The table limits and the increment 
between values is set in the 
2nd  window menu. The Table limits 
and increment were set to a start value of 298 and an incre-
ment of 5. Figure 8–71 shows the values with the resistance 
at 323 K selected. To simplify viewing temperature values in 
Celsius, a second equation is entered (Y2 = X - 273), which 
tabulated the temperature (in red) in Celsius.
Temperature Measuring Circuit
The Wheatstone bridge is designed to be balanced at 20°C. 
The resistance of the thermistor is approximately 32.6 kΩ 
at this temperature. You can conﬁrm this value by substi-
tuting the temperature (in Kelvin) into the equation for RT. 
Remember that the temperature in K is °C + 273.
1. Substituting into the equation for RT, calculate the 
resistance of the thermistor at a temperature of 50°C 
(full-scale deﬂection of the meter).
2. Thevenize the bridge between terminals A and B by keep-
ing the ground reference and forming two facing Thevenin 
circuits as was illustrated in Figure 8–44. Assume the

thermistor temperature is 50°C and its resistance is the 
value calculated previously. Draw the Thevenin circuit for 
this temperature but do not show a load.
3. Show the load resistor for the Thevenin circuit you drew. 
The load is a resistor in series with the ammeter, which 
will have a current of 50 mA at full scale (50°C). You can 
ﬁnd the value of the required load resistor by applying 
the superposition theorem to the two sources and calcu-
lating the total resistance from Ohm’s law (using the full-
scale deﬂection as the current). Subtract the Thevenin 
resistance of each arm from the total resistance to ob-
tain the required load resistance. Neglect the meter resis-
tance. Show the value calculated on the Thevenin circuit.
4. Calculate the thermistor resistance for the lower and 
upper limits of temperature (30°C and 40°C). Draw 
Thevenin circuits for each temperature and calculate the 
current through the load resistor.
The Meter Scale
A requirement for the temperature monitor is to mark 
three color bands on the meter to indicate that the temper-
ature is within the desired range. The desired range is be-
tween a low of 30°C and 40°C. The meter should indicate 
a too-cold range from 20°C to 30°C, a proper operating 
range from 30°C to 40°C, and a too-hot range from 40°C 
and 50°C. Full-scale deﬂection of the meter should be set 
for 50°C.
5. Indicate how you would mark the meter to have a 
quick visual indication of the temperature in the 
tank.
Review
6. At 35°C, what is the current in the meter?
7. What change is needed if a 100 mA meter is used 
 instead of a 50 mA meter?

Suggestions for Teaching with Principles of Electric Circuits
Selected Course Emphasis and Flexibility of the Text This textbook is designed 
primarily for use in a two-term course sequence in which dc topics (Chapters 1 
through 10) are covered in the first term and ac topics (Chapters 11 through 21) are 
covered in the second term. A one-term course covering dc and ac topics is possible 
but would require very selective and abbreviated coverage of many topics.
If time limitations or course emphasis restricts the topics that can be covered, as is 
usually the case, there are several options for selective coverage. The following sugges-
tions for light treatment or omission do not necessarily imply that a certain topic is less 
important than others but that, in the context of a specific program, the topic may not 
require the emphasis that the more fundamental topics do. Because course emphasis, 
level, and available time vary from one program to another, the omission or abbrevi-
ated treatment of selected topics must be made on an individual basis. Therefore, the 
following suggestions are intended only as a general guide.
1. Chapters that may be considered for omission or selective coverage:
◆
◆Chapter 8, Circuit Theorems and Conversions
◆
◆Chapter 9, Branch, Loop, and Node Analyses
◆
◆Chapter 10, Magnetism and Electromagnetism
◆
◆Chapter 18, Passive Filters
◆
◆Chapter 19, Circuit Theorems in AC Analysis
◆
◆Chapter 20, Time Response of Reactive Circuits
◆
◆Chapter 21, Three-Phase Systems in Power Applications
2. Application Activity features and troubleshooting sections can be omitted with-
out affecting other material.
3. Other specific topics may be omitted or covered lightly on a section-by-section 
basis at the discretion of the instructor. The order in which certain topics appear 
in the text can be altered at the instructor’s discretion. For example, the topics of 
capacitors and inductors (Chapters 12 and 13) can be covered at the end of the 
dc course in the first term by delaying coverage of the ac topics in Sections 12–6, 
12–7, 13–5, and 13–6 until the ac course in the second term. Another possibil-
ity is to cover Chapters 12 and 13 in the second term but cover Chapter 15 (RC 
Circuits) immediately after Chapter 12 (Capacitors) and cover Chapter 16 (RL 
Circuits) immediately after Chapter 13 (Inductors).
Application Activity These features are useful for motivation and for introducing 
applications of basic concepts and components. Suggestions for using these sections are:
◆
◆As an integral part of the chapter to illustrate how the concepts and compo-
nents can be applied in a practical situation. The activities can be assigned for 
homework.
◆
◆As extra credit assignments.
◆
◆As in-class activities to promote discussion and interaction and to help students 
understand why they need to know the material.
Coverage of Reactive Circuits Chapters 15 to 17 have been designed to provide two 
approaches to teaching these topics on reactive circuits.

x  ●  Preface
The first option is to cover the topics on the basis of components. That is, first 
cover all of Chapter 15 (RC Circuits), then all of Chapter 16 (RL Circuits), and,  
finally, all of Chapter 17 (RLC Circuits and Resonance).
The second option is to cover the topics on the basis of circuit type. That is, first 
cover all topics related to series reactive circuits, then all topics related to parallel reac-
tive circuits, and finally, all topics related to series-parallel reactive circuits. To facili-
tate this second approach, each of the chapters has been divided into the following 
parts: Part 1: Series Circuits, Part 2: Parallel Circuits, Part 3: Series-Parallel Circuits, 
and Part 4: Special Topics. So, for series reactive circuits, cover Part 1 of all three 
chapters in sequence. For parallel reactive circuits, cover Part 2 of all three chapters 
in sequence. For series-parallel reactive circuits, cover Part 3 of all three chapters in 
sequence. Finally, for special topics, cover Part 4 of all three chapters.
To the Student
Any career training requires effort, and the electrical/electronics field is no exception. 
The best way to learn new material is by reading, thinking, and doing. This text is de-
signed to help you along the way.
Read each section of the text carefully and think about what you have read. 
Sometimes you may need to read the section more than once. Work through each 
example problem step by step before you try the related problem that goes with the 
example. After each section, answer the checkup questions. Answers to the related 
problems and the section checkup questions are at the end of the chapter.
Review the chapter summary, the key term definitions, and the formula list. Take 
the True/False Quiz, the multiple-choice Self-Test, and the Circuit Dynamics Quiz. 
Check your answers against those at the end of the chapter. Finally, work the prob-
lems and verify your answers to the odd-numbered problems with those provided at 
the end of the book.
The importance of obtaining a thorough understanding of the basic principles 
contained in this text cannot be overemphasized. Most employers prefer to hire peo-
ple who have both a thorough grounding in the basics and the ability and eagerness 
to grasp new concepts and techniques. If you have a good training in the basics, an 
employer will train you in the specifics of the job to which you are assigned.
Careers in Electronics
The fields of electricity and electronics are very diverse, and career opportunities are 
available in many areas. There are many types of job classifications for which a person 
with training in electricity and electronics technology may qualify. A few of the most 
common job functions are discussed briefly in the following paragraph.
Service Shop Technician Technical personnel in this category are involved in the 
repair or adjustment of both commercial and consumer electronic equipment that is 
returned to the dealer or manufacturer for service. Specific areas include consumer 
electronics and computers. This area also offers opportunities for self-employment.
Industrial Manufacturing Technician Manufacturing personnel are involved in 
the testing of electrical and electronic products at the assembly-line level or in the 
maintenance and troubleshooting of electrical, electronic, and electromechanical 
systems used in the testing and manufacturing of products. Virtually every type of 
manufacturing plant, regardless of its product, uses automated equipment that is 
electronically controlled.
Laboratory Technician These technicians are involved in breadboarding, prototyp-
ing, and testing new or modified electronic systems in research and development 
laboratories. They generally work closely with engineers during the development 
phase of a product.

Preface  ●  xi
Field Service Technician Field service personnel service and repair electronic 
equipment—for example, computer systems, radar installations, automatic bank-
ing equipment, and security systems.
Engineering Assistant/Associate Engineer Personnel in this category work closely 
with engineers in the implementation of a concept and in the basic design and de-
velopment of electrical and electronic systems. Engineering assistants are frequently 
involved in a project from its initial design through the early manufacturing stages.
Technical Writer Technical writers compile technical information and then use 
the information to write and produce manuals and audiovisual materials. A broad 
knowledge of a particular system and the ability to clearly explain its principles 
and operation are essential.
Technical Sales Technically trained people are in demand as sales representatives 
for high-technology products. The ability both to understand technical concepts 
and to communicate the technical aspects of a product to a potential customer is 
very valuable. In this area, as in technical writing, competency in expressing your-
self orally and in writing is essential. Actually, being able to communicate well is 
very important in any technical job category because you must be able to record 
data clearly and explain procedures, conclusions, and actions taken so that others 
can readily understand what you are doing.
Milestones in Electronics
Let’s briefly look at some of the important developments that led to the electronics technol-
ogy we have today. The names of many of the early pioneers in electricity and electromag-
netics still live on in terms of familiar units and quantities. Names such as Ohm, Ampere, 
Volta, Faraday, Henry, Coulomb, Tesla, Gauss, and Hertz are some of the better known 
examples. More widely known names such as Franklin and Edison are also significant in 
the history of electricity and electronics because of their tremendous contributions. Short 
biographies of some of these pioneers are located throughout the text in History Notes.
The Beginning of Electronics Early experiments with electronics involved electric 
currents in vacuum tubes. Heinrich Geissler (1814–1879) removed most of the air 
from a glass tube and found that the tube glowed when there was current through it. 
Later, Sir William Crookes (1832–1919) found the current in vacuum tubes seemed to 
consist of particles. Thomas Edison (1847–1931) experimented with carbon filament 
bulbs with plates and discovered that there was a current from the hot filament to a 
positively charged plate. He patented the idea but never used it.
Other early experimenters measured the properties of the particles that flowed in 
vacuum tubes. Sir Joseph Thompson (1856–1940) measured properties of these par-
ticles, later called electrons.
Although wireless telegraphic communication dates back to 1844, electronics is 
basically a 20th century concept that began with the invention of the vacuum tube 
amplifier. An early vacuum tube that allowed current in only one direction was con-
structed by John A. Fleming in 1904. Called the Fleming valve, it was the forerunner 
of vacuum tube diodes. In 1907, Lee deForest added a grid to the vacuum tube. The 
new device, called the audiotron, could amplify a weak signal. By adding the control 
element, deForest ushered in the electronics revolution. It was with an improved ver-
sion of his device that made transcontinental telephone service and radios possible.  
In 1912, a radio amateur in San Jose, California, was regularly broadcasting music!
In 1921, the secretary of commerce, Herbert Hoover, issued the first license to a 
broadcast radio station; within two years over 600 licenses were issued. By the end of 
the 1920s radios were in many homes. A new type of radio, the superheterodyne radio, 
invented by Edwin Armstrong, solved problems with high-frequency communication. 
In 1923, Vladimir Zworykin, an American researcher, invented the first television 

xii  ●  Preface
picture tube, and in 1927 Philo T. Farnsworth applied for a patent for a complete 
television system.
The 1930s saw many developments in radio, including metal tubes, automatic gain 
control, “midget sets,” directional antennas, and more. Also started in this decade 
was the development of the first electronic computers. Modern computers trace their 
origins to the work of John Atanasoff at Iowa State University. Beginning in 1937, he 
envisioned a binary machine that could do complex mathematical work. By 1939, he 
and graduate student Clifford Berry had constructed a binary machine called ABC 
(for Atanasoff-Berry Computer) that used vacuum tubes for logic and condensers (ca-
pacitors) for memory. In 1939, the magnetron, a microwave oscillator, was invented in 
Britain by Henry Boot and John Randall. In the same year, the klystron microwave 
tube was invented in America by Russell and Sigurd Varian.
During World War II, electronics developed rapidly. Radar and very high- frequency 
communication were made possible by the magnetron and klystron. Cathode ray tubes 
were improved for use in radar. Computer work continued during the war. By 1946, 
John von Neumann had developed the first stored program computer, the Eniac, at 
the University of Pennsylvania. The decade ended with one of the most important 
inventions ever, the transistor.
Solid-State Electronics The crystal detectors used in early radios were the forerunners 
of modern solid-state devices. However, the era of solid-state electronics began with 
the invention of the transistor in 1947 at Bell Labs. The inventors were Walter Brattain, 
John Bardeen, and William Shockley. PC (printed circuit) boards were introduced in 
1947, the year the transistor was invented. Commercial manufacturing of transistors 
began in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in 1951.
The most important invention of the 1950s was the integrated circuit. On 
September 12, 1958, Jack Kilby, at Texas Instruments, made the first integrated cir-
cuit. This invention literally created the modern computer age and brought about 
sweeping changes in medicine, communication, manufacturing, and the entertainment 
industry. Many billions of “chips”—as integrated circuits came to be called—have 
since been manufactured.
The 1960s saw the space race begin and spurred work on miniaturization and com-
puters. The space race was the driving force behind the rapid changes in electronics 
that followed. The first successful “op-amp” was designed by Bob Widlar at Fairchild 
Semiconductor in 1965. Called the mA709, it was very successful but suffered from 
“latch-up” and other problems. Later, the most popular op-amp ever, the 741, was 
taking shape at Fairchild. This op-amp became the industry standard and influenced 
design of op-amps for years to come.
By 1971, a new company that had been formed by a group from Fairchild intro-
duced the first microprocessor. The company was Intel and the product was the 4004 
chip, which had the same processing power as the Eniac computer. Later in the same 
year, Intel announced the first 8-bit processor, the 8008. In 1975, the first personal 
computer was introduced by Altair, and Popular Science magazine featured it on the 
cover of the January, 1975, issue. The 1970s also saw the introduction of the pocket 
calculator and new developments in optical integrated circuits. An HP-65 programma-
ble hand-held calculator was taken into space in 1975 to provide backup calculations 
for course corrections for docking the Apollo-Soyuz rendezvous.
By the 1980s, half of all U.S. homes were using cable hookups instead of televi-
sion antennas. The reliability, speed, and miniaturization of electronics continued 
throughout the 1980s, including automated testing and calibrating of PC boards. The 
computer became a part of instrumentation and the virtual instrument was created. 
Computers became a standard tool on the workbench.
The 1990s saw a widespread application of the Internet. In 1993, there were 130 
websites, and now there are nearly 2 billion. Companies scrambled to establish a home 
page and many of the early developments of radio broadcasting had parallels with the 
Internet. In 1995, the FCC allocated spectrum space for a new service called Digital 

Preface  ●  xiii
Audio Radio Service. Digital television standards were adopted in 1996 by the FCC for 
the nation’s next generation of broadcast television. Kodak introduced the first digital 
camera in 1991 with a 1.3-megapixel sensor.
The 21st century dawned in January 2001 (although many people celebrated it a 
year earlier). One of the major technology stories of the first decade of the 21st cen-
tury was the continuous and explosive growth of the Internet. Wireless broadband 
access fueled the growth tremendously and saw new developments and standards for 
routers and wireless connectivity. The processing speed of computers continued to 
increase. Another advancement was in digital storage devices including improved op-
tical disc storage technologies such as Blu-ray for high-definition video storage. In 
2007, Steve Jobs of Apple Computer introduced one of the most significant develop-
ments of the first decade of the 21st century when he announced the Apple iPhone. In 
addition to the phone function, the first-generation iPhone featured Internet access, 
music application technology and a 2-megapixel camera plus other features. Smart 
phones, as they have come to be known, have become ubiquitous in the years since the 
iPhone’s introduction.
The second decade of the 21st century has seen continued growth and innova-
tion. New developments in electronics include printed electronics, polymer elec-
tronics, and organic electronics for creating both active and passive components. 
Printable electronics included both electronic and optical components, which has 
enabled products such as biomedical wristbands and curved OLED TVs. In addi-
tion, the continued quest to move to renewable energy has led to intensive research 
and development in the areas of batteries, solar cells, fuel cells, wind energy, and 
other technology.

units of MeasureMent
In the 19th century, the principal weight and measurement units dealt with 
 commerce. As technology advanced, scientists and engineers saw the need for 
 international standard measurement units. In 1875, at a conference called by  
the French, representatives from 18 nations signed a treaty that established inter-
national standards. Today, all engineering and scientific work use an improved 
 international system of units, Le Système International d’Unités, abbreviated SI*.
After completing this section, you should be able to

◆Discuss the SI standard
◆
◆Specify the base (fundamental) SI units
◆
◆Specify the supplementary units
◆
◆Explain what derived units are
*All bold terms are in the end-of-book glossary. The bold terms in color are key terms and are also defined at 
the end of the chapter.
Base and Derived Units
The SI system is based on seven base units (sometimes called fundamental units) and 
two supplementary units. All measurements can be expressed as some combination of 
base and supplementary units. Table 1–1 lists the base units, and Table 1–2 lists the 
supplementary units.
The base electrical unit, the ampere, is the unit for electrical current. Current is 
abbreviated with the letter I (for intensity) and uses the symbol A (for ampere). The 
ampere is unique in that it uses the base unit of time (t) in its definition (second). All 
other electrical and magnetic units (such as voltage, power, and magnetic flux) use 
various combinations of base units in their definitions and are called derived units.
For example, the derived unit of voltage, which is the volt (V), is defined in terms 
of base units as m2 # kg # s-3 # A- 1. As you can see, this combination of base units is 
very cumbersome and impractical. Therefore, the volt is used as the derived unit.

Units of Measurement  ●  3
Letter symbols are used to represent both quantities and their units. One symbol is 
used to represent the name of the quantity, and another symbol is used to represent 
the unit of measurement of that quantity. For example, italic P stands for power, and 
nonitalic W stands for watt, which is the unit of power. Another example is voltage, 
where the same letter stands for both the quantity and its unit. Italic V represents 
voltage and nonitalic V represents volt, which is the unit of voltage. As a rule, italic 
letters stand for the quantity and nonitalic (roman) letters represent the unit of that 
quantity.
Table 1–3 lists the most important electrical quantities, along with their derived 
SI units and symbols. Table 1–4 lists magnetic quantities, along with their derived SI 
units and symbols.

In addition to the common electrical units shown in Table 1–3, the SI system has 
many other units that are defined in terms of certain base units. In 1954, by interna-
tional agreement, meter, kilogram, second, ampere, degree Kelvin, and candela were 
adopted as the basic SI units (degree Kelvin was later changed to just kelvin). The 
mole (abbreviated mol) was added in 1971. Three base units form the basis of the mks 
(for meter-kilogram-second) units that are used for derived quantities in engineering 
and basic physics and have become the preferred units for nearly all scientific and 
engineering work. An older metric system, called the cgs system, was based on the 
centimeter, gram, and second as base units. There are still a number of units in com-
mon use based on the cgs system; for example, the gauss is a magnetic flux unit in the 
cgs system and is still in common usage. In keeping with preferred practice, this text 
uses mks units, except when otherwise noted.

SECTION 1–1
CHECKUP
Answers are at the end of the 
chapter.
1. How does a base unit differ from a derived unit?
2. What is the base electrical unit?
3. What does SI stand for?
4. Without referring to Table 1–3, list as many electrical quantities as possible, includ-
ing their symbols, units, and unit symbols.
5. Without referring to Table 1–4, list as many magnetic quantities as possible, includ-
ing their symbols, units, and unit symbols.
Scientific notation provides a convenient method to represent large and small 
numbers and to perform calculations involving such numbers. In scientific notation, 
a quantity is expressed as a product of a number between 1 and 10 and a power of 
ten. For example, the quantity 150,000 is expressed in scientific notation as 1.5 * 105, 
and the quantity 0.00022 is expressed as 2.2 * 10-4.
Powers of Ten
Table 1–5 lists some powers of ten, both positive and negative, and the corresponding 
decimal numbers. The power of ten is expressed as an exponent of the base 10 in each 
case (10x). An exponent is a number to which a base number is raised. It indicates the 
number of places that the decimal point is moved to the right or left to produce the

scientific notation
In electrical and electronics fields, both very small and very large quantities are 
commonly used. For example, it is common to have electrical current values of 
only a few thousandths or even a few millionths of an ampere and to have resis-
tance values ranging up to several thousand or several million ohms.

engineering notation and Metric Prefixes
Engineering notation, a specialized form of scientific notation, is used widely in 
technical fields to represent large and small quantities. In electronics, engineering 
notation is used to represent values of voltage, current, power, resistance, capaci-
tance, inductance, and time, to name a few. Metric prefixes are used in conjunc-
tion with engineering notation as a “short hand” for the certain powers of ten that 
are multiples of three.

Engineering Notation
Engineering notation is similar to scientific notation. However, in engineering 
 notation a number can have from one to three digits to the left of the decimal point 
and the power-of-ten exponent must be a multiple of three. For example, the number 
33,000 expressed in engineering notation is 33 * 103. In scientific notation, it is ex-
pressed as 3.3 * 104. As another example, the number 0.045 expressed in engineering 
notation is 45 * 10-3. In scientific notation, it is expressed as 4.5 * 10-2.
Express the following numbers in engineering notation:
(a) 82,000 
(b) 243,000 
(c) 1,956,000
 
Solution 
In engineering notation,

(b) 243,000 is expressed as 243 : 103.
(c) 1,956,000 is expressed as 1.956 : 106.

EXAMPLE 1–9
Metric Prefixes
A metric prefix is an affix that precedes a measured quantity and represents a mul-
tiple or power of 10 multiple of the quantity. In engineering notation metric prefixes 
represent each of the most commonly used powers of ten in electronics and electrical 
work. The most commonly used metric prefixes are listed in Table 1–6 with their sym-
bols and corresponding powers of ten.
Metric prefixes are used only with numbers that have a unit of measure, such as 
volts, amperes, and ohms, and precede the unit symbol. For example, 0.025 amperes 
can be expressed in engineering notation as 25 * 10-3 A. This quantity expressed 
using a metric prefix is 25 mA, which is read 25 milliamps. Note that the metric prefix 
milli has replaced 10-3. As another example, 10,000,000 ohms can be expressed as 
10 * 106 Ω. This quantity expressed using a metric prefix is 10 MΩ, which is read  
10 megohms. The metric prefix mega has replaced 106.

Calculator Tip
All scientific and graphing calculators provide features for entering and displaying 
numbers in various formats. Scientific and engineering notation are special cases of 
exponential (power of ten) notation. Most calculators have a key labeled EE (or EXP) 
that is used to enter the exponent of numbers. To enter a number in exponential nota-
tion, enter the base number first, including the sign, and then press the EE key, fol-
lowed by the exponent, including the sign.
Scientific and graphing calculators have displays for showing the power of ten. 
Some calculators display the exponent as a small raised number on the right side of 
the display.
47.0 03
Other calculators display the number with a small E followed by the exponent.
47.0E03
Notice that the base 10 is not generally shown, but it is implied or represented by the E. 
When you write out the number, you need to include the base 10. The displayed num-
ber shown above is written out as 47.0 * 103 in engineering notation.
Some calculators are placed in the scientific or engineering notation mode using 
a secondary or tertiary function, such as SCI or ENG. Then numbers are entered in 
regular decimal form. The calculator automatically converts them to the proper for-
mat. Other calculators provide for mode selection using a menu.
Always check the owner’s manual for your particular calculator to determine how 
to use the exponential notation features.

Metric unit conversions
It is sometimes necessary or convenient to convert a quantity from one unit with a met-
ric prefix to another, such as from milliamperes (mA) to microamperes (mA). Moving 
the decimal point in the number an appropriate number of places to the left or to the 
right, depending on the particular conversion, results in a metric unit conversion.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆
◆Convert from one unit with a metric prefix to another
◆
◆Convert between milli, micro, nano, and pico
◆
◆Convert between kilo and mega
The following rules apply to metric unit conversions:
1. When converting from a larger unit to a smaller unit, move the decimal point 
to the right.
2. When converting from a smaller unit to a larger unit, move the decimal point to 
the left.
3. Determine the number of places to move the decimal point by finding the dif-
ference in the powers of ten of the units being converted.
For example, when converting from milliamperes (mA) to microamperes (mA), move 
the decimal point three places to the right because there is a three-place difference 
between the two units (mA is 10-3 A and mA is 10-6 A). Notice that when the unit is 
made smaller, the number is made larger by a corresponding amount and vice versa. 
The following examples  illustrate a few conversions.
Convert 0.15 milliampere (0.15 mA) to microamperes (mA).
 
Solution 
Move the decimal point three places to the right.

Measured nuMbers
Whenever a quantity is measured, there is uncertainty in the result due to limita-
tions of the instruments used. When a measured quantity contains approximate 
numbers, the digits known to be correct are called significant digits. When report-
ing measured quantities, the number of digits that should be retained are the sig-
nificant digits and no more than one uncertain digit.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆
◆Express measured data with the proper number of significant digits
◆
◆Define accuracy, error, and precision
◆
◆Round numbers properly
Error, Accuracy, and Precision
Data taken in experiments are not perfect because the accuracy of the data depends on 
the accuracy of the test equipment and the conditions under which the measurement was 
made. In order to properly report measured data, the error associated with the measure-
ment should be taken into account. Experimental error should not be thought of as a 
 mistake. All measurements that do not involve counting are approximations of the true 
value. The difference between the true or best-accepted value of some quantity and the 
measured value is the error. A measurement is said to be accurate if the error is small. 
Accuracy is an indication of the range of error in a measurement. It is a measure of how 
well a given measurement agrees with a standard. For example, if you measure thickness 
of a 10.00 mm gauge block with a micrometer and find that it is 10.8 mm, the reading is 
not accurate because a gauge block is considered to be a working standard. If you measure 
10.02 mm, the reading is accurate because it is in reasonable agreement with the standard.
Another term associated with the quality of a measurement is precision. Precision is 
a measure of the repeatability (or consistency) of a measurement of some quantity. It is 
possible to have a precise measurement in which a series of readings are not scattered, 
but each measurement is inaccurate because of an instrument error. For example, a 
meter may be out of calibration and produce inaccurate but consistent (precise) results. 
However, it is not possible to have an accurate instrument unless it is also precise.
Significant Digits
The digits in a measured number that are known to be correct are called significant  digits. 
Most measuring instruments show the proper number of significant digits, but some 
instruments can show digits that are not significant, leaving it to the user to determine 
what should be reported. This may occur because of an effect called loading. A meter can 
change the actual reading in a circuit by its very presence. It is important to recognize when 
a reading may be inaccurate; you should not report digits that are known to be inaccurate.
Another problem with significant digits occurs when you perform mathematical 
operations with numbers. The number of significant digits should never exceed the 
number in the original measurement. For example, if 1.0 V is divided by 3.0 Ω, a cal-
culator will show 0.33333333. Since the original numbers each contain two significant 
digits, the answer should be reported as 0.33 A, the same number of significant digits.
The rules for determining if a reported digit is significant are
1. Nonzero digits are always considered to be significant.
2. Zeros to the left of the first nonzero digit are never significant.
3. Zeros between nonzero digits are always significant.
4. Zeros to the right of the decimal point for a decimal number are significant.

Measured Numbers  ●  13
5. Zeros to the left of the decimal point with a whole number may or may not be 
significant depending on the measurement. For example, the number 12,100 Ω 
can have three, four, or five significant digits. To clarify the significant digits, 
scientific notation (or a metric prefix) should be used. For example, 12.10 kΩ 
has four significant digits.
When a measured value is reported, one uncertain digit may be retained but other 
uncertain digits should be discarded. To find the number of significant digits in a 
number, ignore the decimal point, and count the number of digits from left to right 
starting with the first nonzero digit and ending with the last digit to the right. All of 
the digits counted are significant except zeros to the right end of the number, which 
may or may not be significant. In the absence of other information, the significance of 
the right-hand zeros is uncertain. Generally, zeros that are placeholders, and not part 
of a measurement, are not significant. To avoid confusion, numbers should be shown 
using scientific or engineering notation if it is necessary to show the significant zeros.
Express the measured number 4,300 with two, three, and four significant digits.
 
Solution 
Zeros to the right of the decimal point in a decimal number are significant. There-
fore, to show two significant digits, write
4.3 * 103
To show three significant digits, write
4.30 * 103
To show four significant digits, write
4.300 * 103

(c) 1.20 * 105 has three significant digits; see rule 4.
(d) 120,000 has at least two significant digits. Although the number has the same 
value as in (c), zeros in this example are uncertain; see rule 5. This is not a rec-
ommended method for reporting a measured quantity; use scientific notation 
or a metric prefix in this case. See Example 1–18.

EXAMPLE 1–19
Rounding Off Numbers
Since they always contain approximate numbers, measurements should be shown only 
with those digits that are significant plus no more than one uncertain digit. The num-
ber of digits shown is indicative of the precision of the measurement. For this reason, 

14  ●  Quantities and Units
you should round off a number by dropping one or more digits to the right of the last 
significant digit. Use only the most significant dropped digit to decide how to round 
off. The rules for rounding off are
1. If the most significant digit dropped is greater than 5 or a 5 is followed by any 
nonzero digits, increase the last retained digit by 1.
2. If the most significant digit dropped is less than 5, do not change the last re-
tained digit.
3. If the most significant digit dropped is 5 and there are no following nonzero 
digits, increase the last retained digit by 1 if it makes the number even. If it 
makes the number odd, do not change the retained digit. This is called the 
“round-to-even” rule.
Round off the following numbers to three significant digits:
(a) 10.071 
(b) 29.961 
(c) 6.3948 
(d) 123.52 
(e) 122.5

EXAMPLE 1–20
In most electrical and electronics work, components have tolerances greater than 
1% (5% and 10% are common). Most measuring instruments have accuracy specifica-
tions better than this, but it is unusual for measurements to be made with higher ac-
curacy than one part in 1,000. For this reason, three significant digits are appropriate 
for numbers that represent measured quantities in all but the most exacting work. If 
you are working with a problem with several intermediate results, keep all digits in 
your calculator, but round the answers to three when reporting a result.

SUMMARY
◆
●SI is an abbreviation for Le Système International d’Unités and is a standardized system of units.
◆
●A base unit is an SI unit from which other SI units are derived. There are seven base units 
and two supplementary units.
◆
●Scientific notation is a method for representing very large and very small numbers as a num-
ber between one and ten (one digit to left of decimal point) times a power of ten.
◆
●Engineering notation is a modified form of scientific notation in which quantities are repre-
sented with one, two, or three digits to the left of the decimal point times a power of ten that 
is a multiple of three.

◆
●Metric prefixes represent powers of ten in numbers. In electronics work, prefixes represent 
powers of ten expressed in engineering notation.
◆
●The uncertainty of a measured quantity depends on the accuracy and precision of the mea-
surement.
◆
●The number of significant digits in the result of a mathematical operation should never ex-
ceed the significant digits in the original numbers.

APPLICATION ACTIVITY PREVIEW
In this application activity, you will see how the theory 
presented in this chapter is applied to a practical circuit that 
simulates part of a car’s instrument panel lighting system. 
An automobile’s lights are examples of simple types of elec-
tric circuits. When you turn on the headlights and taillights, 
you are connecting the lamps to the battery, which provides 
the voltage and produces current through each lamp. The 
current causes the lamps to emit light. The lamps themselves 
have resistance that limits the amount of current. The instru-
ment panel lamp in most cars can be adjusted for bright-
ness. By turning a knob, you change the resistance in the 
circuit, thereby causing the current to change. The amount 
of current through the lamp determines its brightness.

INTRODUCTION
The theoretical concepts of electrical current, voltage, and re-
sistance are introduced in this chapter. You will learn how to 
express each of these quantities in the proper units and how 
each quantity is measured. The essential elements that form a 
basic electric circuit and how they are put together are covered.
Types of devices that generate voltage and current are in-
troduced. Also, you will see a variety of components that are 
used to introduce resistance into electric circuits. The opera-
tion of protective devices such as fuses and circuit breakers 
are discussed, and mechanical switches commonly used in 
electric circuits are introduced. You will learn how to control 
and measure voltage, current, and resistance using labora-
tory instruments.
Voltage is essential in any kind of electric circuit. Voltage 
is the potential energy of electrical charge required to 
make the circuit work. Current is also necessary for elec-
tric circuits to operate, but it takes voltage to produce the 
current. Current is the movement of electrons through a 
circuit. Resistance in a circuit limits the amount of cur-
rent. A water system can be used as an analogy for a simple 
circuit. Voltage can be considered analogous to the pres-
sure required to force water through the pipes. Current 
through wires can be thought of as analogous to the water 
moving through the pipes. Resistance can be thought of as 
analogous to the restriction on the water flow produced by 
 adjusting a valve.

22  ●  Voltage, Current, and Resistance
An atom is the smallest particle of an element that retains the characteristics of that 
element. An element is a substance that cannot be broken down into a simpler sub-
stance by chemical means. The number of known elements is now 118, although only 
94 of these occur naturally. Each of these known elements has atoms that are different 
from the atoms of all other elements. This gives each element a unique atomic struc-
ture. According to the classic Bohr model, an atom is visualized as having a planetary 
type of structure that consists of a central nucleus surrounded by orbiting electrons, 
as illustrated in Figure 2–1. The nucleus consists of positively charged particles called 
protons and uncharged particles called neutrons. The basic particles of negative charge 
are called electrons, which orbit the nucleus. The positive charge on a proton and the 
negative charge on an electron are the smallest charges that can exist in isolation.
All matter is made of atoms; and all atoms consist of electrons, protons, and neu-
trons. In this section, you will learn about the structure of an atom, including elec-
tron shells and orbits, valence electrons, ions, and energy levels. The configuration 
of certain electrons in an atom is the key factor in determining how well a given 
conductive or semiconductive material conducts electric current.
After completing this section, you should be able to

▲FIGURE 2–1
The Bohr model of an atom showing electrons in circular orbits around the nucleus. The “tails” on 
the electrons indicate they are in motion.
Niels Bohr was a  Danish physicist 
that is best known for his planetary 
model of the structure of the atom, 
which he first described in a 1913 
paper. His atomic model with some 
modifications still stands as a 
useful tool to explain chemical and 
physical properties of the elements. 
Bohr received the Nobel Prize in 
1922 and later element 107 was 
named in his honor (Bohrium, Bh).

Atomic Structure  ●  23
Each type of atom has a certain number of protons that distinguishes it from the 
atoms of all other elements. For example, the simplest atom is that of hydrogen, 
which has one proton and one electron, as pictured in Figure 2–2(a). As another ex-
ample, the helium atom, shown in Figure 2–2(b), has two protons and two neutrons 
in the nucleus and two electrons orbiting the nucleus.

Atomic Number
All elements are arranged in the periodic table of the elements in order according to 
their atomic number. The atomic number equals the number of protons in the nucleus. 
For example, hydrogen has an atomic number of 1 and helium has an atomic number 
of 2. In their normal (or neutral) state, all atoms of a given element have the same 
number of electrons as protons; the positive charges cancel the negative charges, and 
the atom has a net charge of zero, making it electrically balanced.
Shells, Orbits, and Energy Levels
As you have seen in the Bohr model, electrons orbit the nucleus of an atom at certain 
distances from the nucleus and are restricted to these specific orbits. Each orbit cor-
responds to a different energy level within the atom known as a shell. The shells are 
designated 1, 2, 3, and so on, with 1 being closest to the nucleus. Electrons further 
from the nucleus are at higher energy levels.
The line spectrums of hydrogen from the Bohr model of the atom shows that 
the electrons can only absorb or emit a specific amount of energy that represents 
the exact difference between the levels. Figure 2–3 shows the energy levels within the

hydrogen atom. The lowest level (n = 1) is called the ground state and represents the 
most stable atom with a single electron in the first shell. If this electron acquires a spe-
cific amount of energy by absorbing a photon, it can be raised to one of the higher en-
ergy levels. In this higher state, it can emit a photon with exactly the same energy and 
return to the ground state. Transitions between the levels account for various phe-
nomena we see in electronics, such as the color of light from a light-emitting diode.
After Bohr’s work, Erwin Schroedinger (1887–1961) proposed a mathematical 
theory for the atom that explained more complicated atoms. He suggested that the 
electron has a wavelike property, and he considered the simplest case as having a 
three-dimensional standing wave pattern due to vibrations. Schroedinger theorized 
the standing wave of an electron with a spherical shape could have only certain wave-
lengths. This wave-mechanics model of the atom gave the same equation for the elec-
tron energy in hydrogen as Bohr’s model, but in the wave-mechanics model, more 
complicated atoms could be explained by involving shapes other than spheres and 
adding a designation for the orientation of a given shape within the atom. In both 
models, electrons near the nucleus have less energy than those further out, which was 
the basic concept of the energy levels.
The idea of discrete energy levels within the atom is still a foundation for under-
standing the atom, and the wave-mechanics model has been very successful at predict-
ing the energy levels for various atoms. The wave-mechanics model of the atom used 
the shell number, called the principal quantum number, in the energy equation. Three 
other quantum numbers describe each electron within the atom. All electrons in an 
atom have a unique set of quantum numbers.
When an atom is part of a large group, as in a crystal, the discrete energy levels 
broaden into energy bands, which is an important idea in solid-state electronics. The 
bands also differentiate between conductors, semiconductors, and insulators.
Valence Electrons
Electrons that are in orbits farther from the nucleus have higher energy and are less tightly 
bound to the atom than those closer to the nucleus. This is because the force of attraction 
between the positively charged nucleus and the negatively charged electron decreases with 
increasing distance from the nucleus. Electrons with the highest energy levels exist in the 
outermost shell of an atom and are relatively loosely bound to the atom. This outermost 
shell is known as the valence shell, and electrons in this shell are called valence electrons. 
These valence electrons contribute to chemical reactions and bonding within the structure 
of a material, and they determine the material’s electrical properties.
Energy Levels and Ionization Energy
If an electron absorbs a photon with sufficient energy, it escapes from the atom and be-
comes a free electron that can move under the influence of an electric or magnetic field. 
This is indicated by the ionization energy level in Figure 2–3. Any time an atom or group 
of atoms is left with a net charge, it is called an ion. When an electron escapes from the 
neutral hydrogen atom (designated H), the atom is left with a net positive charge and 
becomes a positive ion (designated H+). In other cases, an atom or group of atoms can 
acquire one or more extra electrons, in which case it is called a negative ion.
The Copper Atom
Copper is the most commonly used metal in electrical applications. The copper atom has 
29 electrons that orbit the nucleus in four shells. The number of electrons in each shell fol-
lows a predictable pattern according to the formula, 2N2, where N is the number of the 
shell. The first shell of any atom can have up to two electrons, the second shell up to eight 
electrons, the third shell up to 18 electrons, and the fourth shell up to 32 electrons.
A copper atom is represented in Figure 2–4. Notice that the fourth or outermost shell, 
the valence shell, has only one valence electron. The inner shells are called the core. When 
the valence electron in the outer shell of the copper atom gains sufficient thermal energy, 

Atomic Structure  ●  25
it can break away from the parent atom and become a free electron. In a piece of copper 
at room temperature, a “sea” of these free electrons is present. These electrons are not 
bound to a given atom but are free to move in the copper material. Free electrons make 
copper an excellent conductor and make electrical current possible.
Categories of Materials
Three categories of materials are used in electronics: conductors, semiconductors, and 
insulators.
Conductors Conductors are materials that readily allow current. They have a large 
number of free electrons and are characterized by one to three valence electrons in their 
structure. Most metals are good conductors. Silver is the best conductor, and copper 
is next. Copper is the most widely used conductive material because it is less expensive 
than silver. Copper wire is commonly used as a conductor in electric circuits.
Semiconductors Semiconductors are classed below the conductors in their abil-
ity to carry current because they have fewer free electrons than do conductors. 
Semiconductors have four valence electrons in their atomic structures. However, be-
cause of their unique characteristics, certain semiconductor materials are the basis 
for electronic devices such as the diode, transistor, and integrated circuit. Silicon and 
germanium are common semiconductive materials.
Insulators Insulators are nonmetallic materials that are poor conductors of electric 
current; they are used to prevent current where it is not wanted. Insulators have no free 
electrons in their structure. The valence electrons are bound to the nucleus and not con-
sidered “free.” Most practical insulators used in electrical and electronic applications 
are compounds such as glass, porcelain, teflon, and polyethylene, to name a few.

26  ●  Voltage, Current, and Resistance
The charge of an electron and that of a proton are equal in magnitude but opposite 
in polarity. Electrical charge is an electrical property of matter that exists because of an 
excess or deficiency of electrons. Charge is symbolized by the letter Q. Static electricity 
is the presence of a net positive or negative charge in a material. Everyone has experi-
enced the effects of static electricity from time to time, for example, when attempting to 
touch a metal surface or another person or when the clothes in a dryer cling together.
As suggested originally by Michael Faraday, there is an electric field surrounding 
every charge that is directed radially away from the charge. Any other charge that enters 
the region will experience a force due to the presence of the field created by this charge. 
It is the electric field that exerts the force on another charge. Likewise, the second charge 
has its own field that exerts a force on the first change. Physicists define the electric field 
at some point as the force exerted on a test charge at the point divided by the charge. 
The electric field is a vector quantity; this means it has a direction and magnitude.
Materials with charges of opposite polarity are attracted to each other, and materials 
with charges of the same polarity are repelled, as indicated in Figure 2–5. A force acts 
between charges, as evidenced by the attraction or repulsion. In the case of oppositely 
charged plates, there will be an electric field between the plates due to all of the charges 
present. This electric field is represented by arrows drawn from the positive plate to the 
negative plate. This field exerts a force on all of the charges as illustrated by Figure 2–6.

As you know, an electron is the smallest particle that exhibits negative electrical charge. 
When an excess of electrons exists in a material, there is a net negative electrical 
charge. When a deficiency of electrons exists, there is a net positive electrical charge.

Coulomb’s law states
A force (F ) exists between two point-source charges (Q1, Q2) that is directly propor-
tional to the product of the two charges and inversely proportional to the square of the 
distance (d ) between the charges.
Coulomb, a Frenchman, spent many 
years as a military engineer. When 
bad health forced him to retire, 
he devoted his time to scientific 
 research. He is best known for his 
work on electricity and magnetism 
due to his development of the inverse 
square law for the force  between 
two charges. The unit of electrical  
charge is named in his honor.

Coulomb: The Unit of Charge
Electrical charge (Q) is measured in coulombs, symbolized by C.
One coulomb is the total charge possessed by 6.25 : 1018 electrons.
A coulomb is a very large amount of charge. A single electron has a charge of only 
1.6 * 10-19 C. The total charge Q, expressed in coulombs, for a given number of elec-
trons is stated in the following formula:

Positive and Negative Charge
Consider a neutral atom—that is, one that has the same number of electrons and pro-
tons and thus has no net charge. As you know, when a valence electron is pulled away 
from the atom by the application of energy, the atom is left with a net positive charge 
(more protons than electrons) and becomes a positive ion. If an atom acquires an extra 
electron in its outer shell, it has a net negative charge and becomes a negative ion.
The amount of energy required to free a valence electron is related to the number of elec-
trons in the outer shell. An atom can have up to eight valence electrons. The more complete 
the outer shell, the more stable the atom and thus the more energy is required to remove an 
electron. Figure 2–7 illustrates the creation of a positive ion and a negative ion when a hydro-
gen atom gives up its single valence electron to a chlorine atom, forming gaseous hydrogen 
chloride (HCl). When the gaseous HCl is dissolved in water, hydrochloric acid is formed.

voltage
As you have seen, a force of attraction exists between a positive and a negative 
charge. A certain amount of energy must be exerted, in the form of work, to 
overcome the force and move the charges a given distance apart. All opposite 
charges possess a certain potential energy because of the separation between 
them. The difference in potential energy per charge is the potential difference or 
voltage. Voltage is the driving force, sometimes called electromotive force or emf, 
in electric circuits and is what establishes current.

where V is voltage in volts (V), W is energy in joules (J), and Q is charge in coulombs

this text.
As an analogy, consider a water tank that is supported several feet above the 
ground. A given amount of energy must be exerted in the form of work to pump 
water up to fill the tank. Once the water is stored in the tank, it has a certain potential 
energy which, if released, can be used to perform work.

to generate static electricity and he 
also discovered methane gas. Volta 
investigated reactions between 
dissimilar metals and developed 
the first battery in 1800. Electrical 
potential, more commonly known 
as voltage, and the unit of voltage, 
the volt, are named in his honor.

Voltage  ●  29
The Voltage Source
A voltage source provides electrical energy or electromotive force (emf), more com-
monly known as voltage. Voltage can be produced by means of chemical energy, light 
energy, or magnetic energy combined with mechanical motion.
The Ideal Voltage Source An ideal voltage source can provide a constant voltage 
for any current required by a circuit. The ideal voltage source does not exist but can 
be closely approximated in practice. For purposes of analysis the ideal source is as-
sumed unless otherwise specified.
Voltage sources can be either dc or ac. A common symbol for a dc voltage source 
is shown in Figure 2–8(a) and one for an ac voltage source is shown in part (b). AC 
voltage sources will be used later in the book.
A graph showing voltage versus current for an ideal dc voltage source is illustrated 
in Figure 2–9. As you can see, the voltage is constant for any current (within limits) 
from the source. For a practical voltage source connected in a circuit, the voltage de-
creases slightly as the current increases, as shown by the dashed curve. Current is al-
ways drawn from a voltage source when a load such as a resistance is connected to it.
Types of DC Voltage Sources
Batteries A battery is a type of voltage source that converts chemical energy directly 
into electrical energy. As you know, work (or energy) per charge is the basic unit for 
voltage, and a battery adds energy to each unit of charge. It is something of a misno-
mer to talk about “charging a battery” because a battery does not store charge but 
rather stores chemical potential energy. All batteries use a specific type of chemical 
reaction called an oxidation-reduction reaction. In this type of reaction, electrons are 
transferred from one reactant to the other. If the chemicals used in the reaction are 
separated, it is possible to cause the electrons to travel in the external circuit, creating 
current. There is an equal current internally in the battery that is composed of moving 
ions. Ions move through the conductive solution in the battery (the electrolyte). As 
long as there is an external path for the electrons, the reaction can proceed, and stored 
chemical energy is converted to electrical current. If the path is broken, the reaction 
stops and the battery is said to be in equilibrium. In a battery, the terminal that sup-
plies electrons has a surplus of electrons and is the negative electrode or anode. The 
electrode that acquires electrons has a positive potential and is the cathode.

30  ●  Voltage, Current, and Resistance
Figure 2–10 shows a nonrechargeable single-cell copper-zinc battery that we will use 
for illustration of battery operation. The copper-zinc cell is simple to construct and illus-
trates concepts common to all nonrechargeable batteries. A zinc electrode and a copper 
electrode are immersed in solutions of zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) and copper sulfate (CuSO4), 
which are separated by a salt bridge that prevents the Cu2+ ions from reacting directly 
with the Zn metal. The zinc metal electrode supplies Zn2+ ions to the solution and elec-
trons to the external circuit, so this electrode is constantly eaten away as the reaction 
proceeds. The salt bridge allows ions to pass through it to maintain charge balance in 
the cell. There are no free electrons in the solutions, so an external path for electrons is 
provided through an ammeter (in our case) or other load. On the cathode side, the elec-
trons that were given up by the zinc combine with copper ions from the solution to form 
copper metal, which deposits on the copper electrode. The chemical reactions (shown in 
the diagram) occur at the electrode. Different types of batteries have different reactions, 
but all involve transfer of electrons in the external circuit.
A single cell will have a certain fixed voltage. In the copper-zinc cell, the voltage is 
1.1 V. In a lead-acid cell, the kind used in car batteries, a potential difference of about 
2.1 V is between the anode and cathode. The voltage of any cell depends on the cell 
chemistry. Nickel-cadmium cells are about 1.2 V and lithium cells can be as high as 
almost 4 V. Cell chemistry also determines the shelf life and discharge characteristics 
for a battery. For example, a lithium-MnO2 battery typically has five times the shelf 
life of a comparable carbon-zinc battery.
Although the voltage of a battery cell is fixed by its chemistry, the capacity is vari-
able and depends on the quantity of materials in the cell. Essentially, the capacity of 
a cell is the number of electrons that can be obtained from it and is measured by the 
amount of current that can be supplied over time.
Batteries normally consist of multiple cells that are electrically connected together in-
ternally. The way that the cells are connected and the type of cells determine the voltage 
and current capacity of the battery. If the positive electrode of one cell is connected to the 
negative electrode of the next and so on, as illustrated in Figure 2–11(a), the battery volt-
age is the sum of the individual cell voltages. This is called a series connection. To increase 
battery current capacity, the positive electrodes of several cells are connected together and 
all the negative electrodes are connected together, as illustrated in Figure 2–11(b). This 
is called a parallel connection. Also, by using larger cells, which have a greater quantity 
of material, the ability to supply current can be increased but the voltage is not affected.

Lead-acid batteries can be dan-
gerous because sulfuric acid is 
highly corrosive and battery gases 
(primarily hydrogen) are explosive. 
The acid in the battery can cause 
serious eye damage if it contacts 
the eye and can cause skin burns 
or destroy clothing. You should 
always wear eye protection when 
working on or around batteries and 
wash well after handling batteries.
When removing a battery from 
service, make sure the switch is 
off. When a cable is removed, a 
spark may be created and ignite 
the explosive battery gases.
T E C H  N O T E
To store a lead-acid battery for an 
extended period, it should be fully 
charged and placed in a cool, dry 
location that is protected from freez-
ing or excessive heat. A battery will 
self-discharge over time, so it needs 
to be periodically checked and 
recharged when it is less than 70% 
fully charged. Battery manufactur-
ers will have specific recommenda-
tions for storage on their websites.

Batteries are divided into two major classes, primary and secondary. Primary 
batteries are used once and discarded because their chemical reactions are irrevers-
ible. Secondary batteries can be recharged and reused many times because they are 
characterized by reversible chemical reactions.
Primary and secondary batteries are available in a variety of shapes and sizes. Some 
of the sizes that you are most familiar with are AAA, AA, C, D, and 9 V but there are 
many others that are less common. Batteries are also typed according to their chemical 
makeup. A few common types of primary and secondary batteries are listed below.
◆
◆Alkaline-MnO2 This is a primary battery that is commonly used in palm-type 
computers, photographic equipment, toys, radios, and recorders.
◆
◆Carbon-zinc This is a primary battery used in flashlights and small appliances.
◆
◆Lead-acid This is a secondary (rechargeable) battery that is commonly used in 
automotive, marine, and other similar applications.
◆
◆Lithium-ion This is a secondary battery that is commonly used in all types of 
portable electronics. This type of battery is increasingly being used in defense, 
aerospace, and automotive applications.
◆
◆Lithium-MnO2 This is a primary battery that is commonly used in photo-
graphic and electronic equipment, smoke alarms, personal organizers, memory 
backup, and communications equipment.
◆
◆Nickel-metal hydride This is a secondary (rechargeable) battery that is com-
monly used in portable computers, cell phones, camcorders, and other portable 
consumer electronics.
◆
◆Silver oxide This is a primary battery that is commonly used in watches, pho-
tographic equipment, hearing aids, and electronics requiring high-capacity 
batteries.
◆
◆Zinc air This is a primary battery that is commonly used in hearing aids, medi-
cal monitoring instruments, pagers, and other frequency-use applications.
Fuel Cells A fuel cell is a device that converts electrochemical energy into dc voltage 
directly. Fuel cells combine a fuel (usually hydrogen) with an oxidizing agent (usually 
oxygen). In the hydrogen fuel cell, hydrogen and oxygen react to form water, which 
is the only by-product. The process is clean, quiet, and more efficient than burning. 
Fuel cells and batteries are similar in that they both are electrochemical devices that 
produce electricity using an oxidation-reduction reaction. However, a battery is a 
closed system with all its chemicals stored inside, whereas in a fuel cell, the chemicals 
(hydrogen and oxygen) constantly flow into the cell where they combine and produce 
electricity.
Hydrogen fuel cells are usually classified by their operating temperature and the 
type of electrolyte they use. Some types work well for use in stationary power genera-
tion plants. Others may be useful for small portable applications or for powering cars. 
For example, the type that holds the most promise for automotive applications is the

polymer exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), which is a type of hydrogen fuel 
cell. A simplified diagram is shown in Figure 2–12 to illustrate the basic operation.
The channels disperse pressurized hydrogen gas and oxygen gas equally over the 
surface of the catalyst, which facilitates the reaction of the hydrogen and oxygen. 
When an H2 molecule comes in contact with the platinum catalyst on the anode side 
of the fuel cell, it splits into two H+ ions and two electrons (e-). The hydrogen ions 
are passed through the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) onto the cathode. The 
electrons pass through the anode and into the external circuit to create current.
When an O2 molecule comes in contact with the catalyst on the cathode side, it 
breaks apart, forming two oxygen ions. The negative charge of these ions attracts two 
H+ ions through the electrolyte membrane and together they combine with electrons 
from the external circuit to form a water molecule (H2O), which is passed from the 
cell as a by-product. In a single fuel cell, this reaction produces only about 0.7 V. To 
get higher voltages, multiple fuel cells are connected in series.
Current research on fuel cells is ongoing and is focused on developing reliable, 
smaller, and cost-effective components for vehicles and other applications. The con-
version to fuel cells also requires research on how best to obtain and provide hy-
drogen fuel where it is needed. Potential sources for hydrogen include using solar, 
geothermal, or wind energy to break apart water. Hydrogen can also be obtained by 
breaking down coal or natural gas molecules, which are rich in hydrogen.
Solar Cells The operation of solar cells is based on the photovoltaic effect, which is the 
process whereby light energy is converted directly into electrical energy. The most  common 
type of solar cell is the crystalline silicon cell, which is shown in Figure 2–13. Briefly, it 
consists of a sandwich of two layers of different types of semiconductive  materials, which 
are connected to a conductive grid on top and a conductive layer on the bottom. The two 
semiconductor layers are modified in manufacturing by adding certain impurities to the 
crystal structure so that each has unique properties. The top layer, called an n-layer, has 
“extra” electrons in its structure and the bottom layer, called the p-layer, has vacancies 
(called “holes”) in its structure. When the two layers are joined, a region called the deple-
tion region is formed at the boundary (studied in more detail in a Devices course). Free 
electrons from the n-layer cross into the p-layer to fill the holes near the boundary leaving 
the n-layer positively charged. This process creates a barrier that makes it increasingly 
 difficult for additional electrons to cross and the process stops.

Voltage  ●  33
The charge separation in the creation of the depletion layer creates an electric field at 
the junction. When sunlight enters the cell, it can provide energy to free electrons. In the 
n-layer, electrons would cross the depletion layer except the electric field prevents them 
from doing so. Only electrons in the p-layer can move across the depletion layer. When 
a conductive path is added as an external circuit, electrons can travel through this path 
and recombine with holes in the p-layer, thus creating an electric current.
Although solar cells can be used in room light for powering a calculator, research 
is focusing more on converting sunlight to electricity. There is considerable research 
in increasing the efficiency of solar cells and photovoltaic (PV) modules today be-
cause they are a very clean source of energy using sunlight. A complete system for 
continuous power generally requires a battery backup to provide energy when the sun 
is not shining. Solar cells are well suited for remote locations where energy sources are 
unavailable and are used in providing power to satellites.
DC Generator Electrical generators convert mechanical energy into electrical energy 
using a principle called electromagnetic induction (see Chapter 10). A conductor is 
rotated through a magnetic field, and a voltage is produced across the conductor. A 
typical generator is pictured in Figure 2–14.

Thermocouples The thermocouple is a thermoelectric type of voltage source that is 
commonly used to sense temperature. A thermocouple is formed by the junction of 
two dissimilar metals, and its operation is based on the Seebeck effect that describes 
the voltage generated at the junction of the metals as a function of temperature.

are also designated by letters as E, J, N, B, R, and S. Most thermocouples are avail-
able in wire or probe form.
Piezoelectric Sensors These sensors act as voltage sources and are based on the 
 piezoelectric effect where a voltage is generated when a piezoelectric material is 
 mechanically deformed by an external force. Quartz and ceramic are two types of piezo-
electric material. Piezoelectric sensors are used in applications such as pressure sensors, 
force sensors, accelerometers, microphones, ultrasonic devices, and many others.

As you have learned, free electrons are available in all conductive and semicon-
ductive materials. These outer-shell electrons drift randomly in all directions, from 
atom to atom, within the structure of the material, as indicated in Figure 2–16. These 
electrons are loosely bound to the positive metal ions in the material, but because of 
thermal energy, they are free to move about the crystalline structure of the metal.

to build an instrument to measure 
charge flow (current). The unit of

If a voltage is placed across a conductive or semiconductive material, one end becomes 
positive and the other negative, as indicated in Figure 2–17. The repulsive force pro-
duced by the negative voltage at the left end causes the free electrons (negative charges) 
to move toward the right. The attractive force produced by the positive voltage at the 
right end pulls the free electrons to the right. The result is a net movement of the free elec-
trons from the negative end of the material to the positive end, as shown in Figure 2–17.
The movement of these free electrons from the negative end of the material to the 
positive end is the electrical current, symbolized by I.
Electrical current is the rate of flow of charge.
Current in a metallic material is determined by net the number of electrons (amount 
of charge) that flow past a point in a unit of time.

where I is current in amperes (A), Q is charge in coulombs (C), and t is time in sec-
onds (s).
One ampere (1 A) is the amount of current that exists when a number of electrons 
having a total charge of one coulomb (1 C) move through a given cross-sectional area 
in one second (1 s).
See Figure 2–18. Remember, one coulomb is the charge carried by 6.25 * 1018 electrons.

36  ●  Voltage, Current, and Resistance
Generally, we think of free electrons as the current carrier, but there are other ways 
charge moves. In a battery, when electrons flow in the external circuit, ions move in-
ternally to balance the charge of the moving electrons. This forms a current composed 
of ions carrying the charge. Another case where ions carry the charge is in a plasma. 
A plasma is a high temperature gas that has lost its electrons. The moving gas ions 
and free electrons both comprise current.
The Current Source
The Ideal Current Source As you know, an ideal voltage source can provide a con-
stant voltage for any load. An ideal current source can provide a constant current in 
any load. Just as in the case of a voltage source, the ideal current source does not exist 
but can be approximated in practice. We will assume ideal unless otherwise specified.
The symbol for a current source is shown in Figure 2–19(a). The graph for an ideal 
current source is a horizontal line as illustrated in Figure 2–19(b). This is called the IV 
characteristic. Notice that the current is constant for any voltage across the current 
source. In a practical current source, the current decreases slightly with voltage, as 
shown by the dashed line.

EXAMPLE 2–3
Current sources change the 
output voltage in order to supply 
a constant current to the load. For 
example, a meter calibrator can 
have a different output voltage 
that depends on the meter under 
test. You should never touch the 
leads from a current source; the 
voltage can be high, and a shock 
will result, particularly if the load 
is a high resistance load or the 
load is disconnected when the 
 current source is turned on.
Practical Current Sources Power supplies are normally thought of as voltage sources 
because they are the most common type of source in the laboratory. However, current 
sources are another type of energy source. Current sources may be “stand-alone” instru-
ments or may be combined with other instruments, such as a voltage source, DMM, or 
function generator. Examples of combination instruments are the source-measurement 
units shown in Figure 2–20. These units can be set up as voltage or current sources and 
include a built-in DMM, as well as other instruments. They are used primarily for test-
ing transistors and other semiconductors.
In most transistor circuits, the transistor acts as a current source because part of the IV 
characteristic curve is a horizontal line as shown by the transistor characteristic in Figure 
2–21. The flat part of the graph indicates where the transistor current is constant over a 
range of voltages. The constant-current region is used to form a constant-current source.

resistance
When there is current in a solid conductor, the free electrons move through the 
material and occasionally collide with atoms. These collisions cause the electrons 
to lose some of their energy, and thus their movement is restricted. The more 
collisions, the more the flow of electrons is restricted. This restriction varies and 
is determined by the type of material. The property of a material that restricts 
the flow of electrons is called resistance, designated with an R.

When electrons that are moving through a material collide with atoms, they lose some 
of their energy, thus restricting their movement. The more collisions, the more the flow of 
electrons is restricted. This restriction varies and is determined by the type of material. The 
property of a material to restrict or oppose the flow of electrons is called resistance, R.
Resistance is the opposition to current.
Resistance is expressed in ohms, symbolized by the Greek letter omega (Ω).
One ohm (1 𝛀) of resistance exists if there is one ampere (1 A) of current in a mate-
rial when one volt (1 V) is applied across the material.
The schematic symbol for resistance is shown in Figure 2–22.

Conductance The reciprocal of resistance is conductance, symbolized by G. It is a 
measure of the ease with which current is established. The formula is
G = 1
R
The unit of conductance is the siemens, abbreviated S. For example, the conductance 
of a 22 kΩ resistor is
G =

22 kΩ= 45.5 mS
The obsolete unit of mho (ohm spelled backwards) was previously used for conductance.
Resistors
A component that is specifically designed to have a certain amount of resistance is called 
a resistor. The principal applications of resistors are to limit current in a circuit, to divide 
voltage, and, in certain cases, to generate heat. Although resistors come in many shapes 
and sizes, they can all be placed in one of two main categories: fixed or variable.
Fixed Resistors Fixed resistors are available with a large selection of resistance values 
that are set during manufacturing and cannot be changed easily. They are constructed 
using various methods and materials. Figure 2–23 shows several common types. The 
top row shows single, fixed resistors. The lower row shows array resistors. Part (a) 
shows two surface mount devices (SMD) that are metal film resistors with a fixed 
value. Surface mount resistors are the most common types of fixed resistor that is 
widely used on printed circuit (pc) boards. SMD resistors have the advantage of small 
size and are available in a wide range of resistance values and power ratings. They are 
placed on a pc board by machines very rapidly without the need for drilling holes. 
Another common type of fixed resistor is the carbon-composition resistor shown in 
Figure 2–23(b). These resistors are constructed with leads that can be bent and in-
serted into holes drilled in a pc board. Some fixed resistors, such as the one illustrated 
Equation 2–4

Resistance  ●  39
in (c), have radial leads that can go directly into a pc board without requiring a bend-
ing operation. The resistors shown in (d), (e), and (f) are array resistors. These are 
constructed as multiple resistors in a single package. In some cases, array resistors 
have a single common lead. Array resistors are another means of speeding construc-
tion of circuits because a single placement operation can place multiple resistors on 
a board.
Construction of two common types of resistors is illustrated in Figure 2–24. In 
(a), an SMD metal film resistor is shown. The end caps form the connection points 
to the resistive film, which is mounted on a substrate and covered with an insulating 
glass layer. Resistance is determined by the resistivity and physical size of the film. 
For precision resistors, the film is laser trimmed. In (b), a carbon-composition type is 
illustrated. It is constructed with a mixture of finely ground carbon, insulating filler, 
and a resin binder. The ratio of carbon to insulating filler sets the resistance value. 
The mixture is formed into rods, and conductive lead connections are made. The en-
tire resistor is then encapsulated in an insulated coating for protection.
Other types of fixed resistors include carbon film, metal film, and wirewound. In film 
resistors, a resistive material is deposited evenly onto a high-grade ceramic rod. The 
resistive film may be carbon (carbon film) or nickel chromium (metal film). In these 
types of resistors, the desired resistance value is obtained by removing part of the resis-
tive material in a helical pattern along the rod using a spiraling technique, as shown in 
Figure 2–25(a). Very close tolerance can be achieved with this method. Film resistors 
are also available in the form of resistor networks, as shown in Figure 2–25(b).

Wirewound resistors are constructed with resistive wire wound around an insulat-
ing rod and then sealed. Normally, wirewound resistors are used in applications that 
require higher power ratings. Since both film resistors and wirewound resistors are 
constructed with a coil of wire, they can have significant inductance and are not used 
at higher frequencies. (Inductance is discussed in Chapter 13.) Some typical wire-
wound resistors are shown in Figure 2–26.

40  ●  Voltage, Current, and Resistance
Resistor Color Codes Fixed resistors with value tolerances of 5% or 10% are color 
coded with four bands to indicate the resistance value and the tolerance. This color-
code band system is shown in Figure 2–27, and the color code is listed in Table 2–1. 
The bands are always closer to one end.

The color code is read as follows:

digit of the resistance value. If it is not clear which is the banded end, start 
from the end that does not begin with a gold or silver band.

3. The third band is the number of zeros following the second digit, or the multi-
plier. The multiplier is actually a power of ten multiplier; thus a black band in 
the third position represents multiplying by 100 or 1.
4. The fourth band indicates the percent tolerance and is usually gold or silver.
For example, a 5% tolerance means that the actual resistance value is within ;5% of the 
color-coded value. Thus, a 100 Ω resistor with a tolerance of ;5% can have an acceptable 
range of values from a minimum of 95 Ω to a maximum of 105 Ω.
For resistance values less than 10 Ω, the third band is either gold or silver. Gold 
represents a multiplier of 0.1, and silver represents 0.01. For example, a color code 
of red, violet, gold, and silver represents 2.7 Ω with a tolerance of ;10,. A table of 
standard resistance values is in Appendix A.

Exceptions There are some exceptions to the color codes given. One case you may 
see is a zero ohm resistor with a single black band. A zero ohm resistor is sometimes 
used as a jumper on a PC board; it has the advantage of being able to be placed using 
a machine that places other components on the board. Another exception is for cer-
tain military resistors, which may include a reliability band. Check with the manufac-
turer’s specification sheet if you are not sure how a resistor is marked.
Resistor Label Codes Not all types of resistors are color coded. Many, including 
 surface-mount resistors, use typographical marking to indicate the resistance value and 
tolerance. These label codes consist of either all numbers (numeric) or a combination of 
numbers and letters (alphanumeric). In some cases when the body of the resistor is large 
enough, the entire resistance value and tolerance are stamped on it in standard form.
Numeric labeling uses three digits to indicate the resistance value, as shown in 
Figure 2–31 using a specific example. The first two digits give the first two digits of 
the resistance value, and the third digit gives the multiplier or number of zeros that 
follow the first two digits. This code is limited to values of 10 Ω or greater. Notice 
that the label for a 10 Ω resistor is 100 and a 100 Ω resistor is 101.

Example of three-digit labeling for a

Another common type of marking is a three- or four-character label that uses both 
digits and letters. An alphanumeric label typically consists of only three digits or two 
or three digits and one of the letters R, K, or M. The letter is used to indicate the mul-
tiplier, and the position of the letter indicates the decimal point placement. The letter 
R indicates a multiplier of 1 (no zeros after the digits), the K indicates a multiplier of 
1,000 (three zeros after the digits), and the M indicates a multiplier of 1,000,000 (six 
zeros after the digits). In this format, values from 100 to 999 consist of three digits 
and no letter to represent the three digits in the resistance value. Surface-mount de-
vices can also include a zero ohm resistor, used as a means of crossing a trace on a pc 
board. Figure 2–32 shows four examples of this type of resistor label.
Interpret the following alphanumeric resistor labels:

44  ●  Voltage, Current, and Resistance
One system of labels for resistance tolerance values uses the letters F, G, and J:
F = {1,   G = {2,   J = {5,
For example, 620F indicates a 620 Ω resistor with a tolerance of ;1%, 4R6G is a 
4.6 Ω ;2% resistor, and 56KJ is a 56 kΩ ;5% resistor. Although these codes are the 
most commonly used ones, there are variations in markings and manufacturers may 
use a different system. Check with the manufacturer if you are not sure.
Variable Resistors Variable resistors are designed so that their resistance values can 
be changed easily. Two basic uses for variable resistors are to divide voltage and to 
control current. The variable resistor used to divide voltage is called a potentiometer. 
The variable resistor used to control current is called a rheostat. Schematic symbols 
for these types are shown in Figure 2–33. The potentiometer is a three-terminal de-
vice, as indicated in part (a). Terminals 1 and 2 have a fixed resistance between them, 
which is the total resistance. Terminal 3 is connected to a moving contact (wiper). You 
can vary the resistance between 3 and 1 or between 3 and 2 by moving the contact.

Figure 2–33(b) shows the rheostat as a two-terminal variable resistor. Part (c) 
shows how you can use a potentiometer as a rheostat by connecting terminal 3 to 
either terminal 1 or terminal 2. Parts (b) and (c) are equivalent symbols. Some typical 
potentiometers are pictured in Figure 2–34.
Potentiometers and rheostats can be classified as linear or tapered, as shown in 
Figure 2–35, where a potentiometer with a total resistance of 100 Ω is used as an 
example. As shown in part (a), in a linear potentiometer, the resistance between 
either terminal and the moving contact varies linearly with the position of the mov-
ing contact. For example, one-half of the total contact movement results in one-half  
the total resistance. Three-quarters of the total movement results in three-quarters 
of the total resistance between the moving contact and one terminal, or one-quarter 
of the total resistance between the other terminal and the moving contact.
In the tapered potentiometer, the resistance varies nonlinearly with the position of 
the moving contact, so that one-half of a turn does not necessarily result in one-half 
the total resistance. This concept is illustrated in Figure 2–35(b), where the nonlinear 
values are arbitrary.
The potentiometer is used as a voltage-control device because when a fixed voltage 
is applied across the end terminals, a variable voltage is obtained at the wiper contact

with respect to either end terminal. The rheostat is used as a current-control device 
because the current can be changed by changing the wiper position.
Variable Resistance Sensors Many sensors operate on the concept of a variable 
resistance, in which a physical quantity alters the electrical resistance. Depending on 
the sensor and the measurement requirements, the change in resistance may be deter-
mined directly or indirectly using the resistance change to alter a voltage or current.
Examples of resistance sensors include thermistors that change resistance as a func-
tion of temperature, photoconductive cells that change resistance as a function of light, 
and strain gauges that change resistance when a force is applied to them. Strain gauges 
are widely used in scales and applications where mechanical motion needs to be sensed. 
The measuring instruments need to be very sensitive because the change in resistance is 
very small. Figure 2–36 shows symbols for these various resistance sensors.

46  ●  Voltage, Current, and Resistance
Direction of Current
For a few years after the discovery of electricity, people assumed all current consisted 
of moving positive charges. However, in the 1890s, the electron was identified as the 
charge carrier in solid conductors.
Today, there are two accepted conventions for the direction of electrical current. 
Electron flow direction, preferred by many in the fields of electrical and electronics tech-
nology, assumes for analysis purposes that current is out of the negative terminal of a volt-
age source, through the circuit, and into the positive terminal of the source. Conventional 
current direction assumes for analysis purposes that current is out of the positive terminal 
of a voltage source, through the circuit, and into the negative terminal of the source. By 
following the direction of conventional current, there is a rise in voltage across a source 
(negative to positive) and a drop in voltage across a resistor (positive to negative).
Since you cannot actually see current, only its effects, it actually makes no differ-
ence which direction of current is assumed as long as it is used consistently. The results 
of electric circuit analysis are not affected by the direction of current that is assumed 
for analytical purposes. The direction used for analysis is largely a matter of prefer-
ence, and there are many proponents for each approach.
Conventional current direction is also used in electronics technology and is used 
almost exclusively at the engineering level. Conventional current direction is used 
throughout this text.
The Basic Circuit
Basically, an electric circuit consists of a voltage source, a load, and a path for current 
between the source and the load. Figure 2–37 shows in pictorial form an example of 
a simple electric circuit: a battery connected to a lamp with two conductors (wires). 
The battery is the voltage source, the lamp is the load on the battery because it draws 
current from the battery, and the two wires provide the current path from the positive 
terminal of the battery to the lamp and back to the negative terminal of the battery. 
Current goes through the filament of the lamp (which has a resistance), causing it to 
emit visible light. Current through the battery occurs by chemical action.

To avoid electrical shock, never 
touch a circuit while it is con-
nected to a voltage source. If you 
need to handle a circuit, remove a 
component, or change a compo-
nent, first make sure the voltage 
source is disconnected.

The Electric Circuit  ●  47
In many practical cases, one terminal of the battery is connected to a common or 
ground point. For example, in most automobiles, the negative battery terminal is con-
nected to the metal chassis of the car. The chassis is the ground for the automobile 
electrical system and acts as a conductor that completes the circuit.
The Electric Circuit Schematic An electric circuit can be represented by a schematic 
using standard symbols for each element, as shown in Figure 2–38 for the simple circuit 
in Figure 2–37. A schematic, in an organized manner, shows how the various components 
in a given circuit are interconnected so that the operation of the circuit can be determined.
Current Control and Protection
The example circuit in Figure 2–37 illustrated a closed circuit—that is, a circuit in 
which the current has a complete path. When the current path is broken, the circuit is 
called an open circuit.
Mechanical Switches Switches are commonly used for controlling the opening or 
closing of circuits. For example, a switch is used to turn a lamp on or off, as illustrated 
in Figure 2–39. Each circuit pictorial is shown with its associated schematic. The type 
of switch indicated is a single-pole–single-throw (SPST) toggle switch. The term pole 
refers to the movable arm in a switch; the number of poles determine the number of 
independent circuits the switch can control. The term throw indicates the number of 
contacts that are affected (either opened or closed) by a single switch  action (a single 
movement of a pole).

▲FIGURE 2–40
An example of an SPDT switch controlling two lamps.
Figure 2–40 shows a somewhat more complicated circuit using a single-pole– 
double-throw (SPDT) type of switch to control the current to two different lamps. 
When one lamp is on, the other is off, and vice versa, as illustrated by the two 
 schematics in parts (b) and (c), which represent each of the switch positions.

48  ●  Voltage, Current, and Resistance
In addition to the SPST and the SPDT switches (symbols are shown in Figure 
2–41(a) and (b)), the following other types are important:
◆
◆Double-pole–single-throw (DPST) The DPST switch permits simultaneous open-
ing or closing of two sets of contacts. The symbol is shown in Figure 2–41(c). The 
dashed line indicates that the contact arms are mechanically linked so that both 
move with a single switch action.
◆
◆Double-pole–double-throw (DPDT) The DPDT switch provides connection from 
one set of contacts to either of two other sets. The schematic symbol is shown 
in Figure 2–41(d).
◆
◆Push-button (PB) In the normally open push-button switch (NOPB), shown 
in Figure 2–41(e), connection is made between two contacts when the button 
is depressed, and connection is broken when the button is released. In the nor-
mally closed push-button switch (NCPB), shown in Figure 2–41(f), connection 
between the two contacts is broken when the button is depressed.
◆
◆Rotary In a rotary switch, connection between one contact and any one of 
several others is made by turning a knob. A symbol for a simple six-position 
rotary switch is shown in Figure 2–41(g).
Figure 2–42 shows several varieties of mechanical switches, and Figure 2–43 shows 
the construction view of a typical toggle switch.
T E C H  N O T E
Small electronic parts can be dam-
aged easily if you apply too much 
heat to them when soldering. Small 
switches frequently are constructed 
with plastic that can melt and 
render the switch useless. Manufac-
turers usually supply a maximum 
time and temperature that can be 
applied to a part without damage.  
A small heat sink can be temporar-
ily connected between the point 
where solder is applied and the 
sensitive region of the component.

Semiconductor Switches Transistors are widely used as switches in many appli-
cations. The transistor can be used as the equivalent of a single-pole–single-throw 
switch. You can open and close a circuit path by controlling the state of the transis-
tor. Two types of transistor symbols are shown in Figure 2–44 with their mechanical 
switch equivalents.
Here is a greatly simplified description of operation. One type, called the bipolar 
transistor, is controlled by current. When there is current at a specific terminal, the 
transistor acts as a closed switch; when there is no current at that terminal, the tran-
sistor acts as an open switch, as illustrated in Figure 2–44(a). Another type, called the 
field-effect transistor, is controlled by voltage. When there is voltage at a specific ter-
minal, the transistor acts as a closed switch; when there is no voltage at that terminal, 
the transistor acts as an open switch, as illustrated in part (b).
Protective Devices Fuses and circuit breakers are used to deliberately create an 
open circuit when the current exceeds a specified number of amperes due to a mal-
function or other abnormal condition in a circuit. For example, a 20 A fuse or circuit 
breaker will open a circuit when the current exceeds 20 A.
The basic difference between a fuse and a circuit breaker is that when a fuse 
is “blown,” it must be replaced; but when a circuit breaker opens, it can be reset 
and reused repeatedly. Both of these devices protect against damage to a circuit 
due to excess current or prevent a hazardous condition created by the overheat-
ing of wires and other components when the current is too great. Several typical 
fuses and circuit breakers, along with their schematic symbols, are shown in 
Figure 2–45.
Two basic categories of fuses in terms of their physical configuration are cartridge 
type and plug type (screw in). Cartridge-type fuses have various-shaped housings with 
leads or other types of contacts, as shown in Figure 2–45(a). A typical plug-type fuse 
is shown in part (b). Fuse operation is based on the melting temperature of a wire or 
other metal element. As current increases, the fuse element heats up and when the 
rated current is exceeded, the element reaches its melting temperature and opens, thus 
removing power from the circuit.
Two common types of fuses are the fast-acting and the time-delay (slow-blow). 
Fast-acting fuses are type F and time-delay fuses are type T. In normal operation, 
fuses are often subjected to intermittent current surges that may exceed the rated cur-
rent, such as when power to a circuit is turned on. Over time, this reduces the fuse’s 
ability to withstand short surges or even current at the rated value. A slow-blow fuse 
can tolerate greater and longer duration surges of current than the typical fast-acting 
fuse. A fuse symbol is shown in Figure 2–45(d).
Always use fully insulated fuse 
pullers to remove and replace  fuses 
in an electrical box. Even if the 
disconnect switch is in the off posi-
tion, line voltage is still  present in 
the box. Never use metal tools to 
remove and replace fuses.
Fuses and circuit breakers should 
always be on the hot side in a 
circuit rather than neutral or 
ground side. This reduces he risk 
of a shock because the circuit after 
the open is no longer energized by 
the source voltage. Although the 
danger is less, it is NOT eliminated 
because certain components in 
circuits can retain a charge after 
the source is disconnected.

▲FIGURE 2–45
Typical fuses and circuit breakers and their symbols.
Typical circuit breakers are shown in Figure 2–45(c) and the symbol is shown in 
part (e). Generally, a circuit breaker detects excess current either by the heating ef-
fect of the current or by the magnetic field it creates. In a circuit breaker based on 
the heating effect, a bimetallic spring opens the contacts when the rated current is 
exceeded. Once opened, the contact is held open by mechanical means until manually 
reset. In a circuit breaker based on a magnetic field, the contacts are opened by a suf-
ficient magnetic force created by excess current and must be mechanically reset.
Wires
Wires are the most common form of conductive material used in electrical applica-
tions. They vary in diameter and are arranged according to standard gauge numbers, 
called AWG (American Wire Gauge) sizes. As the gauge number increases, the wire 
diameter decreases. The size of a wire is also specified in terms of its cross-sectional 
area, as illustrated in Figure 2–46. A unit of cross-sectional area used for wires is the 
circular mil, abbreviated CM. One circular mil is the area of a wire with a diameter of 
0.001 inch (1 mil). You can find the cross-sectional area by expressing the diameter in 
thousandths of an inch (mils) and squaring it, as follows:
Equation 2–5
A = d2
where A is the cross-sectional area in circular mils and d is the diameter in mils. 
Table 2–3 lists the AWG sizes with their corresponding cross-sectional area and re-
sistance in ohms per 1,000 ft at 20°C.

EXAMPLE 2–7
Wire Resistance Although copper wire conducts electricity extremely well, it still has 
some resistance, as do all conductors except specialized extremely low- temperature 
superconductors. The resistance of a wire depends on three physical characteristics: 
(a) type of material, (b) length of wire, and (c) cross-sectional area. In addition, tem-
perature can also affect the resistance.
Each type of conductive material has a characteristic called its resistivity, r. For 
each material, r is a constant value at a given temperature. The formula for the resis-
tance of a wire of length l and cross-sectional area A is
R = rl
A
Equation 2–6
This formula shows that resistance increases with an increase in resistivity and length and 
decreases with an increase in cross-sectional area. For resistance to be calculated in ohms, 
the length must be in feet, the cross-sectional area in circular mils, and the resistivity in 
CM@Ω/ft.

52  ●  Voltage, Current, and Resistance
Example 2–8 illustrates calculating the resistance of a 100 ft length of AWG 21 
wire. From Table 2–1, the resistance of AWG 21 wire is 12.80 Ω/1000 ft. You can find 
the resistance of 100 ft of this wire by using the table value and noting that 100 ft is 
10% of 1000 ft. Thus, the resistance of 100 ft is 1.280 Ω.
As mentioned, Table 2–3 lists the resistance of the various standard wire sizes in 
ohms per 1,000 feet at 20°C. For example, a 1,000 ft length of 14 gauge copper wire 
has a resistance of 2.525 Ω. A 1,000 ft length of 22 gauge wire has a resistance of 
16.14 Ω. For a given length, the smaller wire has more resistance. Thus, for a given 
voltage, larger wires can carry more current than smaller ones.
Ground
Ground is the reference point in electric circuits. The term ground originated from the 
fact that one conductor of a circuit was typically connected with an 8-foot long metal 
rod driven into the earth itself. Today, this type of connection is referred to as an earth 
ground. In household wiring, earth ground is indicated with a green or bare copper 
wire. Earth ground is normally connected to the metal chassis of an appliance or a 
metal electrical box for safety. Unfortunately, there have been exceptions to this rule, 
which can present a safety hazard if a metal chassis is not at earth ground. It is a good 
idea to confirm that a metal chassis is actually at earth ground potential before doing 
any work on an instrument or appliance.
Another type of ground is called a reference ground. Reference ground refers to a 
common point in a circuit from which voltages are typically measured. Voltages are 
always specified with respect to another point. If that point is not stated explicitly, 
the reference ground is understood. Reference ground defines 0 V for the circuit. The 
reference ground can be at a completely different potential than the earth ground; it 
can be a very high voltage. Reference ground is also called common and labeled COM 
or COMM because it represents a common conductor. When you are wiring a pro-
toboard in the laboratory, you will normally reserve one of the bus strips (a long line 
along the length of the board) for this common conductor.
Three ground symbols are shown in Figure 2–47. Unfortunately, there is not a 
separate symbol to distinguish between earth ground and reference ground. The sym-
bol in (a) represents either an earth ground or a reference ground, (b) shows a chassis 
ground, and (c) is an alternate reference symbol typically used when there is more 
than one common connection (such as analog and digital ground in the same circuit). 
In this book, the symbol in part (a) will be used throughout.
Figure 2–48 illustrates a simple circuit with ground connections. The current is 
from the positive terminal of the 12 V source, through the lamp, and back to the 
negative terminal of the source through the ground connection. Ground provides 
a return path for the current back to the source because all of the ground points 
are electrically the same point. The voltage at the top of the circuit is +12 V with 
respect to ground.
Find the resistance of a 100 ft length of copper wire with a cross-sectional area of 
810.1 CM. The resistivity of copper is 10.37 CM@Ω/ft.
 
Solution
R = rl
A = (10.37 CM@Ω/ft)(100 ft)
810.1 CM
= 1.280 𝛀

basic circuit MeasureMents
In working on electrical or electronic circuits, you will frequently need to measure 
voltage, current, or resistance using meters safely and correctly.
After completing this section, you should be able to

◆Set up and read basic meters
Voltage, current, and resistance measurements are commonly required in electron-
ics work. The instrument used to measure voltage is a voltmeter, the instrument used 
to measure current is an ammeter, and the instrument used to measure resistance is an 
ohmmeter. Commonly, all three instruments are combined into a single instrument 
called a multimeter, in which you can choose what specific quantity to measure by 
selecting the appropriate function with a switch.
Meter Symbols
Throughout this book, certain symbols will be used in circuits to represent meters, as 
shown in Figure 2–49. You may see any of four types of symbols for voltmeters, amme-
ters, or ohmmeters, depending on which symbol most effectively conveys the informa-
tion required. The digital meter symbol is used when specific values are to be indicated 
in a circuit. The bar graph meter symbol and sometimes the analog meter symbol are 
used to illustrate the operation of a circuit when relative measurements or changes in 
quantities, rather than specific values, need to be depicted. A changing quantity may be 
indicated by an arrow in the display showing an increase or decrease. The generic sym-
bol is used to indicate placement of meters in a circuit when no values or value changes 
need to be shown.

54  ●  Voltage, Current, and Resistance
Measuring Current
Figure 2–50 illustrates how to measure current with an ammeter. Part (a) shows a sim-
ple circuit in which the current through the resistor is to be measured. First make sure 
the range setting of the ammeter is greater than the expected current and then connect 
the ammeter in the current path by first opening the circuit, as shown in part (b). Then 
insert the meter as shown in part (c). Such a connection is a series connection. The 
polarity of the meter must be such that the current is in at the positive terminal and out 
at the negative terminal.

Measuring Voltage
To measure voltage, connect the voltmeter across the component for which the voltage 
is to be found. Such a connection is a parallel connection. The negative terminal of the 
meter must be connected to the negative side of the circuit, and the positive terminal 
of the meter must be connected to the positive side of the circuit. Figure 2–51 shows a 
voltmeter connected to measure the voltage across the resistor.
Never wear rings or any type of 
metallic jewelry while working 
on a circuit. These items may 
accidentally come in contact with 
the circuit, causing shock and/or 
damage to the circuit. With high-
energy sources, such as a car bat-
tery, a short across jewelry (watch 
or ring) can become hot instantly, 
causing severe burns.

Measuring Resistance
To measure resistance, first turn off the power and disconnect one end or both ends 
of the resistor from the circuit; then connect the ohmmeter across the resistor. This 
procedure is shown in Figure 2–52.

Digital Multimeters
A DMM (digital multimeter) is a multifunction electronic instrument that can measure 
voltage, current, and resistance. DMMs are the most widely used type of electronic 
measuring instrument. Generally, DMMs provide more functions, better accuracy, 
greater ease of reading, and greater reliability than do many analog meters. Analog 
meters have at least one advantage over DMMs, however. They can track short-term 
variations and trends in a measured quantity that many DMMs are too slow to re-
spond to. Figure 2–53 shows typical DMMs. The meter in Figure 2–53(a) is portable, 
so it is handy for typical measurement requirements. In cases where very high accuracy 
is required, a bench DMM such as the one shown in Figure 2–53(b) is useful.
DMM Functions The basic functions found on most DMMs include the following:
◆
◆Ohms
◆
◆DC voltage and current
◆
◆AC voltage and current

56  ●  Voltage, Current, and Resistance
Many DMMs provide additional functions. These include inductor or capacitor val-
ues, temperature and/or frequency measurements, transistor or diode tests, power 
measurement, and decibel measurement for audio amplifier tests. Some meters re-
quire manual selection of the ranges for the functions. Many meters provide auto-
matic range selection and are called autoranging.
DMM Displays DMMs are available with either LCD (liquid-crystal display), LED 
(light-emitting diode), or vacuum fluorescent display (VFD). The LCD is the most 
commonly used readout in battery-powered instruments because it requires only very 
small amounts of current. A typical battery-powered DMM with an LCD readout 
operates on a 9 V battery that will last from a few hundred hours to 2,000 hours and 
more. The disadvantages of LCD readouts are that (a) they are difficult or impossible 
to see in low-light conditions and (b) they are relatively slow to respond to measure-
ment changes, especially in very cold temperatures. Some DMMs overcome low light 
difficulties with LCDs by using a back lit display. LED displays and VFDs use signifi-
cantly more power than liquid crystals, so are generally limited to bench instruments 
but have the advantage of rugged, bright displays. LEDs and VCDs are superior to 
LCDs in that they have very fast response times, and function well in very cold tem-
peratures. LEDs, on the other hand, can be seen in the dark and respond quickly to 
changes in measured values.
DMM displays are primarily in a 7-segment format. In a standard 7-segment dis-
play, each digit consists of seven separate segments as shown in Figure 2–54(a). Each of 
the ten decimal digits is formed by the activation of appropriate segments, as illustrated 
in Figure 2–54(b). In addition to the seven segments, there is also decimal point.
Manufacturers use the CE mark 
to indicate that a product meets 
all the essential requirements 
of the European Directives for 
health and safety. For example, 
DMMs that meet the directive 
IEC 61010-1 are in compliance 
and can use the CE mark on the 
DMM. This mark is used on many 
products in various countries 
much like the UL ( underwriters 
lab) mark that originated in 
the United States. It also shows 
 compliance with safety standards.
Resolution The resolution of a DMM is the smallest increment of a quantity that 
the meter can measure. The smaller the increment, the better the resolution. One fac-
tor that determines the resolution of a meter is the number of digits in the display.
Because many DMMs have 3½ digits in their display, we will use this case for illustra-
tion. A 3½-digit multimeter has three digit positions that can indicate from 0 through 9, 
and one digit position that can indicate only a value of 0 or 1. This latter digit, called the 
half-digit, is always the most significant digit in the display. For example, suppose that a 
DMM is reading 0.999 V, as shown in Figure 2–55(a). If the voltage increases by 0.001 V 
to 1 V, the display correctly shows 1.000 V, as shown in part (b). The “1” is the half-digit. 
Thus, with 3½ digits, a variation of 0.001 V, which is the resolution, can be observed.
Now, suppose that the voltage increases to 1.999 V. This value is indicated on the 
meter as shown in Figure 2–55(c). If the voltage increases by 0.001 V to 2 V, the half-
digit cannot display the “2,” so the display shows 2.00. The half-digit is blanked and 
only three digits are active, as indicated in part (d). With only three digits active, the 
resolution is 0.01 V rather than 0.001 V as it is with 3½ active digits. The resolution 
remains 0.01 V up to 19.99 V. The resolution goes to 0.1 V for readings of 20.0 V to 
199.9 V. At 200 V, the resolution goes to 1 V, and so on.
The resolution capability of a DMM is also determined by the internal circuitry 
and the rate at which the measured quantity is sampled. DMMs with displays of 4½ 
through 8½ digits are also available.
Accuracy The accuracy is the degree to which a measured value represents the true 
or accepted value of a quantity. The accuracy of a DMM is established strictly by its 
internal circuitry and calibration. For typical DMMs, accuracies range from 0.01% to 
0.5%, with some precision laboratory-grade DMMs going to 0.002%.

Categories for Multimeters The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 
sets detailed standards for multimeter manufacturers in four categories. Category 1 
is the lowest rating and covers standards for most low-energy circuits, such as the 
majority of circuits found in electronic equipment. Category 2 covers meters used 
for household appliances, portable tools, and similar loads. Category 3 covers three-
phase distribution and electrical circuits in larger buildings. Category 4 is the highest 
rating and covers outdoor connections and connections to utility power and large 
industrial motors. The meter used for any measurement in a circuit should be rated at 
or above the category for the job.
Reading Analog Multimeters
Although the DMM is the predominate type of multimeter, you may occasionally 
have to use an analog meter. A representation of a typical analog multimeter is shown 
in Figure 2–56. This particular instrument can be used to measure both direct cur-
rent (dc) and alternating current (ac) quantities as well as resistance values. It has 
(a) Resolution: 0.001 V
(b) Resolution: 0.001 V
(c) Resolution: 0.001 V
(d) Resolution: 0.01 V

There are many safety rules for 
working with meters that are 
designed to protect you. It is 
important to never work alone 
and always de-energize a circuit 
whenever possible before making 
measurements. When that is not 
possible, use protective equipment 
such as insulated tools, safety 
glasses, and insulated gloves. Avoid 
holding a meter when working on 
energized circuits—it is better to 
hang it up or set it on a resting 
place to avoid transient voltages. 
Take the time to be familiar with 
your equipment, its limitations 
and safety suggestions from the 
manufacturer. More safety sugges-
tions are in Section 2–8.
 
◀FIGURE 2–56
A typical analog multimeter.

58  ●  Voltage, Current, and Resistance
four selectable functions: dc volts (DC VOLTS), dc milliamperes (DC mA), ac volts  
(AC VOLTS), and OHMS. Most analog multimeters are similar to this one.
Within each function there are several ranges, as indicated by the brackets around 
the selector switch. For example, the DC VOLTS function has 0.3 V, 3 V, 12 V, 
60 V, 300 V, and 600 V ranges. Thus, dc voltages from 0.3 V full-scale to 600 V 
full-scale can be measured. On the DC mA function, direct currents from 0.06 mA 
full-scale to 120 mA full-scale can be measured. On the ohm scale, the settings  
are *1, *10, *100, *1K, and *100K.
The Ohm Scale Ohms are read on the top scale of the meter. This scale is nonlinear; that 
is, the values represented by each division (large or small) vary as you go across the scale. 
In Figure 2–56, notice how the scale becomes more compressed as you go from right to left.
To read the actual value in ohms, multiply the number on the scale as indicated by 
the pointer by the factor selected by the switch. For example, when the switch is set at 
*100 and the pointer is at 20, the reading is 20 * 100 = 2,000 Ω.
As another example, assume that the switch is at *10 and the pointer is at the seventh 
small division between the 1 and 2 marks, indicating 17 Ω (1.7 * 10). Now, if the meter 
remains connected to the same resistance and the switch setting is changed to *1, the 
pointer will move to the second small division between the 15 and 20 marks. This, of 
course, is also a 17 Ω reading, illustrating that a given resistance value can often be read 
at more than one range switch setting. However, the meter should be zeroed each time 
the range is changed by touching the leads together and adjusting the needle.
The AC-DC and DC mA Scales The second, third, and fourth scales from the top, labeled 
“AC” and “DC,” are used in conjunction with the DC VOLTS and AC VOLTS func-
tions. The upper ac-dc scale ends at the 300 mark and is used with range settings, such as 
0.3, 3, and 300. For example, when the switch is at 3 on the DC VOLTS function, the 300 
scale has a full-scale value of 3 V; at the range setting of 300, the full-scale value is 300 V.  
Determine the quantity (voltage, current, or resistance) that is being measured 
and its value for each specified switch setting on the meter in Figure 2–57.
(a) The switch is set on the DC VOLTS function and the 60 V range.
(b) The switch is set on the DC mA function and the 12 mA range.
(c) The switch is set on the OHMS function and the *1K range.
 
Solution 
(a)     The reading taken from the middle AC-DC scale is 18 V.
(b) The reading taken from the lower AC-DC scale is 3.8 mA.
(c) The reading taken from the ohms scale (top) is 10 k𝛀.

electrical safety
Safety is a major concern when working with electricity. The possibility of an 
electric shock or a burn is always present, so caution should always be used. You 
provide a current path when voltage is applied across two points on your body, 
and current produces electrical shock. Electrical components often operate at 
high temperatures, so you can sustain skin burns when you come in contact with 
them. Also, the presence of electricity creates a potential fire hazard.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆
◆Recognize electrical hazards and practice proper safety procedures
◆
◆Describe the cause of electrical shock
◆
◆List the groups of current paths through the body
◆
◆Discuss the effects of current on the human body
◆
◆List the safety precautions that you should observe when you work with electricity
Electric Shock
Current through your body, not the voltage, is the cause of electrical shock. Of 
course, it takes voltage across a resistance to produce current. When a point on your 
body comes in contact with a voltage and another point comes in contact with a dif-
ferent voltage or with ground, such as a metal chassis, there will be current through 
your body from one point to the other. The path of the current depends on the points 
across which the voltage occurs. The severity of the resulting electrical shock depends 
on the amount of voltage and the path that the current takes through your body. The 
current path through the body determines which tissues and organs will be affected.
Effects of Current on the Human Body The amount of current is dependent on volt-
age and resistance. The human body has resistance that depends on many factors, which 
include body mass, skin moisture, and points of contact of the body with a voltage 
 potential. Table 2–4 shows the effects for various values of current in milliamperes.
Body Resistance Resistance of the human body is typically between 10 kΩ and 
50 kΩ and depends on the two points between which it is measured. The moisture 
of the skin also affects the resistance between two points. The resistance determines 
The middle ac-dc scale ends at 60. This scale is used in conjunction with range settings, such as 
0.06, 60, and 600. For example, when the switch is at 60 on the DC VOLTS function, the full-scale 
value is 60 V. The lower ac-dc scale ends at 12 and is used in conjunction with switch settings, such 
as 1.2, 12, and 120. The three DC mA scales are used in a similar way to measure current.

60  ●  Voltage, Current, and Resistance
the amount of voltage required to produce each of the effects listed in Table 2–4. For 
 example, if you have a resistance of 10 kΩ between two given points on your body, 90 V  
across those two points will produce enough current (9 mA) to cause painful shock.
Utility Voltages
We tend to take utility voltages for granted, but they can be and have been lethal. It 
is best to be careful around any source of voltage (even low voltages can present a 
serious burn hazard). As a general rule, you should avoid working on any energized 
circuit, and check that the power is off with a known good meter. Most work in edu-
cational labs uses low voltages, but you should still avoid touching any energized cir-
cuit. If you are working on a circuit that is connected to utility voltages, the service 
should be disconnected, a notice should be placed on the equipment or place where 
the service is disconnected, and a padlock should be used to prevent someone from ac-
cidentally turning on the power. This procedure is called lockout/tagout and is widely 
used in industry. There are specific OSHA and industry standards for lockout/tagout.
Most laboratory equipment is connected to the utility line (“ac”) and in North 
America, this is 120 Vrms (rms is discussed in Section 11–3). A faulty piece of equip-
ment can cause the “hot” lead to inadvertently become exposed. You should inspect 
cords for exposed wires and check equipment for missing covers or other potential safety 
problems. The single-phase utility lines in homes and electrical laboratories use three 
insulated wires that are referred to as the “hot” (black or red wire), neutral (white wire), 
and safety ground (green wire). The hot and neutral wires will have current, but the 
green safety line should never have current in normal operation. The safety wire is con-
nected to the metal exterior of encased equipment and is also connected to conduit and 
the metal boxes for housing receptacles. Figure 2–58(a) shows the location of these con-
ductors on a standard receptacle. Notice that the neutral line is larger than the hot line.
The safety ground should be connected to the neutral at the service panel. The 
metal chassis of an instrument or appliance is also connected to ground. In the event 
that the hot wire is accidentally in contact with ground, the resulting high current 
should trip the circuit breaker or open a fuse to remove the hazard. However, a bro-
ken or missing ground lead may not have high current until it is contacted by a per-
son. This danger is one obvious reason for ensuring that line cords have not been 
altered by removing the ground pin.
Many circuits are further protected with a special device called a ground-fault cir-
cuit interrupter (GFCI, which is sometimes called just GFI). If a fault occurs in a 
GFCI circuit, a sensor detects that the current in the hot line and the neutral line are 
not equal as they should be and trips the circuit breaker. The GFCI breaker is very 
fast acting and can trip faster than the breaker on the main panel. GFCI breakers 
are required in areas where a shock hazard exists such as wherever there is water

reset button restores power.
Safety Precautions
There are many practical things that you should do when you work with electrical and 
electronic equipment. Some important precautions are listed here.
◆
◆Avoid contact with any voltage source. Turn power off before you work on cir-
cuits when touching circuit parts is required.
◆
◆Do not work alone. A telephone should be available for emergencies.
◆
◆Do not work when tired or taking medications that make you drowsy.
◆
◆Remove rings, watches, and other metallic jewelry when you work on circuits.
◆
◆Do not work on equipment until you know proper procedures and are aware of 
potential hazards.
◆
◆Make sure power cords are in good condition and grounding pins are not miss-
ing or bent.
◆
◆Keep your tools properly maintained. Make sure the insulation on metal tool 
handles is in good condition.
◆
◆Handle tools properly and maintain a neat work area.
◆
◆Wear safety glasses when appropriate, particularly when soldering and clipping wires.
◆
◆Always shut off power and discharge capacitors before you touch any part of 
a circuit. Capacitors can be discharged with a special capacitor discharge tool 
that releases the charge in a controlled manner.
◆
◆Know the location of the emergency power-off switch and emergency exits.
◆
◆Never try to override or tamper with safety devices such as an interlock switch.
◆
◆Always wear shoes and keep them dry. Do not stand on metal or wet floors 
when working on electrical circuits. Stand on a rubber mat if possible.
◆
◆Never handle instruments when your hands are wet.
◆
◆Never assume that a circuit is off. Double-check it with a known good meter 
before handling.
◆
◆Set the limiter on electronic power supplies to prevent currents larger than nec-
essary to supply the circuit under test.
A GFCI outlet does not prevent 
shock or injury in all cases. If you 
are touching the hot and neutral 
wires without being grounded, no 
ground fault is detected and the 
GFCI breaker will not trip. In an-
other case, the GFCI may prevent 
electrocution but not the initial 
electric shock before it interrupts 
the circuit. The initial shock could 
cause a secondary injury, such as 
a fall.
 
◀FIGURE 2–58
Standard electrical outlets.

62  ●  Voltage, Current, and Resistance
◆
◆When making circuit connections, always make the connection to the point 
with the highest voltage as your last step.
◆
◆Avoid contact with the terminals of power supplies.
◆
◆Always use wires with insulation and connectors or clips with insulating shrouds.
◆
◆Keep cables and wires as short as possible. Connect polarized components 
properly.
◆
◆Be aware of and follow all workplace and laboratory rules. Do not have drinks 
or food near equipment.
◆
◆If another person cannot let go of an energized conductor, switch the power off 
immediately. If that is not possible, use any available nonconductive material to 
try to separate the body from the contact.
◆
◆Use a lockout/tagout procedure to avoid someone turning power on while you 
are working on a circuit.

In this application activity, a dc 
voltage is applied to a circuit in 
order to produce current through a lamp to provide light. You 
will see how the current is controlled by resistance. The circuit 
simulates an instrument panel illumination circuit, which 
allows you to increase or decrease the amount of light on the 
instruments.
The instrument panel illumination circuit operates from 
a 12 V battery that is the voltage source for the circuit. 
The circuit uses a potentiometer connected as a rheostat, 
controlled by a knob on the instrument panel, which is used 
to set the amount of current through the lamp to back-light 
the instruments. The brightness of the lamp is proportional 
to the amount of current through the lamp. The switch used 
to turn the lamp on and off is the same one used for the 
headlights. There is a fuse for circuit protection in case of a 
short circuit.
Application Activity
Figure 2–59 shows the schematic for the illumination 
circuit, and Figure 2–60 shows the breadboarded circuit. 
A laboratory dc power supply is used in the place of an 
 actual battery. The protoboard in Figure 2–60 is a type 
that is commonly used for constructing circuits on the  
test bench.

The Test Bench
Figure 2–60 shows the breadboarded circuit, a dc power sup-
ply, and a digital multimeter. The power supply is connected 
to provide 12 V to the circuit. The multimeter is used to mea-
sure current, voltage, and resistance in the circuit.

breadboarded circuit in Figure 2–60 to make sure it is 
connected as the schematic in Figure 2–59 indicates.
2. Explain the purpose of each component in the circuit.
As shown in Figure 2–61, the typical protoboard consists 
of rows of small sockets into which component leads and 
wires are inserted. In this particular configuration, all five 
sockets in each row are connected together and are effectively 
one electrical point as shown in the bottom view. All sockets 
arranged on the outer edges of the board are typically con-
nected together as shown.

ammeter.

est? Explain.

SUMMARY
◆
●An atom is the smallest particle of an element that retains the characteristics of that element.
◆
●When electrons in the outer orbit of an atom (valence electrons) break away, they become 
free electrons.
◆
●Free electrons make current possible.
◆
●Like charges repel each other, and opposite charges attract each other.

66  ●  Voltage, Current, and Resistance
◆
●Voltage must be applied to a circuit to produce current.
◆
●Resistance limits the current.
◆
●Basically, an electric circuit consists of a source, a load, and a current path.
◆
●An open circuit is one in which the current path is broken.
◆
●A closed circuit is one which has a complete current path.
◆
●An ammeter is connected in line with the current path.
◆
●A voltmeter is connected across the current path.
◆
●An ohmmeter is connected across a resistor (resistor must be disconnected from circuit).
◆
●One coulomb is the charge of 6.25 * 1018 electrons.
◆
●One volt is the potential difference (voltage) between two points when one joule of energy is 
required to move one coulomb of charge from one point to the other.
◆
●One ampere is the amount of current that exists when one coulomb of charge moves through 
a given cross-sectional area of a material in one second.
◆
●One ohm is the resistance when there is one ampere of current in a material with one volt 
applied across the material.
◆
●Figure 2–65 shows the electrical symbols introduced in this chapter.
◆
●Standard connections to electrical outlets include a hot wire, a neutral, and a safety ground.
◆
●GFCI breakers sense the currents in the hot wire and neutral wire and trip the breaker if the 
currents are different, indicating a ground fault.

Formulas  ●  67
Coulomb’s law A law that states a force exists between two charged bodies that is directly 
proportional to the product of the two charges and inversely proportional to the square of the 
distance between them.
Current The rate of flow of charge. In metallic conductors, the charge is carried by electrons. 
Charge can also be carried by ions in an electrolyte or in an ionized gas.
Current source A device that produces a constant current for a varying load.
DMM Digital multimeter; an electronic instrument that combines functions for measurement 
of voltage, current, and resistance.
Electrical shock The physical sensation resulting from electrical current through the body.
Electron A basic particle of electrical charge in matter. The electron possesses negative charge.
Free electron A valence electron that has broken away from its parent atom and is free to 
move under the influence of an electric or magnetic field.
Ground The common or reference point in a circuit.
Insulator A material that does not allow current under normal conditions.
Load An element connected across the output terminals of a circuit that draws current from 
the source and upon which work is done.
Ohm (𝛀) The unit of resistance.
Ohmmeter An instrument for measuring resistance.
Open circuit A circuit in which there is not a complete current path.
Potentiometer A three-terminal variable resistor.
Pole With reference to a switch, it is the movable arm; the number of poles determines the number 
of independent circuits the switch can control. Thus a DP switch can control 2 independent circuits.
Power supply An electronic device that converts ac voltage to dc voltage.
Reference ground A common point in a circuit from which voltages are typically measured.
Resistance Opposition to current. The unit is the ohm (Ω).
Resistor An electrical component specifically designed to have a certain amount of resistance.
Rheostat A two-terminal variable resistor.
Semiconductor A material that has a conductance value between that of a conductor and an 
insulator. Silicon and germanium are examples.
Siemens (S) The unit of conductance.
Strain gauge A sensor in which the resistance varies with the applied force. They are widely 
used in scales and in various transducers (accelerometers, displacement and force) and for ex-
pansion and contraction.
Throw With reference to a switch, it is the number of contacts (positions) that are affected by 
a single switch action. Thus a single throw (ST) switch close a circuit in only one position. A 
double-throw (DT) switch has two positions.
Volt The unit of voltage or electromotive force.
Voltage The amount of energy per charge available to move electrons from one point to an-
other in an electric circuit.
Voltage source A device that produces a constant voltage for a varying load.

used in a practical circuit. The circuit is an array of switch- 
selectable resistors of various values used to control the 
speed of a fan. The resistance values will be determined 
based on fan motor data and by the application of Ohm’s 
law. A test procedure will be developed once the modifica-

INTRODUCTION
In Chapter 2, you studied the concepts of voltage, current, 
and resistance. You also were introduced to a basic electric 
circuit. In this chapter, you will learn how voltage, current, 
and resistance are interrelated. You will also learn how to 
analyze a simple electric circuit.
Ohm’s law is perhaps the single most important tool for 
the analysis of electric circuits, and you must know how to 
apply it.
In 1826 Georg Simon Ohm found that current, voltage, 
and resistance are related in a specific and predictable way. 
Ohm expressed this relationship with a formula that is 
known today as Ohm’s law. In this chapter, you will learn 
Ohm’s law and how to use it in solving circuit problems. A 
general approach to troubleshooting using an analysis,  
planning, and measurement (APM) approach is also introduced.

The Relationship of Current, Voltage, and Resistance  ●  77
Ohm determined experimentally that if the voltage across a resistor is increased, 
the current through the resistor will also increase; and, likewise, if the voltage is de-
creased, the current will decrease. For example, if the voltage is doubled, the current 
will double. If the voltage is halved, the current will also be halved. This relationship 
is illustrated in Figure 3–1, with relative meter indications of voltage and current.
Ohm also determined that if the voltage is held constant, less resistance results in 
more current, and, also, more resistance results in less current. For example, if the 
resistance is halved, the current doubles. If the resistance is doubled, the current is 
halved. This concept is illustrated by the meter indications in Figure 3–2, where the 
resistance is increased and the voltage is held constant.

the relationshiP of current, voltage, and resistance
Ohm’s law describes mathematically how voltage, current, and resistance in a resis-
tive circuit are related. Ohm’s law is expressed in three equivalent forms depending on 
which quantity you need to determine. As you will learn, in a resistive circuit, current 
and voltage are directly proportional. However, current and resistance are inversely 
proportional.

78  ●  Ohm’s Law
Ohm’s law states that current is directly proportional to voltage and inversely pro-
portional to resistance. In mathematics, if two variables are directly proportional, 
their ratio is equal to a constant (x/y = k). The circuits in Figures 3–1 and 3–2 illus-
trate Ohm’s law, which is given in the following formula:
Show that if the voltage in the circuit of Figure 3–3 is increased to three times its 
present value, the current will triple in value.
 
Solution 
With 10 V, the current is
I = V
R =
10 V
4.7 kΩ= 2.13 mA
If the voltage is increased to 30 V, the current will be
I = V
R =
30 V
4.7 kΩ= 6.38 mA
The current went from 2.13 mA to 6.38 mA when the voltage was tripled to 30 V.
EXAMPLE 3–1
 
I = V
R 
where I is current in amperes (A), V is voltage in volts (V), and R is resistance in ohms 
(Ω). For a constant value of R, if the value of V is increased, the value of I increases; if 
V is decreased, I decreases. If V is constant and R is increased, I decreases. Similarly, 
if V is constant and R is decreased, I increases.
Using Equation 3–1, you can calculate the current if you know the values of volt-
age and resistance. By manipulating Equation 3–1, you can obtain expressions for 
voltage and resistance.
 
V = IR 
With Equation 3–2, you can calculate voltage if you know the values of current and 
resistance. With Equation 3–3, you can calculate resistance if you know the values of 
voltage and current.
The three expressions—Equations 3–1, 3–2, and 3–3—are all equivalent. They are 
simply three ways of stating Ohm’s law.
The Linear Relationship of Current and Voltage
In mathematics, the term linear refers to a relationship between variables that plots 
a straight line. A graph of a linear equation may or may not pass through the origin. 
When the line passes through the origin, the variables are directly proportion (or lin-
early proportional). In this case, the form of the equation is y = kx.
In resistive circuits, current and voltage are linearly proportional. If one of the 
quantities is increased or decreased by a certain percentage, the other will increase 
or decrease by the same percentage, assuming that the resistance is constant in value. 
For example, if the voltage across a resistor is tripled, the current will triple.

The Relationship of Current, Voltage, and Resistance  ●  79
Let’s take a constant value of resistance, for example, 10 Ω, and calculate the 
 current for several values of voltage ranging from 10 V to 100 V in the circuit in 
Figure 3–4(a). The current values obtained are shown in Figure 3–4(b). The graph of 
the I values versus the V values is shown in Figure 3–4(c). Note that it is a straight line 
graph with a slope equal to the conductance. (Recall that conductance is the recipro-
cal of resistance.) This graph tells us that a change in voltage results in a linearly pro-
portional change in current. No matter what value R is, assuming that R is constant, 
the graph of I versus V will always be a straight line.
Assume that you are measuring the current in a resistive circuit that is operat-
ing with 25 V. The ammeter reads 50 mA. Later, you notice that the current has 
dropped to 40 mA. Assuming that the resistance did not change, you must con-
clude that the voltage source has changed. How much has the voltage changed, 
and what is its new value?
 
Solution 
The current has dropped from 50 mA to 40 mA, which is 80% of the original 50 mA.
The new voltage must be 80% of the original voltage.
New voltage = 0.80 * 25 V = 20 V
Notice that you did not need the resistance value in order to find the new voltage.

80  ●  Ohm’s Law
The Inverse Relationship of Current and Resistance
As you have seen, current varies inversely with resistance as expressed by Ohm’s law, 
I = V>R. When the resistance is reduced, the current goes up; when the resistance is 
increased, the current goes down. For example, if the source voltage is held constant 
and the resistance is halved, the current doubles in value; when the resistance is dou-
bled, the current is reduced by half.
Let’s take a constant value of voltage, for example, 10 V, and calculate the current for 
several values of resistance ranging from 10 Ω to 100 Ω in the circuit in Figure 3–5(a). 
The values obtained are shown in Figure 3–5(b). The graph of the I values versus the R 
values is shown in Figure 3–5(c). When two variables are inversely proportional, the 
product of the two variables is a constant and the equation has the form xy = k.

MultiSim
Measuring current often requires opening the current path to insert an ammeter. 
For this reason, it is common to determine current in a circuit indirectly by measuring 
the voltage across a known resistor and applying Ohm’s law. In some cases, a special 
“sense” resistor is put into a circuit for the purpose of determining current from the 
measured voltage. Often times, this sense resistor is a low-value precision resistor that 
will develop a small voltage. There are, of course, many other instances where you 
will want to determine a current from a voltage measurement across a known resistor. 
The following examples use the formula I = V>R to find the current from a known 
voltage and resistance. When V is given in volts and R is given in ohms, the current 
(I) will be in amperes.

82  ●  Ohm’s Law
Units with Metric Prefixes
In electronics, resistance values of thousands of ohms or even millions of ohms are 
common. The metric prefixes kilo (k) and mega (M) are used to indicate large values. 
Thus, thousands of ohms are expressed in kilohms (kΩ), and millions of ohms are ex-
pressed in megohms (MΩ). The following four examples illustrate how to use kilohms 
and megohms to calculate current. Volts (V) divided by kilohms (kΩ) results in mil-
liamperes (mA). Volts (V) divided by megohms (MΩ) results in microamperes (mA). 
In general, if the answer is not between 1 and 1,000, you should adjust it to follow this 
convention using a different metric prefix. (Most calculators do this automatically.)
Calculate the current in Figure 3–7.
 
Solution 
 Remember that 1.0 kΩ is the same as 1 * 103 Ω. Use the formula I = V>R  and

If you divide volts by resistance in megohms, the current is in microamperes (mA),

EXAMPLE 3–8
Small voltages, usually much less than 50 V, are common in semiconductor circuits. 
Occasionally, however, large voltages are encountered. For example, the high-voltage 
supply in some older television receivers is around 20,000 V (20 kilovolts, or 20 kV), and 
transmission voltages generated by the power companies may be as high as 765,000 V  
(765 kV). The following two examples illustrate how to use voltage values in the kilo-
volt range to calculate current.
How much current is produced by a voltage of 24 kV across a 12 kΩ resistor?
 
Solution 
Since kilovolts are divided by kilohms, the prefixes cancel; therefore, the current is 
in amperes.
I = V
R = 24 kV
12 kΩ= 24 * 103 V
12 * 103 Ω

Related Problem 
What is the current in mA produced by 1 kV across a 27 kΩ resistor?
EXAMPLE 3–9
How much current is there through a 100 MΩ resistor when 50 kV is applied?
 
Solution 
In this case, divide 50 kV by 100 MΩ to get the current. Substitute 50 * 103 V for 
50 kV and 100 * 106 Ω for 100 MΩ.
I = V
R =
50 kV
100 MΩ=

Remember that the power of ten in the denominator is subtracted from the 
power of ten in the numerator. So 50 was divided by 100, giving 0.5, and 6 was 
 subtracted from 3, giving 10-3.

these values into the formula V = IR.
V = IR = (10 mA)(3.3 kΩ) = (10 * 10-3 A)(3.3 * 103 Ω) = 33 V
Notice that 10-3 and 103 cancel. Therefore, milliamperes cancel kilohms when 
multiplied, and the result is volts.

86  ●  Ohm’s Law
If there is a current of 50 mA through a 4.7 MΩ resistor, what is the voltage?
 
Solution 
Fifty microamperes equals 50 * 10-6 A and 4.7 MΩ is 4.7 * 106 Ω. Substitute 
these values into the formula V = IR.
V = IR = (50 mA)(4.7 MΩ) = (50 * 10-6 A)(4.7 * 106 Ω) = 235 V
Notice that 10-6 and 106 cancel. Therefore, microamperes cancel megohms when 
multiplied, and the result is volts.

88  ●  Ohm’s Law
Troubleshooting is the application of logical thinking combined with a thorough 
knowledge of circuit or system operation to correct a malfunction. The basic ap-
proach to troubleshooting consists of three steps: analysis, planning, and measuring. 
We will refer to this three-step approach as APM.
Analysis
The first step in troubleshooting a circuit is to analyze clues or symptoms of the fail-
ure. The analysis can begin by determining the answer to certain questions:
1. Has the circuit ever worked?
2. If the circuit once worked, under what conditions did it fail?
3. What are the symptoms of the failure?
4. What are the possible causes of failure?
Suppose that the value of the resistor in Figure 3–14 is changed. If the battery volt-
age is still 150 V and the ammeter reads 68.2 mA, what is the new resistor value?
 
Solution 
68.2 mA equals 68.2 * 10-6 A. Substitute V and I values into the equation for R.
R = V
I =
150 V
68.2 mA =
150 V
68.2 * 10-6 A
= 2.2 * 106 Ω= 2.2 M𝛀

introduction to troubleshooting
Technicians must be able to diagnose and repair malfunctioning circuits and sys-
tems. In this section, you learn a general approach to troubleshooting using a sim-
ple example. Troubleshooting coverage is an important part of this textbook, so 
you will find a troubleshooting section in many of the chapters and troubleshooting 
problems, including Multisim circuits, for skill building.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆
◆Describe a basic approach to troubleshooting
◆
◆List three steps in troubleshooting
◆
◆Explain what is meant by half-splitting
◆
◆Discuss and compare the three basic measurements of voltage, current, 
and resistance

Introduction to Troubleshooting  ●  89
Planning
The second step in the troubleshooting process, after analyzing the clues, is formulating 
a logical plan of attack. Much time can be saved by proper planning. A working knowl-
edge of the circuit is a prerequisite to a plan for troubleshooting. If you are not certain 
how the circuit is supposed to operate, take time to review circuit diagrams (schematics), 
operating instructions, and other pertinent information. A schematic with proper volt-
ages marked at various test points is particularly useful. Although logical thinking is per-
haps the most important tool in troubleshooting, it rarely can solve the problem by itself.
Measuring
The third step is to narrow the possible failures by making carefully thought out mea-
surements. These measurements usually confirm the direction you are taking in solving 
the problem, or they may point to a new direction that you should take. Occasionally, 
you may find a totally unexpected result.
An APM Example
The thought process that is part of the APM approach can be illustrated with a simple 
example. Suppose you have a string of eight decorative 12 V bulbs connected in series to 
a 120 V source VS, as shown in Figure 3–15. Assume that this circuit worked properly at 
one time but stopped working after it was moved to a new location. When plugged in at 
the new location, the lamps fail to turn on. How do you go about finding the trouble?

◀FIGURE 3–15
A string of bulbs connected 
to a  voltage source.
The Analysis Thought Process You may think like this as you proceed to analyze 
the situation:
◆
◆Since the circuit worked before it was moved, the problem could be that there is 
no voltage at the new location.
◆
◆Perhaps the wiring was loose and pulled apart when moved.
◆
◆It is possible that a bulb is burned out or loose in its socket.
With this reasoning, you have considered possible causes and failures that may have 
occurred. The thought process continues:
◆
◆The fact that the circuit once worked eliminates the possibility that the original 
circuit was improperly wired.
◆
◆If the fault is due to an open path, it is unlikely that there is more than one break 
which could be either a bad connection or a burned out bulb.
You have now analyzed the problem and are ready to plan the process of finding the 
fault in the circuit.
The Planning Thought Process The first part of your plan is to measure for voltage at 
the new location. If the voltage is present, then the problem is in the string of lights. If volt-
age is not present, check the circuit breaker at the distribution box in the house. Before 
resetting breakers, you should think about why a breaker may be tripped. Let’s assume 
that you find the voltage is present. This means that the problem is in the string of lights.

90  ●  Ohm’s Law
The second part of your plan is to measure either the resistance in the string of 
lights or to measure voltages across the bulbs. The decision whether to measure re-
sistance or voltage is a toss-up and can be made based on the ease of making the test. 
Seldom is a troubleshooting plan developed so completely that all possible contingen-
cies are included. You will frequently need to modify the plan as you go along.
The Measurement Process You proceed with the first part of your plan by using a 
multimeter to check the voltage at the new location. Assume the measurement shows 
a voltage of 120 V. Now you have eliminated the possibility of no voltage. You know 
that, since you have voltage across the string and there is no current because no bulb 
is on, there must be an open in the current path. Either a bulb is burned out, a connec-
tion at the lamp socket is broken, or the wire is broken.
Next, you decide to locate the break by measuring resistance with your multimeter. 
Applying logical thinking, you decide to measure the resistance of each half of the 
string instead of measuring the resistance of each bulb. By measuring the resistance 
of half the bulbs at once, you can usually reduce the effort required to find the open. 
This technique is a type of troubleshooting procedure called half-splitting.
Once you have identified the half in which the open occurs, as indicated by an infinite 
resistance, you use half-splitting again on the faulty half and continue until you narrow 
the fault down to a faulty bulb or connection. This process is shown in Figure 3–16, 
 assuming for purposes of illustration that the seventh bulb is burned out.
As you can see in the figure, the half-splitting approach in this particular case takes 
a maximum of five measurements to identify the open bulb. If you had decided to mea-
sure each bulb individually and had started at the left, you would have needed seven 
measurements. Sometimes half-splitting saves steps; sometimes it doesn’t. The number 
of steps required depends on where you make your measurements and in what sequence.
Unfortunately, most troubleshooting is more difficult than this example. However, 
analysis and planning are essential for effective troubleshooting in any situation. As 
measurements are made, the plan is often modified; the experienced troubleshooter 
narrows the search by fitting the symptoms and measurements into a probable cause. 
In some cases, low-cost equipment is simply discarded when troubleshooting and re-
pair costs are comparable to replacement costs.
Comparison of V, R, and I Measurements
As you know from Section 2–7, you can measure voltage, current, or resistance in a 
circuit. To measure voltage, place the voltmeter in parallel across the component; that 
is, place one lead on each side of the component. This makes voltage measurements 
the easiest of the three types of measurements.
A good resistance reading indicates
this part of the circuit is OK.

sequence in which the multimeter is moved from one position to another.

Application Activity  ●  91
To measure resistance, connect the ohmmeter across a component; however, the 
voltage must be first disconnected, and generally one end of the component itself 
must be removed from the circuit to isolate it. Therefore, resistance measurements are 
generally more difficult than voltage measurements.
To measure current, place the ammeter in series with the component; that is, the 
ammeter must be in line with the current path. To do this you must disconnect a com-
ponent lead or a wire before you connect the ammeter. This usually makes a current 
measurement the most difficult to perform.
SECTION 3–5
CHECKUP
1. Name the three steps in the APM approach to troubleshooting.
2. Explain the basic idea of the half-splitting technique.
3. Why are voltages easier to measure than currents in a circuit?
 In this application, a resistive 
circuit is developed for controlling 
the speed of a small dc motor used to drive a fan for cooling 
electronic equipment mounted in a cabinet. One way to control 
the speed of a dc motor is to connect a resistor to the motor, 
as shown in Figure 3–17. The resistor reduces the current to 
the motor and therefore reduces its speed. This method is only 
recommended for small motors because energy is wasted in the 
resistance, and the overall efficiency is low.
Application Activity
A circuit is required that will allow a selection of four 
motor speeds. The control circuit is to be mounted in a small 
box that will be attached to the equipment cabinet to control 
the fan motor speed, as shown in Figure 3–18.

INTRODUCTION
From Chapter 3, you know the relationship of current, volt-
age, and resistance as stated by Ohm’s law. The existence 
of these three quantities in an electric circuit results in the 
fourth basic quantity known as power. A specific relation-
ship exists between power and I, V, and R.
Energy is the ability to do work, and power is the rate 
at which energy is used. Current carries electrical energy 
through a circuit. As the free electrons pass through the 
resistance of the circuit, they give up their energy when 
they collide with atoms in the resistive material. The electri-
cal energy given up by the electrons is converted into heat 
energy. In general, the rate at which the electrical energy is 
converted into heat is the power dissipated in the circuit. 
Electrical energy can also be converted to other forms of 
energy such as sound waves or it can be radiated as electro-
magnetic waves (light or radio waves).

Energy and Power  ●  103
When there is current through a resistance, electrical energy is converted to heat or 
other form of energy, such as light. A common example of this is an incandescent 
light bulb that becomes too hot to touch. The current through the filament that 
produces light also produces unwanted heat because the filament has resistance. 
Electrical components must be able to dissipate a certain amount of energy in a 
given period of time.
After completing this section, you should be able to

James Watt 
1736–1819
Equation 4–1
where P is power in watts (W), W is energy in joules (J), and t is time in seconds (s). 
Note that an italic W is used to represent energy in the form of work and a nonitalic W  
is used for watts, the unit of power. The joule (J) is the SI unit of energy.
Energy in joules divided by time in seconds gives power in watts. For example, 
if 50 J of energy are used in 2 s, the power is 50 J/2 s =  25 W. By definition,
One watt (W) is the amount of power when one joule of energy is used in one 
second.
Thus, the number of joules used in one second is always equal to the number of 
watts. For example, if 75 J are used in 1 s, the power is P =  W>t =  75 J>1 s =  75 W.
Amounts of power much less than one watt are common in certain areas of elec-
tronics. As with small current and voltage values, metric prefixes are used to designate 
small amounts of power. Thus, milliwatts (mW) and microwatts (mW) are  commonly 
found in some applications.
In the electrical utilities field, kilowatts (kW) and megawatts (MW) are common 
units. Various types of transmitters including broadcast stations (radio and TV), 
radar, and even space communications use large amounts of power to transmit sig-
nals, so kW and MW are commonly used to state power levels in these fields. Another 
larger power unit in common use is the horsepower. Large electric motors are com-
monly rated in horsepower (hp) where 1 hp =  746 W.
Since power is the rate at which energy is used, as expressed in Equation 4–1, power 
utilized over a period of time represents energy consumption. If you multiply power 
in watts and time in seconds, you have energy in joules, symbolized by W.
W =  Pt

EXAMPLE 4–3
The Kilowatt-hour (kWh) Unit of Energy
The joule has been defined as a unit of energy. However, there is another way to ex-
press energy. Since power is expressed in watts and time in seconds, units of energy 
called the watt-second (Ws), watt-hour (Wh), and kilowatt-hour (kWh) can be used.
When you pay your electric bill, you are charged on the basis of the amount of 
energy you use, not the power. Because power companies deal in huge amounts of 
energy, the most practical unit is the kilowatt-hour. You use a kilowatt-hour (kWh) 
of energy when you use one thousand watts of power for one hour. For example, a 
100 W light bulb burning for 10 h uses 1 kWh of energy.
W =  Pt =  (100 W)(10 h) =  1,000 Wh =  1 kWh
Joule, a British physicist, is known 
for his research in electricity and 
thermodynamics. He formulated 
the relationship that states that the 
amount of heat energy produced by 
an electrical current in a conductor 
is proportional to the conductor’s 
resistance and the time. The unit of 
energy is named in his honor.

Power in an electric circuit
The generation of heat, which occurs when electrical energy is converted to heat 
energy, is usually an unwanted by-product of current through the resistance in the 
circuit. In some cases, however, the generation of heat is the primary purpose of 
a circuit as, for example, in an electric resistive heater. In any case, you must fre-
quently deal with power in electrical and electronic circuits.
After completing this section, you should be able to

◆Calculate power in a circuit
◆
◆Determine power when you know I and R values
◆
◆Determine power when you know V and I values
◆
◆Determine power when you know V and R values
When there is current through resistance, the collisions of the electrons produce 
heat as a result of the conversion of electrical energy, as indicated in Figure 4–1. The 
amount of power dissipated in an electric circuit is dependent on the amount of resis-
tance and on the amount of current, expressed as follows:
P =  I 2R
where P is power in watts (W), I is current in amperes (A), and R is resistance in 
ohms (Ω). You can get an equivalent expression for power in terms of voltage and 
current by substituting V for IR (I 2 is I *  I).
P =  I 2R =  (I *  I) R =  I(IR) =  (IR)I
P =  VI

consumptions:
(a)  1,400 W for 1 h  (b)  2,500 W for 2 h  (c)  100,000 W for 5 h
 
Solution
(a) 1,400 W = 1.4 kW 
W =  Pt = (1.4 kW) (1 h) =  1.4 kWh
(b) 2,500 W = 2.5 kW 
W = (2.5 kW)(2 h) = 5 kWh
(c) 100,000 W =  100 kW 
W =  (100 kW)(5 h) =  500 kWh

The relationships between power and current, voltage, and resistance expressed in 
the preceding formulas are known as Watt’s law. In each case, I must be in amps, V 
in volts, and R in ohms. To calculate the power in a resistance, you can use any one 
of the three power formulas, depending on what information you have. For example, 
assume that you know the values of current and voltage. In this case calculate the 
power with the formula P = VI. If you know I and R, use the formula P = I 2R. If 
you know V and R, use the formula P = V 2>R.

resistor Power ratings
As you know, a resistor gives off heat when there is current through it. The limit to 
the amount of heat that a resistor can give off is specified by its power rating.

108  ●  Energy and Power
The power rating is the maximum amount of power that a resistor can dissipate 
without being damaged or changed in value by excessive heat. The power rating is not 
related to the ohmic value (resistance) but rather is determined mainly by the physical 
composition, size, and shape of the resistor. All else being equal, the larger the surface 
area of a resistor, the more power it can dissipate. The surface area of a cylindrically 
shaped resistor is equal to the length (l) times the circumference (c), as indicated in 
Figure 4–4. The area of the ends is not included.

The power rating of a resis-
tor is directly related to its 
surface area.
Metal-film resistors are available in standard power ratings from 1>8 W to 1 W, as 
shown in Figure 4–5. Available power ratings for other types of resistors vary. For 
example, wirewound resistors have ratings up to 225 W or greater. Figure 4–6 shows 
some of these resistors.

▲FIGURE 4–6
Typical resistors with high power ratings.
The power rating of a resistor must be greater than the maximum power that it will 
have to handle. Typically, resistors are specified to an ambient temperature of 70°C. 
At higher ambient temperatures, the resistor power ratings are decreased according 
to a derating curve provided by the manufacturer. The circuit designer may provide 
forced convective cooling to maintain a safe temperature. For example, if a resistor is 
to dissipate 0.75 W in a circuit application, its rating should be at least the next higher 
standard value which is 1 W. There are a number of factors that engineers must con-
sider in specifying resistor power rating including spacing of components including 
other resistors, air flow, ambient temperature, altitude, and any heat sinks. As a rule 
of thumb, engineers tend to pick a resistor power rating that is at least twice the calcu-
lated power dissipation to increase component reliability unless there are overriding 
considerations, such as physical design constraints. At a minimum, choose a rating 
larger than the actual power when possible to provide a safety margin.
T E C H  N O T E
Sometimes an overheated resistor is 
due to another failure in the circuit. 
After replacing a heat- damaged 
resistor and before restoring power, 
check for visual faults that may 
cause excessive current, such as a 
short between two conductors.

Resistor Power Ratings  ●  109
When the power in a resistor is greater than its rating, the resistor will become ex-
cessively hot. As a result, the resistor may burn open or its resistance value may per-
manently change and/or its lifetime can be reduced. In extreme cases, a fire can result.
A resistor that has been damaged because of overheating can often be detected 
by the charred or altered appearance of its surface. If there is no visual evidence, a 
resistor that is suspected of being damaged can be checked with an ohmmeter for an 
open or incorrect resistance value. Recall that one or both leads of a resistor should 
be removed from a circuit to measure resistance.
Measuring Resistance with a Digital Multimeter (DMM)
A digital multimeter, such as the one shown in Figure 4–8(a) is the most common 
method to measure resistance. The large rotary switch is used to select the function 
to be measured—in this case the ohms function. The resistance to be measured is iso-
lated from other components, and probes are touched (or connected) to the resistor. 
You should not hold both ends of a resistor or your body resistance will be included 
in the measurement. The meter will position the decimal automatically to display the 
resistance reading including inserting the correct metric prefix when necessary.
The meter shown in Figure 4–8(b) is a manual ranging meter and is similar in opera-
tion to the auto ranging meter but the decimal point is not automatically positioned. 
The user uses the selection switch to choose the function and the range. In the OHMS 
positions there are several ranges in multiples of 10 to choose from. The best resolution 
will be the range that is just larger than the resistor. If the range selected is too low, the 
meter typically read 1 with a blank space after it. Move the function selection to the 
next higher range and try again. If the range setting is too high, the reading will lack sig-
nificant figures. Choose a lower, more sensitive range to measure with better resolution. 
In Figure 4–8(b), it is set to the 2kÆ range.
Measuring Resistance with an Analog Volt-Ohmmeter
Figure 4–9 shows an analog volt-ohmmeter (referred to as a VOM). The meter shown 
is the Simpson 260-8, which is a classic meter still preferred by many people for mak-
ing measurements in low power applications. The 260-8 has a small function switch 
Choose a minimum power rating for each of the metal-film resistors in

power has been turned off, allow

on the left side of the front panel and a central range switch to select one of the 
available ranges. To measure resistance, the function switch is set to either the +DC 
or the −DC position and the test leads are connected to the COMMON and the + 
jack. The range switch is rotated to an appropriate range and the leads are connected 
together. The ZERO OHMS control is rotated until the pointer indicates zero ohms. 
Power must be off when connecting the leads to a circuit and the desired resistance 
must be isolated. The resistance is read on the top scale with increasing resistance to 
the left side. The resistance reading is multiplied by the factor shown on the range 
switch. For example, if the pointer is at 50 on the ohms scale and the range switch is 
set at R * 10, the resistance being measured is 50 * 10 Ω= 500 Ω. If the resistor is 
open, the pointer will stay at full left scale (∞ means infinite) regardless of the range 
switch setting.

112  ●  Energy and Power
Figure 4–11 illustrates charge in the form of electrons flowing from the negative 
terminal of a battery, through a circuit, and back to the positive terminal. As they 
emerge from the negative terminal, the electrons are at their highest energy level. The 
electrons flow through each of the resistors that are connected together to form a 
current path. (This type of connection is called series, as you will learn in Chapter 5). 
As the electrons flow through each resistor, some of their energy is given up in the 
form of heat. Therefore, the electrons have more energy when they enter a resistor 
than when they exit the resistor, as illustrated in the figure by the decrease in the 
intensity of the red color. When they have traveled through the circuit back to the 
positive terminal of the battery, the electrons are at their lowest energy level.

energy conversion and voltage droP in resistance
As you have learned, when there is current through a resistance, electrical energy is 
converted to heat energy. This heat is caused by collisions of the free electrons within 
the atomic structure of the resistive material. When a collision occurs, heat is given off; 
and the electron gives up some of its acquired energy as it moves through the material.
After completing this section, you should be able to

◆

◆
◆Explain the relationship between energy conversion and voltage drop
Recall that voltage equals energy per charge (V = W>Q) and charge is a property 
of electrons. Based on the voltage of the battery, a certain amount of energy is im-
parted to all of the electrons that flow out of the negative terminal. The same number 
of electrons flow at each point throughout the circuit, but their energy decreases as 
they move through the resistance of the circuit.
In Figure 4–11, the voltage at the left end of R1 is equal to Wenter>Q and the voltage 
at the right end of R1, is equal to Wexit>Q. The same number of electrons that enter R1 
also exit R1, so Q is constant. However, the energy Wexit is less than Wenter, so the volt-
age at the right end of R1 is less than the voltage at the left end. This decrease in voltage 
across the resistor due to a loss of energy is called a voltage drop. The voltage at the right 
end of R1 is less negative (or more positive) than the voltage at the left end. The voltage 
drop is indicated by - and + signs (the + implies a more positive voltage).

Power Supplies and Batteries  ●  113
The electrons have lost some energy in R1 and now they enter R2 with a reduced

Power suPPlies and batteries
Recall that power supplies and batteries were briefly introduced as types of voltage 
sources in Chapter 2. In general, a power supply is a device that converts energy 
from one form to another for a load. Usually, it converts ac (alternating current) 
from the utility lines to a dc (direct current) voltage that virtually all electronic cir-
cuits and some transducers require. Batteries are also capable of supplying dc; in 
fact, many systems, such as laptop computers, can run from either a power supply 
or internal battery. In this section, both types of voltage sources are described.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆
◆Discuss the characteristics of power supplies and batteries
◆
◆Describe controls on typical laboratory power supplies
◆
◆Determine the efficiency of a power supply given the input and output power
◆
◆Define ampere-hour rating of batteries
Utilities universally have adopted ac for transmitting electricity from the generating 
station to the user because it can be readily transformed to high voltages for trans-
mission and low voltages for the end user. High voltages are much more efficient and 
 cost-effective to transmit over long distances. For a given amount of power, a higher 
voltage means less current; as a result resistance loss in power lines is greatly reduced. 
In the United States, the standard voltage supplied to outlets is approximately 120 V or 
240 V at 60 Hz, but in Europe and other countries, the outlet voltage is 240 V at 50 Hz.
Virtually all electronic systems require stable dc for the integrated circuits and 
other devices to work properly. Power supplies fulfill this function by converting ac 
to stable dc and are usually built into the product. Many electronic systems have a 
recessed and protected switch that allows the internal power supply to be set for either 
the 120 V standard or for the 240 V standard. That switch must be set correctly, or 
serious damage can occur to the equipment. Some ac/dc adapters are autoswitching 
thus eliminating the need to select the correct voltage.
In the laboratory, circuits are developed and tested. Generally, a laboratory power 
 supply is required for testing electronic circuits to convert ac line voltage to dc required by 
the circuit under test. In some cases a battery can provide the necessary dc. The test circuit 
can be anything from a simple resistive network to a complex amplifier or logic circuit. To 
meet the requirement for a constant voltage, with almost no noise or ripple, laboratory 
power supplies are regulated, meaning the output is constantly sensed and automatically 
adjusted if it tries to change because of a change in the line voltage or the load.
Many circuits require multiple voltages, as well as the ability to set the voltage to 
a precise value or change it a small amount for testing. For this reason, laboratory 
power supplies usually have two or three outputs that are independent of each other 

114  ●  Energy and Power
and can be controlled separately. Output metering is normally part of a good labora-
tory power supply, in order to set and monitor the output voltage or current. Control 
may include fine and coarse controls or digital inputs to set precise voltages.
Figure 4–12 shows a triple output bench supply such as the type used in many 
electronic laboratories. The model shown has two 0–30 V independent supplies and 
a 4–6.5 V high current supply (commonly referred to a logic supply). Voltages can be 
precisely set using coarse and fine controls. The 0–30 V supplies have floating outputs, 
meaning they are not referenced to ground. This allows the user to set them up as a 
positive or negative supply, wire them in series to obtain up to 60 V out, wire them in 
parallel for greater current, or even connect them to another external supply. They can 
also be set up to track changes in the other supply, a useful feature for circuits requir-
ing positive and negative voltages. Another feature of this supply is that it can be set 
up as a current source, with a maximum voltage set for constant current applications.
 
N FIGURE 4–12
A triple output power supply. 
(Courtesy B+K Precision)
As in many power supplies, there are three output jacks for each of the 0–30 V 
 supplies. The output is taken between the red (more positive) and black terminals. 
The green jack is referenced to the chassis, which is earth ground, and can be con-
nected to either the red or black jacks. In addition, current and voltage can be moni-
tored using the built-in digital meters.
The power delivered by a power supply is the product of the absolute voltage and 
current. For example, if a power supply is providing -15.0 V at 3.0 A, the supplied 
power is 45 W. For a triple output supply, the total power supplied by all three sup-
plies is the sum of the power from each one individually.
What is the total power delivered by a triple output power supply if the output 
voltage and current are as follows?
Source 1: 18 V at 2.0 A
Source 2: −18 V at 1.5 A
Source 3: 5.0 V at 1.0 A
 
Solution 
Power delivered from each supply is the product of voltage and current (ignoring 
the sign).
Source 1: P1 = V1I1 = (18 V) (2.0 A) = 36 W
Source 2: P2 = V2I2 = (18 V) (1.5 A) = 27 W
Source 3: P3 = V3I3 = (5.0 V) (1.0 A) = 5.0 W
The total power is
P T = P1 + P2 + P3 = 36 W + 27 W + 5.0 W = 68 W
 
Related Problem 
How will the total power delivered change if the current from Source 1 increases to 2.5 A?

Power Supplies and Batteries  ●  115
Power Supply Efficiency
An important characteristic of electronic power supplies is efficiency. Efficiency is the 
ratio of the output power delivered to a load to the input power to a circuit.
Efficiency is often expressed as a percentage. For example, if the input power is 100 W 
and the output power is 50 W, the efficiency is (50 W/100 W) * 100, = 50,.
All electronic power supplies require that power be put into them; for this reason, 
they are considered to be energy converters. For example, an electronic power supply 
generally uses the ac power from a wall outlet as its input. Its output is usually a regu-
lated dc voltage. The output power is always less than the input power because some 
of the total power must be used internally to operate the power supply circuitry. This 
internal power dissipation is normally called the power loss. The output power is the 
input power minus the power loss.
 
POUT =  PIN -  PLOSS
High efficiency means that very little power is dissipated in the power supply and 
there is a higher proportion of output power for a given input power.
A certain electronic power supply requires 25 W of input power. It can produce an 
output power of 20 W. What is its efficiency, and what is the power loss?
 
Solution

EXAMPLE 4–10
Ampere-Hour Ratings of Batteries
Batteries convert stored chemical energy to electrical energy. They are widely used to 
power small systems, such as laptop computers and cell phones, to supply the stable dc 
required. The batteries used in these small systems are normally rechargeable, mean-
ing that the chemical reaction can be reversed from an external source. The capacity 
for any battery is measured in ampere-hours (Ah). For a rechargeable battery, the Ah 
rating is the capacity before it needs to be recharged. The ampere-hour (Ah) rating 
determines the length of time a battery can deliver a certain amount of current at the 
rated voltage. The Ah rating is a general guideline; there are other factors that affect 
the rating including temperature and depth of discharge.
A rating of one ampere-hour means that a battery can deliver an average of one am-
pere of current to a load for one hour at the rated voltage output. The ampere hour 
rating is derated if the current exceeds some limit. As the current draw is increased, the 
Ah rating goes down. In practice, a battery usually is rated for a specified current level 
and output voltage. For example, a lead-acid 12 V automobile battery may be rated for 
100 Ah at 5 A. This means that it can produce an average of 5 A for 20 h at the rated 
voltage. Most lead-acid batteries are rated based on 20 hours of current draw. If the load 
takes more current than this rated current, the battery will need to be derated, so that it is 
no longer able to provide 100 Ah. All lead-acid batteries share this characteristic; there is 
less energy available at higher discharge rates and the battery life is shortened by higher 
discharge rates.

118  ●  Energy and Power
SUMMARY
◆
●The power rating in watts of a resistor determines the maximum power that it can handle safely.
◆
●Resistors with a larger surface area can dissipate more power in the form of heat than smaller ones.
◆
●A resistor should have a power rating higher than the maximum power that it is expected to 
handle in the circuit.
◆
●Power rating is not related to resistance value.
◆
●A resistor normally opens when it overheats and fails.
◆
●Energy is the ability to do work and is equal to power multiplied by time.
◆
●The kilowatt-hour is a unit of energy.
◆
●One kilowatt-hour equals one thousand watts used for one hour or any other combination 
of watts and hours that has a product of one.
◆
●A power supply converts energy from one form to another for a load.
◆
●A battery is one type of power supply that converts chemical energy into electrical energy.
◆
●An electronic power supply converts commercial energy (ac from the power company) to 
regulated dc at various voltage levels.
◆
●The output power of a supply is the output voltage times the load current.
◆
●A load is a device that draws current from the power supply.
◆
●The capacity of a battery is measured in ampere-hours (Ah).
◆
●One ampere-hour equals one ampere used for one hour, or any other combination of am-
peres and hours that has a product of one.
◆
●For a battery, the greater the discharge rate, the lower the amount of energy that can be delivered.
◆
●A circuit with a high efficiency has a smaller percentage power loss than one with a lower 
efficiency.

INTRODUCTION
In Chapter 3 you learned about Ohm’s law, and in Chapter 4 
you learned about power in resistors. In this chapter, those 
concepts are applied to circuits in which resistors are connected 
in a series arrangement.
Resistive circuits can be of two basic forms: series and 
parallel. In this chapter, series circuits are studied. Parallel 
circuits are covered in Chapter 6, and combinations of 
series and parallel resistors are examined in Chapter 7. In 
this chapter, you will see how Ohm’s law is used in series 
circuits; and you will learn another important circuit law, 
Kirchhoff’s voltage law. Also, several applications of series 
circuits, including voltage dividers, are presented.
When resistors are connected in series and a voltage is 
applied across the series connection, there is only one path 
for current; therefore, each resistor in series has the same 
amount of current through it. All of the resistances in series 
add together to produce a total resistance. The voltage drops 
across each of the resistors add up to the voltage applied 
across the entire series connection.

126  ●  Series Circuits
The schematic in Figure 5–1(a) shows two resistors connected in series between 
point A and point B. Part (b) shows three resistors in series, and part (c) shows four in 
series. Of course, there can be any number of resistors in a series circuit.
When a voltage source is connected between point A and B, the only way for cur-
rent to get from one point to the other in any of the connections of Figure 5–1 is to go 
through each of the resistors. The following statement describes a series circuit:
A series circuit provides only one path for current between two points so that the 
 current is the same through each series resistor.
In an actual circuit diagram, a series circuit may not always be as easy to visually 
identify as those in Figure 5–1. For example, Figure 5–2 shows series resistors drawn 
in other ways with voltage applied. Remember, if there is only one current path be-
tween two points, the resistors between those two points are in series, no matter how 
they appear in a diagram.
Suppose that there are five resistors positioned on a protoboard as shown in 
Figure 5–3. Wire them together in series so that, starting from the positive (+)  
terminal, R1 is first, R2 is second, R3 is third, and so on. Draw a schematic 
 showing this connection.

Series Resistor Values Add
When resistors are connected in series, the resistor values add because each resistor 
 offers opposition to the current in direct proportion to its resistance. A greater num-
ber of resistors connected in series creates more opposition to current. More opposi-
tion to current implies a higher value of resistance. Thus, every time a resistor is added 
in series, the total resistance increases.
Figure 5–7 illustrates how series resistances add to increase the total resistance. 
Part (a) has a single 10 Ω resistor. Part (b) shows another 10 Ω resistor connected

connected between pins 1 and 2 on the PC board.

tion is connected between pins 3 and 4 on the PC board.

R4 = 1.2 kΩ, R5 = 3.3 kΩ, R6 = 4.7 kΩ, R7 = 5.6 kΩ, R8 = 12 kΩ, R9 = 68 kΩ, 
R10 = 27 kΩ, R11 = 12 kΩ, R12 = 82 kΩ, and R13 = 270 kΩ.

Total Series Resistance  ●  129
Series Resistance Formula
For any number of individual resistors connected in series, the total resistance is the 
sum of each of the individual values.
RT = R1 + R2 + R3 + g + Rn
where RT is the total resistance and Rn is the last resistor in the series string (n can be 
any positive integer equal to the number of resistors in series). For example, if there 
are four resistors in series (n = 4), the total resistance formula is
RT = R1 + R2 + R3 + R4
If there are six resistors in series (n = 6), the total resistance formula is
RT = R1 + R2 + R3 + R4 + R5 + R6
To illustrate the calculation of total series resistance, let’s determine RT in the cir-
cuit of Figure 5–8, where VS is the source voltage. The circuit has five resistors in 
series. To get the total resistance, simply add the values.
RT = 56 Ω+ 100 Ω+ 27 Ω+ 10 Ω+ 47 Ω= 240 Ω
Note in Figure 5–8 that the order in which the resistances are added does not  matter. 
You can physically change the positions of the resistors in the circuit without  affecting 
the total resistance or the current.

Equal-Value Series Resistors
When a circuit has more than one resistor of the same value in series, there is a short-
cut method to obtain the total resistance: Simply multiply the resistance value by 
the number of equal-value resistors that are in series. This method is essentially the 
same as adding the values. For example, five 100 Ω resistors in series have an RT of 
5(100 Ω) = 500 Ω. In general, the formula is expressed as
 
RT = nR
where n is the number of equal-value resistors and R is the resistance value.
Equation 5–2
Find the RT of eight 22 Ω resistors in series.
 
Solution 
Find RT by adding the values.
RT = 22 Ω+ 22 Ω+ 22 Ω+ 22 Ω+ 22 Ω+ 22 Ω+ 22 Ω+ 22 Ω= 176 𝛀
However, it is much easier to multiply to get the same result.
RT = 8(22 Ω) = 176 𝛀

point in this circuit, the current into that point must equal the current out of that point, 
as illustrated by the current directional arrows. Notice also that the current out of 
each resistor must equal the current into each resistor because there is no place where

The following are key points to remember when you analyze series circuits:
1. Current through any of the series resistors is the same as the total current.
2. If you know the total applied voltage and the total resistance, you can determine 
the total current by Ohm’s law.
IT = VT
RT
3. If you know the voltage drop across one of the series resistors (Rx), you can deter-
mine the total current by Ohm’s law.
IT = Vx
Rx
4. If you know the total current, you can find the voltage drop across any of the 
series resistors by Ohm’s law.
Vx = ITRx
5. The polarity of a voltage drop across a resistor is positive at the end of the resis-
tor that is closest to the positive terminal of the voltage source.
6. The current through a resistor is defined to be in a direction from the positive end 
of the resistor to the negative end.
7. An open in a series circuit prevents current; therefore, there is zero voltage drop 
across each series resistor. The total voltage appears across the points between 
which there is an open.
Now let’s look at several examples that use Ohm’s law for series circuit analysis.

by the current through it. Use the Ohm’s law formula V = IR to determine the

voltage across each of the resistors. Keep in mind that there is the same current 
through each series resistor. The voltage across R1 (designated V1) is
V1 = IR1 = (1 mA)(1.0 kΩ) = 1 V
The voltage across R2 is
V2 = IR2 = (1 mA)(3.3 kΩ) = 3.3 V
The voltage across R3 is
V3 = IR3 = (1 mA)(4.7 kΩ) = 4.7 V
To find the value of VS, first determine RT.
RT = 1.0 kΩ+ 3.3 kΩ+ 4.7 kΩ= 9 kΩ
The source voltage VS is equal to the current times the total resistance.
VS = IRT = (1 mA)(9 kΩ) = 9 V
Notice that if you add the voltage drops of the resistors, they total 9 V, which is 
the same as the source voltage.
VS can be increased to a value where I = 5 mA. Calculate the maximum value 
of VS as follows:
VS(max) = IRT = (5 mA)(9 kΩ) = 45 V

where a red LED is used as an indicator as part of a more complicated circuit. 
The rheostat is included to dim the LED depending on ambient conditions. We

A red LED will always have a voltage across it of about +1.7 V when it is on

power supply will be across the two series resistors. Together, the rheostat and the 
fixed resistor will have a total of 3.3 V across them.
Assume you want current in the LED to range from a minimum of 2.5 mA 
(dim) to a maximum of 10 mA (bright). What values of R1 and R2 would you 
choose to accomplish this?
 
Solution 
Start with the brightest condition when the resistance of the rheostat is adjusted 
for 0 Ω. In this case, there will be no voltage across R1 and 3.3 V will be across R2. 
Because it is a series circuit, the same current is in R2 as the LED. Therefore,
R2 = V
I =
3.3 V
10 mA = 330 𝛀
Now determine the total resistance required to limit the current to 2.5 mA. The 
total resistance is RT = R1 + R2, and the voltage drop across RT is 3.3 V. From 
Ohm’s law,
RT = V
I =
3.3 V
2.5 mA = 1.32 k𝛀
To find R1, subtract the value of R2 from the total resistance.
R1 = RT - R2 = 1.32 kΩ- 330 Ω= 990 Ω
Choose a 1.0 k𝛀 rheostat as the nearest standard value.

138  ●  Series Circuits
When two or more voltage sources are in series, the total voltage is equal to the 
algebraic sum of the individual source voltages. The algebraic sum means that the 
polarities of the sources must be included when the sources are combined in series. 
Sources with opposite polarities have voltages with opposite signs.
VS(tot) = VS1 + VS2 + g + VSn
When the voltage sources are all in the same direction in terms of their polarities, 
as in Figure 5–22(a), all of the voltages have the same sign when added; there is a total 
of 4.5 V from terminal A to terminal B with A more positive than B.
VAB = 1.5 V + 1.5 V + 1.5 V = +4.5 V
The voltage has a double subscript, AB, to indicate that it is the voltage at point A 
with respect to point B.
In Figure 5–22(b), the middle voltage source is opposite to the other two; so its 
voltage has an opposite sign when added to the others. For this case the total voltage 
from A to B is
VAB = +1.5 V - 1.5 V + 1.5 V = +1.5 V
Terminal A is 1.5 V more positive than terminal B.
A familiar example of voltage sources in series is the flashlight. When you put two 
1.5 V batteries in your flashlight, they are connected in series, giving a total of 3 V. 
When connecting batteries or other voltage sources in series to increase the total volt-
age, always connect from the positive (+) terminal of one to the negative (-) terminal 
of another. Such a connection is illustrated in Figure 5–23.

polarities opposite to the source voltage polarity. For example, in Figure 5–30, follow 
a clockwise loop around the circuit. Note that the source polarity is minus-to-plus and 
each voltage drop is plus-to-minus. The voltage drops across resistors are designated 
as V1, V2, and so on.
In Figure 5–30, by definition, the current is out of the positive side of the source and 
through the resistors as the arrows indicate. The current is into the positive side of each 
resistor and out the negative side. The drop in energy across a resistor creates a potential 
difference, or voltage drop, with a plus-to-minus polarity in the direction of the current.
The voltage from point A to point B in the circuit of Figure 5–30 is the source volt-
age, VS. Also, the voltage from A to B is the sum of the series resistor voltage drops. 
Therefore, the source voltage is equal to the sum of the three voltage drops, as stated 
by Kirchhoff’s voltage law.
The sum of all the voltage drops around a single closed path in a circuit is equal to the 
total source voltage in that loop.
Kirchhoff’s voltage law applied to a series circuit is illustrated in Figure 5–31. For this 
case, Kirchhoff’s voltage law can be expressed by Equation 5–3.
 
VS = V1 + V2 + V3 + g + Vn
where the subscript n represents the number of voltage drops.
If all the voltage drops around a closed path are added and then this total is sub-
tracted from the source voltage, the result is zero. This result occurs because the sum 
of the voltage drops always equals the source voltage.

Kirchhoff’s voltage law
Kirchhoff’s voltage law is a fundamental circuit law that states that the algebraic 
sum of all the voltages around a single closed path is zero or, in other words, the 
sum of the voltage drops equals the total source voltage.

The algebraic sum of all the voltages (both source and drops) around a single closed 
path is zero.
Therefore, another way of expressing Kirchhoff’s voltage law in equation form is
VS - V1 - V2 - V3 - g - Vn = 0
You can verify Kirchhoff’s voltage law by connecting a circuit and measuring each 
resistor voltage and the source voltage as illustrated in Figure 5–32. When the resistor 
voltages are added together, their sum will equal the source voltage. Any number of 
resistors can be added.

Kirchhoff was a German physi-

 fundamental understanding of 
electrical circuits, spectroscopy, 
and the emission of black-body 
radiation by heated objects. 
Concepts in both circuit theory 
and thermal emission are named 
Kirchhoff’s laws in his honor. 
Kirchhoff formulated his circuit 
laws, which are now commonly 
used in electrical engineering and 
technology, in 1845 while still a 
student. He completed this study 
as a seminar exercise; it later 
became his  doctoral dissertation.

Solution 
In this problem you will use both Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s voltage law.
First, use Ohm’s law to find the voltage drop across each of the known resistors.
V1 = IR1 = (10 mA)(100 Ω) = 1.0 V
V2 = IR2 = (10 mA)(470 Ω) = 4.7 V
V3 = IR3 = (10 mA)(1.0 kΩ) = 10 V
Next, use Kirchhoff’s voltage law to find V4, the voltage drop across the un-
known resistor.
 VS - V1 - V2 - V3 - V4 = 0 V
 50 V - 1.0 V - 4.7 V - 10 V - V4 = 0 V
 34.3 V - V4 = 0 V
 V4 = 34.3 V
Now that you know V4, use Ohm’s law to calculate R4.
R4 = V4
I = 34.3 V
10 mA = 3.43 k𝛀
R4 is most likely color-coded as a 3.3 kΩ resistor because 3.43 kΩ is within a 
standard tolerance range ({5,) of 3.3 kΩ.

Determine R4 in Figure 5–34 for VS = 25 V and I = 10 mA.

144  ●  Series Circuits
So far, you have seen how Kirchhoff’s voltage law can be applied to a series circuit with 
a voltage source, but it can also be applied to other types of circuits. For example, there 
are cases where there is no source voltage in a given closed loop. Even so, Kirchhoff’s 
voltage law still applies. This leads to a more-general form of Equation 5–3.
V1 + V2 + V3 + c + Vn = 0
If a voltage source is present, it is simply treated as one of the terms in Equation 5–4.
In applying Equation 5–4, an algebraic sign is given to each voltage in the path 
depending on whether it is voltage rise (+) or a voltage drop (-). A voltage across a 
resistor can appear as either a rise or a drop depending on the path direction chosen, 
so you will need to assign algebraic signs to voltage rises and voltage drops in a con-
sistent manner. A practical example of writing Kirchhoff’s voltage law around a loop 
with no source is given in the Application Activity in Chapter 6.
Sometimes you will see an equation such as Equation 5–4 expressed in shorthand 
notation using the Greek letter sigma (Σ) to denote summation, as follows:
a
n
i = 1
Vi = 0
This mathematical expression is equivalent to Equation 5–4 and means that you add 
the voltages from the first (i = 1) to the last (i = n).

Solution 
By Kirchhoff’s voltage law (Eq. 5–4), the algebraic sum of all the voltages around 
the circuit is zero. The value of each voltage drop except V3 is known. Substitute 
these values into the equation.
VS1 + VS2 + V3 + V2 + V1 = 0
50 V - 15 V - V3 - 6 V - 12 V = 0
Next, combine the known values, transpose 17 V to the right side of the equation, 
and cancel the minus signs.
17 V - V3 = 0 V
-V3 = -17 V
V3 = 17 V
The voltage drop across R3 is 17 V, and its polarity is as shown in Figure 5–35.
 
Related Problem

Voltage Dividers  ●  145
A circuit consisting of a series string of resistors connected to a voltage source acts 
as a voltage divider. Figure 5–36 shows a circuit with two resistors in series, although 
there can be any number. There are two voltage drops across the resistors: one across 
R1 and one across R2. These voltage drops are V1 and V2, respectively, as indicated in 
the schematic. Since each resistor has the same current, the voltage drops are propor-
tional to the resistance values. For example, if the value of R2 is twice that of R1, then 
the value of V2 is twice that of V1.
The total voltage drop around a single closed path divides among the series resistors in 
amounts directly proportional to the resistance values. For example, in Figure 5–36, if VS is 
10 V, R1 is 50 Ω, and R2 is 100 Ω, then V1 is one-third the total voltage, or 3.33 V, because 
R1 is one-third the total resistance of 150 Ω. Likewise, V2 is two-thirds VS, or 6.67 V.
Voltage-Divider Formula
With a few calculations, you can develop a formula for determining how the voltages 
divide among series resistors. Assume a circuit with n resistors in series as shown in 
Figure 5–37, where n can be any number.
Let Vx represent the voltage drop across any one of the resistors and Rx represent 
the number of a particular resistor or combination of resistors. By Ohm’s law, you 
can express the voltage drop across Rx as follows:
Vx = IRx
The current through the circuit is equal to the source voltage divided by the 
total resistance (I = VS/RT). In the circuit of Figure 5–37, the total resistance is 
R1 + R2 + R3 + g + Rn. By substitution of VS/RT for I in the expression for Vx,
Vx = a VS

Determine V1 (the voltage across R1) and V2 (the voltage across R2) in the voltage

EXAMPLE 5–16
 
Solution 
To determine V1, use the voltage-divider formula, Vx = (Rx/RT)VS, where x = 1. 
The total resistance is
RT = R1 + R2 = 100 Ω+ 56 Ω= 156 Ω

There are two ways to find the value of V2: Kirchhoff’s voltage law or the 
 voltage-divider formula. If you use Kirchhoff’s voltage law (VS = V1 + V2), 
 substitute the values for VS and V1 as follows:
V2 = VS - V1 = 10 V - 6.41 V = 3.59 V
To determine V2, use the voltage-divider formula where x = 2.
V2 = a R2

Calculate the voltage drop across each resistor in the voltage divider of Figure 5–39.
EXAMPLE 5–17
 
Solution 
Look at the circuit for a moment and consider the following: The total resistance is 
1000 Ω. Ten percent of the total voltage is across R1 because it is 10% of the total 
resistance (100 Ω is 10% of 1,000 Ω). Likewise, 22% of the total voltage is dropped 
across R2 because it is 22% of the total resistance (220 Ω is 22% of 1,000 Ω). 
 Finally, R3 drops 68% of the total voltage because 680 Ω is 68% of 1,000 Ω.
Because of the convenient values in this problem, it is easy to figure the volt-
ages mentally. (V1 = 0.10 * 10 V = 1 V, V2 = 0.22 * 10 V = 2.2 V, and V3 =
0.68 * 10 V = 6.8 V.) Such is usually not the case, but sometimes a little thinking 
will produce a result more efficiently and eliminate some calculating. This is also 
a good way to estimate what your results should be so that you will recognize an 
unreasonable answer as a result of a calculation error.
Although you have already reasoned through this problem, the calculations will 
verify your results.

Notice that the sum of the voltage drops is equal to the source voltage, in accordance 
with Kirchhoff’s voltage law. This check is a good way to verify your results.

A Potentiometer as an Adjustable Voltage Divider
Recall from Chapter 2 that a potentiometer is a variable resistor with three terminals. 
A linear potentiometer connected to a voltage source is shown in Figure 5–41(a) with 
the schematic shown in part (b). Notice that the two end terminals are labeled 1 and 2.  
The adjustable terminal or wiper is labeled 3. The potentiometer functions as a volt-
age divider, which can be illustrated by separating the total resistance into two parts, 
as shown in Figure 5–41(c). The resistance between terminal 1 and terminal 3 (R13) is

one part, and the resistance between terminal 3 and terminal 2 (R32) is the other part. 
So this potentiometer is equivalent to a two-resistor voltage divider that can be manu-
ally adjusted for any output voltage from 0 V to VS.
Figure 5–42 shows what happens when the wiper contact (3) is moved. In part (a), 
the wiper is exactly centered, making the two resistances equal. If you measure the 
voltage across terminals 3 to 2 as indicated by the voltmeter symbol, you have one-half 
of the total source voltage. When the wiper is moved up, as in part (b), the resistance 
between terminals 3 and 2 increases, and the voltage across it increases proportionally. 
When the wiper is moved down, as in part (c), the resistance between terminals 3 and 2 
decreases, and the voltage decreases proportionally.
Applications
The volume control of some radio receivers is a common application of a potenti-
ometer used as a voltage divider. Since the loudness of the sound is dependent on the 
amount of voltage associated with the audio signal, you can increase or decrease the 
volume by adjusting the potentiometer, that is, by turning the knob of the volume 
control on the set. The block diagram in Figure 5–43 shows how a potentiometer can 
be used for volume control in a typical receiver.

Voltage dividers are commonly used in operational amplifier circuits to control 
gain among other things. An operational amplifier is a widely used high-gain amplifier 
that is a basic building block for many analog circuits. It has two inputs that are non-
inverting (+) and inverting (−) and a single output as shown in Figure 5–44(a). In a 
basic non-inverting amplifier shown in (b), a voltage divider returns a fraction of the 
output voltage (Vout) to the inverting input. This is called negative feedback and the 
feedback voltage, Vf, is the voltage developed across R2. As you will learn in a study 
of devices, the amount of feedback determines the gain. In the case of the amplifier in 
Figure 5–44(b), you can apply the voltage divider rule to obtain Vf:

in the tank decreases, the sensor output voltage also decreases. The output voltage 
goes to the indicator circuitry, which controls a digital readout to show the amount of 
liquid in the tank. The schematic of this system is shown in part (c).
Voltage dividers are also commonly used in setting the dc operating voltage (bias) 
in transistor amplifiers. Figure 5–46 shows a voltage divider used for this purpose. 
You will study transistor amplifiers and biasing in a later course, so it is important 
that you understand the basics of voltage dividers at this point.
A voltage divider is useful for converting a resistance sensor output to a voltage. 
Resistance sensors were described in Chapter 2 and include thermistors, CdS cells, 
and strain gauges. To convert a change in resistance to an output voltage, the resis-
tance sensor can replace one of the resistors in a voltage divider.

Assume you have a CdS cell configured as shown in Figure 5–47 that uses three 
AA batteries for a voltage source (4.5 V). At dusk, the resistance of the cell rises 
from a low resistance to above 90 kΩ. The cell is used to trigger a logic circuit that 
will turn on lights if VOUT is greater than approximately 1.5 V. What value of R 
will produce an output voltage of 1.5 V when the cell resistance is 90 kΩ?
EXAMPLE 5–19
 
Solution 
Notice that the threshold voltage (1.5 V) is one-third of the supply voltage.  
You know that 90 kΩ represents one-third of the total resistance at this point. 
Therefore, the total resistance is
RT = 3(90 kΩ) = 270 kΩ
The resistance value needed to produce VOUT = 1.5 V is
R = RT - 90 kΩ= 270 kΩ- 90 kΩ= 180 k𝛀

Another application for series circuits is to share power dissipation. When testing 
high power transmitters it is sometimes necessary to dissipate the power is a resistive 
load (called a dummy load) rather than allow the power to radiate from the antenna. 
A dummy load can consist of multiple series resistors, to enable its construction with

Power in series circuits
The power dissipated by each individual resistor in a series circuit contributes to 
the total power in the circuit. The individual powers are additive.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆
◆Determine power in a series circuit
◆
◆Apply one of the power formulas
The total amount of power in a series resistive circuit is equal to the sum of the 
powers in each resistor in series.
PT = P1 + P2 + P3 + c + Pn
where PT is the total power and Pn is the power in the last resistor in series.
The power formulas that you learned in Chapter 4 are applicable to series circuits. 
Since there is the same current through each resistor in series, the following formulas 
are used to calculate the total power:
 PT = VSI
PT = I 2RT
PT = V 2

RT
where I is the current through the circuit, VS is the total source voltage across the se-
ries connection, and RT is the total resistance.

Power in Series Circuits  ●  153
The amount of power in a resistor is important because the power rating of the re-
sistors must be high enough to handle the expected power in the circuit. The following 
example illustrates practical considerations relating to power in a series circuit.
Determine if the indicated power rating (½ W) of each resistor in Figure 5–49 is 
sufficient to handle the actual power when the switch is closed. If a rating is not 
adequate, specify the required minimum rating.
 
Solution 
First, determine the total resistance.
RT = R1 + R2 + R3 + R4 = 1.0 kΩ+ 2.7 kΩ+ 910 Ω+ 3.3 kΩ= 7.91 kΩ
EXAMPLE 5–21
Determine the total amount of power in the series circuit in Figure 5–48.
EXAMPLE 5–20
 
Solution 
The source voltage is 15 V. The total resistance is
RT = R1 + R2 + R3 + R4 = 10 Ω+ 18 Ω+ 56 Ω+ 22 Ω= 106 Ω
The easiest formula to use is PT = V 2
S/RT since you know both VS and RT.
PT = V 2
S
RT
= (15 V)2
106 Ω= 225 V2
106 Ω= 2.12 W
If you determine the power in each resistor separately and all of these powers 
are added, you obtain the same result. First, find the current.
I = VS
RT
=
15 V
106 Ω= 142 mA
Next, calculate the power for each resistor using P = I 2R.
P1 = I 2R1 = (142 mA)2(10 Ω) = 200 mW
P2 = I 2R2 = (142 mA)2(18 Ω) = 360 mW
P3 = I 2R3 = (142 mA)2(56 Ω) = 1.12 W
P4 = I 2R4 = (142 mA)2(22 Ω) = 441 mW
Then, add these powers to get the total power.
PT = P1 + P2 + P3 + P4 = 200 mW + 360 mW + 1.12 W + 441 mW = 2.12 W
This result is the same as the total power as determined previously by the formula 
PT = V 2
S/RT.

R2 and R4 do not have a rating sufficient to handle the actual power, which exceeds 
½ W in each of these two resistors, and they may burn out if the switch is closed. 
These resistors should be replaced by 1 W resistors.

voltage MeasureMents
The concept of reference ground was introduced in Chapter 2 and designated as 
the 0 V reference point for a circuit. Voltage is always measured with respect to 
another point in the circuit. In this section, ground is discussed in more detail.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆
◆Measure voltage with respect to ground
◆
◆Define the term reference ground
◆
◆Explain the use of single and double subscripts for indicating voltages
◆
◆Identify ground in a circuit

Voltage Measurements  ●  155
The term ground has its origin in telephone systems in which one of the conductors 
was the earth itself. The term was also used in early radio receiving antennas (called 
aerials) where one part of the system was connected to a metal pipe driven into the 
earth. Today, ground can mean different things and is not necessarily at the same po-
tential as the earth. Recall that reference ground was defined in Section 2–8 as a com-
mon point in a circuit from which voltages are typically measured. Frequently, the 
reference ground is the conductor that carries the power supply return current. Most 
electronic circuit boards have a larger conducting surface area for ground. For many 
multilayer circuit boards, the ground surface area is a separate internal layer, which is 
referred to as a ground plane.
Basic concepts of standard electrical wiring in North America were discussed in 
Chapter 2 (Section 2–8). Recall that the neutral conductor is connected to earth ground 
only at the entrance to a building. Neutral is part of the live circuit and carries return 
current from the load but ground is for safety purposes and connects metal boxes, 
cases, and the like to the building ground. In normal operation, ground and neutral 
are at the same potential and neutral can serve as a reference ground.
The concept of reference ground is also used in automotive electrical systems. In 
most automotive systems, the chassis of the automobile is the ground reference. In 
nearly all modern automobiles, the negative post of the battery is connected to the 
chassis with a solid low-resistance connection. This makes the chassis of the vehicle 
serve as the return path for all of the electrical circuits in the vehicle, as illustrated in 
the simplified drawing in Figure 5–50. In some vintage cars, the positive terminal was 
connected to the chassis in an arrangement called positive ground. In both cases, the 
chassis represents the reference ground point.
When removing a battery from 
an automobile, remove the 
reference ground wire first. If 
a tool should then accidentally 
come in contact with the  chassis 
and the positive terminal, a 
spark will be avoided; there is 
no  current because there is no 
return path. When installing 
a battery, always install the 
ground connection last.
Measuring Voltages with Respect to Ground
When voltages are measured with respect to ground, they are indicated with a single 
letter subscript. For example, VA is voltage at point A with respect to ground. The 
circuits in Figure 5–51 consist of three 1.0 kΩ series resistors and four lettered refer-
ence points. Reference ground represents a potential of 0 V with respect to all other 
points in the circuit as illustrated. In part (a), the reference point is D and all voltages 
are positive with respect to D. In part (b), the reference point is A in the circuit, and all 
other points have a negative voltage.
Many circuits use both positive and negative voltages and as mentioned, the re-
turn path for these supplies is designated as reference ground. Figure 5–51(c) shows 
the same circuit but with two 6 V sources replacing the 12 V source. In this case, the 
reference point is arbitrarily designated between the two voltage sources. There is 
exactly the same current in all three circuits, but now voltages are referenced to the

new ground point. As you can see from these examples, the reference ground point is 
arbitrary and does not change the current.
Not all voltages are measured with respect to ground. If you wish to specify 
the voltage drop across an ungrounded resistor, you can name the resistor in the 
subscript or use two subscripts. When two subscripts are used, the voltage rep-
resents the difference between the points. For example, VBC means VB - VC. In 
Figure 5–51, VBC is the same in all three circuits (+4.0 V) as you can confirm by 
performing the subtraction in each case. Another way of designating VBC is to 
write simply VR2.
There is one more convention commonly used to express voltages using subscripts. 
Power supply voltages are usually given with a double-letter subscript. The reference 
point is ground or common. For example, a voltage written as VCC is a positive power 
supply voltage with respect to ground. Other common power supply voltages are VSS 
(positive), VEE (negative), and VSS (negative).
To measure voltages with a digital meter, the meter leads can be connected across 
any two points and the meter will indicate the voltage, either positive or negative. 
The meter reference jack is labeled “COM” (normally black). This is common only 
to the meter, not to the circuit. Figure 5–52 shows measuring a floating voltage using 
a DMM to measure the voltage across the ungrounded resistor R2. The circuit is the 
same one given in Figure 5–51(b), which has a negative power supply. It is shown as 
it might be constructed in a lab. Notice that the meter indicates a negative voltage, 
which means that the meter’s COM lead is the more positive lead. If you wanted to 
measure voltages with respect to the circuit’s reference ground, you would connect 
the COM on the meter to the circuit’s reference ground. The voltage with respect to 
the reference ground will be indicated.
If you are using an analog meter to make circuit measurements, you must con-
nect the meter so that its common lead is connected to the most negative point in 
the circuit; otherwise, the meter movement will try to move backward. (An excep-
tion is when the meter has a switch for reversing the polarity.) If you are uncertain 
as to the polarity of the voltage, set the meter for the highest range and note which 
direction the meter deflects. Then choose a scale that produces reasonable deflec-
tion and zero the meter on that scale prior to making a measurement. Figure 5–53 
shows an analog meter connected to the same circuit as before; notice that the 
meter leads are reversed. To measure voltage across R2, the leads must be con-
nected so that the meter will deflect in the positive direction. Notice that the posi-
tive lead on the meter is connected to the more positive point in the circuit, which 
in this case is the circuit’s ground. The user appends a minus sign to the reading 
when recording the reading.

Open resistors or contacts and one point shorted to another are common prob-
lems in all circuits including series circuits.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆
◆Troubleshoot series circuits
◆
◆Check for an open circuit
◆
◆Check for a short circuit
◆
◆Identify primary causes of opens and shorts
Open Circuit
The most common failure in a series circuit is an open. For example, when a resistor 
or a lamp burns out, it causes a break in the current path and creates an open circuit, 
as illustrated in Figure 5–55. An open circuit can also be created by a switch, circuit 
breaker or fuse; any of these can interrupt current when open.
An open in a series circuit prevents current.
Troubleshooting an Open In Chapter 3, you were introduced to the analysis, plan-
ning, and measurement (APM) approach to troubleshooting. You also learned about 
the half-splitting method and saw an example using an ohmmeter. Now, the same 
principles will be applied using voltage measurements instead of resistance measure-
ments. As you know, voltage measurements are generally the easiest to make because 
you do not have to disconnect anything.
As a beginning step, prior to analysis, it is a good idea to make a visual check of the 
faulty circuit. Occasionally, you can find a charred resistor, a broken lamp filament, a 
loose wire, or a loose connection this way. However, it is possible (and probably more 
common) for a resistor or other component to open without showing visible signs of 
damage. When a visual check reveals nothing, then proceed with the APM approach.
When an open occurs in a series circuit, all of the source voltage appears across the 
open. The reason for this is that the open condition prevents current through the se-
ries circuit. With no current, there can be no voltage drop across any of the other 
resistors (or other component). Since IR = (0 A)R = 0 V, the voltage on each end of 
a good resistor is the same. Therefore, the voltage applied across a series string also 
appears across the open component because there are no other voltage drops in the 
T E C H  N O T E
When measuring a resistance, make 
sure that you do not touch the 
 meter leads or the resistor leads 
with your fingers. If you hold both 
ends of a high-value resistor in your 
fingers along with the meter probes, 
the measurement will be inaccurate 
because your body resistance can 
 affect the measured value. When 
body resistance is placed in  parallel 
with a high-value resistor, the 
measured value will be less than the 
actual value of the resistor.

resistor in accordance with Kirchhoff’s voltage law as follows:
VS = V1 + V2 + V3 + V4 + V5 + V6

Troubleshooting a series circuit for an open using half-splitting.
Example of Half-Splitting Using Voltage Measurements Suppose a circuit has four 
resistors in series. You have determined by analyzing the symptoms (there is voltage 
at the source but no current) that one of the resistors is open, and you are planning to 
find the open resistor using a voltmeter for measuring by the half-splitting method. A 
sequence of measurements for this particular case is illustrated in Figure 5–57.
Step 1:  Measure across R1 and R2 (the left half of the circuit). A 0 V reading indi-
cates that neither of these resistors is open.
Step 2:  Move the meter to measure across R3 and R4; the reading is 10 V. This in-
dicates there is an open in the right half of the circuit, so either R3 or R4 is 
the faulty resistor (assume no bad connections).
Step 3:  Move the meter to measure across R3. A measurement of 10 V across R3 
identifies it as the open resistor. If you had measured across R4, it would have 
indicated 0 V. This would have also identified R3 as the faulty component 
because it would have been the only one left that could have 10 V across it.

Troubleshooting  ●  161
Short Circuit
Sometimes an unwanted short circuit occurs when two conductors touch or a foreign 
object such as solder or a wire clipping accidentally connects two sections of a circuit 
together. This situation can occur in circuits with a high component density. Several 
potential causes of short circuits are illustrated on the PC board in Figure 5–58.

◀FIGURE 5–59
Example of the effect of a short in a 
series circuit.
When there is a short, a portion of the series resistance is bypassed (all of the current 
goes through the short), thus reducing the total resistance as illustrated in Figure 5–59. 
Notice that the current increases as a result of the short.
A short in a series circuit causes more current than normal.
Troubleshooting a Short A short is very difficult to troubleshoot. As in any trou-
bleshooting situation, it is a good idea to make a visual check of the faulty circuit. 
In the case of a short in the circuit, a wire clipping, solder splash, or touching 
leads is often found to be the culprit. In terms of component failure, shorts are 
less common than opens in many types of components. Furthermore, a short in 
one part of a circuit can cause overheating in another part due to the higher cur-
rent caused by the short. As a result two failures, an open and a short, may occur 
together.
When a short occurs in a series circuit, there is essentially no voltage across the 
shorted part. A short has zero or near zero resistance, although shorts with significant 
resistance values can occur from time to time. These are called resistive shorts. For 
purposes of illustration, zero resistance is assumed for all shorts.
In order to troubleshoot a short, measure the voltage across each resistor until you 
get a reading of 0 V. This is the straightforward approach and does not use half-splitting.

162  ●  Series Circuits
In order to apply the half-splitting method, you must know the correct voltage at each 
point in the circuit and compare it to measured voltages. Example 5–23 illustrates using 
half-splitting to find a short.
Assume you have determined that there is a short in a circuit with four series 
resistors because the current is higher than it should be. You know that the volt-
age at each point in the circuit should be as shown in Figure 5–60 if the circuit is 
working properly. The voltages are shown relative to the negative terminal of the 
source. Find the location of the short.

Solution 
Use the half-splitting method to troubleshoot the short.
Step 1:  Measure across R1 and R2. The meter shows a reading of 6.67 V, which is 
higher than the normal voltage (it should be 5 V). Look for a voltage that 
is lower than normal because a short will make the voltage less across that 
part of the circuit.
Step 2:  Move the meter and measure across R3 and R4; the reading of 3.33 V is 
incorrect and lower than normal (it should be 5 V). This shows that the 
short is in the right half of the circuit and that either R3 or R4 is shorted.
Step 3:  Again move the meter and measure across R3. A reading of 3.3 V across R3 
tells you that R4 is shorted because it must have 0 V across it. Figure 5–61 
illustrates this troubleshooting technique.

Application Activity
For this application activity, you 
have a voltage-divider circuit board 
that has been given to you to check and evaluate. The purpose of 
the board is to provide five different reference voltage levels from 
a 12.0 V battery that has a 6.5 Ah rating. The reference voltages 
are for use in another circuit.
Your job is to check the existing circuit and predict the out-
put voltages at each pin based on the resistor color codes. Then 
you will compare your predicted values with the measured volt-
ages and determine if they are within the tolerance range of the 
expected values. If not, suggest why they are not as expected. 
You also need to confirm that power ratings of the resistors are

SUMMARY
●◆The current is the same at all points in a series circuit.
●◆The total resistance in a series circuit is the sum of all resistors.
●◆The resistance between any two points in a series circuit is equal to the sum of all resistors 
connected between those two points.
●◆If all of the resistors in a series circuit are of equal value, the total resistance is the number of 
resistors multiplied by the resistance value of one resistor.
●◆Voltage sources in series add algebraically.
●◆Kirchhoff’s voltage law: The sum of all the voltage drops around a single closed path in a 
circuit is equal to the total source voltage in that loop.
●◆Kirchhoff’s voltage law: The algebraic sum of all the voltages (both source and drops) around 
a single closed path is zero.
●◆The voltage drops in a circuit are always opposite in polarity to the total source voltage.
●◆Conventional current is defined to be out of the positive side of a source and into the nega-
tive side.
●◆Conventional current is defined to be into the positive side of each resistor and out of the 
more negative (less positive) side.
●◆A voltage drop results from a decrease in energy level across a resistor.
●◆A voltage divider is a series arrangement of resistors connected to a voltage source.
●◆A voltage divider is so named because the voltage drop across any resistor in the series circuit 
is divided down from the total voltage by an amount proportional to that resistance value in 
relation to the total resistance.
●◆A potentiometer can be used as an adjustable voltage divider.
●◆The total power in a resistive circuit is the sum of all the individual powers of the resistors 
making up the series circuit.
●◆Reference ground (common) is zero volts with respect to all points that are compared to it in 
the circuit.
●◆Negative ground is the term used when the negative side of the source is grounded.
●◆Positive ground is the term used when the positive side of the source is grounded.
●◆The voltage across an open component in a series circuit always equals the source voltage.
●◆The voltage across a shorted component is always 0 V.

APPLICATION ACTIVITY PREVIEW
In this application activity, a panel-mounted power supply 
will be modified by adding a milliammeter to indicate current 
to a load. Expansion of the meter for multiple current ranges 
using parallel (shunt) resistors will be demonstrated. The 
problem with very low-value resistors when a switch is used 
to select the current ranges will be introduced and the effect 
of switch contact resistance will be demonstrated. A way of 
eliminating the contact resistance problem will be presented. 
Finally, the ammeter circuit will be installed in the power sup-
ply. The knowledge of parallel circuits and of basic ammeters 
that you will acquire in this chapter plus your understanding 
of Ohm’s law and current dividers will be put to good use.

INTRODUCTION
In Chapter 5, you learned about series circuits and how to 
apply Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s voltage law. You also saw 
how a series circuit can be used as a voltage divider to obtain 
several specified voltages from a single source voltage. The ef-
fects of opens and shorts in series circuits were also examined.
In this chapter, you will see how Ohm’s law is used in 
parallel circuits; and you will learn Kirchhoff’s current law. 
Also, several applications of parallel circuits, including au-
tomotive lighting, residential wiring, control circuit, and the 
internal wiring of analog ammeters are presented. You will 
learn how to determine total parallel resistance and how to 
troubleshoot for open resistors.
When resistors are connected in parallel and a voltage is 
applied across the parallel circuit, each resistor provides a 
separate path for current. The total resistance of a parallel 
circuit is reduced as more resistors are connected in parallel. 
The voltage across each of the parallel resistors is equal to 
the voltage applied across the entire parallel circuit.

resistors in Parallel
When two or more resistors are individually connected between two separate 
points (nodes) in a circuit, they are in parallel with each other. A parallel circuit 
includes a voltage source between the two points and more than one path for 
current.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆
◆Identify a parallel resistive circuit
◆
◆Translate a physical arrangement of parallel resistors into a schematic
◆
◆Identify parallel resistors.
◆
◆Define node
Each current path in a circuit is called a branch, and a parallel circuit is one 
that has more than one branch. Two resistors connected in parallel with a source 
are shown in Figure 6–1(a). As shown in part (b), the current out of the source (IT) 
divides when it gets to point A. I1 goes through R1 and I2 goes through R2. If addi-
tional resistors are connected in parallel with the first two, more current paths are 
provided between point A and point B, as shown in Figure 6–1(c). All points along 
the top shown in blue are electrically the same as point A, and all points along the 
bottom shown in green are electrically the same as point B. A and B are called nodes. 
A node is a point or junction in a circuit where two or more components are con-
nected. A parallel circuit is one that has exactly two nodes and all components are 
connected between the two nodes.
In Figure 6–1, it is obvious that the resistors are connected in parallel. Often, in ac-
tual circuit diagrams, the parallel relationship is not as clear. It is important that you 
learn to recognize parallel circuits regardless of how they may be drawn.
A rule for identifying parallel circuits is as follows:
If there is more than one current path (branch) between two separate points and if the 
voltage between those two points also appears across each of the branches, then there 
is a parallel circuit between those two points.
Figure 6–2 shows parallel resistors drawn in different ways between two separate 
points labeled A and B. Notice that in each case, the current has two paths going from 
A to B, and the resistors are connected between the same two nodes. For this reason, 
the voltage across each resistor is the same. Although these examples show only two 
parallel paths, there can be any number of resistors in parallel.

voltage in a Parallel circuit
The voltage across any given branch of a parallel circuit is equal to the voltage 
across each of the other branches in parallel. As you know, each current path in a 
parallel circuit is called a branch.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆
◆Determine the voltage across each branch in a parallel circuit
◆
◆Explain why the voltage is the same across all parallel resistors
To illustrate voltage in a parallel circuit, let’s examine Figure 6–7(a). Points A, 
B, C, and D along the left side of the parallel circuit are electrically the same point 
because the voltage is the same along this line; for this reason they are all one node. 
You can think of all of these points as being connected by a single wire to the negative 
terminal of the battery. The points E, F, G, and H along the right side of the circuit 
form a second node and are all at a voltage equal to that of the positive terminal of 
the source. Thus, voltage across each parallel resistor is the same, and each is equal to 
the source voltage. Note that the parallel circuit in Figure 6–7 resembles a ladder; the 
rails of the ladder are the two nodes of a parallel circuit.
Figure 6–7(b) is the same circuit as in part (a), drawn in a slightly different way. 
Here the left side of each resistor is connected to a single point, which is the negative 
battery terminal. The right side of each resistor is connected to a single point, which 
is the positive battery terminal. The resistors are still all in parallel across the source 
and there are exactly two nodes.

Kirchhoff’s current law, often abbreviated KCL, can be stated as follows:
The sum of the currents into a node (total current in) is equal to the sum of the cur-
rents out of that node (total current out).
Intuitively, this makes sense. Recall that a node is a junction and that current is the 
net movement of charge over a time interval 1I = Q>t2. If the current into a node 
did not equal the current out of the node, extra charge would have to build or be sup-
plied by the node, a condition that is not possible. In the circuit of Figure 6–12, point 
A is one node and point B is another. Let’s start at the positive terminal of the source 
and follow the current. The total current I T from the source is into node A. At this 
point, the current splits up among the three branches as indicated. Each of the three 
branch currents (I 1, I 2,  and I 3) is out of node A. Kirchhoff’s current law says that the 
total current into node A is equal to the total current out of node A; that is,
I T = I 1 + I 2 + I 3
Now, following the currents in Figure 6–12 through the three branches, you see 
that they come back together at node B. Currents I1, I2, and I3 are into node B, and IT

Kirchhoff’s current law can be 
applied to anything that acts as a 
load for an electrical system. For 
example, the power connections to 
a circuit board will have the same 
current supplied to the board as 
leaving the board. Likewise, a build-
ing has the same current on the 
incoming “hot” line as the neutral. 
Normally, the supply current and 
return current are always the same.

be stated as

Kirchhoff’s Current Law  ●  189
To express Kirchhoff’s current law with this method, all currents are assigned a se-
quential subscript (1, 2, 3, and so on) no matter if the current is into or out of the 
node. Currents into the node are positive and currents leaving the node are negative.
You can verify Kirchhoff’s current law by connecting a circuit and measuring each 
branch current and the total current from the source, as illustrated in Figure 6–14. 
When the branch currents are added together, their sum will equal the total current. 
This rule applies for any number of branches.

Solving for IA3 yields
I A3 = 5 mA - 1.5 mA = 3.5 mA
The total current into node Y is I A3 = 3.5 mA. Two currents are out of node Y:  
1 mA through resistor R 2 and the current through A5 and R 3. Kirchhoff’s current 
law applied at node Y gives

Using Kirchhoff’s current law, find the current in each of two taillights given that 
the total current from the battery is 8.0 A and together the headlights draw 5.6 A.

I BAT - I T(HEAD) - I T(TAIL) = 0
Rearranging and changing the signs,
I T(TAIL) = I BAT - I T(HEAD) = 8.0 A - 5.6 A = 2.4 A
Because the taillights are identical, each draws 2.4 A/2 = 1.2 A.

5. An underground pump has 10 A of current in the hot line. What should be the

As you know, when resistors are connected in parallel, the current has more than 
one path. The number of current paths is equal to the number of parallel branches.
In Figure 6–18(a), there is only one current path because it is a series circuit. There 
is a certain amount of current, I 1, through R 1. If resistor R 2 is connected in parallel 
with R 1, as shown in Figure 6–18(b), there is an additional amount of current, I 2, 
through R 2. However, I 1 does not change because Ohm's Law states that I 1 = Vs>R1 
and neither Vs nor R 1 has changed. Therefore, the total current from the source has 
increased with the addition of the parallel resistor. Assuming that the source voltage 
is constant, an increase in the total current from the source means that the total resis-
tance has decreased, in accordance with Ohm’s law. Additional resistors connected in 
parallel will further reduce the resistance and increase the total current.

total Parallel resistance
When resistors are connected in parallel, the total resistance of the circuit de-
creases. The total resistance of a parallel circuit is always less than the value of 
the smallest resistor. For example, if a 10 Ω resistor and a 100 Ω resistor are con-
nected in parallel, the total resistance is less than 10 Ω.

Calculator Tip
The parallel-resistance formula is easily solved on a calculator using Equation 6–2. The 
general procedure is to enter the value of R1 and then take its reciprocal by  pressing 
the x -1 key. (The reciprocal is a secondary function on some calculators.) Next press 
the  + key; then enter the value of R2 and take its reciprocal using the x -1 key and 
press the + key. Repeat this procedure until all of the resistor values have been entered; 
then press ENTER (on some calculators, this is the 5 key). The final step is to press the 
x -1 key and the ENTER key to get RT. The total parallel resistance is now on the dis-
play. The display format may vary, depending on the particular calculator. For  example, 
the steps required for a typical calculator solution of Example 6–7 are as follows:

The Case of Two Resistors in Parallel
Equation 6–2 is a general formula for finding the total resistance for any number of 
resistors in parallel. The combination of two resistors in parallel occurs commonly in 
practice. Also, any number of resistors in parallel can be broken down into pairs as an 
alternate way to find the RT. Based on Equation 6–2, the formula for the total resis-
tance of two resistors in parallel is
RT =
1
a 1

Combining the terms in the denominator yields

which can be rewritten as follows:

The total resistance for two resistors in parallel is equal to the product of the two 
resistors divided by the sum of the two resistors.
This equation is sometimes referred to as the “product over the sum” formula.

The Case of Equal-Value Resistors in Parallel
Another special case of parallel circuits is the parallel connection of several resistors 
each having the same resistance value. There is a shortcut method of calculating RT 
when this case occurs.
If several resistors in parallel have the same resistance, they can be assigned the 
same symbol R. For example, R1 = R2 = R3 = . . . = Rn = R. Starting with 
Equation 6–2, you can develop a special formula for finding RT.
RT =
1
a 1
Rb + a 1
Rb + a 1
Rb + g + a 1
Rb
Notice that in the denominator, the same term, 1/R, is added n times (n is the number 
of equal-value resistors in parallel). Therefore, the formula can be written as
RT =
1
n/R
or
 
RT = R
n  
Equation 6–4
Equation 6–4 says that when any number of resistors (n), all having the same re-
sistance (R), are connected in parallel, RT is equal to the resistance divided by the 
number of resistors in parallel.
Four 8 Ω speakers are connected in parallel to the output of an amplifier. What is

Determining an Unknown Parallel Resistor
Sometimes you need to determine the values of resistors that are to be combined to 
produce a desired total resistance. For example, you use two parallel resistors to ob-
tain a known total resistance. If you know or arbitrarily choose one resistor value, 
then you can calculate the second resistor value using Equation 6–3 for two parallel 
resistors. The formula for determining the value of an unknown resistor Rx is devel-
oped as follows:

where Rx is the unknown resistor and RA is the known or selected value.
Suppose that you wish to obtain a resistance as close to 150 Ω as possible by 
combining two resistors in parallel. There is a 330 Ω resistor available. What other 
value do you need?
 
Solution 
RT = 150 Ω and RA = 330 Ω. Therefore,
Rx =
RART
RA - RT
= (330 Ω)(150 Ω)
330 Ω- 150 Ω= 275 Ω
The closest standard value is 270 𝛀.
 
Related Problem 
If you need to obtain a total resistance of 130 Ω, what value can you place in 
parallel to the parallel combination of 330 Ω and 270 Ω? First find the value of 
330 Ω and 270 Ω in parallel and treat that value as a single resistor.
EXAMPLE 6–12
Notation for Parallel Resistors
Sometimes, for convenience, parallel resistors are designated by two parallel vertical 
marks. For example, R1 in parallel with R2 can be written as R1‘R2. Also, when several 
resistors are in parallel with each other, this notation can be used. For example,
R1‘R2‘R3‘R4‘R5
indicates that R1 through R5 are all in parallel.
This notation is also used with resistance values. For example,
10 kΩ‘5 kΩ
means that a 10 kΩ resistor is in parallel with a 5 kΩ resistor.

then you can apply Ohm’s law to get the voltage. The total resistance is

Sometimes a direct measurement of resistance is not practical. For example, 
tungsten filament bulbs get hot after turning them on, causing the resistance to 
increase. An ohmmeter cannot be used in an energized circuit, therefore it can 
only measure the cold resistance. Assume you want to know the equivalent hot 
resistance of the two headlight bulbs and the two taillight bulbs in a car. The two 
headlights normally operate on 12.6 V and draw 2.8 A each when they are on.
 
(a) What is the total equivalent hot resistance when two headlights are on?
 
(b)  Assume the total current for headlights and taillights is 8.0 A when all four 
bulbs are on. What is the equivalent resistance of each taillight?
 
Solution 
(a) Use Ohm’s law to calculate the equivalent resistance of one headlight.

current sources in Parallel
As you learned in Chapter 2, a current source is a type of energy source that 
provides a constant current to a load even if the resistance of that load changes. 
A transistor or operational amplifier acts as a current source under certain 
conditions. For this reason, current sources are important in electronic circuits.

Current Sources in Parallel  ●  201
The total current produced by current sources in parallel is equal to the algebraic 
sum of the individual current sources. The algebraic sum means that you must con-
sider the direction of current when you combine the sources in parallel. For example, 
in Figure 6–29(a), the three current sources in parallel provide current in the same 
direction (into node A). So the total current into node A is
IT = 1 A + 2 A + 2 A = 5 A
In Figure 6–29(b), the 1 A source provides current in a direction opposite to the 
other two. The total current into node A in this case is
IT = 2 A + 2 A - 1 A = 3 A
Although the study of transistors and operational amplifiers is beyond the scope 
of this book, you should understand how current sources act in parallel.

202  ●  Parallel Circuits
In a parallel circuit, the total current into the junction of the parallel branches 
divides among the branches. Thus, a parallel circuit acts as a current divider. This 
current-divider principle is illustrated in Figure 6–32 for a two-branch parallel circuit 
in which part of the total current IT goes through R1 and part through R2.
Since the same voltage is across each of the resistors in parallel, the branch currents 
are inversely proportional to the values of the resistors. For example, if the value of 
R2 is twice that of R1, then the value of I2 is one-half that of I1. In other words,
The total current divides among parallel resistors into currents with values inversely 
proportional to the resistance values.
The branches with higher resistance have less current, and the branches with lower 
resistance have more current, in accordance with Ohm’s law. If all the branches have 
the same resistance, the branch currents are all equal.
Figure 6–33 shows specific values to demonstrate how the currents divide ac-
cording to the branch resistances. Notice that in this case the resistance of the upper 
branch is one-tenth the resistance of the lower branch, but the upper branch current is 
ten times the lower branch current.

The branch with the lower resistance

The current through any one of the parallel resistors is Ix, where x represents the 
number of a particular resistor (1, 2, 3, and so on). By Ohm’s law, you can express the 
current through any one of the resistors in Figure 6–34 as follows:
Ix = VS

The source voltage, VS, appears across each of the parallel resistors, and Rx represents 
any one of the parallel resistors. The total source voltage, VS, is equal to the total cur-
rent times the total parallel resistance.

Power in Parallel circuits
Total power in a parallel circuit is found by adding up the powers of all the individual 
resistors, the same as for series circuits.

◆Determine power in a parallel circuit
Equation 6–9 states the formula for finding total power in a concise way for any 
number of resistors in parallel.
Equation 6–9 
PT = P1 + P2 + P3 + g + Pn
where PT is the total power and Pn is the power in the last resistor in parallel. As you 
can see, the powers are additive, just as in a series circuit.
The power formulas in Chapter 4 are directly applicable to parallel circuits. The 
following formulas are used to calculate the total power PT:
PT = VIT
PT = I 2
TRT
PT = V 2
RT
where V is the voltage across the parallel circuit, IT is the total current into the parallel 
circuit, and RT is the total resistance of the parallel circuit. Examples 6–19 and 6–20

The easiest power formula to use is PT = I 2
TRT because you know both IT and RT.
PT = I 2
TRT = (200 mA)2(11.1 Ω) = 442 mW
Let’s demonstrate that if you determine the power in each resistor and if you 
add all of these values together, you will get the same result. First, find the voltage 
across each branch of the circuit.
V = ITRT = (200 mA)(11.1 Ω) = 2.21 V
Remember that the voltage across all branches is the same.
Next, use P = V 2/R to calculate the power for each resistor.
P1 = (2.22 V)2
68 Ω
= 71.8 mW
P2 = (2.22 V)2
33 Ω
= 148 mW
P3 = (2.22 V)2
22 Ω
= 222 mW
Add these powers to get the total power.
PT = 71.8 mW + 148 mW + 222 mW = 442 mW
This calculation shows that the sum of the individual powers is equal to the total 
power as determined by one of the power formulas.

Automotive
One advantage of a parallel circuit over a series circuit is that when one branch opens, 
the other branches are not affected. For example, Figure 6–42 shows a simplified dia-
gram of an automobile lighting system. When one headlight on a car goes out, it does 
not cause the other lights to go out because they are all in parallel.
Notice that the brake lights are switched on independently of the headlights and 
taillights. They come on only when the driver closes the brake light switch by depress-
ing the brake pedal. When the lights switch is closed, both headlights and both tail-
lights are on. When the headlights are on, the parking lights are off and vice versa, as 
indicated by the dashed line connecting the switches. The back-up lights are switched 
on when the reverse gear is engaged. If any one of the lights burns out (opens), there 
is still current in each of the other lights.

Parallel circuit aPPlications
Parallel circuits are found in some form in virtually every electronic system. In 
many of these applications, the parallel relationship of components may not be 
obvious until you have covered some advanced topics that you will study later. For 
now, let’s look at some examples of common and familiar applications of parallel 
circuits.

*Voltage is ac in this case; but resistive (real) power is determined the same for ac voltage,

Parallel Circuit Applications  ●  209
Another automotive application of parallel resistances is the rear window defroster 
as previously shown in Example 6–11. As you know, power is dissipated in the resis-
tance element in the form of heat. The resistive elements warm the glass to remove 
frost when power is applied. A typical defroster can dissipate over 100 W across the 
window. Although resistance heating is not as efficient as other forms of heat, in this 
application it is simple and cost effective.
Residential
Another common use of parallel circuits is in residential electrical systems. All the 
lights and appliances in a home are wired in parallel. Figure 6–43 shows a typical 
room wiring arrangement with two switch-controlled lights and three wall outlets in 
parallel.

Control Circuits
Many control systems use parallel circuits or equivalent circuits for control and 
monitoring an industrial process such as a production line. Most complex control 
applications are implemented on a dedicated computer called a programmable logic 
controller (PLC). A PLC shows an equivalent parallel circuit, which is displayed on 
a computer screen. Internally, the circuit may exist only as a computer code, written 
in a computer programming language. However, the displayed circuit is one that 
could in principle be constructed with hardware. These circuits can be drawn to re-
semble a ladder—with rungs representing the load (and a source) and the rails rep-
resenting the two principal nodes. (For example, notice that Figure 6–43 resembles a 

210  ●  Parallel Circuits
ladder on its side, with the lights and wall outlets as loads.) Parallel control circuits 
use ladder diagrams but add additional control elements (switches, relays, timers, 
and more). The result of adding the control elements creates a logical diagram, 
which is referred to as ladder logic. Ladder logic is easy to understand, so it is popu-
lar for showing control logic in industrial environments, such as factories or food 
processors. Although many books have been written about ladder logic, but a lad-
der diagram (parallel circuit) is at the core of all ladder logic. The most important 
aspect is that ladder logic shows the basic functionality of the circuit in an easy-to-
read format.
Analog Ammeters
Parallel circuits are used in the analog (needle-type) ammeter or milliammeter. Although 
analog meters are not as common as they once were, they are still used as panel meters 
in certain applications and analog multimeters are still available. Parallel circuits are an 
important part of analog ammeter operation because they allow the selection of various 
ranges in order to measure many different current values.
The mechanism in an ammeter that causes the pointer to move in proportion to 
the current is called the meter movement, which is based on a magnetic principle that 
you will learn later. Right now, it is sufficient to know that a given meter movement 
has a certain resistance and a maximum current. This maximum current, called the 
full-scale deflection current, causes the pointer to go all the way to the end of the scale. 
For example, a certain meter movement has a 50 Ω resistance and a full-scale deflec-
tion current of 1 mA. A meter with this particular movement can measure currents of 
1 mA or less as indicated in Figure 6–44(a) and (b). Currents greater than 1 mA will 
cause the pointer to “peg” (or stop) slightly past the full scale mark as indicated in 
part (c), which can damage the meter.

Figure 6–45 shows a simple ammeter with a resistor in parallel with the 1 mA meter 
movement; this resistor is called a shunt resistor. Its purpose is to bypass a portion of 
current around the meter movement to extend the range of current that can be mea-
sured. The figure specifically shows 9 mA through the shunt resistor and 1 mA through 
the meter movement. Thus, up to 10 mA can be measured. To find the actual current 
value, simply multiply the reading on the scale by 10.
A multiple-range ammeter has a range switch that permits the selection of sev-
eral full-scale current settings. In each switch position, a certain amount of current 
is bypassed through a parallel resistor as determined by the resistance value. In our 
example, the current though the movement is never greater than 1 mA.

Figure 6–46 illustrates a meter with three ranges: 1 mA, 10 mA, and 100 mA. When 
the range switch is in the 1 mA position, all of the current into the meter goes through 
the meter movement. In the 10 mA setting, up to 9 mA goes through RSH1 and up to 
1 mA through the movement. In the 100 mA setting, up to 99 mA goes through RSH2, 
and the movement can still have only 1 mA for full-scale.
SECTION 6–9
CHECKUP
1. What is the purpose of a shunt resistor in an analog meter movement?
2. Do the shunt resistors have resistance values considerably less than or more than 
that of the meter movement? Why?
The scale reading is interpreted based on the range setting. For example, in Figure 6–46, 
if 50 mA of current are being measured, the needle points at the 0.5 mark on the scale; 
you must multiply 0.5 by 100 to find the current value. In this situation, 0.5 mA would be 
through the movement (half-scale deflection) and 49.5 mA are through RSH2.

212  ●  Parallel Circuits
Open Branches
If a switch is connected in a branch of a parallel circuit, as shown in Figure 6–47, 
an open or a closed path can be made by the switch. When the switch is closed, as in 
Figure 6–47(a), R1  and R2  are in parallel. The total resistance is 50 Ω (two 100 Ω 
resistors in parallel). Current is through both resistors. If the switch is opened, as in 
Figure 6–47(b), R1  is effectively removed from the circuit, and the total resistance is 
100 Ω. Current is now only through R2. In general,
When an open occurs in a parallel branch, the total resistance increases, the total cur-
rent decreases, and the same current continues through each of the remaining parallel 
paths.
The decrease in total current equals the amount of current that was previously in the 
open branch. The other branch currents remain the same.
Consider the lamp circuit in Figure 6–48. There are four bulbs in parallel with a 12 V  
source. In part (a), there is current through each bulb. Now suppose that one of the 
bulbs burns out, creating an open path as shown in Figure 6–48(b). This light will go 
out because there is no current through the open path. Notice, however, that current 
continues through all the other parallel bulbs, and they continue to glow. The open 
branch does not change the voltage across the parallel branches; it remains at 12 V, 
and the current through each branch remains the same.
You can see that a parallel circuit has an advantage over a series circuit in lighting 
systems because if one or more of the parallel bulbs burn out, the others will stay on. 
In a series circuit, when one bulb goes out, all of the others go out also because the 
current path is completely interrupted.
When a resistor in a parallel circuit opens, the open resistor cannot be located 
by measurement of the voltage across the branches because the same voltage exists 
across all the branches. Thus, there is no way to tell which resistor is open by simply 
measuring voltage. The good resistors will always have the same voltage as the open 
one, as illustrated in Figure 6–49 (note that the middle resistor is open).

Recall that an open circuit is one in which the current path is interrupted and there 
is no current. In this section, we examine what happens when a branch of a parallel 
circuit opens.

Troubleshooting  ●  213
If a visual inspection does not reveal the open resistor, it must be located by cur-
rent measurements. In practice, measuring current is more difficult than measuring 
voltage because you must insert the ammeter in series to measure the current. Thus, 
a wire or a PC board connection must typically be cut or disconnected, or one end 
of a component must be lifted off the circuit board, in order to connect the ammeter 
in  series. This procedure, of course, is not required when voltage measurements are 
made because the meter leads are simply connected across a component.
An alternative to inserting an ammeter is to use a digital pulser and a second sens-
ing instrument called a current tracer. The pulser injects a series of digital pulses on 
a conductor. The current tracer can sense the magnetic field generated by the pulser 
and follow the current path. It is particularly useful for finding an open or shorted 
path.
Finding an Open Branch by Current Measurement
In a parallel circuit with a suspected open branch, the total current can be measured 
to find the open. When a parallel resistor opens, the total current, IT, is always less than 
its normal value. Once you know IT and the voltage across the branches, a few calcula-
tions will determine the open resistor when all the resistors are of different resistance 
values.
Consider the two-branch circuit in Figure 6–50(a). If one of the resistors opens, the 
total current will equal the current in the good resistor. Ohm’s law quickly tells you 
what the current in each resistor should be.
 I1 =
50 V
560 Ω= 89.3 mA
 I2 =
50 V
100 Ω= 500 mA
 IT = I1 + I2 = 589.3 mA
If R2  is open, the total current is 89.3 mA, as indicated in Figure 6–50(b). If R1  is 
open, the total current is 500 mA, as indicated in Figure 6–50(c).

214  ●  Parallel Circuits
This procedure can be extended to any number of branches having unequal re-
sistances. If the parallel resistances are all equal, the current in each branch must be 
checked until a branch is found with no current. This is the open resistor.
EXAMPLE 6–22
 
Solution 
Calculate the current in each branch.
I1 = V

I2 = V
R2

4.7 kΩ= 4.26 mA

R3
=
20 V
2.2 kΩ= 9.09 mA
I4 = V
R4
=
20 V
1.0 kΩ= 20 mA
The total current should be
IT = I1 + I2 + I3 + I4 = 2 mA + 4.26 mA + 9.09 mA + 20 mA = 35.35 mA
The actual measured current is 31.09 mA, as stated, which is 4.26 mA less than nor-
mal, indicating that the branch carrying 4.26 mA is open. Thus, R2 must be open.

What is the total current measured in Figure 6–51 if R4 and not R2 is open?
Finding an Open Branch by Resistance Measurement
If the parallel circuit to be checked can be disconnected from its voltage source and 
from any other circuit to which it may be connected, a measurement of the total resis-
tance can be used to locate an open branch.
Recall that conductance, G, is the reciprocal of resistance (1/R) and its unit is the 
siemens (S). The total conductance of a parallel circuit is the sum of the conductances 
of all the resistors.
GT = G1 + G2 + G3 + g + Gn
To locate an open branch, do the following steps:
1. Calculate what the total conductance should be using the individual resistor values.

Shorted Branches
When a branch in a parallel circuit shorts, the current increases to an excessive value, 
causing a fuse or circuit breaker to blow. This results in a difficult troubleshooting 
problem because it is hard to isolate the shorted branch.
As mentioned previously, pulser and a current tracer are tools often used to find 
shorts in a circuit. They are not restricted to use in digital circuits but can be effective 
in any type of circuit. The pulser is a pen-shaped tool that applies pulses to a selected 
point in a circuit, causing pulses of current to flow through the shorted path. The 
current tracer is also a pen-shaped tool that senses pulses of current. By following the 
current with the tracer, the current path can be identified.
Thermal Imaging
A non-contact method for looking at circuits is thermal imaging. Thermal imaging uses a 
special camera to capture IR energy and convert the temperature differences into an image. 
The camera assigns different colors to the image based on those differences. Thermal im-
aging is widely used to inspect buildings for heat loss, but is also applied to electrical ap-
plications to find electrical problems, with primary use in industrial environments where 
currents are generally higher. Thermal imaging looks for temperature differences rather 
than measuring actual temperatures. For parallel resistors, a hotter or colder resistor will 
stand out on a thermal image, to give an indication of where a problem might be.
A shorted branch can sometimes can be isolated using a current-limited voltage 
supply to limit the current to a low but safe value for the circuit. An IR camera can 
pick up the heat signature to find the short without requiring the circuit to be opened. 
The FLIR ONE Pro in Figure 6–53 is an example of a low-cost IR sensor that con-
verts a smart phone into a thermal camera.

CHECKUP
1. If a parallel branch opens, what changes can be detected in the circuit’s voltage and 
the currents, assuming that the parallel circuit is across a constant-voltage source?
2. What happens to the total resistance if one branch opens?
3. If several light bulbs are connected in parallel and one of the bulbs opens (burns 
out), will the others continue to glow?
4. There is 100 mA of current in each branch of a parallel circuit. If one branch opens, 
what is the current in each of the remaining branches?
5. A three-branch circuit normally has the following branch currents: 100 mA, 250 mA, 
and 120 mA. If the total current measures 350 mA, which branch is open?
In this application activity, a 
dc power supply is modified by 
adding a 3-range ammeter to indicate current to the load. As 
you have learned, parallel resistances can be used to extend the 
range of an ammeter. These parallel resistors, called shunts, 
bypass current around the meter movement, allowing for the 
meter to effectively measure higher currents than the maxi-
mum current for which the meter movement is designed.
The Power Supply
A rack-mounted power supply is shown in Figure 6–54.  
The voltmeter indicates the output voltage, which can be 
 adjusted from 0 V to 10 V using the voltage control. The 
power supply is capable of providing up to 2 A to a load.  
A basic block diagram of the power supply is shown in 
Figure 6–55. It consists of a rectifier circuit that converts 
ac voltage from the wall outlet to dc voltage and a regulator 
circuit that keeps the output voltage at a constant value.

It is required that the power supply be modified by add-
ing an ammeter with three switch-selected current ranges of 
25 mA, 250 mA, and 2.5 A. To accomplish this, two shunt 
resistances are used that can each be switched into a parallel 
connection with the meter movement. This approach works 
fine as long as the required values of the shunt resistors are 
not too small. However, there are problems at very low values 
of shunt resistance and you will see why next.

218  ●  Parallel Circuits
The Shunt Circuit
An ammeter is selected that has a full-scale deflection of 
25 mA and a resistance of 6 Ω. Two shunt resistors must be 
added—one for 250 mA and one for 2.5 A full-scale deflec-
tions. The internal meter movement provides the 25 mA 
range. This is shown in Figure 6–56. The range selection is 
provided by a 1-pole, 3-position rotary switch with a contact 
resistance of 50 mΩ. Contact resistance of switches can be 
from less than 20 mΩ to about 100 mΩ. The contact resis-
tance of a given switch can vary with temperature, current, 
and usage and, therefore, cannot be relied upon to remain 
within a reasonable tolerance of the specified value. Also, the 
switch is a make-before-break type, which means that contact 
with the previous position is not broken until contact with the 
new position is made.
The shunt resistance value for the 2.5 A range is determined 
as follows where the voltage across the meter movement is
VM = IMRM = (25 mA)(6 Ω) = 150 mV
The current through the shunt resistor for full-scale 
 deflection is
ISH2 = IFULL SCALE - IM = 2.5 A - 25 mA = 2.475 A
The total shunt resistance is
RSH2(tot) = VM
ISH2
= 150 mV
2.475 A = 60.6 mΩ
Low-ohm precision resistors are generally available in values 
from 1 mΩ to 10 Ω or greater from various manufacturers.
Notice in Figure 6–56 that the contact resistance, RCONT, 
of the switch appears in series with RSH2. Since the total shunt 
 resistance must be 60.6 mΩ, the value of the shunt resistor 
RSH2 is
RSH2 = RSH2(tot) - RCONT = 60.6 mΩ - 50 mΩ = 10.6 mΩ

▲FIGURE 6–56

Although this value, or one close to it, may be available, the 
problem in this case is that the switch contact resistance is 
nearly five times that of RSH2 and any variation in it would 
create a significant inaccuracy in the meter. As you can see, this 
approach is not acceptable for these particular requirements.
Another Approach
A variation of the standard shunt resistance circuit is shown 
in Figure 6–57. The shunt resistor, RSH, is connected in paral-
lel for the two higher current range settings and disconnected 
for the 25 mA setting using a 2-pole, 3-position switch. This 
circuit avoids dependency on the switch contact resistance 
by using resistor values that are large enough to make it 
insignificant. The disadvantages of this meter circuit are that 
it requires a more complex switch and the voltage drops from 
input to output are greater than in the previous shunt circuit.
For the 250 mA range, the current through the meter 
movement for full-scale deflection is 25 mA. The voltage 
across the meter movement is 150 mV.
ISH = 250 mA - 25 mA = 225 mA
RSH = 150 mV
225 mA = 0.667 Ω= 667 mΩ
This value of RSH is more than thirteen times the expected 
switch contact resistance of 50 mΩ, thus minimizing the 
 effect of the contact resistance.
For the 2.5 A range, the current through the meter move-
ment for full-scale deflection is still 25 mA. This is also the 
current through R1.
ISH = 2.5 A - 25 mA = 2.475 A
The voltage across the meter circuit from A to B is
VAB = ISHRSH = (2.475 A)(667 mΩ) = 1.65 V
Applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law and Ohm’s law to find R1,

Application Activity  ●  219
 VR1 + VM = VAB
 VR1 = VAB - VM = 1.65 V - 150 mV = 1.50 V
 R1 = VR1
IM
= 1.50 V
25 mA = 60 Ω
This value is much greater than the contact resistance of the 
switch.
1. Determine the maximum power dissipated by RSH in 
Figure 6–57 for each range setting.
2. How much voltage is there from A to B in Figure 6–57 
when the switch is set to the 2.5 A range and the current 
is 1 A?
3. The meter indicates 250 mA. How much does the voltage 
across the meter circuit from A to B change when the 
switch is moved from the 250 mA position to the 2.5 A 
position?
4. Assume the meter movement has a resistance of 4 Ω 
 instead of 6 Ω. Specify any changes necessary in the 
circuit of Figure 6–57.
Implementing the Power Supply Modification
Once the proper values are obtained, the resistors are placed 
on a board which is then mounted in the power supply. The 
resistors and the range switch are connected to the power 
supply as shown in Figure 6–58. The ammeter circuit is 
connected between the rectifier circuit in the power supply 
and the regulator circuit in order to reduce the impact of the 
voltage drop across the meter circuit on the output voltage. 
The regulator maintains, within certain limits, a constant dc 
output voltage even though its input voltage coming through 
the meter circuit may change.

INTRODUCTION
In Chapters 5 and 6, series circuits and parallel circuits were 
studied individually. In this chapter, both series and parallel 
resistors are combined into series-parallel circuits. In many 
practical situations, you will have both series and parallel 
combinations within the same circuit, and the analysis meth-
ods you learned for series circuits and for parallel circuits 
will apply.
Important types of series-parallel circuits are intro-
duced in this chapter. These circuits include the voltage 
divider with a resistive load, the ladder network, and the 
Wheatstone bridge. Ideal circuit elements are assumed in-
cluding voltage and current sources as well as linear resistors 
to form equivalent circuits. The methods you learn in this 
chapter with ideal components can later be applied with 
modifications to more complex practical circuits.
The analysis of series-parallel circuits requires the use of 
Ohm’s law, Kirchhoff’s voltage and current laws, and the 
methods for finding total resistance and power that you 
learned in the last two chapters. The topic of loaded voltage 
dividers is important because this type of circuit is found 
in many practical situations, such as the voltage-divider 
bias circuit for a transistor amplifier. Ladder networks 
are important in several areas, including a major type of 
 digital-to- analog conversion, which you will study in a digi-
tal fundamentals course. The Wheatstone bridge is used in 
many types of systems for the measurement of unknown 
parameters, including most electronic scales.

236  ●  Series-Parallel Circuits
Figure 7–1(a) shows an example of a simple series-parallel combination of  resistors. 
Notice that the resistance from point A to point B is R1. The resistance from point 
B to point C is R2 and R3 in parallel (R2 }R3).  The total resistance from point A to 
point C is R1 in series with the parallel combination of R2 and R3, as indicated in 
Figure 7–1(b). The term point can refer to either a node or a terminal. For example, 
in Figure 7–1(a), A is a terminal because it is an end point, B is a node because it is 
the junction of two or more components, and C is both a terminal and a node. So, the 
term point will sometimes be used to represent either or both.
When the circuit of Figure 7–1(a) is connected to a voltage source as shown in 
Figure 7–1(c), the total current is through R1 and divides at point B into the two par-
allel paths. These two branch currents then recombine, and the total current is into 
the negative source terminal as shown.
Now, to illustrate series-parallel relationships, let’s increase the complexity of 
the circuit in Figure 7–1(a) step-by-step. In Figure 7–2(a), another resistor (R4)

Solution 
Starting at the positive terminal of the source, follow the current paths. All of the 
current produced by the source must go through R1, which is in series with the rest 
of the circuit.
The total current takes two paths when it gets to node A. Part of it is through 
R2, and part of it is through R3. Resistors R2 and R3 are in parallel with each 
other, and this parallel combination is in series with R1.
At node B, the currents through R2 and R3 come together again. Thus, the total 
current is through R4. Resistor R4 is in series with R1 and the parallel combination 
of R2 and R3. The currents are shown in Figure 7–6, where IT is the total current.
In summary, R1 and R4 are in series with the parallel combination of R2 and 
R3. From precedence rules, R2 and R3 are solved first and the result is added to R1 
and R4 as given by the following expression:
R1 + R2 }R3 + R4

do not have basic series and parallel combinations. Other methods are needed for these 
cases, as we will discuss later.
Total Resistance
In Chapter 5, you learned how to determine total series resistance. In Chapter 6, you 
learned how to determine total parallel resistance. To find the total resistance (RT) 
of a series-parallel combination, simply define the series and parallel relationships; 
then perform the calculations that you have previously learned. The following two 
examples illustrate this general approach.
Find the total resistance between the positive and negative terminals of the battery 
in Figure 7–17.

EXAMPLE 7–6
 
Solution 
First, calculate the equivalent parallel resistance of R2 and R3. Since R2 and R3 
are equal in value, you can use Equation 6–4.
R2}3 = R
n = 100 Ω
2
= 50 Ω
Notice that the term R2}3 is used here to designate the total resistance of a 
 portion of a circuit in order to distinguish it from the total resistance, RT, of the 
complete circuit.
Now, since R1 is in series with R2}3, add their values as follows:
RT = R1 + R2}3 = 10 Ω+ 50 Ω= 60 𝛀

Total Current
Once you know the total resistance and the source voltage, you can apply Ohm’s law 
to find the total current in a circuit. Total current is the source voltage divided by the 
total resistance.
IT = VS
RT
For example, assuming that the source voltage is 10 V, the total current in the circuit 
of Example 7–7 (Figure 7–17) is
IT = VS
RT
=
10 V
148.4 Ω= 67.4 mA
 
Solution 
In the upper branch, R2 is in series with R3. This series combination is designated 
R2 + 3 and is equal to R2 + R3.
R2 + 3 = R2 + R3 = 47 Ω+ 47 Ω= 94 Ω
In the lower branch, R4 and R5 are in parallel with each other. This parallel 
combination is designated R4}5.
R4}5 =
R4R5
R4 + R5
= (68 Ω)(39 Ω)
68 Ω+ 39 Ω= 24.8 Ω
Also in the lower branch, the parallel combination of R4 and R5 is in series 
with R6. This series-parallel combination is designated R4}5 + 6.
R4}5 + 6 = R6 + R4}5 = 75 Ω+ 24.8 Ω= 99.8 Ω
Figure 7–18 shows the original circuit in a simplified equivalent form.
Now you can find the equivalent resistance between A and B. It is R2 + 3 in 
 parallel with R4}5 + 6. Calculate the equivalent resistance as follows:

know RT.
RT =   R1 +
R2R3
R2 + R3

Branch Currents
Using the current-divider formula, Kirchhoff’s current law, Ohm’s law, or combina-
tions of these, you can find the current in any branch of a series-parallel circuit. In 
some cases, it may take repeated application of the formula to find a given current. 
The following two examples will help you understand the procedure. (Notice that the 
subscripts for the current variables (I) match the R subscripts; for example, current 
through R1 is referred to as I1.)
EXAMPLE 7–8

Determine the current through R4 in Figure 7–20 if VS = 5 V.
EXAMPLE 7–9
 
Solution 
First, find the current (I2) into node B. Once you know this current, use the 
 current-divider formula to find I4, the current through R4.
Notice that there are two main branches in the circuit. The left-most branch con-
sists of only R1. The right-most branch has R2 in series with the parallel combination 
of R3 and R4. The voltage across both of these main branches is the same and equal 
to 5 V. Calculate the equivalent resistance (R2 + 3}4) of the right-most main branch and 
then apply Ohm’s law; I2 is the total current through this main branch. Thus,

Voltage Drops
To find the voltages across certain parts of a series-parallel circuit, you can use the 
voltage-divider formula given in Chapter 5, Kirchhoff’s voltage law, Ohm’s law, or 
combinations of each. The following three examples illustrate use of the formulas. 
(The subscripts for V match the subscripts for the corresponding R: V1 is the voltage 
across R1; V2 is the voltage across R2; etc.)
Determine the voltage drop from node A to ground in Figure 7–21. Then find 
the voltage (V1) across R1.

Solution 
Note that R2 and R3 are in parallel in this circuit. Since they are equal in value, 
their equivalent resistance from node A to ground is
RA = 560 Ω

In the equivalent circuit shown in Figure 7–22, R1 is in series with RA. The total 
circuit resistance as seen from the source is
RT = R1 + RA = 150 Ω+ 280 Ω= 430 Ω

The voltages across R1 and R2 are
V1 = I1R1 = (688 mA)(1.0 kΩ) = 688 mV

The currents through R4 and R5 are the same because these resistors are in series.
I4 = I5 = IT - I3 = 1 mA - 346 mA = 654 mA
Calculate the voltages across R4 and R5 as follows:

voltage-divider formula. First, you need to reduce each parallel combination to an 
 equivalent  resistance. Since R1 and R2 are in parallel between A and B, combine 
their values.
RAB =
R1R2
R1 + R2
= (3.3 kΩ)(6.2 kΩ)
9.5 kΩ
= 2.15 kΩ
Since R4 is in parallel with the R5 and R6 series combination (R5 + 6) between  
C and D, combine these values.
RCD =
R4R5 + 6
R4 + R5 + 6
= (1.0 kΩ)(1.07 kΩ)
2.07 kΩ
= 517 Ω
The equivalent circuit is drawn in Figure 7–25. The total circuit resistance is
RT = RAB + R3 + RCD = 2.15 kΩ+ 1.0 kΩ+ 517 Ω= 3.67 kΩ
Next, use the voltage-divider formula to determine the voltages in the equivalent circuit.
VAB = aRAB
RT
bVS = a2.15 kΩ
3.67 kΩb8 V = 4.69 V
VCD = aRCD
RT
bVS = a 517 Ω
3.67 kΩb8 V = 1.13 V
V3 = a R3
RT
bVS = a 1.0 kΩ
3.67 kΩb8 V = 2.18 V
Refer to Figure 7–24. VAB equals the voltage across both R1 and R2, so
V1 = V2 = VAB = 4.69 V
VCD is the voltage across R4 and across the series combination of R5 and R6. Therefore,
V4 = VCD = 1.13 V
Now apply the voltage-divider formula to the series combination of R5 and  
R6 to get V5 and V6.
 V5 = a
R5
R5 + R6
bVCD = a 680 Ω

 V6 = a

Voltage Dividers with Resistive Loads  ●  249
The voltage divider in Figure 7–28(a) produces an output voltage (VOUT) of 5 V 
because the two resistors are of equal value. This voltage is the unloaded output 
 voltage. When a load resistor, RL, is connected from the output to ground as shown in 
Figure 7–28(b), the output voltage is reduced by an amount that depends on the value 
of RL. The load resistor is in parallel with R2, reducing the resistance from node A 
to ground and, as a result, also reducing the voltage across the parallel combination.

250  ●  Series-Parallel Circuits
This is one effect of loading a voltage divider. Another effect of a load is that more 
current is drawn from the source because the total resistance of the circuit is reduced.
The larger RL is, compared to R2, the less the output voltage is reduced from its 
unloaded value, as illustrated in Figure 7–29. When RL is large compared to R2 (at 
least 10 times), the loading effect is small, and the output voltage will change only a 
small amount from its unloaded value, as shown in Figure 7–29(c). In this case, the 
divider is said to be a stiff voltage divider.

Voltage Dividers with Resistive Loads  ●  251
A voltage divider is in a transistor amplifier bias network is shown in Figure 7–32(a). 
The input to the transistor can be modeled as a single resistor, RIN, as shown in 
Figure 7–32(b). (The method for finding RIN is studied in devices courses.) Our focus 
here is the effect of loading for the equivalent circuit, which is modeled in (b) as a 
voltage-divider with a resistive load. From the modeled circuit, determine the voltage 
at A and the current into the transistor, IIN.

Notice that RIN is in parallel with R2. The resistance of this parallel combination 
is R(IN + 2):

A Practical Application
A practical application of a voltage divider with a resistive load occurs in certain tran-
sistor amplifiers. The transistor’s input circuit can be modeled as a resistance that acts 
exactly like a load resistor on a voltage divider. The voltage divider sets the dc volt-
age (called bias) for the transistor to operate properly. The next example illustrates a 
practical example. Keep in mind that our focus here is on the effect of the equivalent 
resistive load on the bias rather than the transistor.
The equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 7–31(b). The loaded output voltage is
VOUT(loaded) = a
R2 }RL
R1 + R2 }RL
bVS = a 9.1 kΩ
13.8 kΩb5 V = 3.30 V
For the smaller value of RL, the reduction in VOUT is
3.40 V - 2.58 V = 0.82 V  (a 24% drop in output voltage)
For the larger value of RL, the reduction in VOUT is
3.40 V - 3.30 V = 0.10 V  (a 3% drop in output voltage)
This illustrates the loading effect of RL on the voltage divider.

Load Current and Bleeder Current
In a multiple-tap loaded voltage-divider circuit, the total current drawn from the source 
consists of currents through the load resistors, called load currents, and the divider resis-
tors. Figure 7–33 shows a voltage divider with two voltage outputs or two taps. Notice 
that the total current, IT, through R1 enters node A where the current divides into IRL1 
through RL1 and into I2 through R2. At node B, the current I2 divides into IRL2 through 
RRL2 and into I3 through R3. Current I3 is called the bleeder current, which is the cur-
rent left after the total load current is subtracted from the total current in the circuit.

Voltage Dividers with Resistive Loads  ●  253
Determine the load currents IRL1 and IRL2 and the bleeder current I3 in the two-
tap loaded voltage divider in Figure 7–33.
 
Solution 
The equivalent resistance from node A to ground is the 100 kΩ load resistor  
RL1 in parallel with the combination of R2 in series with the parallel combination  
of R3 and RL2. Determine the resistance values first. R3 in parallel with RL2 is  
designated RB. The resulting equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 7–34(a).
RB =

R3 + RL2

R2 in series with RB is designated R2 + B. The resulting equivalent circuit is shown 
in Figure 7–34(b).
R2 + B = R2 + RB = 6.2 kΩ+ 5.84 kΩ= 12.0 kΩ
RL1 in parallel with R2 + B is designated RA. The resulting equivalent circuit is

loading effect of a voltMeter
As you have learned, voltmeters must be connected in parallel with a resistor in 
order to measure the voltage across the resistor. Because of its internal resistance, 
a voltmeter puts a load on the circuit and will affect, to a certain extent, the volt-
age that is being measured. Until now, we have ignored the loading effect because 
the internal resistance of a voltmeter is very high, and normally it has negligible 
effect on the circuit that is being measured. However, if the internal resistance of 
the voltmeter is not sufficiently greater than the circuit resistance across which it 
is connected, the loading effect will cause the measured voltage to be less than its 
actual value. You should always be aware of this effect.

Loading Effect of a Voltmeter  ●  255
If RM is much greater than R3, the resistance from A to B changes very little, and 
the meter indicates the actual voltage. If RM is not sufficiently greater than R3, the 
resistance from A to B is reduced significantly, and the voltage across R3 is altered 
by the loading effect of the meter. A good rule of thumb for troubleshooting work is 
that if the loading effect is less than 10%, it can usually be neglected, depending on the 
accuracy required.
Most voltmeters are part of a multifunction instrument such as the DMM or the 
analog multimeter discussed in Chapter 2. The voltmeter in a DMM will typically have 
an internal resistance of 10 MΩ or more, so the loading effect is important only in 
very high-resistance circuits. DMMs have a constant resistance on all ranges because 
the input is connected to an internal fixed voltage divider. For analog  multimeters, 
the internal resistance depends on the range selected for making a measurement. To 
 determine the loading effect, you need to know the sensitivity of the meter, a value 
given by the manufacturer on the meter or in the manual. Sensitivity is expressed in 
ohms/volt and is typically about 20,000 Ω>V. To determine the internal series resis-
tance, multiply the sensitivity by the maximum voltage on the range  selected. For 
example, a 20,000 Ω>V meter will have an internal resistance of 20,000 Ω on the 
1 V range and 200,000 Ω on the 10 V range. As you can see, there is a smaller loading 
effect for higher voltage ranges than for lower ones on the analog multimeter.
When a voltmeter is connected to a circuit as shown, for example, in Figure 7–35(a), 
its internal resistance appears in parallel with R3, as shown in part (b). The resistance 
from A to B is altered by the loading effect of the voltmeter’s internal resistance, RM, 
and is equal to R3 }RM, as indicated in part (c).

Ladder networks such as the one in Figure 7–37 can be useful in certain cases. For 
 example, you can use a ladder to provide certain reference voltages. See if you can 
figure out VA, VB, and VC in the following example before looking at the solution.
Determine the current through each resistor and the voltage at each labeled node 
with respect to ground in the ladder network of Figure 7–38.
EXAMPLE 7–17
Next, neglecting the circuit to the left of node A, the resistance from node A to 
ground (RA) is R2 in parallel with the series combination of R3 and RB. Calculate 
resistance RA.
RA =
R2(R3 + RB)
R2 + (R3 + RB) = (10 kΩ)(10 kΩ)
20 kΩ
= 5.0 kΩ
 
Solution 
To find the current through each resistor, you must know the total current from 
the source (IT). To obtain IT, you must find the total resistance “seen” by the source.
Determine RT in a step-by-step process, starting at the right of the circuit 
diagram. First, notice that R5 and R6 are in series across R4. Neglecting the circuit 
to the left of node B, the resistance from node B to ground is
RB =

The R>2R Ladder Network
The general form for an R>2R ladder network is shown in Figure 7–41. As you can see, 
the name comes from the relationship of the resistor values. R represents a common 
value, and one set of resistors has twice the value of the others. This type of ladder 
Using RA, you can further simplify the equivalent circuit of Figure 7–39 as 
shown in Figure 7–40.
Finally, the total resistance “seen” by the source is R1 in series with RA.
RT = R1 + RA = 1.0 kΩ+ 5.0 kΩ= 6.0 kΩ
The total circuit current is
IT = VS
RT
=
12 V
6.0 kΩ= 2.00 mA
As indicated in Figure 7–39, IT is into node A and divides between R2 and the 
branch containing R3 + RB. Since the branch resistances are equal in this par-
ticular example, half the total current is through R2 and half into node B. So the 
currents through R2 and R3 are
I2 = 1.00 mA
I3 = 1.00 mA
If the branch resistances are not equal, use the current-divider formula. As indicat-
ed in Figure 7–38. I3 is into node B and is divided between R4 and the branch contain-
ing R5 + R6. Therefore, the currents through R4, R5, and R6 can be calculated.
I4 = a
R5 + R6
R4 + (R5 + R6) bI3 = a10 kΩ
20 kΩb1.00 mA = 0.50 mA
 I5 = I6 = I3 - I4 = 1.00 mA - 0.50 mA = 0.50 mA
To determine VA, VB, and VC, apply Ohm’s law.

network is used in applications where digital codes are converted to speech, music, or 
other types of analog signals as found, for example, in the area of digital recording 
and reproduction. This application is called digital-to-analog (D>A)  conversion.
Let’s examine the general operation of a basic R>2R  ladder using the four-step 
circuit in Figure 7–42. In a later course in digital fundamentals, you will learn specifi-
cally how this type of circuit is used in D/A conversion.
The switches used in this illustration simulate the digital (two-level) inputs. One 
switch position is connected to ground (0 V), and the other position is connected to a 
positive voltage (V). The analysis is as follows: Start by assuming that switch SW4 in 
Figure 7–42 is at the V position and the others are at ground so that the inputs are as 
shown in Figure 7–43(a).
The total resistance from node A to ground is found by first combining R1 and R2 
in parallel from node D to ground. The simplified circuit is shown in Figure 7–43(b).

The analysis for this case is as follows: The resistance from node B to ground is

Notice that the output voltage in this case (V>4) is one-half the output voltage (V>2) 
for the case where V is connected at switch SW4.
A similar analysis for each of the remaining switch inputs in Figure 7–42 results in 
output voltages as follows: For SW2 connected to V and the other switches connected 
to ground,
VOUT = V
8
For SW1 connected to V and the other switches connected to ground,
VOUT = V
16
When more than one input at a time are connected to V, the total output is the 
sum of the individual outputs, according to the superposition theorem that is cov-
ered in Section 8–4. These particular relationships among the output voltages for the 
various levels of inputs are important in the application of R/2R ladder networks to 
 digital-to-analog conversion.

The Wheatstone Bridge  ●  263
A Wheatstone bridge circuit is shown in its most common “diamond” configuration 
in Figure 7–46(a). It consists of four resistors and a dc voltage source connected across 
the top and bottom points of the “diamond.” The output voltage is taken across the left 
and right points of the “diamond” between A and B. In part (b), the circuit is drawn in a 
slightly different way to more clearly show its series-parallel configuration.
Wheatstone was a British 
 scientist and inventor of many 
scientific breakthroughs, includ-
ing the English concertina, the 
stereoscope (a device for displaying 
three- dimensional images), and 
an encryption cipher technique. 
Wheatstone is best known for his 
contributions in the development 
of the Wheatstone bridge, originally 
invented by Samuel Hunter  Christie, 
and as a major figure in the develop-
ment of telegraphy. Wheatstone 
gave full credit for the invention to 
Christie, but because of his work in 
developing and  applying the bridge, 
it became known as the Wheatstone 
bridge. (Photo credit: AIP Emilio

The Balanced Wheatstone Bridge
The Wheatstone bridge in Figure 7–46 is in the balanced bridge condition when the 
output voltage (VOUT) between terminals A and B is equal to zero.
VOUT = 0 V
When the bridge is balanced, the voltages across R1 and R2 are equal (V1 = V2) and 
the voltages across R3 and R4 are equal (V3 = V4). Therefore, the voltage ratios can 
be written as

the wheatstone bridge
The Wheatstone bridge circuit can be used to precisely measure resistance. 
However, the bridge is most commonly used in conjunction with  transducers 
to measure physical quantities such as strain, temperature, and pressure. 
Transducers are devices that sense a change in a physical parameter and 
 convert that change into an electrical quantity such as a change in resistance. 
For  example, a strain gauge exhibits a change in resistance when it is exposed 
to mechanical factors such as force, pressure, or displacement. A thermistor 
 exhibits a change in its resistance when it is exposed to a change in  temperature. 
The Wheatstone bridge can be operated in a balanced or an unbalanced 
 condition. The condition of operation depends on the type of application.

Since I1 = I3 and I2 = I4, all the current terms cancel, leaving the resistor ratios.
R1
R3
= R2
R4
Solving for R1 results in the following formula:
R1 = R3 aR2
R4
b
This formula allows you to find the value of resistor R1 in terms of the other resistor 
values when the bridge is balanced. You can also find the value of any other resistor 
in a similar way.
Using the Balanced Wheatstone Bridge to Find an Unknown Resistance Assume 
that R1 in Figure 7–46 has an unknown value, which we call RX. Resistors R2 and R4 
have fixed values so that their ratio, R2/R4, also has a fixed value. Since RX can be any 
value, R3 must be adjusted to make R1/R3 = R2/R4 in order to create a balanced or null 
condition. A null measurement is a very precise comparison method in which the volt-
age difference between the arms of the bridge is zero. Therefore, R3 is a variable resistor, 
which we will call RV. When RX is placed in the bridge, RV is adjusted until the bridge is 
balanced as indicated by a zero output voltage. Then, the unknown resistance is found as
 
RX = RV aR2
R4
b
Equation 7–2
The ratio R2>R4 is the scale factor. The accuracy of the measurement is dependent 
only on the accuracy of the bridge resistors and any stray wiring resistance as any 
loading effect is negligible.
An older type of measuring instrument called a galvanometer can be connected between 
the output terminals A and B to detect a balanced condition. The galvanometer is essen-
tially a very sensitive analog ammeter that senses current in either direction. It differs from 
a regular ammeter in that the midscale point is zero. In modern instruments, an amplifier 
connected across the bridge output indicates a balanced condition when its output is 0 V. 
Typically, the amplifier is an operational amplifier (op-amp) that can significantly increase 
the sensitivity of the bridge. This idea is illustrated in the application assignment for this 
chapter. In demanding applications high precision micro-adjustable resistors can be used. 
The micro-adjustable resistors enable fine adjustment of the bridge resistors during manu-
facture for applications such as medical sensors, scales, and precision measurements.
From Equation 7–2, the value of RV at balance multiplied by the scale factor R2/R4 
is the actual resistance value of RX. If R2/R4 = 1, then RX = RV; if R2/R4 = 0.5, 
then RX = 0.5RV; and so on. In a practical bridge circuit, the position of the RV ad-
justment can be calibrated to indicate the actual value of RX on a scale or with some 
other method of display.
Determine the value of RX in the balanced bridge shown in Figure 7–47.

The Unbalanced Wheatstone Bridge
An unbalanced bridge condition occurs when VOUT is not equal to zero. The unbal-
anced bridge is used to measure several types of physical quantities such as mechan-
ical strain, temperature, or pressure. This can be done by connecting a transducer 
in one leg of the bridge, as shown in Figure 7–48. The resistance of the transducer 
changes proportionally to the changes in the parameter that it is measuring. If the 
bridge is balanced at a known point, then the amount of deviation from the balanced 
condition, as indicated by the output voltage, indicates the amount of change in the 
parameter being measured. Therefore, the value of the parameter being measured can 
be determined by the amount that the bridge is unbalanced.
A Bridge Circuit for Measuring Temperature If temperature is to be measured, the 
transducer can be a thermistor, which is a temperature-sensitive resistor. The thermis-
tor resistance changes in a predictable way as the temperature changes. A change in 
temperature causes a change in thermistor resistance, which causes a corresponding 
change in the output voltage of the bridge as it becomes unbalanced. The output volt-
age is proportional to the temperature; therefore, either a voltmeter connected across 
the output can be calibrated to show the temperature or the output voltage can be 
amplified and converted to digital form to drive a readout display of the temperature.
A bridge circuit used to measure temperature is designed so that it is balanced at a ref-
erence temperature and becomes unbalanced at a measured temperature. For example, 
let’s say the bridge is to be balanced at 25°C. A thermistor will have a known value of re-
sistance at 25°C. For simplicity, let’s assume the other three bridge resistors are equal to 
the thermistor resistance at 25°C, so Rtherm = R2 = R3 = R4. For this particular case,  
 
Solution 
The scale factor is
R2
R4
= 150 Ω
100 Ω= 1.5
The bridge is balanced (VOUT = 0 V) when RV is set at 1,200 Ω, so the  unknown 
resistance is
RX = RV aR2

b = (1,200 Ω)(1.5) = 1,800 𝛀

Determine the output voltage of the temperature-measuring bridge circuit in 
Figure 7–49 if the thermistor is exposed to a temperature of 50°C and its resis-
tance at 25°C is 1.0 kΩ. Assume the resistance of the thermistor decreases to 
900 Ω at 50°C.

Equation 7–3
The ∆ (Greek letter delta) in front of a variable means a change in the variable. This 
formula applies only to the case where all resistances in the bridge are equal when 
the bridge is balanced. A derivation is provided in Appendix B. Keep in mind that 
the bridge can be initially balanced without having all the resistors equal as long as 
R1 = R2 and R3 = R4 (see Figure 7–46), but the formula for ∆VOUT would be more 
complicated.
EXAMPLE 7–19
Other Unbalanced Wheatstone Bridge Applications A Wheatstone bridge with a 
strain gauge can be used to measure forces. A strain gauge is a device that exhibits a 
change in resistance when it is compressed or stretched by the application of an exter-
nal force. As the resistance of the strain gauge changes, the previously balanced bridge 
becomes unbalanced. This unbalance causes the output voltage to change from zero, 
and this change can be measured to determine the amount of strain. In strain gauges, 
the resistance change is extremely small. This tiny change unbalances a Wheatstone 
bridge and can be detected because of its high sensitivity.
Strain gauges are one of the most useful resistive transducers that convert the stretch-
ing or compression of a fine wire into a change in resistance. When strain causes the wire 

The Wheatstone Bridge  ●  267
in the gauge to stretch, the resistance increases a small amount; and when it compresses, 
the resistance of the wire decreases.
Strain gauges are used in many types of scales, from those that are used for weigh-
ing small parts to those for weighing huge trucks. Typically, the gauges are mounted 
on a special block of aluminum that deforms when a weight is on the scale. The strain 
gauges are extremely delicate and must be mounted properly, so the entire assembly 
is generally prepared as a single unit called a load cell. A load cell is a transducer that 
uses strain gauges to convert mechanical force in to an electrical signal. A wide variety 
of load cells with different shapes and sizes are available from manufacturers depend-
ing on the application. A typical S-type load cell for a weighing application is shown 
Figure 7–50(a). The load cell has four strain gauges as illustrated in Figure 7–50(b). 
The gauges are mounted so that two of the gauges stretch (tension) when a load is 
placed on the scale and two of the gauges compress.
Load cells are usually connected to a Wheatstone bridge as shown in Figure 7–50(c) 
with strain gauges (SG) in tension (T) and compression (C) in opposite diagonal legs as 
shown. The output of the bridge is normally digitized and converted to a reading for a 
display or sent to a computer for processing. The major advantage of the Wheatstone 
bridge circuit is that it is capable of accurately measuring very small differences in 
resistance. The use of four active transducers increases the sensitivity of the measure-
ment and makes the bridge the ideal circuit for instrumentation. The Wheatstone 
bridge circuit has the added benefit of compensating for temperature variations and 
wire resistance of connecting wires that would otherwise contribute to inaccuracies.
In addition to scales, strain gauges are used with Wheatstone bridges in other types of 
measurements including pressure measurements, displacement and acceleration measure-
ments to name a few. In pressure measurements, the strain gauges are bonded to a flexible 
diaphragm that stretches when pressure is applied to the transducer. The amount of flexing 
is related to the pressure, which again converts to a very small resistance change.

268  ●  Series-Parallel Circuits
Opens and shorts are typical problems that occur in electric circuits. As mentioned in 
Chapter 5, if a resistor burns out, it will normally produce an open. Bad solder connec-
tions, broken wires, and poor contacts can also be causes of open paths. Pieces of foreign 
material, such as solder splashes and broken insulation on wires, can lead to shorts in a 
circuit. A short is considered to be a zero resistance path between two points.
In addition to complete opens or shorts, partial opens or partial shorts can develop 
in a circuit. A partial open would be a much higher than normal resistance, but not 
infinitely large. A partial short would be a much lower than normal resistance, but 
not zero.
The following three examples illustrate troubleshooting series-parallel circuits.
As you know, troubleshooting is the process of identifying and locating a failure 
or problem in a circuit. Some troubleshooting techniques and the application of 
logical thought have already been discussed in relation to both series circuits and 
parallel circuits. A basic premise of troubleshooting is that you must know what 
to look for before you can successfully troubleshoot a circuit.

From the indicated voltmeter reading in Figure 7–51, determine if there is a fault by 
applying the APM approach. If there is a fault, identify it as either a short or an open.

Troubleshooting  ●  269
This calculation shows that 4.22 V is the voltage reading that you should get on the 
meter. However, the meter reads 9.6 V across R2}3. This value is incorrect, and, be-
cause it is higher than it should be, either R2 or R3 is probably open. Why? Because if 
either of these two resistors is open, the resistance across which the meter is connected 
is larger than expected. A higher resistance will drop a higher voltage in this circuit.
There are other ways to analyze the problem. For example, you might decide to 
find the total current in the circuit by applying Ohm’s law to R1. The total resis-
tance of R2 }R3 would be 10 kÆ, which matches R3. Thus R2 must be open.
Step 2: Planning
Start trying to find the open resistor by assuming that R2 is open. If it is, the volt-
age across R3 is
V3 = a
R3
R1 + R3
bVS = a10 kΩ
25 kΩb24 V = 9.6 V
Since the measured voltage is also 9.6 V, this calculation shows that R2 is probably open.
Step 3: Measurement
Disconnect power and remove R2. Measure its resistance to verify it is open. If it 
is not, inspect the wiring, solder, or connections around R2, looking for the open.
 
Related Problem 
What would be the voltmeter reading if R3 were open in Figure 7–51? If R1 were open?
Open Multisim file E07-20 and verify the result in this example by removing R2 to 
simulate an open and observe the meter reading.
MultiSim
Suppose that you measure 24 V with the voltmeter in Figure 7–52. Determine if 
there is a fault, and, if there is, identify it.
EXAMPLE 7–21
 
Solution 
Step 1: Analysis
There is no voltage drop across R1 because both sides of the resistor are at +24 V. 
Either there is no current through R1 from the source, which tells you that R2 is 
open in the circuit, or R1 is shorted.
Step 2: Planning
The most probable failure is an open R2. If it is open, then there will be no current 
from the source. To verify this, measure across R2 with the voltmeter. If R2 is open, 
the meter will indicate 24 V. The right side of R2 will be at zero volts because there is 
no current through any of the other resistors to cause a voltage drop across them.
Step 3: Measurement
The measurement to verify that R2 is open is shown in Figure 7–53.

VA = a
R3
R1 + R2 + R3
bVS = a 3.3 kΩ
21.6 kΩb24 V = 3.67 V
The voltmeter A reading is correct. This indicates that R1, R2, and R3 are con-

Step 2: See if the voltmeter B reading is correct. R6 + R7 is in parallel with R5. 
The series-parallel combination of R5, R6, and R7 is in series with R4. Calculate the 
resistance of the R5, R6, and R7 combination as follows:
R5}(6 + 7) =

R5 + R6 + R7

Thus, the actual measured voltage (6.65 V) at this point is incorrect. Some logical 
thinking will help to isolate the problem.
Step 3: R4 is not open, because if it were, the meter would read 0 V. If there were a 
short across it, the meter would read 24 V. Since the actual voltage is much less than 
it should be, R5}(6 + 7) must be less than the calculated value of 6.32 kΩ. The most 
likely problem is a short across R7. If there is a short from the top of R7 to ground, 
R6 is effectively in parallel with R5. In this case,
R5 }R6 =
R5R6
R5 + R6
= (10 kΩ)(2.2 kΩ)
12.2 kΩ
= 1.80 kΩ
Then VB is
VB = a1.80 kΩ
6.5 kΩb24 V = 6.65 V
This value for VB agrees with the voltmeter B reading. So there is a short across R7. 
If this were an actual circuit, you would try to find the physical cause of the short.

272  ●  Series-Parallel Circuits
The Wheatstone bridge is widely 
used in measurement applications 
that use sensors to convert a physical parameter to a change in 
resistance. Modern Wheatstone bridges are automated; with 
intelligent interface modules, the output can be conditioned 
and converted to any desired unit for display or processing 
(for example, the output might be displayed in pounds for a 
scale application).
The Wheatstone bridge provides a null measurement, 
which enables it to have great sensitivity. It can also be 
designed to compensate for changes in temperature, a great 
advantage for many resistive measurements, particularly when 
the resistance change of the sensor is very small. Usually, the 
output voltage of the bridge is increased by an amplifier that 
has a minimum loading effect on the bridge.
Temperature Controller
In this application activity, a Wheatstone bridge circuit is 
used in a temperature controller. The sensor is a thermistor 
(“thermal resistor”), which is a resistive sensor that changes 
resistance as temperature changes. Thermistors are avail-
able with positive or negative resistance characteristics as a 
function of temperature. The thermistor in this circuit is one 
of the resistors in a Wheatstone bridge but is located a short 
distance from the circuit board for sensing the temperature at 
a point off the board. The threshold voltage for the output to 
change is controlled by the 10 kΩ potentiometer, R3.
The operational amplifier (741C) and LEDs are shown only 
to provide a context for this Wheatstone bridge application 
and are not intended to be the focus. The op-amp in this circuit 
is configured as a comparator, which is be used to compare the 
voltage on one side of the bridge with the voltage on the other.
Application Activity
The advantage of a comparator is that it is extremely 
 sensitive to an unbalanced bridge and produces a large output 
when the bridge is unbalanced. In fact, it is so sensitive, it is 
virtually impossible to adjust the bridge for perfect balance. 
Even the tiniest imbalance will cause the output to go to a volt-
age near either the maximum or minimum possible (the power 
supply voltages). This is handy for turning on a heater or other 
device based on the temperature; however, there is a drawback 
to this circuit. The sensitivity of the op-amp is such that it can 
oscillate about the trip point. For  purposes of this  Application 
Assignment, we will assume that this does not matter. In 
courses on devices, you will learn a simple fix to this issue.
The Control Circuit
This application has a tank containing a liquid that needs  
to be held at a warm temperature, as illustrated in  
 Figure 7–57(a). The circuit board for the temperature con-
troller is shown in Figure 7–57(b). The circuit board controls 
a heating unit (through an interface, which is not shown) 
when the temperature is too cold. The thermistor, which is 
located in the tank, is connected between one of the ampli-
fier inputs and ground as illustrated.
The op-amp has two inputs, an output, and connections 
for positive and negative supply voltages. The schematic 
symbol for the op-amp with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) 
connected to the output is shown in Figure 7–58. The red 
LED is on when the op-amp output is a positive voltage, 
indicating the heater is on. The green LED is on when the 
output is a negative voltage, indicating the heater is off.
1. Using the circuit board as a guide, complete the sche-
matic in Figure 7–58. The op-amp inputs are connected 
to a Wheatstone bridge. Show the values for all resistors.

The Thermistor
The thermistor is a mixture of two metal-oxides, which exhibit 
a large resistance change as a function of temperature. The 
thermistor in the temperature controller circuit is located 
off the board near the point where temperature is to be sensed 
in the tank and is connected between the thermistor input and 
ground.
Thermistors have a nonlinear resistance-temperature char-
acteristic described by the exponential equation:
RT = R 0 e
b a
T0 - T
T0T b
Where:
RT = the resistance at a given temperature
R0 = the resistance at a reference temperature
 T0 =  the reference temperature in Kelvin (K), 
typically 298 K, which is 25°C
T = temperature in K
 b = a constant (K) provided by the  manufacturer
This exponential equation where e is the base of natural loga-
rithms can be solved easily on a scientific calculator. Expo-
nential equations are studied in Chapters 12 and 13.
The thermistor in this application is a Thermometrics 
RL2006-13.3K-140-D1 thermistor with a specified resistance 
of 25 kΩ at 25°C and a b of 4,615 K. For convenience, the re-
sistance of this thermistor is plotted as a function of tempera-
ture in Figure 7–59. Notice that the negative slope indicates 
that this thermistor has a negative temperature coefficient 
(NTC); that is, its resistance decreases as the temperature 
increases. In the Application Activity for Chapter 8, the graph 
for this thermistor is plotted using a graphing calculator.
As an example, the calculation for finding the resistance at  
T = 50°C is shown. First, convert 50°C to K.
T = °C + 273 = 50°C + 273 = 323 K
Also,
 T0 = °C + 273 = 25°C + 273 = 298 K
 R0 = 25 kΩ

SUMMARY
◆
●A series-parallel circuit is a combination of both series and parallel current paths.
◆
●To determine total resistance in a series-parallel circuit, identify the series and parallel relationships, 
and then apply the formulas for series resistance and parallel resistance from Chapters 5 and 6.
◆
●To find the total current, apply Ohm’s law and divide the total voltage by the total resistance.
◆
●To determine branch currents, apply the current-divider formula, Kirchhoff’s current law, or 
Ohm’s law. Consider each circuit problem individually to determine the most appropriate method.
◆
●To determine voltage drops across any portion of a series-parallel circuit, use the voltage-
divider formula, Kirchhoff’s voltage law, or Ohm’s law. Consider each circuit problem indi-
vidually to determine the most appropriate method.
◆
●When a load resistor is connected across a voltage-divider output, the output voltage 
 decreases.
◆
●The load resistor should be large compared to the resistance across which it is connected, in 
order that the loading effect may be minimized.
◆
●To find total resistance of a ladder network, start at the point farthest from the source and 
reduce the resistance in steps.
◆
●A balanced Wheatstone bridge can be used to measure an unknown resistance.
◆
●The Wheatstone bridge is balanced when the output voltage is zero. The balanced condition 
produces zero current through a load connected across the output terminals of the bridge.
◆
●An unbalanced Wheatstone bridge can be used to measure physical quantities using transducers.
◆
●Opens and shorts are typical circuit faults.

INTRODUCTION
In previous chapters, you analyzed various types of circuits 
using Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s laws. Some types of cir-
cuits are difficult to analyze using only those basic laws and 
 require additional methods in order to simplify the analysis.
The theorems and conversions in this chapter make  analysis 
easier for certain types of circuits. These methods do not re-
place Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s laws, but they are normally 
used in conjunction with the laws in certain situations.
Because all electric circuits are driven by either voltage 
sources or current sources, it is important to understand how 
to work with these elements. The superposition  theorem will 
help you to deal with circuits that have multiple sources. 
Thevenin’s and Norton’s theorems provide methods for 
reducing a circuit to a simple equivalent form for ease of 
analysis. The maximum power transfer theorem is used 
in applications where it is important for a given circuit to 
provide maximum power to a load. An example of this is an 
audio amplifier that provides maximum power to a speaker. 
Delta-to-wye and wye-to-delta conversions are sometimes 
useful when you analyze bridge circuits that are commonly 
found in systems that measure physical parameters such as 
temperature, pressure, and strain.

The DC Voltage Source  ●  291
In reality, no voltage source is ideal; however, regulated power supplies can ap-
proach ideal when operated within the specified output current limits. All voltage 
sources have some inherent internal resistance as a result of their physical and/or 
chemical makeup, which can be represented by a resistor in series with an ideal source, 
as shown in Figure 8–2(a). RS is the internal source resistance, and VS is the source 
voltage. With no load, the output voltage (voltage from A to B) is VS. This voltage is 
sometimes called the open circuit voltage.
8–1 
the dc voltage source
As you learned in Chapter 2, the dc voltage source is one of the principal types 
of energy source in electronic applications, so it is important to understand 
its characteristics. The dc voltage source ideally provides constant voltage to a 
load even when the load resistance varies.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆
◆Describe the characteristics of a dc voltage source
◆
◆Compare a practical voltage source to an ideal source
◆
◆Discuss the effect of loading on a practical voltage source
Figure 8–1(a) is the familiar symbol for an ideal dc voltage source. The voltage 
across its terminals, A and B, remains fixed regardless of the value of load resistance 
that may be connected across its output. Figure 8–1(b) shows a load resistor, RL, con-
nected. All of the source voltage, VS, is dropped across RL. Ideally, RL can be changed 
to any value except zero, and the voltage will remain fixed. The ideal voltage source 
has an internal resistance of zero.

Loading of the Voltage Source
When a load resistor is connected across the output terminals, as shown in Figure 8–2(b), 
all of the source voltage does not appear across RL. Some of the voltage is dropped across 
RS because RS and RL are in series. Current in RS also causes internal heating of the 
source. In the case of high currents, internal heating can be significant.
If RS is very small compared to RL, the source approaches ideal because almost all 
of the source voltage, VS, appears across the larger resistance, RL. Very little voltage is 
dropped across the internal resistance, RS. If RL changes, most of the source voltage 
remains across the output as long as RL is much larger than RS. As a result, very little 
change occurs in the output voltage. The larger RL is, compared to RS, the less change 
there is in the output voltage. Example 8–1 illustrates the effect of changes in RL on 
the output voltage when RL is much greater than RS.
A certain C cell battery has an output voltage of 1.55 V and an internal resistance 
of 300 mÆ as shown in Figure 8–3. Calculate the output voltage for loads of 5.0 Æ,  
10 Æ, and 100 Æ.
 
Solution 
For RL = 5.0 Ω, the voltage output is
VOUT = a
RL
RS + RL
bVS = a5.0 Ω
5.3 Ωb1.55 V = 1.46 V
For RL = 10 Ω,
VOUT = a 10 Ω
10.3 Ωb1.55 V = 1.50 V
For RL = 100 Ω,
VOUT = a 100 Ω
100.3 Ωb1.55 V = 1.55 V
Notice that the output voltage is within 10% of the source voltage, VS, for all 
three values of RL because RL is at least 10 times RS.

Determine VOUT for the cell in Figure 8–3 if the internal resistance is 
150 mΩ  and RL = 5.0 Ω.

EXAMPLE 8–1

The DC Voltage Source  ●  293
The output voltage decreases significantly as the load resistance is made smaller 
compared to the internal source resistance as illustrated in the previous example for 
a single cell. This is true for electronic power supplies but the source resistance in a 
well regulated supply is much less than 1 Æ. In the case of batteries, the output voltage 
drops and the cell resistance increases as the battery ages.
Determining the Internal Resistance of a Voltage Source
The internal resistance of a voltage source cannot be measured directly but can be 
calculated from indirect measurements. To determine the internal resistance, start by 
measuring the no load output voltage, VNL. Place a known load resistor, RL, across 
the output. (RL should not be so small that the load current exceeds the current limit 
for the source.) Measure the voltage under load VL. The difference between VNL and 
VL is the drop across the source resistance, VRS. That is:
VRS = VNL - VL
The current in the source resistance is the same as load current:
IRS = VL
RL
The source resistance can now be calculated by substituting and applying Ohm’s law:
RS = VRS

Transistors act basically as current sources, and for this reason, knowledge of the 
current source concept is important. You will find that the equivalent model of a 
transistor does contain a current source.
Although the ideal current source can be used in most analysis work, no actual 
device is ideal. A practical current source representation is shown in Figure 8–5. Here 
the internal resistance appears in parallel with the ideal current source.
Figure 8–4(a) shows a symbol for the ideal current source. The arrow indicates the 
direction of source current, IS. An ideal current source produces a constant value of 
current through a load, regardless of the value of the load. This concept is illustrated 
in Figure 8–4(b), where a load resistor is connected to the current source between 
terminals A and B. The ideal current source has an infinitely large internal parallel 
resistance.
If the internal source resistance, RS, is much larger than a load resistor, the practi-
cal source approaches ideal. The reason is illustrated in the practical current source 
shown in Figure 8–5. Part of the current, IS, is through RS, and part is through RL. The 
internal source resistance, RS, and the load resistor, RL, act as a current divider. If RS 
is much larger than RL, most of the current is through RL and very little through RS.

the current source
As you learned in Chapter 2, the current source is another type of energy source 
that ideally provides a constant current to a variable load. The concept of the 
 current source is important in certain types of transistor circuits.

The Current Source  ●  295
As long as RL remains much smaller than RS, the current through RL will stay almost 
constant, no matter how much RL changes.
If there is a constant-current source, you can normally assume that RS is so much 
larger than the load resistance that RS can be neglected. This simplifies the source to 
ideal, making the analysis easier.
Example 8–3 illustrates the effect of changes in RL on the load current when RL 
is much smaller than RS. Generally, RL should be at least 10 times smaller than 
RS (10RL … RS) for a source to act as a reasonable current source.

Converting a Voltage Source to a Current Source
The source voltage, VS, divided by the internal source resistance, RS, gives the value of 
the equivalent current source.
IS = VS
RS
The value of RS is the same for both the voltage and current sources. As illustrated 
in Figure 8–7, the directional arrow for the current points from minus to plus. The 
equivalent current source is in parallel with RS. Notice that the equivalent current 
source is the same as the current in a shorted load.

source conversions
Equivalency of two sources means that for any given load resistance connected 
to the two sources, the same load voltage and load current are produced by both 
sources. This concept is called terminal equivalency.
You can show that the voltage source and the current source in Figure 8–7 are 
equivalent by connecting a load resistor to each, as shown in Figure 8–8, and then 
calculating the load current. For the voltage source, the load current is

Converting a Current Source to a Voltage Source
The source current, IS, multiplied by the internal source resistance, RS, gives the value 
of the equivalent source voltage.

Again, RS remains the same. The polarity of the voltage source is minus to plus in the 
direction of the current. The equivalent voltage source is the voltage in series with RS, 
as illustrated in Figure 8–11.

The Superposition Theorem  ●  299
The superposition method is a way to determine current or voltage in a circuit with 
multiple sources by isolating the separate effects of each source on the circuit in turn 
and then algebraically combining the results. Recall that an ideal voltage source has 
a zero internal resistance and an ideal current source has infinite internal resistance. 
Non-ideal sources are replaced with their internal resistance. In our treatment of the 
superposition theorem, all sources will be treated as ideal in order to simplify the 
coverage.
A general statement of the superposition theorem is as follows:
The current or voltage in any given branch of a multiple-source linear circuit can 
be found by determining the current or voltage in that particular branch produced 
by each source acting independently with all other sources replaced by their internal 
resistances. The total current or voltage for the branch is the algebraic sum of the 
responses in that branch.
The steps in applying the superposition method are as follows:
Step 1:  Leave one voltage (or current) source at a time in the circuit and replace 
each of the other voltage (or current) sources with its internal resistance. 
For ideal sources a short represents zero internal resistance and an open 
represents infinite internal resistance.

Some circuits use more than one voltage or current source. For example, most 
amplifiers operate with two voltage sources: an ac and a dc source. Additionally, 
some amplifiers require both a positive and a negative dc voltage source for 
proper operation. When multiple sources are used in a circuit, the superposition 
theorem provides a method for analysis.

Solution

The Superposition Theorem  ●  301
Replace VS2 with a short as shown in Figure 8–18 and solve for VR2 due to 
VS1.  Notice that with VS2 shorted, R2 is in parallel with R3. VR2 due to VS1

Step 2:  Replace VS1 with a short as shown in Figure 8–19 and solve for VR2 due to 
VS2. Notice that with VS1 shorted, R2 is in parallel with R1. VR2 due to VS2 
can be written immediately using the voltage divider rule:

Step 3:  Both voltages have the same polarity. Algebraically sum the contributions 
from VS1 and VS2:
VR2(tot) = V2(S1) + V2(S2) = 3.33 V + 1.67 V = 5.0 V

EXAMPLE 8–7
 
Solution 
Step 1:  Find the current through R2 due to VS by replacing IS with an open, as 
shown in Figure 8–21.
 
 The current is from left to right in R3 due to VS1 acting independently.
Step 2:  Calculate the total resistance and current from VS2 with VS1 replaced with 
a short as shown in Figure 8–19.
 
The total resistance “seen” by VS2 is
RT(S2) = R3 + R1 }R3 = 100 Ω+ 100 Ω}100 Ω= 150 Ω
 
The total current from VS2 acting independently is
IT1S22 =
VS2
RT1S22
= 5.0 V
150 Ω= 33.3 mA
 
 This current is the same as I3 as the total current from VS2 must go through 
R3. Therefore,
 
 I3(S2) = IT(S2) = -33.3 mA from right to left. Because this is opposite to 
the direction found in Step 1, assign it with a negative sign.
Step 3: Add the currents from steps 1 and 2:
I3(S1) + I3(S2) = 33.3 mA + (-33.3 mA) =  0  mA
The actual current through R3 is zero. Notice this result is the consequence 
of VS1 that created a voltage of +5.0 V at the top of R2, which opposed 
the voltage of VS2. Both ends of R3 were found to be at the same potential, 
hence there is no  current in R3.

Although regulated dc power supplies are close to ideal voltage sources, many ac 
sources are not. For example, function generators generally have 50 Ω or 600 Ω of 
internal resistance, which appears as a resistance in series with an ideal source. Also, 
batteries can look ideal when they are fresh; but as they age, the internal resistance in-
creases. When applying the superposition theorem, it is important to recognize when 
a source is not ideal and replace it with its equivalent internal resistance.
Current sources are not as common as voltage sources and are also not always 
ideal. If a current source is not ideal, as in the case of many transistors, it should be re-
placed by its equivalent internal resistance when the superposition theorem is applied.

thevenin’s theoreM
The Thevenin equivalent form of any two-terminal resistive circuit consists of 
an equivalent voltage source (VTH) and an equivalent resistance (RTH), arranged as 
shown in Figure 8–30. The values of the equivalent voltage and resistance depend on 
the values in the original circuit. Any resistive circuit can be simplified regardless of 
its complexity with respect to two output terminals.

308  ●  Circuit Theorems and Conversions
The equivalent voltage, VTH, is one part of the complete Thevenin equivalent circuit. 
The other part is RTH.
The Thevenin equivalent voltage (VTH) is the open circuit (no-load) voltage between 
two output terminals in a circuit.
Any component connected between these two terminals effectively “sees” VTH in series 
with RTH. As defined by Thevenin’s theorem,
The Thevenin equivalent resistance (RTH) is the total resistance appearing between 
two terminals in a given circuit with all sources replaced by their internal resistances.
Although a Thevenin equivalent circuit is not the same as its original circuit, it acts 
the same in terms of the output voltage and current. Try the following demonstration 
as illustrated in Figure 8–31. Place a resistive circuit of any complexity in a box with 
only the output terminals exposed. Then place the Thevenin equivalent of that circuit 
in an identical box with, again, only the output terminals exposed. Connect identical 
load resistors across the output terminals of each box. Next connect a voltmeter and 
an ammeter to measure the voltage and current for each load as shown in the figure. 
The measured values will be identical (neglecting tolerance variations), and you will 
not be able to determine which box contains the original circuit and which contains 
the Thevenin equivalent from these measurements. That is, in terms of your observa-
tions based on any electrical measurements, both circuits appear to be the same. This 
condition was previously defined as terminal equivalency because both circuits pro-
duce the same result for a given load connected to their output.
Thevenin was a French telegraph 
engineer who became increas-
ingly interested in the problems of 
measurement in electrical circuits. 
As a result of studying Kirchhoff’s 
circuit laws and Ohm’s law, in 
1882 he developed a method, now 
known as Thevenin’s theorem, 
which made it possible to analyze 
a complex electrical circuit by 
reducing it to a simple equivalent 
circuit.

To find the Thevenin equivalent of any circuit, determine the equivalent voltage, 
VTH, and the equivalent resistance, RTH, looking from the output terminals. As an ex-
ample, the Thevenin equivalent for the circuit between terminals A and B is developed 
in Figure 8–32.
In Figure 8–32(a), the voltage across the designated terminals A and B is the 
Thevenin equivalent voltage. In this particular circuit, the voltage from A to B is the 
same as the voltage across R2 because there is no current through R3 and, therefore, 
no voltage drop across it. The Thevenin voltage is expressed as follows for this par-
ticular example:

In Figure 8–32(b), the resistance between terminals A and B with the source re-
placed by a short (zero internal resistance) is the Thevenin equivalent resistance. In 
this particular circuit, the resistance from A to B is R3 in series with the parallel com-
bination of R1 and R2. Therefore, RTH is expressed as follows:

Thevenin Equivalency Depends on the Viewpoint
The Thevenin equivalent for any circuit depends on the location of the two output 
terminals from which the circuit is “viewed.” In Figure 8–33, you viewed the circuit 
from between the two terminals labeled A and B. Any given circuit can have more 
than one Thevenin equivalent, depending on how the output terminals are designated. 
For example, if you view the circuit in Figure 8–35 from between terminals A and C, 
you obtain a completely different result than if you viewed it from between terminals 
A and B or from between terminals B and C.

Thevenin’s Theorem  ●  313
Thevenizing a Portion of a Circuit
In many cases, it helps to thevenize only a portion of a circuit. For example, when 
you need to know the equivalent circuit as viewed by one particular resistor in the cir-
cuit, you can remove the resistor and apply Thevenin’s theorem to the remaining part 
of the circuit as viewed from the points between which that resistor was connected. 
Figure 8–39 illustrates the thevenizing of part of a circuit.
Using this type of approach, you can easily find the voltage and current for a speci-
fied resistor for any number of resistor values or a variable load using only Ohm’s 
law. This method eliminates the necessity of reanalyzing the original circuit for each 
different resistance value.
Thevenizing a Bridge Circuit
The usefulness of Thevenin’s theorem is perhaps best illustrated when it is applied to a 
Wheatstone bridge circuit. For example, when a load resistor is connected to the out-
put terminals of a Wheatstone bridge, as shown in Figure 8–40, the circuit is difficult 
to analyze because it is not a straightforward series-parallel arrangement. There are 
no resistors that are in series or in parallel with another resistor.
Using Thevenin’s theorem, you can simplify the bridge circuit to an equivalent cir-
cuit viewed from the load resistor as shown step-by-step in Figure 8–41. Study care-
fully the steps in this figure. Once the equivalent circuit for the bridge is found, the 
voltage and current for any value of load resistor can easily be determined.

Thevenin’s Theorem  ●  315
An Alternate Approach An alternate way to thevenize the Wheatstone bridge is to 
consider a different viewpoint. Instead of viewing it from between the A and B termi-
nals, you can view it from terminal A to ground and from terminal B to ground, as 
illustrated in Figure 8–44(a) and (b). The resulting equivalent circuit is simplified into 
two facing Thevenin circuits that still include ground, as illustrated in Figure 8–44(c). 
When calculating the Thevenin resistance, replace the voltage source by a short; thus, 
two of the bridge resistors are shorted out. In Figure 8–44(a), R3 and R4 are shorted 
and in part (b) R1 and R2 are shorted. In each case, the remaining two resistors appear 
in parallel to form the Thevenin resistance. The load resistor can be replaced as in 
Figure 8–44(d), which is seen to be a simple series circuit with two opposing sources. 
The advantage of this method is that ground is still shown in this equivalent circuit, so 
it is easy to find the voltage at terminal A or B with respect to ground by applying the 
superposition theorem to the equivalent circuit.
Summary of Thevenin’s Theorem
Remember, the Thevenin equivalent circuit is always in the form of an equivalent volt-
age source in series with an equivalent resistance regardless of the original circuit that 
it replaces. The significance of Thevenin’s theorem is that the equivalent circuit can

316  ●  Circuit Theorems and Conversions
replace the original circuit as far as any external load is concerned. Any load resistor 
connected between the terminals of a Thevenin equivalent circuit will have the same 
current through it and the same voltage across it as if it were connected to the termi-
nals of the original circuit.
A summary of steps for applying Thevenin’s theorem is as follows:
Step 1:  Open the two terminals (remove any load) between which you want to find 
the Thevenin equivalent circuit.
Step 2: Determine the voltage (VTH) across the two open terminals.
Step 3:  Determine the resistance (RTH) between the two open terminals with 
all sources replaced with their internal resistances (ideal voltage sources 
shorted and ideal current sources opened).
Step 4:  Connect VTH and RTH in series to produce the complete Thevenin equiva-
lent for the original circuit.
Step 5:  Replace the load removed in Step 1 across the terminals of the Thevenin 
equivalent circuit. You can now calculate the load current and load volt-
age using only Ohm’s law. They have the same value as the load current 
and load voltage in the original circuit.
Determining VTH and RTH by Measurement
Thevenin’s theorem is largely an analytical tool that is applied theoretically in order to 
simplify circuit analysis. However, you can find Thevenin’s equivalent for an actual circuit 
by the following general measurement methods. These steps are illustrated in Figure 8–45.
Step 1: Remove any load from the output terminals of the circuit.
Step 2:  Measure the open terminal voltage. The voltmeter used must have an internal 
resistance much greater (at least 10 times greater) than the RTH of the circuit 
so that it has negligible loading effect. (VTH is the open terminal voltage.)

Step 3:  Connect a variable resistor (rheostat) across the output terminals. Set it at 
its maximum value, which must be greater than RTH.
Step 4:  Adjust the rheostat until the terminal voltage equals 0.5VTH. At this point, 
the resistance of the rheostat is equal to RTH.
Step 5:  Disconnect the rheostat from the terminals and measure its resistance with 
an ohmmeter. This measured resistance is equal to RTH.
This procedure for determining RTH differs from the theoretical procedure because 
it is impractical to short voltage sources or open current sources in an actual circuit 
unless the source is external to the circuit. An external source can be replaced by its 
internal resistance. Also, when measuring RTH, be certain that the circuit is capable of 
providing the required current to the variable resistor load and that the variable resis-
tor can handle the required power. If the circuit cannot supply the current for the case 
where RTH = RL, you can indirectly determine RTH by observing the loading effect 
on RL on a higher resistive load. For example, if a load drops the output to 90% of 
the open circuit voltage, then it is nine times larger than RTH. (In this case, 10% of the 
output is across RTH, which means that 90,>10, = 9 times larger.)

An Example of a Practical Application
Although you have not studied transistor circuits, a basic amplifier can be used to 
illustrate the usefulness of Thevenin’s equivalent circuit. A transistor circuit can be 
modeled with basic components including a dependent current source and a Thevenin 
equivalent circuit. Modeling is generally a mathematical simplification of a complex 
circuit, retaining only the most important parts of the circuit and eliminating those 
that have only a minimum effect.
A typical dc model of a transistor is shown in Figure 8–46. This type of transis-
tor (bipolar junction transistor) has three terminals, labeled base (B), collector (C), 
and emitter (E). In this case, the emitter terminal is both an input and an output, so 
it is common. The dependent current source (diamond-shaped symbol) is controlled 
by the base current, IB. For this example, the current from the dependent source is 
200 times larger than the base current as expressed by the term bIB, where b is a tran-
sistor gain parameter and, in this case, b = 200.
The transistor is part of a dc amplifier circuit, and you can use the basic model 
to predict the output current. The output current is larger than the input circuit can 
provide by itself. For example, the source can represent a small transducer, such as a 
solar cell with an internal resistance of 6.8 kΩ. It is shown as an equivalent Thevenin 
voltage and Thevenin resistance. The load could be any device that requires higher 
current than the source can provide directly.

Norton’s Theorem  ●  319
Norton’s theorem is a method for simplifying a two-terminal linear circuit to an 
equivalent circuit with only a current source in parallel with a resistor. The form 
of Norton’s equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 8–48. Regardless of how com-
plex the original two-terminal circuit is, it can always be reduced to this equivalent 
form. The equivalent current source is designated IN, and the equivalent resistance 
is designated RN. To apply Norton’s theorem, you must know how to find the two 
quantities IN and RN. Once you know them for a given circuit, simply connect them 
in parallel to get the complete Norton circuit.

Norton’s Equivalent Current (IN)
Norton’s equivalent current (IN) is the short-circuit current between two output 
 terminals in a circuit.
Any component connected between these two terminals effectively “sees” a current 
source IN in parallel with RN. To illustrate, suppose that a resistive circuit of some kind 
has a resistor (RL) connected between two output terminals in the circuit, as shown in 
Figure 8–49(a). You want to find the Norton circuit that is equivalent to the one shown 
as “seen” by RL. To find IN, calculate the current between terminals A and B with these 
two terminals shorted, as shown in Figure 8–49(b). Example 8–14 demonstrates how to 
find IN.

Norton’s Theorem  ●  321
Norton’s Equivalent Resistance (RN)
Norton’s equivalent resistance (RN) is defined in the same way as RTH.
The Norton equivalent resistance, RN, is the total resistance appearing between 
two output terminals in a given circuit with all sources replaced by their internal 
resistances.
Example 8–15 demonstrates how to find RN.
Examples 8–14 and 8–15 have shown how to find the two equivalent components 
of a Norton equivalent circuit, IN and RN. Keep in mind that these values can be 
found for any linear circuit. Once these are known, they must be connected in parallel 
to form the Norton equivalent circuit, as illustrated in Example 8–16.
Find RN for the circuit within the beige area of Figure 8–50(a) (see Example 8–14).
 
Solution 
First reduce V S to zero by shorting it, as shown in Figure 8–51. Looking in at termi-

R3. Thus,

Summary of Norton’s Theorem
Any load resistor connected between the output terminals of a Norton equivalent 
circuit will have the same current through it and the same voltage across it as if it 
were connected to the output terminals of the original circuit. A summary of steps for 
theoretically applying Norton’s theorem is as follows:
Step 1:  Short the two terminals between which you want to find the Norton 
equivalent circuit.
Step 2: Determine the current (IN) through the shorted terminals.
Step 3:  Determine the resistance (RN) between the two open terminals with all 
sources replaced with their internal resistances (ideal voltage sources 
shorted and ideal current sources opened). RN = RTH.
Step 4:  Connect IN and RN in parallel to produce the complete Norton equivalent 
for the original circuit.
Norton’s equivalent circuit can also be derived from Thevenin’s equivalent circuit 
by use of the source conversion method discussed in Section 8–3.
An Example of a Practical Application
A voltage amplifier in a digital light meter is modeled using a Norton equivalent cir-
cuit and a dependent voltage source. A block diagram of the light meter is shown in 
Figure 8–53. The light meter uses a photocell as a sensor. The photocell is a current 
source that produces a very small current proportional to the incident light. Because 
it is a current source, a Norton circuit can be used to model the photocell. The very 
small amount of current from the photocell is converted to a small input voltage 
across RN. A dc amplifier is used to increase the voltage to a level sufficient for driving 
the analog-to-digital converter.
Norton started work as an 
 electrical engineer in 1922 at the 
Western Electric Corporation, 
which became Bell Laboratories 
in 1925. Norton’s theorem is basi-
cally an extension of Thevenin’s 
theorem and was developed in 
1926 and documented in a Bell 
Labs internal technical report. 
A German telecommunications 
engineer, Hans Mayer, published 
the same result in the same month 
as Norton’s technical memoran-
dum. In Europe, it is known as the 
Mayer-Norton equivalent. (Photo

In this application, only with the first two blocks in the light meter diagram are of

modeled as a Norton circuit on the input. The output of the Norton circuit is fed to 
the amplifier’s input resistance, which converts the current IN to a small voltage VIN. 
The amplifier increases this voltage by 20 to drive the analog-to-digital converter 
which, for simplicity, is modeled simply as a load resistor, RL. The value of 20 is the 
gain of this particular amplifier.

324  ●  Circuit Theorems and Conversions
The maximum power transfer theorem is stated as follows:
For a given source voltage, maximum power is transferred from a source to a load 
when the load resistance is equal to the internal source resistance.
The source resistance, RS, of a circuit is the equivalent resistance as viewed from the out-
put terminals using Thevenin’s theorem. The maximum power transfer theorem assumes 
the source resistance is fixed and cannot be changed. A Thevenin equivalent circuit with 
its output resistance and load is shown in Figure 8–56. When RL = RS, the maximum 
power possible is transferred from the voltage source to RL for a given value of VS.

Practical applications of the maximum power transfer theorem include audio sys-
tems such as stereo, radio, and public address. In these systems the speaker is the 
load which, for the purpose of this discussion, will be considered as a resistive load. 
(Non-resistive loads will be covered later.) The circuit that drives the speaker is a 
power amplifier. The systems are typically optimized for maximum power to the 
speakers. Thus, the resistance of the speaker must equal the internal source resis-
tance of the amplifier.
Example 8–18 shows that maximum power occurs when RL = RS.
The source in Figure 8–57 has an internal source resistance of 75 Ω. Determine 
the load power for each of the following values of load resistance:

To convert from delta to wye, you need R1, R2, and R3 in terms of RA, RB, and RC. The

Application Activity  ●  333
The Wheatstone bridge circuit 
was introduced in  Chapter 7 
and expanded in this chapter to include the use of Thevenin’s 
theorem. In Chapter 7, the circuit application used a thermistor in 
one arm of the bridge to sense temperature. The bridge was used 
to compare the resistance of the thermistor with the resistance of 
a rheostat, which set the temperature at which the output would 
switch from one polarity to the opposite for turning on a heater 
in a tank filled with a liquid. In this application activity, you will 
work with a similar circuit, but this time it will be used to monitor 
the temperature in the tank to provide a visual indication that the 
temperature is within a specified range.
The Temperature Monitor
The basic measuring circuit in the temperature monitor is 
a Wheatstone bridge with an ammeter and a series resis-
tor acting as the load. The meter is an analog panel meter 
with a sensitivity of 50 mA full scale. The Wheatstone bridge 
 temperature-measuring circuit is shown in Figure 8–69(a), 
and the meter panel is shown in Figure 8–69(b).
The Thermistor
The thermistor is the same one used in the circuit application of 
Chapter 7, specifically a Thermometrics RL2006-13.3K-140-D1 
thermistor with a specified resistance of 25 kΩ at 25°C and a 
b of 4615K. Recall that b  is a constant supplied by the manu-
facturer that indicates the shape of the  temperature-resistance 
characteristic. As given in Chapter 7, the exponential equation 
for the resistance of a thermistor is approximated by
RT = R0e
ba
T0 - T
T0T b
where:
RT =  the resistance at a given temperature
R0 =  the resistance at a reference temperature
T0 =   the reference temperature in K (typically  
298 K, which is 25°C)
Application Activity
 
T =  temperature (K)
b =  a constant (K) provided by the manufacturer
A plot of this equation was given previously in Figure 7–59. 
You can confirm that your thermistor resistance calcula-
tions in this circuit application are in reasonable agreement 
with this plot.
If you have a graphing calculator such as the TI-84 Plus 
CE, you can easily reproduce the plot by entering the equation 
for it after pressing the 
y=  key. Figure 8–70 shows the plot 
on a TI-84 Plus CE calculator. The equation is shown at the 
top of the plot. R represents the resistance in ohms at the refer-
ence temperature (R0), T represents the reference temperature 
in K, and B represents b in K. Pressing the trace  button 
allows you to position the cursor along the graph to read val-
ues. Another way to see values is to press 
trace
2nd
, which 
brings up a table of values. The table limits and the increment 
between values is set in the 
2nd  window menu. The Table limits 
and increment were set to a start value of 298 and an incre-
ment of 5. Figure 8–71 shows the values with the resistance 
at 323 K selected. To simplify viewing temperature values in 
Celsius, a second equation is entered (Y2 = X - 273), which 
tabulated the temperature (in red) in Celsius.
Temperature Measuring Circuit
The Wheatstone bridge is designed to be balanced at 20°C. 
The resistance of the thermistor is approximately 32.6 kΩ 
at this temperature. You can confirm this value by substi-
tuting the temperature (in Kelvin) into the equation for RT. 
Remember that the temperature in K is °C + 273.
1. Substituting into the equation for RT, calculate the 
resistance of the thermistor at a temperature of 50°C 
(full-scale deflection of the meter).
2. Thevenize the bridge between terminals A and B by keep-
ing the ground reference and forming two facing Thevenin 
circuits as was illustrated in Figure 8–44. Assume the

thermistor temperature is 50°C and its resistance is the 
value calculated previously. Draw the Thevenin circuit for 
this temperature but do not show a load.
3. Show the load resistor for the Thevenin circuit you drew. 
The load is a resistor in series with the ammeter, which 
will have a current of 50 mA at full scale (50°C). You can 
find the value of the required load resistor by applying 
the superposition theorem to the two sources and calcu-
lating the total resistance from Ohm’s law (using the full-
scale deflection as the current). Subtract the Thevenin 
resistance of each arm from the total resistance to ob-
tain the required load resistance. Neglect the meter resis-
tance. Show the value calculated on the Thevenin circuit.
4. Calculate the thermistor resistance for the lower and 
upper limits of temperature (30°C and 40°C). Draw 
Thevenin circuits for each temperature and calculate the 
current through the load resistor.
The Meter Scale
A requirement for the temperature monitor is to mark 
three color bands on the meter to indicate that the temper-
ature is within the desired range. The desired range is be-
tween a low of 30°C and 40°C. The meter should indicate 
a too-cold range from 20°C to 30°C, a proper operating 
range from 30°C to 40°C, and a too-hot range from 40°C 
and 50°C. Full-scale deflection of the meter should be set 
for 50°C.
5. Indicate how you would mark the meter to have a 
quick visual indication of the temperature in the 
tank.

terminals regardless of the load resistance.
◆
●A practical voltage source has a nonzero internal resistance.
◆
●An ideal current source has infinite internal resistance. It provides a constant current regard-
less of the load resistance.

◆
●The superposition theorem is useful for multiple-source circuits.

◆
●The term equivalency, as used in Thevenin’s and Norton’s theorems, means that when a given 
load resistance is connected to the equivalent circuit, it will have the same voltage across it 
and the same current through it as when it was connected to the original circuit.
◆
●Norton’s theorem provides for the reduction of any two-terminal linear resistive circuit to 
an equivalent form consisting of an equivalent current source in parallel with an equivalent 
resistance.

the load resistance equals the internal source resistance.

INTRODUCTION
In the last chapter, you learned about the superposition 
theorem, Thevenin’s theorem, Norton’s theorem, maxi-
mum power transfer theorem, and several types of conver-
sion methods. These theorems and conversion methods  
are useful in solving some types of circuit problems for 
both dc and ac.
In this chapter, three more circuit analysis methods 
are introduced. These methods, based on Ohm’s law and 
Kirchhoff’s laws, are particularly useful in the analysis of 
multiple-loop circuits having two or more voltage or current 
sources. The methods presented here can be used alone or 
in conjunction with the techniques covered in the previous 
chapters. With experience, you will learn which method is 
best for a particular problem or you may develop a prefer-
ence for one of them.
In the branch current method, you will apply 
Kirchhoff’s laws to solve for current in various branches of 
a  multiple-loop circuit. A loop is a complete current path 
within a circuit. In the loop current method, you will solve 
for loop currents rather than branch currents. In the node 
voltage method, you will find the voltages at the indepen-
dent nodes in a circuit. As you know, a node is the junction 
of two or more components.

Simultaneous equations consist of a set of n equations containing n unknowns, 
where n is a number with a value of 2 or more. The number of independent equa-
tions in the set must equal the number of unknowns. For example, to solve for two 
unknown variables, you must have two independent equations; to solve for three un-
knowns you must have three independent equations; and so on. An independent equa-
tion is one that cannot be derived algebraically from any other equation in the set. 
For example, the equations 2x - 3y = 4 and 6x - 9y = 12 are not linearly indepen-
dent, because the second equation is a multiple of the first equation. Consequently, 
6x - 9y = 12 does not provide any information about x or y that 2x - 3y = 4 does 
not already provide.
Standard Form Equations
A linear equation is an algebraic equation in which each term is either a constant or 
a constant multiplied by a variable with an exponent of one. The graph of a linear 
equation is always a straight line. Linear equations are common in electronic circuit 
analysis; the variables are typically an unknown current or voltage. For the case where 
there are two unknowns (x1 and x2), there must be a set of two independent equations 
containing those variables expressed in standard form.
In standard form, the x1 variables are in the first position in each equation, and 
the x2 variables are in the second position in each equation. The variables with their 
coefficients are on the left side of the equation, and the constants are on the right side.
The set of two simultaneous equations written in standard form is
a1,1x1 + a1,2x2 = b1
a2,1x1 + a2,2x2 = b2
In these simultaneous equations, the “a” is the coefficient of the variables x1 and x2 and 
can represent values of circuit components, such as resistors. Notice that the subscripts 
of the coefficients contain two numbers. For example, a1,1 appears in the first equation 
as the coefficient of x1 and a2,1 appears in the second equation as the  coefficient of x1. 
The “b” is the constant and can represent a voltage source. This notation will be useful 
when you use a calculator to solve the equations.

unknown currents or voltages by solving simultaneous equations. These analysis 
methods, which include branch current, loop current, and node voltage methods,

Coverage is limited to equations with two unknowns and equations with three 
unknowns. These equations can then be solved simultaneously for the unknown 
quantities using one of the methods covered in this section.

Simultaneous Equations in Circuit Analysis  ●  351
In some cases, there are three unknown voltages or currents. In order to solve for 
the variables x1, x2, and x3, there must be a set of three independent equations con-
taining those variables. The general form for three simultaneous equations written in 
standard form is
a1,1x1 + a1,2x2 + a1,3x3 = b1
a2,1x1 + a2,2x2 + a2,3x3 = b2
a3,1x1 + a3,2x2 + a3,3x3 = b3
Assume the following three equations describe a particular circuit with three 
unknown currents I1, I2, and I3. The coefficients are resistance values and the con-

5I1 + 6I2 + 9I3 - 7 = 0

The equations are rearranged to put them in standard form as follows:
7I1 + 2I2 + 4I3 = 0
5I1 + 6I2 + 9I3 = 7
1I1 + 2I2 + 5I3 = 8

Solutions of Simultaneous Equations
Simultaneous equations can be solved by algebraic substitution, elimination, or by 
using matrix algebra (determinants).
Solving by Substitution You can solve two or three simultaneous equations in stan-
dard form using algebraic substitution by first solving one of the variables in terms of 
the others. However, because the process can become quite lengthy, we will restrict this 
method to second-order equations. Consider the following set of simultaneous equations:
2x1 + 6x2 = 8 (Eq. 1)
3x1 + 5x2 = 2 (Eq. 2)
Step 1:  Solve for x1 in terms of x2 in Eq. 1.
2x1 = 8 - 6x2
 x1 = 4 - 3x2
Step 2:  Substitute the result for x1 into Eq. 2 and solve for x2.
 3x1 + 5x2 = 2
3(4 - 3x2) + 5x2 = 2
 12 - 9x2 + 5x2 = 2
 -4x2 = -10
 x2 = -10
-4 = 2.50
Step 3: Substitute the value for x2 into the equation for x1 in Step 1.
x1 = 4 - 3x2 = 4 - 3(2.50) = 4 - 7.50 = -3.50
Solving by Elimination The elimination method is an alternate algebraic method 
for solving simultaneous equations. We will again illustrate it for two equations using 
the same two equations as in the substitution method. Solving equations with the 
elimination method is cumbersome with more than two variables, so we will restrict 
our discussion to two unknowns. To use the elimination method, you need to make 
one of the variables in both equation have the same coefficient. You can eliminate that 
variable by subtracting one equation from the other. Rewriting the two equations:
2x1 + 6x2 = 8 (Eq. 1)
3x1 + 5x2 = 2 (Eq. 2)
Step 1:  Multiply Eq. 1 by 3/2 (1.5):
3x1 + 9x2 = 12 (Eq. 1 * 3>2)
3x1 + 5x2 = 2  (Eq. 2)
Step 2:  Subtract Eq. 2 from (Eq.1 * 3>2)
3x1 + 9x2 = 12 (Eq. 1 * 3>2)
3x1 + 5x2 = 2    (Eq. 2)
4x2 = 10
x2 = 2.50
Substitute the result for x2 back into the Eq. 1 and solve for x1 as in the substitution 
method:
2x1 + 612.502 = 8 (Eq. 1)
2x1 = 8 - 15 = -7
x1 = -3.50

Simultaneous Equations in Circuit Analysis  ●  353
Solving by Determinants The determinant method is a part of matrix algebra and 
provides a “cookbook” approach for solving simultaneous equations with two or 
more variables. A matrix is an array of numbers, and a determinant is effectively the 
solution to a matrix, resulting in a specific value. Determinants are named for the size 
of the matrix; thus a second-order determinant is the solution to a 2 * 2 matrix and a 
third-order determinant is the solution to a 3 * 3 matrix. Second-order determinants 
are used for two variables and third-order determinants are used for three variables. 
The equations must be in standard form for a solution.
To illustrate the determinant method for two simultaneous equations, let’s find 
the values of I1 and I2 in the following two equations expressed in standard form. The 
coefficients are resistance values in ohms, and the constants are voltage in volts.
10I1 + 5I2 = 15
2I1 + 4I2 = 8
First, form the characteristic determinant from the matrix of the coefficients of 
the unknown currents. The first column in the determinant consists of the coef-
ficients of I1, and the second column consists of the coefficients of I2. The resulting 
determinant is
1st column 
2nd column
` 10
5
2
4 `
An evaluation of this characteristic determinant requires three steps.
Step 1:  Multiply the first number in the left column by the second number in the 
right column.
` 10
2 * 5
4 ` = 10 * 4 = 40
Step 2:  Multiply the second number in the left column by the first number in the 
right column.
` 10
2 * 5
4 ` = 2 * 5 = 10
Step 3: Subtract the product in Step 2 from the product in Step 1.
40 - 10 = 30
This difference is the value of the characteristic determinant (30 in this case).
Next, replace the coefficients of I1 in the first column of the characteristic deter-
minant with the constants (fixed numbers) on the right side of the equations to form 
another determinant:
` 15
5
8
4 `
Evaluate this I1 determinant as follows:
` 15
8 * 5
4 ` = 15 * 4 = 60
` 15
8 * 5
4 ` = 60 - (8 * 5) = 60 - 40 = 20
The value of this determinant is 20.
Replace coefficients of I1  
with constants from  
right sides of equations.

Solve the following set of equations for the unknown currents:
2I1 - 5I2 = 10

characteristic determinant as follows:
` 2
-5
6
10 ` = (2)(10) - (-5)(6) = 20 - (-30) = 20 + 30 = 50
Solving for I1 yields
I1 =

50
= (10)(10) - (-5)(20)
50

50 = 4 A

I2 =
` 2
10

20 `
50
= (2)(20) - (6)(10)
50
= 40 - 60

= ∙0.4 A
A result with a negative sign indicates that the direction of actual current is 
 opposite to the assigned direction.
Note that multiplication can be expressed either by the multiplication sign such 
as 2 * 10 or by parentheses such as (2)(10).

Third-order determinants can be evaluated by the expansion method. We will il-

equations expressed in standard form:
 1I1 + 3I2 - 2I3 = 7
 0I1 + 4I2 + 1I3 = 8
-5I1 + 1I2 + 6I3 = 9
The characteristic determinant for the matrix of coefficients for this set of equations 
is formed in a similar way to that used earlier for the second-order determinant. The 
first column consists of the coefficients of I1, the second column consists of the coef-

Solving Matrices by Calculator Many scientific calculators have built-in functions 
for solving simultaneous equations and make the results much easier to obtain. As 
with “manual” methods, it is important to first get the equations into the standard 
form before entering data on a calculator. We will focus on using matrix algebra as 
the basic means to find the unknowns.
A typical sequence for entering the data for a specific set of equations into a cal-
culator is illustrated in a generic way for three simultaneous equations in Figure 9–1.

◀FIGURE 9–1
In the generic example shown in Figure 9–1, you can think of the three equations as 
being composed of three matrices: the coefficient matrix indicated by 3A4, the constant 
matrix indicated by 3B4, and the unknown matrix: let us call it 3X4. A shorthand 
way of indicating the three simultaneous equations is 3A43X4 = 3B4. (Matrices are 
written with a capital letter enclosed in square brackets or a bold italic capital letter. 
Multiplying both sides by 3A4- 1, we get 3X4 = 3A4- 13B4.) (Note that 3A4- 13A4 
produces an identity matrix 3I4, which is equivalent to multiplying by 1.)
The TI-84 Plus CE calculator is used to illustrate the procedure in Example 9–5. If 
you have a TI-86 or TI-89, the same problem is used in Examples 9–6 and 9–7 using 
the procedure for those calculators. Other graphing calculators may have a differ-

Branch Current Method  ●  361
Figure 9–8 shows a circuit that will be used as the basic model throughout the 
chapter to illustrate each of the three circuit analysis methods. In this circuit, there are 
only two nonredundant closed loops. A loop is a complete current path within a cir-
cuit, and you can view a set of nonredundant closed loops as a set of  “windowpanes,” 
where each windowpane represents one nonredundant loop. Also, there are four 
nodes as indicated by the letters A, B, C, and D. A node is a junction where two or 
more components are connected. When defined in reference to the branch current 
method, a branch is a current path and there are three branches in this circuit: one 
containing R1, one containing R2, and one containing R3. (The term branch is also 
used to describe a path between two nodes.) The branch current method is an analy-
sis method that relies on Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s laws to find unknown currents 
in a circuit.

Step 1:  Assign a current in each circuit branch in an arbitrary direction.
Step 2:  Show the polarities of the resistor voltages according to the assigned 
branch current directions.
Step 3:  Apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law around each closed loop (algebraic sum of 
voltages is equal to zero).
Step 4:  Apply Kirchhoff’s current law at the minimum number of nodes so that all 
branch currents are included (algebraic sum of currents at a node equals zero).

These steps are demonstrated with the aid of Figure 9–9. First, the branch currents 
I1, I2, and I3 are assigned in the direction shown. Don’t worry about the actual cur-
rent directions at this point; if a guess is wrong, it will show up as a negative result. 
Second, the polarities of the voltage drops across R1, R2, and R3 are indicated in the 
figure according to the assigned current directions. Third, Kirchhoff’s voltage law 
applied to the two loops gives the following equations where the resistance values are 
the coefficients for the unknown currents:
Equation 1: R1I1 + R2I2 - VS1 = 0 for loop 1
Equation 2: R2I2 + R3I3 - VS2 = 0 for loop 2
Fourth, Kirchhoff’s current law is applied to node A, including all branch currents 
as follows:
Equation 3: I1 - I2 + I3 = 0
The negative sign indicates that I2 is out of the node. Fifth and last, the three equa-
tions must be solved for the three unknown currents, I1, I2, and I3. Example 9–8 shows 
how to solve equations by the substitution method.

Solution 
Step 1:  Assign branch currents as shown in Figure 9–10. Keep in mind that you can 
assume any current direction at this point and that the final solution will 
have a negative sign if the actual current is opposite to the assigned current.
Step 2:  Mark the polarities of the resistor voltage drops in accordance with the 
assigned current directions as shown in the figure.
Step 3: Applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law around the left loop gives
470I1 + 220I2 - 10 = 0
Around the right loop gives
220I2 + 820I3 - 5 = 0
where all resistance values are in ohms and voltage values are in volts. For 
simplicity, the units are not shown.
Step 4: At node A, the current equation is
I1 - I2 + I3 = 0
Step 5:  The equations are solved by substitution as follows. First, find I1 in terms 
of I2 and I3.
I1 = I2 - I3
Now, substitute I2 - I3 for I1 in the left loop equation.
470(I2 - I3) + 220I2 = 10
470I2 - 470I3 + 220I2 = 10
690I2 - 470I3 = 10
Next, take the right loop equation and solve for I2 in terms of I3.
220I2 = 5 - 820I3
I2 = 5 - 820I3
220
Substituting this expression for I2 into 820I2 - 470I3 = 10 yields

b - 470I3 = 10
 3450 - 565800I3

 I3 =
5.68
3041.8 = 0.00187 A = 1.87 mA
Now, substitute the value of I3 in amps into the right loop equation.
220I2 + 820(0.00187) = 5
Solve for I2.
I2 = 5 - 820(0.00187)
220
= 3.47
220 = 0.0158 = 15.8 mA
Substituting I2 and I3 values into the current equation at node A yields
I1 - 0.0158 + 0.00187 = 0
I1 = 0.0158 - 0.00187 = 0.0139 A = 13.9 mA

366  ●  Branch, Loop, and Node Analyses
The loop current method is a systematic method of circuit analysis that applies 
Kirchhoff’s voltage law around closed paths through all components of a circuit. The 
resulting equations can be solved by various methods to determine the currents. The 
loop current method is given in the following steps and is illustrated in Figure 9–13, 
which is the same circuit configuration used in the branch current analysis. It demon-
strates the basic principles well.
Step 1:  Although direction of an assigned loop current is arbitrary, we will as-
sign a current in the clockwise (CW) direction around each nonredundant 
closed loop, for consistency. This may not be the actual current direction, 
but it does not matter. The number of loop-current assignments must be 
sufficient to include current through all components in the circuit.
Step 2:  Indicate the voltage drop polarities in each loop based on the assigned 
current directions.
Step 3:  Apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law around each closed loop. When more than 
one loop current passes through a component, include its voltage drop. 
This results in one equation for each loop.
Step 4:  Using substitution or determinants, solve the resulting equations for the 
loop currents.

▲FIGURE 9–13
First, the loop currents IA and IB are assigned in the CW direction as shown in 
Figure 9–13. A loop current could be assigned around the outer perimeter of the 
circuit, but this would be redundant since IA and IB already pass through all of the 
components.
Second, the polarities of the voltage drops across R1, R2, and R3 are shown based on 
the loop-current directions. Notice that IA and IB are in opposite directions through R2 
because R2 is common to both loops. Therefore, two voltage polarities are indicated. In 
reality, the R2 current cannot be separated into two parts, but remember that the loop 
currents are basically mathematical quantities used for analysis purposes. The actual 
current in R2 is the superposition of the two loop currents. The polarities of the voltage 
sources are fixed and are not affected by the current assignments.
Third, Kirchhoff’s voltage law applied to the two loops results in the following two 
equations:
 R1IA + R2(IA - IB) = VS1  for loop A
 R3IB + R2(IB - IA) = -VS2  for loop B
Notice that IA is positive in loop A and IB is positive in loop B.
Fourth, the like terms in the equations are combined and rearranged into standard 
form for convenient solution so that they have the same position in each equation, 
that is, the IA term is first and the IB term is second. The equations are rearranged into 
the following form. Once the loop currents are evaluated, all of the branch currents 
can be determined.
(R1 + R2)IA - R2IB = VS1  for loop A
-R2IA + (R2 + R3)IB = -VS2  for loop B

Loop Current Method  ●  367
Notice that in the loop current method only two equations are required for the 
same circuit that required three equations in the branch current method. The last two 
equations (developed in the fourth step) follow a form to make loop analysis easier. 
Referring to these last two equations, notice that for loop A, the total resistance in the 
loop, R1 + R2, is multiplied by IA (its loop current). Also in the loop A equation, the 
resistance common to both loops, R2, is multiplied by the other loop current, IB, and 
subtracted from the first term. The same form is seen in the loop B equation except 
that the terms have been rearranged. From these observations, a concise rule for ap-
plying steps 1 to 4 is as follows:
(Sum of resistors in loop) times (loop current) minus (each resistor common to both 
loops) times (associated adjacent loop current) equals (source voltage in the loop).
Example 9–10 illustrates the application of this rule to the loop current analysis of a 
circuit.
EXAMPLE 9–10
Using the loop current method, find the branch currents in Figure 9–14.
 
Solution 
Assign the loop currents (IA and IB) as shown in Figure 9–14; resistance values are 
in ohms and voltage values are in volts. Use the rule described to set up the two 
loop equations.
 (470 + 220)IA - 220IB = 10
 690IA - 220IB = 10  for loop A

The negative sign on IB means that its assigned direction is opposite to the actual 
current.
Now find the actual branch currents. Since IA is the only current through R1, it 
is also the branch current I1.
I1 = IA = 13.9 mA
Since IB is the only current through R3, it is also the branch current I3.
I3 = IB = ∙1.87 mA
The negative sign indicates opposite direction of that originally assigned to IB.
As originally assigned, both loop currents IA and IB are through R2 in opposite 
directions. The branch current I2 is the difference between IA and IB.
I2 = IA - IB = 13.9 mA - (-1.87 mA) = 15.8 mA
Keep in mind that once you know the branch currents, you can find the voltages 
by using Ohm’s law. Notice that these results are the same as in Example 9–8 
where the branch current method was used.

Circuits with More Than Two Loops
The loop current method can be systematically applied to circuits with any number 
of loops. Of course, the more loops there are, the more difficult is the solution, but 
calculators have greatly simplified solving simultaneous equations. Most circuits that 
you will encounter will not have more than three loops. Keep in mind that the loop 
currents are not the actual physical currents but are mathematical quantities assigned 
for analysis purposes.
A widely used circuit that you have already encountered is the Wheatstone 
bridge. The Wheatstone bridge was originally designed as a stand-alone measur-
ing instrument but has largely been replaced with other instruments. However, the 
Wheatstone bridge circuit is incorporated in automated measuring instruments and, 
as explained previously, is widely used in the scale industry and in other measure-
ment applications.
One method for solving the bridge parameters, which directly leads to finding the 
current in each arm of the bridge and the load current, is to write loop equations for 
the bridge. Figure 9–15 shows a Wheatstone bridge with three loops. Example 9–11 
illustrates how to solve for all of the currents in the bridge.

For the Wheatstone bridge circuit in Figure 9–16, find the loop currents. Use the 
loop currents to solve for the current in each resistor (branch current).
 
Solution 
Assign three clockwise loop currents (IA, IB, and IC) as shown in Figure 9–16. Then 
write the loop equations. The equations for the loops are
Loop A: 
-12 + 330(IA - IB) + 300(IA - IC) = 0
Loop B: 330(IB - IA) + 360IB + 1000(IB - IC) = 0
Loop C: 300(IC - IA) + 1000(IC - IB) + 390IC = 0
Rearrange the equations into standard form:
Loop A: 
 630IA - 330IB  - 300IC  = 12 V
Loop B:  -330IA + 1690IB - 1000IC = 0 
Loop C:  -300IA - 1000IB + 1690IC = 0 
You can solve these equations with substitution, but this is tedious with three 
unknowns. The determinant method or directly solving with your calculator are 
simpler ways. Units are not shown until the end of the problem.

Another useful three-loop circuit is the bridged-T circuit. While the circuit is pri-
marily applied in ac filter circuits using reactive components, it is introduced here 
to illustrate the three-loop circuit solution. A loaded resistive bridged-T is shown in 
Figure 9–17.
Resistors will often be in kΩ (or even MΩ) so the coefficients for simultaneous 
equations will become quite large if they are shown explicitly in solving equations. To 
simplify entering and solving equations with kΩ, it is common practice to drop the 
kΩ in the equations and recognize that the unit for current is the mA if the voltage is 
volts. The following example of a bridged-T circuit illustrates this idea.

node voltage Method
Another method of analysis of multiple-loop circuits is called the node volt-
age method. It is based on finding the voltages at each node in the circuit using 
Kirchhoff’s current law. Recall that a node is the junction of two or more 
components.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆
◆Use node analysis to find unknown quantities in a circuit
◆
◆Select the nodes at which the voltage is unknown and assign currents
◆
◆Apply Kirchhoff’s current law at each node
◆
◆Develop and solve the node equations

Node Voltage Method  ●  373
The general steps for the node voltage method of circuit analysis are as follows:
Step 1: Determine the number of nodes.
Step 2:  Select one node as a reference. All voltages will be relative to the refer-
ence node. Assign voltage designations to each node where the voltage is 
unknown.
Step 3:  Assign currents at each node where the voltage is unknown, except at the 
reference node. The directions are arbitrary.
Step 4:  Apply Kirchhoff’s current law to each node where currents are assigned.
Step 5:  Express the current equations in terms of voltages, and solve the equa-
tions for the unknown node voltages using Ohm’s law.

Circuit for node voltage analysis.
We will use Figure 9–20 to illustrate the general approach to node voltage analysis. 
First, establish the nodes. In this case, there are four nodes, as indicated in the figure. 
Second, let’s use node B as the reference. Think of it as the circuit’s reference ground. 
Node voltages C and D are already known to be the source voltages. The voltage 
at node A is the only unknown; it is designated as VA. Third, arbitrarily assign the 
branch currents at node A as indicated in the figure. Fourth, the Kirchhoff current 
equation at node A is
I1 - I2 + I3 = 0
Fifth, express the currents in terms of circuit voltages using Ohm’s law.
I1 = V1
R1
= VS1 - VA

I2 = V2

R3

Substituting these terms into the current equation yields

= 0
The only unknown is VA; so solve the single equation by combining and rearrang-
ing terms. Once you know the voltage, you can calculate all branch currents. Example 
9–13 illustrates this method further.

Find the node voltage VA in Figure 9–21 and determine the branch currents.
EXAMPLE 9–13
 
Solution 
The reference node is chosen at B. The unknown node voltage is VA, as indicated 
in Figure 9–21. This is the only unknown voltage. Branch currents are assigned  
at node A as shown. The current equation is
I1 - I2 + I3 = 0
Substitution for currents using Ohm’s law gives the equation in terms of voltages.

(6692)(38540) = 3.47 V
You can now determine the branch currents.
I1 = 10 V - 3.47 V

I2 = 3.47 V
220 Ω= 15.8 mA

Node Voltage Method  ●  375
Example 9–13 illustrated an obvious advantage to the node method. The branch 
current method required three equations for the three unknown currents. The loop 
current method reduced the number of simultaneous equations but required the extra 
step of converting the fictitious loop currents to the actual currents in the resistors. 
The node method for the circuit in Figure 9–21 reduced the equations to one, in which 
all of the currents were written in terms of one unknown node voltage. The node volt-
age method also has the advantage of finding unknown voltages, which are easier to 
directly measure than current.
Node Voltage Method for a Wheatstone Bridge
The node voltage method can be applied to a Wheatstone bridge. The Wheatstone 
bridge is shown with nodes identified in Figure 9–22 with currents shown. Node D  
is usually selected as the reference node, and node A has the same potential as the 
source voltage. When setting up the equations for the two unknown node voltages 
(B and C), it is necessary to specify a current direction as described in the gen-
eral steps. The direction of current in RL is dependent on the bridge resistances; 
if the assigned direction is incorrect, it will show up as a negative current in the 
solution.

Node Voltage Method for the Bridged-T Circuit
Applying the node voltage method to the bridged-T circuit also results in two equa-
tions with two unknowns. As in the case of the Wheatstone bridge, there are four 
nodes as shown in Figure 9–24. Node D is the reference and node A is the source volt-
age, so the two unknown voltages are at nodes C and D. The effect of a load resistor 
on the circuit is usually the most important question, so the voltage at node C is the 
focus. A calculator solution of the simultaneous equations is simplified for analyzing 
the effect of various loads because only the equation for node C is affected when the 
load changes. Example 9–15 illustrates this idea.

The gain (A) of the dependent source can be positive or 
negative, depending on how it is configured.
Assume you need to calculate in detail the effect of an 
operational amplifier circuit on a transducer that serves as 
an input. Some transducers, such as pH meters, appear as 
a small source voltage with a high series resistance. The trans-
ducer that is shown here is modeled as a small Thevenin dc 
voltage source in series with a Thevenin resistance of 10 kΩ.
Practical amplifiers are created using an operational 
amplifier with external components. Figure 9–28(a) shows 
one type of amplifier configuration that includes the Theve-
nin resistance of the source along with two other external 
resistors. RS represents the Thevenin source resistance. RL is 
connected from the operational amplifier output to ground 
as a load, and RF is connected from the output to the input 
as a feedback resistor. Feedback is used in most operational 
amplifier circuits and is simply a path from the output back 
to the input. It has many advantages as you will learn in a 
later course.

▲FIGURE 9–29
Figure 9–28(b) is the equivalent circuit model of the source, 
the op-amp, and the load that we will use for analysis purposes. 
The internal gain of the dependent source, shown with the let-
ter A on the op-amp block, is negative because it is an inverting 
amplifier (the output has the opposite sign of the input). This 
internal gain is generally extremely high. Although it is a very 
large number, the actual gain of the circuit with the external 
components is much lower because it is controlled by the exter-
nal components rather than the internal gain.
The specific values for the circuit in this application are 
given in Figure 9–29 along with assigned currents. All values 
are shown in kΩ to simplify entering the coefficients in the 
equations that you will use. Although op-amp circuits have 
excellent simple approximations for determining the output 
voltage, there are times you may want to know the exact 
output. You can apply your knowledge from this chapter to 
the circuit to find the exact output voltage.
The amplifier model in Figure 9–29 can be analyzed 
easiest with the node voltage method because there are only 
two nodes, A and B, that have unknown voltages. At node A, 
the voltage is designated and is the same as the input to the 
op-amp (VIN). At node B, the voltage is designated and also 
represents the output (or load voltage), VL. Current names 
and directions are assigned as shown.

True/False Quiz  ●  381
Analysis
Apply Kirchhoff’s current law at each of the unknown nodes 
to write the node equations.
Node A: IS = IF + IIN
Node B: IOUT + IF = IL
Next, apply Ohm’s law and let VIN = VA. The internal 
source voltage for the op-amp is AVIN, so this is written as 
AVA to express the unknowns in terms of VA and VB.
Node A: VS - VA

INTRODUCTION
This chapter departs from the coverage of dc circuits and 
 introduces the concepts of magnetism and electromag-
netism. The operation of devices such as the relay, the 
solenoid, and the speaker is based partially on magnetic or 
electromagnetic principles. Electromagnetic induction is im-
portant in an electrical component called an inductor or coil, 
which is the topic in Chapter 13.
Two types of magnets are the permanent magnet and the 
electromagnet. The permanent magnet maintains a constant 
magnetic field between its two poles with no external exci-
tation. The electromagnet produces a magnetic field only 
when there is current through it. The electromagnet is basi-
cally a coil of wire wound around a magnetic core material.
The chapter concludes with an introduction to dc genera-
tors and dc motors.

The Magnetic Field  ●  391
A permanent magnet, such as the bar magnet shown in Figure 10–1, has a magnetic 
field surrounding it. All magnetic fields have their origin in moving charge, which in 
solid materials is caused by moving electrons. In certain materials such as iron, atoms 
can be aligned so that the electron motion is reinforced, creating a measurable field 
that extends in three dimensions. Even some electrical insulators can exhibit this be-

insulators. They are used in many applications including hard disk read/write heads, 
sensors, magnetic resonant imaging, and motors to name a few.
A permanent magnet has a magnetic field surrounding it. A magnetic field is 
 visualized by lines of force that  radiate from the north pole (N) to the south  
pole (S) and back to the north pole through the magnetic material.

Magnetic lines of force around a bar

To illustrate magnetic fields, “lines of force” or flux lines are used to represent an 
unseen field. Flux lines are widely used as a description of a field, showing the strength 
and direction of the field. The flux lines never cross. When lines are close together, the 
field is more intense; when they are farther apart, the field is weaker. The flux lines are 
always drawn from the north pole (N) to the south pole (S) of a magnet. Even in weak 
magnets, the number of lines based on the mathematical definition is extremely large, so 
for clarity, only a few lines are generally shown in drawings of magnetic fields.
When unlike poles of two permanent magnets interact, their magnetic fields pro-
duce an attractive force, as indicated in Figure 10–2(a). When two like poles are 
brought close together, they repel each other, as shown in part (b).
When a nonmagnetic material such as paper, glass, wood, or plastic is placed in a 
magnetic field, the lines of force are unaltered, as shown in Figure 10–3(a). However, 
when a magnetic material such as iron is placed in the magnetic field, the lines of 
force tend to change course and pass through the iron rather than through the sur-
rounding air. They do so because the iron provides a magnetic path that is more 
easily established than that of air. Figure 10–3(b) illustrates this principle. The fact

that magnetic lines of force follow a path through iron or other materials is a con-
sideration in the design of shields that prevent stray magnetic fields from affecting 
sensitive circuits.
Magnetic Flux (F)
The group of force lines going from the north pole to the south pole of a magnet is 
called the magnetic flux, symbolized by f (the Greek letter phi). A stronger field is 
represented by more lines of force. Several factors determine the strength of a magnet, 
including the material and physical geometry as well as the distance from the magnet. 
Magnetic field lines tend to be more concentrated at the poles.
The unit of magnetic flux is the weber (Wb). One weber equals 108 lines. The weber 
is a very large unit; thus, in most practical situations, the microweber (mWb) is used. 
One microweber equals 100 lines of magnetic flux.

former, wireless communications, 
and fluorescent lights. He worked

The Magnetic Field  ●  393
Magnetic Flux Density (B)
The magnetic flux density is the amount of flux per unit area perpendicular to the 
magnetic field. Its symbol is B, and its SI unit is the tesla (T). One tesla equals one 
weber per square meter (Wb/m2). The following formula expresses the flux density:
 
B = f
A 
Equation 10–1
where f is the flux (Wb) and A is the cross-sectional area in square meters (m2) of the 
magnetic field.
Compare the flux and the flux density in the two magnetic cores shown in Figure 10–4. 
The diagram represents the cross section of a magnetized material. Assume that each 
dot represents 100 lines or 1 mWb.
EXAMPLE 10–1
 
Solution 
The flux is simply the number of lines. In Figure 10–4(a) there are 49 dots. Each represents 
1 mWb, so the flux is 49 mWb. In Figure 10–4(b) there are 72 dots, so the flux is 72 mWb.
To calculate the flux density in Figure 10–4(a), first calculate the area in m2.
A = l * w = 0.025 m * 0.025 m = 6.25 * 10-4 m2
For Figure 10–4(b) the area is
A = l * w = 0.025 m * 0.050 m = 1.25 * 10-3 m2
Use Equation 10–1 to calculate the flux density. For Figure 10–4(a) the flux density is
B = f
A =
49 mWb
6.25 * 10-4 m2 = 78.4 * 10-3 Wb/m2 = 78.4 * 10-3 T
For Figure 10–4(b) the flux density is
B = f
A =
72 mWb
1.25 * 10-3 m2 = 57.6 * 10-3 Wb/m2 = 57.6 * 10-3  T
The data in Table 10–1 compares the two cores. Note that the core with the 
largest flux does not necessarily have the highest flux density.

The Gauss Although the tesla (T) is the mks SI unit for flux density, another unit called 
the gauss, G, from the CGS (centimeter-gram-second) system, is used (104 G = 1 T). 
In fact, the instrument used to measure flux density is the gaussmeter. A typical gauss-
meter is shown in Figure 10–5. This particular gaussmeter is a portable unit with four 
ranges that can measure magnetic fields as small as the earth’s field (about 0.5 G, but 
widely varies depending on location) to strong fields such as in an MRI unit (about 
10,000 G or 1 T). The unit gauss is still in widespread use, so you should be familiar 
with it as well as the tesla.
To use a gaussmeter such as the one shown, the user first needs to calibrate the meter 
by zeroing it. For best results, the probe is inserted into a “zero gauss” chamber that 
shields the sensor from stray magnetic fields including the earth’s magnetic field. The 
zero set controls are adjusted for a zero reading. The probe is then placed in the mag-
netic field and oriented to read the field. The probe shown in Figure 10–5 is a transverse 
probe; to measure a magnet’s strength, it is placed flat on the magnet near the tip.
If the flux density in a certain magnetic material is 0.23 T and the area of the mate-
rial is 0.38 in.2, what is the flux through the material?
 
Solution 
First, 0.38 in.2 must be converted to square meters. 39.37 in. = 1 m; therefore,
A = 0.38 in.2[1 m2/(39.37 in.)2] = 245 * 10-6 m2
The flux through the material is
f = BA = (0.23 T)(245 * 10-6 m2) = 56.4 MWb
 
Related Problem 
Calculate B if A = 0.05 in.2 and f = 1,000 mWb.

The Magnetic Field  ●  395
How Materials Become Magnetized
Ferromagnetic materials such as iron, nickel, and cobalt become magnetized when 
placed in the magnetic field of a magnet. We have all seen a permanent magnet pick 
up things like paper clips, nails, and iron filings. In these cases, the object becomes 
magnetized (that is, it actually becomes a magnet itself) under the influence of the 
permanent magnetic field and becomes attracted to the magnet. When removed from 
the magnetic field, the object tends to lose its magnetism.
Ferromagnetic materials have minute magnetic domains created within their 
atomic structure. These domains can be viewed as very small bar magnets with north 
and south poles. When the material is not exposed to an external magnetic field, the 
magnetic domains are randomly oriented, as shown in Figure 10–6(a). When the ma-
terial is placed in a magnetic field, the domains align themselves as shown in part (b). 
Thus, the object itself effectively becomes a magnet.

material.

when the material is magnetized.

Magnetic domains in (a) an unmagnetized and in (b) a magnetized material.
Effects of the Magnetic Material The magnetic material affects not only the mag-
netic flux density at the poles but also how the magnetic flux density falls off as 
 distance from the poles increases. The physical size also affects the flux density. For 
example, two disk magnets that are made from alnico (an alloy of aluminum (Al), 
nickel (Ni), and cobalt (Co)) have very similar densities near the pole, but the larger 
magnet has much higher flux density, as you move away from the pole, as shown in 
Figure 10–7. Notice that the flux density falls off rapidly as you move away from the 
pole. This type of plot can illustrate if a given magnet is effective for a specific applica-
tion that depends on the distance in which the magnet must work.

The Hall effect was discovered by 
Hall in 1879 while he worked on 
his doctoral thesis in physics at 
Johns Hopkins University. Hall’s 
experiments consisted of exposing 
thin gold leaf on a glass plate to a 
magnetic field and accessing tap 
points on the gold leaf at points 
down its length. After applying a 
current through the gold leaf, he 
observed a tiny voltage across the 
tap points. (Photo credit: Voltiana,

The type of material is an important parameter for the actual flux density of mag-
nets. Table 10–2 lists the flux densities of typical magnetic fields in teslas. For per-
manent magnets, the numbers given are based on the flux density of the field that is 
typical if measured close to the pole. As previously discussed, these values can drop 
significantly as distance from the poles is increased. The strongest field most people 
will ever experience is about 1 T (10,000 G) if they have an MRI exam. The strongest 
commercially available permanent magnets are neodymium-iron-boron composites 
(NdFeB), commonly abbreviated NIB. To find the flux density in gauss, multiply the 
values in teslas by 104 (10,000).

Applications
Permanent magnets are widely used in brushless motors (discussed in Section 10–7), 
magnetic separators, speakers, microphones, automobiles and devices that use ion 
beams in electronic manufacturing, physics research, and certain medical devices. They 
are also commonly used in switches, such as the normally closed switch illustrated in 
Figure 10–8. When the magnet is near the switch mechanism, as in Figure 10–8(a), the 
switch is closed. When the magnet is moved away, as in part (b), the spring pulls the 
arm open. Magnetic switches are widely used in security systems.

Operation of a magnetic switch.
Another important application of permanent magnets is in sensors that take advan-
tage of an effect known as the Hall effect. The Hall effect is the occurrence of a small 
voltage (a few mV) that is generated on opposite sides of a thin current-carrying conduc-
tor or semiconductor (the Hall element) in a magnetic field. A voltage called the Hall 
voltage appears across the Hall element, as illustrated in Figure 10–9. This voltage is 
proportional to the magnetic field strength, B. The Hall voltage is due to the forces 
exerted on the electrons as they traverse the magnetic field, causing an excess of charge 
on one side of the Hall element. Although the effect was first noticed in a conductor, it

is more pronounced in semiconductors, which are normally used in Hall-effect sensors. 
Notice that the magnetic field, the electric current, and the Hall voltage are all at right 
angles to each other. This voltage is amplified and can be used to detect the presence 
of the magnetic field. The detection of a magnetic field is useful in sensor applications.
Hall-effect sensors are widely used because they are small, inexpensive, and have 
no moving parts. In addition, they are noncontacting sensors, so they can last for 
billions of repeated operations, a clear advantage over contacting sensors that can 
wear out. Hall-effect sensors can detect the nearby presence of a magnet by sensing 
its magnetic field. For this reason, they can be used for position measurements or for 
sensing motion. They are used in conjunction with other sensor elements to measure 
current, temperature, or pressure.
There are many applications for Hall-effect sensors. In automobiles, Hall-effect 
sensors are used to measure various parameters such as throttle angle, crankshaft and 
camshaft positions, distributor position, tachometer, power seat, and rear-view  mirror 
positions. As a current sensor, they are used in motor control (see Section 10–7), switch 
mode power supplies, and load control. An example of a current sensor using a Hall-
effect sensor is the Allegro ACS723. A few other applications for Hall-effect sensors 
include measuring parameters for rotating devices such as drills, fans, vanes in flow 
meters, and disk speed detection.

Current produces a magnetic field, called an electromagnetic field, around a 
 conductor, as illustrated in Figure 10–10. The invisible lines of force of the magnetic 
field form a concentric circular pattern around the conductor and are continuous along 
its length. Unlike the bar magnet, the magnetic field surrounding a wire does not have 
a north or south pole. The direction of the lines of force surrounding the conductor 
shown in the figure is for conventional current. The lines are in a clockwise direction. 
When current is reversed, the magnetic field lines are in a counterclockwise direction.

Visible effects of an electromagnetic field.
Although the magnetic field cannot be seen, it is capable of producing visible effects. 
For example, if a current-carrying wire is inserted through a sheet of paper in a perpen-
dicular direction, iron filings placed on the surface of the paper arrange themselves along 
the magnetic lines of force in concentric rings, as illustrated in Figure 10–11(a). Part (b) 
of the figure illustrates that the north pole of a compass placed in the electromagnetic 
field will point in the direction of the lines of force. The field is stronger closer to the 
 conductor and becomes weaker with increasing distance from the conductor.
Right-Hand Rule An aid to remembering the direction of the lines of force is illus-
trated in Figure 10–12. Imagine that you are grasping the conductor with your right 
hand, with your thumb pointing in the direction of current. Your fingers point in the 
direction of the magnetic lines of force.

Electromagnetism  ●  399
Electromagnetic Properties
Several important properties are related to electromagnetic fields.
Permeability (M) The ease with which a magnetic field can be established in a given 
material is measured by the permeability of that material. The higher the permeabil-
ity, the more easily a magnetic field can be established.
The symbol of permeability is m (the Greek letter mu), and its value varies depend-
ing on the type of material. The permeability of a vacuum (m0) is 4p * 10-7 Wb/At # m 
(webers/ampere-turn # meter) and is used as a reference. Ferromagnetic materials 
 typically have permeabilities hundreds of times larger than that of a  vacuum, indicating 
that a magnetic field can be set up with relative ease in these materials. Ferromagnetic 
materials include iron, steel, nickel, cobalt, and their alloys.
The relative permeability (mr) of a material is the ratio of its absolute permeability 
to the permeability of a vacuum (m0).

Reluctance in magnetic circuits is analogous to resistance in electric circuits. The

Wb/At # m as follows:

Equation 10–3 is analogous to Equation 2–6 for determining wire resistance. 
Recall that Equation 2–6 is

The reciprocal of resistivity (r) is conductivity (s). By substituting 1/s for r, 
Equation 2–6 can be written as
R =

mr = m

Equation 10–2
Because it is a ratio of permeabilities, mr is dimensionless. Typical magnetic materials, 
such as iron, have a relative permeability of a few hundred. Highly permeable materi-
als can have a relative permeability as high as 100,000.
Reluctance (ℛ) The opposition to the establishment of a magnetic field in a material 
is called reluctance. The value of reluctance is directly proportional to the length (l ) of 
the magnetic path and inversely proportional to the permeability (m) and to the cross-
sectional area (A) of the material, as expressed by the following equation:

400  ●  Magnetism and Electromagnetism
Compare this last equation for wire resistance with Equation 10–3. The length (l ) 
and the area (A) have the same meaning in both equations. The conductivity (s) in 
electrical circuits is analogous to permeability (m) in magnetic circuits. Also, resis-
tance (R) in electric circuits is analogous to reluctance (ℛ) in magnetic circuits; both 
are oppositions. Typically, the reluctance of a magnetic circuit is 50,000 At/Wb or 
more, depending on the size and type of material.
Calculate the reluctance of a torus (a doughnut-shaped core) made of low-carbon 
steel. The inner radius of the torus is 1.75 cm and the outer radius of the torus is 
2.25 cm. Assume the permeability of low-carbon steel is 2 * 10-4  Wb/At # m.
 
Solution 
You must convert centimeters to meters before you calculate the area and length. 
From the dimensions given, the thickness (diameter) is 0.5 cm = 0.005 m. Thus, 
the cross-sectional area is
A = pr2 = p(0.0025)2 = 1.96 * 10-5 m2
The length is equal to the circumference of the torus measured at the average 
radius of 2.0 cm or 0.020 m.

m = m0mr = (4p * 10-7 Wb/At # m)(800) = 1.00 * 10-3 Wb/At # m
Next, convert the length to meters and the area to square meters.

Magnetomotive Force (mmf) As you have learned, current in a conductor produces a 
magnetic field. The cause of a magnetic field is called the  magnetomotive force (mmf). 
Magnetomotive force is something of a misnomer because in a physics sense mmf is 
not really a force, but rather it is a direct result of the movement of charge (current). 

Electromagnetism  ●  401
The unit of mmf, the ampere-turn (At), is established on the basis of the current in a 
single loop (turn) of wire. The formula for mmf is
Fm = NI
where Fm is the magnetomotive force, N is the number of turns of wire, and I is the 
current in amperes.
Figure 10–13 illustrates that a number of turns of wire carrying a current around a 
magnetic material creates the mmf that sets up flux lines through the magnetic path. 
The amount of flux depends on the magnitude of the mmf and on the reluctance of 
the material, as expressed by the following equation:

Equation 10–5 is known as Ohm’s law for magnetic circuits because the flux (f) is 
 analogous to current, the mmf (Fm) is analogous to voltage, and the reluctance (ℛ) is 
analogous to resistance. Like other phenomena in science, the flux is an effect, the mmf 
is a cause, and the reluctance is an opposition. In magnetic circuits the cause of flux is 
current (and number of turns), whereas in electric circuits the cause of current is voltage.
One important difference between an electric circuit and a magnetic circuit is that 
in magnetic circuits, Equation 10–5 is only valid up to a certain point before the mag-
netic material saturates (flux becomes a maximum). You will see this when you look 
at magnetization curves in Section 10–4. Another difference that was already noted 
is that flux does occur in permanent magnets with no source of mmf. In a permanent 
magnet, the flux is due to internal electron motion rather than an external current. No 
equivalent effect occurs in electric circuits.

Rework the example for I = 85 mA and N = 500. The flux is 500 mWb.
In many magnetic circuits, the core is not continuous. For example, if an air 
gap is cut into the core, it will increase the reluctance of the magnetic circuit. 
This means that more current is required to establish the same flux as  before 
because an air gap represents a significant opposition to establishing flux. The 
situation is analogous to a series electrical circuit; the total reluctance of the 
magnetic circuit is the sum of the reluctance of the core and the reluctance of  
the air gap. There are various reasons to have an air gap in a core. For example, 
one reason is to prevent core saturation, where an increase in current does not 
lead to an increase in flux.
A widely used core material is composed of a ferrite material. Ferrites are crys-
talline compounds composed of iron oxides and other materials that can be  selected 
for specific desired properties. Hard ferrites are widely used to make permanent 
magnets. Another class of ferrites are called soft ferrites that have properties use-
ful in inductors, high frequency transformers, antennas, and other electronic com-
ponents. (Inductors are discussed in Chapter 13; transformers are discussed in 
Chapter 14.)
The Electromagnet
An electromagnet is based on the properties that you have just learned. A basic elec-
tromagnet is simply a coil of wire wound around a core material that can be easily 
magnetized.
The shape of an electromagnet can be designed for various applications. For exam-
ple, Figure 10–15 shows a U-shaped magnetic core. When the coil of wire is  connected 
to a battery and there is current, as shown in part (a), a magnetic field is established as

indicated. If the current is reversed, as shown in part (b), the direction of the magnetic 
field is also reversed. The closer the north and south poles are brought together, the 
smaller the air gap between them becomes, and the easier it becomes to establish a 
magnetic field because the reluctance is lessened.

The Solenoid
The solenoid is a type of electromagnetic device that has a movable iron core called a 
plunger. The movement of this iron core depends on both an electromagnetic field and 
a mechanical spring force. The basic structure of a solenoid is shown in Figure 10–16. 
It consists of a cylindrical coil of wire wound around a nonmagnetic hollow form. 
A stationary iron core is fixed in position at the end of the shaft and a sliding iron core 
(plunger) is attached to the stationary core with a spring.
The basic solenoid operation is illustrated in Figure 10–17 for the unenergized and 
the energized conditions. In the at-rest (or unenergized) state, the plunger is extended. 
The solenoid is energized by current through the coil, which sets up an electromag-
netic field that magnetizes both iron cores. The south pole of the stationary core at-
tracts the north pole of the movable core causing it to slide inward, thus retracting 
the plunger and compressing the spring. As long as there is coil current, the plunger 
remains retracted by the attractive force of the magnetic fields. When the current is 
cut off, the magnetic fields collapse and the force of the compressed spring pushes the 
plunger back out. The solenoid is used for applications such as opening and closing 
valves and automobile door locks.

The Solenoid Valve In industrial controls, solenoid valves are widely used to control 
the flow of air, water, steam, oils, refrigerants, and other fluids. Solenoid valves are 
used in both pneumatic (air) and hydraulic (oil) systems, common in machine controls. 
Solenoid valves are also common in the aerospace and medical fields. Solenoid valves 
can either move a plunger to open or close a port or can rotate a blocking flap a fixed 
amount.

Electromagnetic Devices  ●  405
A solenoid valve consists of two functional units: a solenoid coil that provides the 
magnetic field to provide the required movement to open or close the valve and a 
valve body, which is isolated from the coil assembly via a leakproof seal and includes 
a pipe and butterfly valve. Figure 10–18 shows a cutaway of one type of solenoid 
valve. When the solenoid is energized, the butterfly valve is turned to open a normally 
closed (NC) valve or to close a normally open (NO) valve.

◀FIGURE 10–18
A basic solenoid valve structure.
Solenoid valves are available with a wide variety of configurations including nor-
mally open or normally closed valves. They are rated for different types of fluids 
(for example, gas or water), pressures, number of pathways, sizes, and more. The 
same valve may control more than one line and may have more than one solenoid 
to move.
The Relay
The relay uses the mechanical motion of a solenoid to open and close electrical 
 contacts. Figure 10–19 shows the basic operation of an armature-type relay with 
one normally open (NO) contact and one normally closed (NC) contact (single pole–
double throw). When there is no coil current, the armature is held against the upper 
contact by the spring, thus providing continuity from terminal 1 to terminal 2, as 
shown in part (a) of the figure. When energized with coil current, the armature is 
pulled down by the attractive force of the electromagnetic field and makes connection 
with the lower contact to provide continuity from terminal 1 to terminal 3, as shown 
in Figure 10–19(b). A typical armature relay is shown in part (c), and the schematic 
symbol is shown in part (d).
Another widely used type of relay is the reed relay, which is shown in Figure 10–20. 
The reed relay, like the armature relay, uses an electromagnetic coil. The contacts are 
thin reeds of magnetic material and are usually located inside the coil. When there is 
no coil current, the reeds are in the open position as shown in part (b). When there 
is current through the coil, the reeds make contact because they are magnetized and 
attract each other as shown in part (c).
Closely related to relays are contactors, which are electrically controlled switches 
that function like a relay but are designed to switch higher currents (15 A or more) to 
a load. With contactors, the load is connected directly to the contacts so the contacts 
need to be designed to minimize problems with arcing. In general, contactors have 
larger contact points than relays are designed to open and close rapidly to minimize 
time for arcs to heat the contacts. In high voltage applications, insulation between 
contacts is used to prevent arcing between contacts. Contactors are found in indus-
trial applications, where the contacts are connected to a load such as a large motor or 
heating element.

406  ●  Magnetism and Electromagnetism
Another type of relay is the reed relay, which is based on the reed switch. Reed 
relays are simple, fast, and highly reliable relays that are basically one or more reed 
switches controlled by an external magnet. The contacts for the reed switch are 
mounted on magnetic reeds that are inside a sealed glass tube. They are opened or 
closed by an external magnetic field, so there is no armature. They generally are rated 
for lower currents than armature relays and are susceptible to shock and vibration 
and can “bounce” when contacts are closed. Applications include pulse counting, 
 position sensors, alarm systems, and overload protection.

The Speaker
A speaker is an electromagnetic device that converts electrical signals into sound. 
Essentially, it is a linear motor that alternately attracts and repels an electromagnet 
to and from a permanent magnet called a donut magnet. Figure 10–21 shows the key 
parts of a speaker. The audio signal is connected using very flexible wires to a cylindri-
cal coil called the voice coil. The voice coil and its movable core form an electromag-
net, which is suspended in an accordion-like structure called the spider. The spider 
acts like an accordion spring, keeping the voice coil in the center and restoring it to the 
rest position when there is no input signal.
Current from the audio input alternates back and forth and powers the electro-
magnet; when there is more current, the attraction or repulsion is greater. When 
the input current reverses direction, the polarity of the electromagnet reverses direc-
tion also, faithfully following the input signal. The voice coil and its moving magnet 
are firmly attached to the cone. The cone is a flexible diaphragm that vibrates to 
 produce sound.

Meter Movement
The d’Arsonval meter movement is the most common type used in analog  multimeters. 
In this type of meter movement, the pointer is deflected in proportion to the amount 
of current through a coil. Figure 10–22 shows a basic d’Arsonval meter movement. 
It consists of a coil of wire wound on a bearing-mounted assembly that is placed

between the poles of a permanent magnet. A pointer is attached to the moving as-
sembly. With no current through the coil, a spring mechanism keeps the pointer at 
its left-most (zero) position. When there is current through the coil, electromagnetic 
forces act on the coil, causing a rotation to the right. The amount of rotation depends 
on the amount of current.
Figure 10–23 illustrates how the interaction of magnetic fields produces rotation 
of the coil assembly. Current is inward at the “cross” and outward at the “dot” in the 
single winding shown. The inward current produces a clockwise electromagnetic field 
that reinforces the permanent magnetic field above it. The result is a downward force 
on the right side of the coil as shown. The outward current produces a counterclock-
wise electromagnetic field that reinforces the permanent magnetic field below it. The 
result is an upward force on the left side of the coil as shown. These forces produce a 
clockwise rotation of the coil assembly and are opposed by a spring mechanism. The 
indicated forces and the spring force are balanced at the value of the current. When 
current is removed, the spring force returns the pointer to its zero position.

Magnetic Disk and Tape Read/Write Head
A simplified and greatly magnified diagram of a magnetic disk or tape surface read/
write operation is shown in Figure 10–24. A data bit (1 or 0) is written on the mag-
netic surface by the magnetization of a tiny segment of the surface as it moves by the 
write head. The direction of the magnetic flux lines is controlled by the direction of 
the current pulse in the winding, as shown in Figure 10–24(a). At the air gap in the 
write head, the magnetic flux takes the lower reluctance path through the magnetic 
surface of the storage device. This magnetizes a tiny spot on the surface in the direc-
tion of the field. A magnetized spot of one polarity represents a binary 1, and one of

the opposite polarity represents a binary 0. Over the years, the size of the magnetized 
spot has decreased dramatically allowing higher storage densities. The bit density is 
determined by the ability of the read/write head to localize the magnetic field. Today, 
hard disk drives with 20 terabytes of storage are available to consumers.
In older read heads, the magnetized spot flies under a read head and induces a 
magnetic flux that follows the low reluctance path through the read head as shown in  
Figure 10–24(b). The direction of the induced current depends on the direction of the 
magnetized spot. Some older read/write heads combined reading and writing in the same 
head but normally the reading and writing functions are done with separate heads.
Modern hard disk read heads use magnetoresistive heads that are more sensi-
tive than the older type that generate a current in a coil. Magnetoresistive read 
heads use a special material that changes its resistance in the presence of a mag-
netic field. The resistance depends on the direction of the field and special sensors 
can  convert the resistance back into the data bits that were written on the media. 
Figure 10–25 shows a magnetoresistive read head used with a hard drive. This type 
of head (called a Giant Magnetoresistive head or GMR) enables much higher data 
densities in the magnetic material. The GMR head uses a device called a spin valve 
whose resistance depends on the relative alignment of the magnetization between 
two internal layers.

Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM)
Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM) is a new technology that stores 
binary states (0 or 1) in a ferromagnetic material integrated with silicon circuitry. 
Because it is magnetic, the data are stored when power is removed, an important 
 advantage. Bits are stored in an array that has a magnetic tunnel junction cell as a 
storage unit. Two magnetic layers are separated by an extremely thin insulating layer 
called a tunnel barrier forming a sandwich called the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), 
as illustrated in Figure 10–26(a). The bottom layer is a fixed permanent magnetic 
layer that is set at the time of manufacture; the top layer is a free magnetic layer. 
The polarity of the magnetic poles in the free layer changes the resistance of the cell 
(high or low resistance), which determines if a 1 or 0 is stored. This resistance does 
not change when power is removed, which means the data are nonvolatile. This is an 
important advantage to this type of memory.
There are currently two technologies for writing the polarity of each magnetic stor-
age cell. In “toggle” MRAM, shown in Figure 10–26(b), writing can be controlled by 
direction of a current at the intersection of perpendicular lines. Both lines must be active 
to write to a given cell, a technology that has roots in old core memory from the 1950s. 

410  ●  Magnetism and Electromagnetism
The magnetic field associated with the write current in each of the two write lines deter-
mines the polarity and hence the resistance of the MTJ. There are limits to bit density 
with this method because one cell’s magnetism can interfere with an adjacent cell if they 
are too close to each other. Toggle MRAMs have been in production since 2003.
A second-generation technology, called spin-torque (ST), uses the spin state of elec-
trons to read or write to the cell and overcomes some of the drawbacks to toggle 
MRAMs. Spin is the property of electrons (or other charge carriers) to behave as tiny 
spinning tops, thus carrying angular momentum. Normal current has a 50–50 mix of 
spin-up or spin-down electrons. In polarized spin current, the majority of change car-
riers have the same spin. The polarized spin current has the ability to flip the magnetic 
state of the cells. This technology allows higher density that toggle MRAM because 
magnetic interference is greatly reduced. A significant research effort is currently on-
going for ST-MRAMs that may eventually become the ideal memory. Currently, a 
number of manufacturers are engaged in research.
To read the stored data in an MRAM cell, a transistor that is part of the cell is 
activated. The resistance of the cell depends on the polarity of the magnetic poles in 
the free layer. If the polarity matches the polarity of the fixed layer, the resistance is 
low; otherwise it is high. There are many advantages to MRAM. In addition to being 
nonvolatile, it is fast, reliable, low-power, and has no wear-out mechanism as there 
are no moving parts.

Magnetic Hysteresis  ●  411
Magnetic Field Intensity (H)
The magnetic field intensity (also called magnetizing force) in a material is defined to 
be the magnetomotive force (Fm) per unit length (l) of the material, as expressed by 
the following equation. The unit of magnetic field intensity (H) is ampere-turns per 
meter (At/m).
H = Fm
l
where Fm = NI. Note that the magnetic field intensity depends on the number of 
turns (N) of the coil of wire, the current (I ) through the coil, and the length (l ) of the 
material. It does not depend on the type of material.
Since f = Fm/ ℛ, as Fm increases, the flux increases. Also, the magnetic field inten-
sity (H) increases. Recall that the flux density (B) is the flux per unit cross-sectional 
area (B = f/A), so B is also proportional to H. The curve showing how these two 
quantities (B and H) are related is called the B-H curve or the hysteresis curve. The 
parameters that influence both B and H are illustrated in Figure 10–27.

and the flux density (B).
The Hysteresis Curve and Retentivity
Hysteresis is a characteristic of a magnetic material whereby a change in magnetization 
lags the application of the magnetic field intensity. The magnetic field  intensity (H) 
can be readily increased or decreased by varying the current through the coil of wire, 
and it can be reversed by reversing the voltage polarity across the coil.
Figure 10–28 illustrates the development of the hysteresis curve. Let’s start by as-
suming a magnetic core is unmagnetized so that B = 0. As the magnetic field in-
tensity (H) is increased from zero, the flux density (B) increases proportionally, as 
indicated by the curve in Figure 10–28(a). When H reaches a certain value, B  begins 
to level off. As H continues to increase, B reaches a saturation value (Bsat) when  
H reaches a value (Hsat), as illustrated in Figure 10–28(b). Once saturation is reached, 
a further increase in H will not increase B.
Now, if H is decreased to zero, B will fall back along a different path to a residual value 
(BR), as shown in Figure 10–28(c). This indicates that the material continues to be mag-
netized even when the magnetic field intensity is zero (H = 0). The ability of a material 
to maintain a magnetized state without magnetic field intensity is called retentivity. 

412  ●  Magnetism and Electromagnetism
The retentivity of a material represents the maximum flux that can be retained after 
the material has been magnetized to saturation and is indicated by the ratio of BR 
to Bsat.
Reversal of the magnetic field intensity is represented by negative values of H on 
the curve and is achieved by reversing the current in the coil of wire. An increase in 
H in the negative direction causes saturation to occur at a value (-Hsat) where the flux 
density is at its maximum negative value, as indicated in Figure 10–28(d).
When the magnetic field intensity is removed (H = 0), the flux density goes to its 
negative residual value (-BR), as shown in Figure 10–28(e). From the -BR value, the 
flux density follows the curve indicated in part (f) back to its maximum positive value 
when the magnetic field intensity equals Hsat in the positive direction.
The complete B@H curve is shown in Figure 10–28(g) and is called the hysteresis 
curve. The magnetic field intensity required to make the flux density zero is called the 
coercive force, HC.
Materials with a low retentivity do not retain a magnetic field very well, while 
those with high retentivities exhibit values of BR very close to the saturation value 
of B. Depending on the application, retentivity in a magnetic material can be an ad-
vantage or a disadvantage. In permanent magnets and magnetic tape, for example, 
high retentivity is required; while in tape recorder read/write heads, low retentivity is 
necessary. In ac motors, retentivity is undesirable because the residual magnetic field 
must be overcome each time the current reverses, thus wasting energy.

Relative Motion
When a straight conductor is moved perpendicular to a magnetic field, there is a rela-
tive motion between the conductor and the magnetic field. Likewise, when a magnetic 
field is moved past a stationary conductor, there is also relative motion. In either case, 
this relative motion results in an induced voltage (vind) in the conductor, as Figure 10–29 
indicates. This principle is known as electromagnetic induction. The lowercase v stands 
for instantaneous voltage. Voltage is only induced when the conductor “cuts” magnetic 
lines as shown. The amount of the induced voltage (vind) depends on the flux density (B), 
the length of the conductor (l ) that is exposed to the magnetic field, and the rate at which 
the conductor and the magnetic field move with respect to each other. The faster the rela-
tive speed, the greater the induced voltage. The equation for induced voltage in a straight 
conductor is
vind = B#lv
where vind is the induced voltage, B# is the portion of the flux density in teslas that is 
perpendicular to the motion, l is the length of the conductor exposed to the magnetic 
field in meters, and v is the relative velocity in meters per second.
Polarity of the Induced Voltage
If the conductor in Figure 10–29 is moved first one way and then another in the mag-
netic field, a reversal of the polarity of the induced voltage will be observed. As the

net is 5.0 cm wide. The flux density is 0.5 T, and the conductor is moved  upward at 
a velocity of 0.8 m/s. What voltage is induced in the conductor?
 
Solution 
Although the conductor is 10 cm, only 5.0 cm (0.05 m) is in the magnetic field 
 because of the size of the pole faces. Therefore,
vind = B#lv = (0.5 T)(0.05 m)(0.8 m/s) = 20 mV

EXAMPLE 10–7
Induced Current
When a load resistor is connected to the conductor in Figure 10–30, the voltage in-
duced by the relative motion in the magnetic field will cause a current in the load, as 
shown in Figure 10–31. This current is called the induced current (iind). The lowercase 
i stands for instantaneous current.

▶FIGURE 10–31
Induced current in a load as the conductor 
moves through the magnetic field.
The action of producing a voltage and a resulting current in a load by moving a 
conductor across a magnetic field is the basis for electrical generators. A single con-
ductor will have a small induced current, so practical generators use coils with many 
turns. This effectively increases the length of the conductor that is exposed to the 
magnetic field. The property of an electrical conductor to produce an emf when there 
is relative motion between the conductor and magnetic field is the basis for induc-
tance in an electric circuit.
Faraday’s law
Michael Faraday discovered the principle of electromagnetic induction in 1831. The 
key idea behind Faraday’s law is that a changing magnetic field can induce a volt-
age in a conductor. Sometimes Faraday’s law is stated as Faraday’s law of induc-
tion. Faraday experimented with coils, and his law is an extension of the principle of 
 electromagnetic induction for straight conductors discussed previously.
Faraday was an English  physicist 
and chemist who is best 
 remembered for his  contribution 
to the understanding of 
 electromagnetism. He discovered 
that electricity could be produced 
by moving a magnet inside a coil 
of wire, and he was able to build 
the first electric motor. He later

Electromagnetic Induction  ●  415
When a conductor is coiled into multiple turns, more conductors can be exposed to 
the magnetic field, increasing the induced voltage. When the magnetic flux is caused to 
change by any means, an induced voltage will result. The change in the magnetic field 
can be caused by relative motion between the magnetic field and the coil. Faraday’s 
observations can be stated as follows:
1. The amount of voltage induced in a coil is directly proportional to the rate of 
change of the magnetic field with respect to the coil (df/dt).
2. The amount of voltage induced in a coil is directly proportional to the number of 
turns of wire in the coil (N).
Faraday’s first observation is demonstrated in Figure 10–32, where a bar magnet 
is moved through a coil, thus creating a changing magnetic field. In part (a) of the fig-
ure, the magnet is moved at a certain rate, and a certain induced voltage is produced 
as indicated. In part (b), the magnet is moved at a faster rate through the coil, creating 
a greater induced voltage.
Faraday’s second observation is demonstrated in Figure 10–33. In part (a), the mag-
net is moved through the coil and a voltage is induced as shown. In part (b), the  magnet 
is moved at the same speed through a coil that has a greater number of turns. The 
greater number of turns creates a greater induced voltage.
As the magnet moves slowly to the right, its magnetic field
is changing with respect to the coil, and a voltage is induced.

416  ●  Magnetism and Electromagnetism
Faraday’s law is stated as follows:
The voltage induced across a coil equals the number of turns in the coil times the rate 
of change of the magnetic flux.
Faraday’s law is expressed in equation form as
vind = N adf
dt b
where vind is the induced voltage, N is the number of turns in the coil, and df/dt is the 
rate of change of the magnetic flux in Wb/s.
Equation 10–8
Apply Faraday’s law to find the induced voltage across a coil with 500 turns that is 
located in a magnetic field that is changing at a rate of 8,000 mWb/s.
 
Solution 
 
vind = N adf
dt b = (500 t)(8,000 mWb/s) = 4.0 V
 
Related Problem 
Find the induced voltage across a 250 turn coil in a magnetic field that is changing 
at 50 mWb/s.
EXAMPLE 10–8
Any relative motion between the magnetic field and the coil will produce the chang-
ing magnetic field that will induce a voltage in the coil. The changing magnetic field 
can even be induced by ac applied to an electromagnet, just as if there were motion. 
This type of changing magnetic field is the basis for transformer action in ac circuits, 
as you will see in Chapter 14.
Lenz’s Law
Faraday’s law states that a changing magnetic field induces a voltage in a coil that 
is directly proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic field and the number 
of turns in the coil. Lenz’s law defines the polarity or direction of the induced 
voltage.
When the current through a coil changes, an induced voltage is created as a result of 
the changing electromagnetic field and the polarity of the induced voltage is such that 
it always opposes the change in current.
An Application of Electromagnetic Induction
In automobiles, it is necessary to know the position of the crankshaft to control 
ignition timing and sometimes to adjust the fuel mixture. As mentioned previ-
ously, a Hall-effect sensor is one method to determine the position of the crank-
shaft (or camshaft). Another widely used method is to detect a change in the 
magnetic field as a metallic tab moves though the air gap in a magnetic assembly. 
A basic concept is shown in Figure 10–34. A steel disk with protruding tabs is 
connected to the end of the crankshaft. As the crankshaft turns, the tabs move 
through the magnetic field. Steel has a much lower reluctance than does air, so 
the magnetic flux increases when a tab is in the air gap. This change in the mag-
netic flux causes an induced voltage to appear across the coil, indicating the posi-
tion of the crankshaft.
Lenz was born in Estonia (then 
Russia) and became a professor at 
the University of St. Petersburg.  
He carried out many experiments  
following Faraday’s lead and 
 formulated the principle of 
electromagnetism, which defines 
the  polarity of induced voltage 
in a coil. The statement of this 
 principle is named in his honor.

Forces on a Current-Carrying Conductor in a Magnetic  
Field (Motor Action)
When two bar magnets are placed next to each other so that the north and south poles 
of one are next to like poles of the other, the flux from the adjacent magnets will have 
the same polarity (i.e., point in the same direction) and the magnets will repel. If the 
magnets are placed next to each other so that the north and south poles of one magnet 
are next to the opposite poles of the other, the flux from the adjacent magnets will 
have opposite polarity (i.e., point in different directions) and the magnets will attract. 
In a motor, when current flows through the conductor, it creates a circular field whose 
polarity is determined by right-hand rule, as shown in Figure 10–35(a) and (b).

fied the apparently diverse fields of 
electricity, light, and magnetism in 
series of four equations. Essentially 
his equations laid the foundation 
for 20th-century physics, including 
special relativity and quantum  
mechanics. His equations started 
with the work of Faraday and 
Gauss, but he went further 
and was able to show that light 
consisted of oscillating electric 
and magnetic fields. This work 
is considered to be the greatest 
accomplishments of 19th-century 
physics.

In Figure 10–35(a) the current through the conductor is out of the page and creates

Conversely, the polarity of the flux below the conductor is the same as the polarity

of the flux above the conductor is the same as that of the fixed magnetic field, so 
that the force between them repels the conductor. Conversely, the polarity of the flux 
below the conductor is opposite to that of the fixed magnetic field, so that the force 
between them attracts the conductor. In both cases, the force exerted on the conduc-
tor is downward.
The force on a current carrying conductor is given by the equation
F = BIlsinu
where F is the force in newtons, B is the magnetic flux density in teslas, I is the 
current in amperes, l is the length of the conductor exposed to the magnetic field 
in  meters, and u is the angle between the conductor and the field. When the angle 
between the conductor and the field is 90°, sin u = 1 and the equation simplifies to 
F = BIl. (This is the case for the conductor in Figure 10–35, with the current in and 
out of the page.)
Equation 10–9
Assume a magnetic pole face is a square that is 3.0 cm on a side. Find the force on 
a conductor that has a current of 2 A if the conductor is perpendicular to the field 
and the flux density is 0.35 T.
 
Solution 
Because the conductor is perpendicular to the field, sin u = 1 and F = BIl. The 
length of conductor exposed to the magnetic flux is 3.0 cm (0.030 m). Therefore,
F = BIl = (0.35 T)(2.0 A)(0.03 m) = 0.21 N
 
Related Problem 
What is the direction of the force if the field is directed up (along the y axis) and the 
current is directed inward (along the z axis)?
EXAMPLE 10–9
Although the force in Example 10–9 is relatively small, it can be multiplied many 
times by simply coiling the conductor and exposing a much longer length of the con-
ductor to the magnetic field.

◀FIGURE 10–36
A simplified dc generator.
Figure 10–36 shows a simplified dc generator consisting of a single loop of wire in 
a permanent magnetic field. Notice that each end of the wire loop is connected to a 
split-ring arrangement. This conductive metal ring is called a commutator. As the wire 
loop rotates in the magnetic field, the split commutator ring also rotates. Each half 
of the split ring rubs against the fixed contacts, called brushes, and connects the wire 
loop to an external circuit.
As the wire loop rotates through the magnetic field, it cuts through the flux lines 
at varying angles, as illustrated in Figure 10–37. At position A in its rotation, the 
loop of wire is effectively moving parallel with the magnetic field. Therefore, at this 
instant, the rate at which it is cutting through the magnetic flux lines is zero. As the 
loop moves from position A to position B, it cuts through the flux lines at an increas-
ing rate. At position B, it is moving effectively perpendicular to the magnetic field and 
thus is cutting through a maximum number of lines per unit time. As the loop rotates 
from position B to position C, the rate at which it cuts the flux lines decreases to 
minimum (zero) at C. From position C to position D, the rate at which the loop cuts 
the flux lines increases to a maximum at D and then back to a minimum again at A.

As you have learned, when a wire moves through a magnetic field, a voltage is 
induced, and by Faraday’s law, the amount of induced voltage is proportional to the 
number of loops (turns) in the wire and the rate at which it is moving with respect to 
the magnetic field. The angle at which the wire moves with respect to the magnetic 
flux lines determines the amount of induced voltage because the rate at which the wire 
cuts through the flux lines depends on the angle of motion.

▲FIGURE 10–38
Operation of a basic dc generator.
Figure 10–38 illustrates how a voltage is induced in the external circuit as the 
single loop rotates in the magnetic field. Assume that the loop is in its instantaneous 
horizontal position, so the induced voltage is zero. As the loop continues in its rota-
tion, the  induced voltage builds up to a maximum at position B, as shown in part (a) 
of the figure. Then, as the loop continues from B to C, the voltage decreases to zero 
at position C, as shown in part (b).
During the second half of the revolution, shown in Figure 10–38(c) and (d), the 
brushes switch to opposite commutator sections, so the polarity of the voltage remains 
the same across the output. Thus, as the loop rotates from position C to position D 
and then back to position A, the voltage increases from zero at C to a maximum at D 
and back to zero at A.

A simplified rotor core. The coils are

In practical generators, multiple coils are pressed into slots in a ferromagnetic-core 
assembly. The entire assembly, called the rotor, is connected to bearings and rotates 
in the magnetic field. Figure 10–40 is a diagram of the rotor core with no wire loops 
(coils) shown. The commutator is divided into segments, with each pair of segments 
connected to the end of a coil. With more coils, the voltages from several coils are 
combined because the brushes can contact more than one of the commutator seg-
ments at once. The loops do not reach maximum voltage at the same time, so the 
pulsating output voltage is much smoother than is the case with only one coil or loop 
shown previously. The variations can be further smoothed by filters to produce a 
nearly constant dc output. (Filters are discussed in Chapter 18.)
Figure 10–39 shows how the induced voltage varies as the wire loop in the dc gen-
erator goes through several rotations (three in this case). This voltage is a dc voltage 
because its polarities do not change. However, the voltage is pulsating between zero 
and its maximum value.
Instead of permanent magnets, most generators use electromagnets to provide the 
required magnetic field. One advantage to this is that flux density can be controlled, 
thus controlling the output voltage of the generator. The windings for the electromag-
nets, called field windings, require current to produce the magnetic field.
The current for the field windings can be provided from a separate voltage source, 
but this is a disadvantage. A better method is to use the generator itself to provide the 
current for the electromagnets; this is called a self-excited generator. The generator 
starts because there is normally enough residual magnetism in the field magnets due 
to hysteresis that causes a small initial field and allows the generator to start produc-
ing a voltage. In cases where a generator has not been used for a long time, it may be 
necessary to provide an external source to the field windings to start it.
The stationary part of a generator (or motor) includes all of the nonmoving parts 
and is called the stator. Figure 10–41 illustrates a simplified two-pole dc generator

showing the magnetic paths (end caps, bearings, and commutator are not shown). 
Notice that the frame is part of the magnetic path for the field magnets. To make a 
generator have high efficiency, the air gap is kept as small as possible. The armature 
is the power-producing component and can be either on the rotor or the stator. In 
the dc generator described previously, the armature is the rotor because power is pro-
duced in the moving conductors and taken from the rotor via the commutator.
Equivalent Circuit for a DC Generator
A self-excited generator can be represented by a basic dc circuit with a coil to  produce 
the magnetic field and a mechanically driven generator, as shown in Figure 10–42. 
There are other configurations of dc generators, but this represents a common one. In 
the case shown, the field windings are in parallel with the source; this configuration 
is called a shunt-wound generator. The resistance of the field windings is shown as RF. 
For the equivalent circuit, this resistance is shown in series with the field windings. 
The armature is driven by a mechanical input, causing it to spin; it looks like a  voltage 
source of VG. The armature resistance is shown as the series resistance, RA. The rheo-
stat, RREG, is in series with the field winding resistance and regulates the output 
 voltage by controlling the current to the field windings and thus the flux density.

When a load is connected to the output, current in the armature is shared between

as the ratio of the power delivered to the load (PL) to the total power (PT), which 
 includes the losses in the armature and the resistance in the field circuit.

MHD Generator A magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generator causes a voltage to be 
generated from a conducting fluid (it can be a very hot ionized gas, plasma, liquid 
metal, or salt water). The gas is hot enough to ionize the atoms in the gas, which means 
the gas becomes a good electrical conductor. The concept is illustrated in Figure 10–43. 
The hot gas is passed through a transverse field of a very strong electromagnet (of sev-
eral tesla strength). This generates dc at the output, which is taken from electrodes that 
are perpendicular to the magnetic field as illustrated. To date, the process has not been 
cost effective for adoption in large-scale power generation; however, there are applica-
tions for MHD phenomena in flow control and metal processing. There is considerable 
interest in government, academia, and research labs in developing cost-effective MHD 
generators because they have the potential to be very efficient with reduced pollution 
and with no moving parts they should have high reliability.

Basic Operation
As in the case of generators, motor action is the result of the interaction of mag-
netic fields. In a dc motor, the rotor field interacts with the magnetic field of the 
stator. The rotor in all dc motors contains the armature winding, which sets up a 
magnetic field. The rotor moves because of the attractive force between opposite 
poles and the repulsive force between like poles, as illustrated in the simplified dia-
gram of Figure 10–44. The rotor moves because of the attraction of its north pole 
with the south pole of the stator (and vice versa). As the two poles near each other, 
the polarity of the rotor current is suddenly switched by the commutator, reversing 
the magnetic poles of the rotor. The commutator serves as a mechanical switch to 
reverse the current in the armature just as the unlike poles are near each other, con-
tinuing the rotation of the rotor.

Brushless DC Motors
Many dc motors do not use a commutator to reverse the polarity of the current. 
Instead of supplying current to a moving armature, the magnetic field is rotated in 
the stator windings using an electronic controller. The direction of current in the 
field coils is periodically reversed by the controller by producing an ac waveform 
(or modified ac waveform) from the dc input. This causes the stator field to rotate, 
and the permanent magnet rotor moves in the same direction to keep up with the 
rotating field. A common way to sense the position of the rotating magnet is to 
use a Hall-effect sensor, which provides the controller with position information. 
Brushless motors have higher reliability than traditional brushed motors because 
they do not need to have periodic brush replacement, but have the added complex-
ity of the electronic controller. Figure 10–45 shows a cutaway view of a brushless 
dc motor.
Back EMF
When a dc motor is first started, a magnetic field is present from the field windings. 
Armature current develops another magnetic field that interacts with the one from 

The DC Motor  ●  425
the field windings and starts the motor turning. The armature windings are now 
spinning in the presence of the magnetic field, so generator action occurs. In effect, 
the spinning armature has a voltage developed across it that opposes the original 
applied voltage in accordance with Lenz’s law. This self-generated voltage is called 
back emf (electromotive force). The term emf was once common for voltage but is 
not favored because voltage is not a “force” in the physics sense, but back emf still 
refers to the self-generated voltage in motors. Back emf, also called counter emf, 
serves to significantly reduce the armature current when the motor is turning at 
constant speed.
Motor Ratings
Some motors are rated by the torque they can provide, others are rated by the power 
they produce. Torque and power are important parameters for any motor. Although 
torque and power are different physical parameters, if one is known, the other can be 
obtained.
Torque tends to rotate an object. In a dc motor, the torque is proportional to the 
amount of flux and to the armature current. Torque, T, in a dc motor can be calcu-
lated from the equation

from torque, you must know the speed of the motor in rpm for the torque that 
you measured. The equation to determine the power, given the torque at a certain

The Series DC Motor
The series dc motor has the field coil windings and the armature coil windings in series. 
A schematic of this arrangement is shown in Figure 10–46(a). The internal resistance 
is generally small and consists of field coil resistance, armature winding resistance, and 
brush resistance. As in the case of generators, dc motors may also contain an interpole 
winding, as shown, and current limiting for speed control. The interpole winding is 
an auxiliary winding to overcome the effects of the armature reactance. In a series dc 
motor, the armature current, field current, and line current are all the same.
What is the power developed by a motor that turns at 350 rpm when the torque is 
3.6 N-m?
 
Solution 
Substitute into Equation 10–11.
P = 0.105Ts = 0.105(3.6 N@m)(350 rpm) = 132 W
 
Related Problem 
Determine the power produced by a motor if T = 5 N@m and s = 1,000 rpm.
EXAMPLE 10–10
As you know, magnetic flux is proportional to the current in a coil. The magnetic 
flux created by the field windings is proportional to armature current because of the 
series connection. Thus, when the motor is started, there is no back emf and the high 
starting current implies high magnetic flux. Recall that Equation 10–10 showed that 
the torque in a dc motor is proportional to both the armature current and the mag-
netic flux. Thus, the series-wound motor will have a very high starting torque when 
the current is high because flux and armature current are high. For this reason, series 
dc motors are used when high starting torques are required (such as a starter motor 
in a car).
The plot of the torque and motor speed for a series dc motor is shown in  
Figure 10–46(b). The starting torque is at its maximum value. At low speeds, the 
torque is still very high, but drops off dramatically as the speed increases. As you can 
see, the speed can be very high if the torque is low; for this reason, the series-wound 
dc motor always is operated with a load.
The Shunt DC Motor
A shunt dc motor has the field coil in parallel with the armature, as shown in the 
equivalent circuit in Figure 10–47(a). In the shunt motor, the field coil is supplied by a

One characteristic of dc motors 
is that if they are allowed to run 
without a load, the torque can 
cause the motor to “run away” 
to a speed beyond the manufac-
turer’s rating. Therefore, dc motors 
should always be operated with a 
load to prevent self-destruction.

Application Activity  ●  427
Application Activity
The relay is a common type of 
electromagnetic device that is 
used in many types of control applications. With a relay, a 
lower voltage, such as from a battery, can be used to switch 
a much higher voltage, such as the 120 V from an ac outlet. 
You will see how a relay can be used in a basic security 
alarm system.
The schematic in Figure 10–48 shows a simplified intru-
sion alarm system that uses a relay to turn on an audible 
alarm (siren) and lights. The system operates from a 9 V 
battery so that even if power to the house is off, the audible 
alarm will still work.
The detection switches are normally open (NO) mag-
netic switches that are parallel connected and located in the 
windows and doors. The relay is a triple-pole–double-throw 
device that operates with a coil voltage of 9 V dc and draws 
approximately 50 mA. When an intrusion occurs, one of 
the switches closes and allows current from the battery to 
the relay coil, which energizes the relay and causes the three 
sets of normally open contacts to close. Closure of contact 
constant voltage source, so the magnetic field set up by the field coils is constant. The 
armature resistance and the back emf produced by generator action in the armature 
determine the armature current.
The torque-speed characteristic for a shunt dc motor is quite different than for 
a series dc motor. When a load is applied, the shunt motor will slow down, causing 
the back emf to be reduced and the armature current to increase. The increase in 
armature current tends to compensate for the added load by increasing the torque 
of the motor. Although the motor has slowed because of the additional load, the 
torque-speed characteristic is nearly a straight line for the shunt dc motor as shown 
in Figure 10–47(b). At full load, the shunt dc motor still has high torque.

SUMMARY
◆
●Unlike magnetic poles attract each other, and like poles repel each other.
◆
●Materials that can be magnetized are called ferromagnetic.
◆
●When there is current through a conductor, it produces an electromagnetic field around the 
conductor.
◆
●You can use the right-hand rule to establish the direction of the electromagnetic lines of force 
around a conductor.
◆
●An electromagnet is basically a coil of wire around a magnetic core.
◆
●When a conductor moves within a magnetic field, or when a magnetic field moves relative to 
a conductor, a voltage is induced across the conductor.
◆
●The faster the relative motion between a conductor and a magnetic field, the greater the 
induced voltage.
◆
●Table 10–3 summarizes the quantities and units used in this chapter.
◆
●Hall-effect sensors use current to sense the presence of a magnetic field.
◆
●DC generators convert mechanical power to dc electrical power.

430  ●  Magnetism and Electromagnetism
◆
●The moving part of a generator or motor is called the rotor; the stationary part is called the 
stator.
◆
●DC motors convert electrical power to mechanical power.
◆
●Brushless dc motors use a permanent magnet as the rotor, and the stator is the armature.

INTRODUCTION
In the preceding chapters, you have studied resistive circuits 
with dc currents and voltages. This chapter provides an intro-
duction to ac circuit analysis in which time-varying electrical 
signals, particularly the sine wave, are studied. An electrical 
signal is a voltage or current that changes in some consistent 
manner with time.
An alternating voltage is one that changes polarity at a 
certain rate, and an alternating current is one that changes 
direction at a certain rate. The sinusoidal waveform (sine 
wave) is the most common and fundamental type because 
all other types of repetitive waveforms can be broken down 
into composite sine waves. The sine wave is a periodic wave-
form which means that it repeats at fixed intervals. The use 
of phasors to represent sine waves is discussed.
Special emphasis is given to the sinusoidal waveform 
(sine wave) because of its fundamental importance in ac cir-
cuit analysis. Alternators, which generate sine waves, and ac 
motors are introduced. Other types of repetitive waveforms 
are also introduced, including pulse, triangular, and saw-
tooth. The use of the oscilloscope for displaying and measur-
ing waveforms is introduced.

438  ●  Introduction to Alternating Current and Voltage
Sinusoidal voltages are produced by two types of sources: rotating electrical 
 machines (ac generators) or electronic oscillator circuits, which are used in instru-
ments commonly known as electronic signal generators. Figure 11–1 shows the sym-
bol used to represent either source of sinusoidal voltage. AC generators are covered in 
Section 11–7, and electronic signal generators and function generators are discussed 
at the end of this section.
Figure 11–2 is a graph showing the general shape of a sine wave, which is generally 
either an alternating current or an alternating voltage. Voltage (or current) is displayed 
on the vertical axis and time (t) is displayed on the horizontal axis. Notice how the volt-
age (or current) varies with time. Starting at zero, the voltage (or current)  increases to 
a positive maximum (peak), returns to zero, and then increases to a negative maximum 
(peak) before returning again to zero, thus completing one full cycle. The complete 
wave consists of two alternations. (An alternation is defined as the portion of the cycle 
between zero crossings during which the signal polarity does not change.)
11–1 
the sinusoidal waveforM
The sinusoidal waveform or sine wave is based on the mathematical sine function 
from trigonometry but in electrical work it is defined as an alternating current (ac) 
or alternating voltage. It is also referred to as a sinusoidal wave or, simply, sinu-
soid. The electrical service provided by the power company is in the form of sinu-
soidal voltage and current. In addition, other types of repetitive waveforms are 
composites of many integer multiples of a fundamental sine wave. In this section, 
we will focus on the sine wave itself.
After completing this section, you should be able to

▶FIGURE 11–2
Graph of one cycle of a sine wave.
Polarity of a Sine Wave
As mentioned, a sine wave changes polarity at its zero value; that is, it alternates between 
positive and negative values. When a sinusoidal voltage source (Vs) is applied to a resis-
tive circuit, as in Figure 11–3, an alternating sinusoidal current results. When the voltage 
changes polarity, the current correspondingly changes direction as indicated.

The Sinusoidal Waveform  ●  439
During the positive alternation of the applied voltage Vs, the current is in the direc-
tion shown in Figure 11–3(a). During a negative alternation of the applied voltage, 
the current is in the opposite direction, as shown in Figure 11–3(b). The combined 
positive and negative alternations make up one cycle of a sine wave.
Period of a Sine Wave
A sine wave varies with time (t) in a definable manner.
The time required for a sine wave to complete one full cycle is called the period (T).
Figure 11–4(a) illustrates the period of a sine wave. Typically, a sine wave continues 
to repeat itself in identical cycles, as shown in Figure 11–4(b). Since all cycles of a

Solution 
Method 1:  The period can be measured from one zero crossing to the corresponding 
zero crossing in the next cycle (the slope must be the same at the corre-
sponding zero crossings).
Method 2:  The period can be measured from the positive peak in one cycle to the 
positive peak in the next cycle.
Method 3:  The period can be measured from the negative peak in one cycle to the 
negative peak in the next cycle.
These measurements are indicated in Figure 11–7, where two cycles of the sine 
wave are shown. Keep in mind that you obtain the same value for the period no 
matter which corresponding points on the waveform you use.

The Sinusoidal Waveform  ●  441
Frequency of a Sine Wave
Frequency ( f ) is the number of cycles that a sine wave completes in one second.
The more cycles completed in one second, the higher the frequency. Frequency ( f ) 
is measured in units of hertz. One hertz (Hz) is equivalent to one cycle per second; 
60 Hz is 60 cycles per second, for example. Figure 11–8 shows two sine waves. The sine 
wave in part (a) completes two full cycles in one second. The one in part (b) completes 
four cycles in one second. Therefore, the sine wave in part (b) has twice the frequency 
of the one in part (a).

Hertz, a German physicist, was

electromagnetic (radio) waves. He 
produced electromagnetic waves in 
the laboratory and measured their 
parameters. Hertz also proved that 
the nature of the reflection and 
refraction of electromagnetic waves 
was the same as that of light. The 
unit of frequency (hertz) is named 
in his honor. It replaced the older 
cycle per second (cps) in 1960. The 
older unit was more descriptive of

sense because a sine wave with a longer period goes through fewer cycles in one  second 
than one with a shorter period.

Electronic Signal Generators
A signal generator is an instrument that electronically produces sine waves for use 
in testing or controlling electronic circuits and systems. All signal generators consist 
basically of an oscillator, which is an electronic circuit that produces repetitive waves. 
There are a variety of signal generators, ranging from special-purpose instruments 
that produce only one type of waveform in a limited frequency range, to programma-
ble instruments that produce a wide range of frequencies and a variety of waveforms. 
All generators have controls for adjusting the amplitude and frequency.
Function Generators and Arbitrary Function Generators A function generator is a 
type of signal generator that produces more than one type of waveform. Typically, a 
conventional function generator can generate sine, square, and triangle waveforms as 
well as pulses. An arbitrary function generator has many more waveforms and added 
capabilities available than conventional function generators. These include multiple 
outputs and various output modes such as repetitive, burst, or the ability to simulate 
certain common signals. The Tektronix AFG1022 Arbitrary Function Generator is 
shown in Figure 11–10(a). This generator has dual channel outputs and has 50 built-in 
 
Solution 
The sine wave in Figure 11–9(b) has the higher frequency because it completes more 
cycles in 1 s than does the sine wave in part (a).
In Figure 11–9(a), three cycles are completed in 1 s; therefore,
f = 3 Hz
One cycle takes 0.333 s (one-third second), so the period is
T = 0.333 s = 333 ms
In Figure 11–9(b), five cycles are completed in 1 s; therefore,
f = 5 Hz
One cycle takes 0.2 s (one-fifth second), so the period is
T = 0.2 s = 200 ms

waveforms available with a wide range of frequencies that can be selected. A genera-
tor like this allows the user to simulate various conditions for test.
Arbitrary Waveform Generators An arbitrary waveform generator has even more 
 capability than an arbitrary function generator. In addition to all of the standard 
 outputs, an arbitrary waveform generator can synchronize multiple independent chan-
nels. This capability is useful in testing complex systems. The output can be defined 
by a mathematical function, a graphical input from the user, or can be a waveform 
captured and stored in a digital oscilloscope. The Tektronix AWG5200, shown in  
Figure 11–10(b), is an example of a multiple channel arbitrary waveform generator.

sinusoidal voltage and current values
Five ways to express the value of a sine wave in terms of its voltage or its current 
magnitude are instantaneous, peak, peak-to-peak, rms, and average values.

444  ●  Introduction to Alternating Current and Voltage
Instantaneous Value
Figure 11–11 illustrates that at any point in time on a sine wave, the voltage (or cur-
rent) has an instantaneous value. This instantaneous value is different at different 
points along the curve. Instantaneous values are positive during the positive alterna-
tion and negative during the negative alternation. Instantaneous values of voltage and 
current are symbolized by lowercase v and i, respectively. The curve in part (a) shows 
voltage only, but it applies equally for current when the v’s are replaced with i’s. An 
example of instantaneous values is shown in part (b) where the instantaneous voltage 
is 3.1 V at 1 ms, 7.07 V at 2.5 ms, 10 V at 5 ms, 0 V at 10 ms, -3.1 V at 11 ms, and so on.
Peak Value
The peak value of a sine wave is the value of voltage (or current) at the positive or the 
negative maximum (peak) with respect to zero. Since the positive and negative peak 
values are equal in magnitude, a sine wave is characterized by a single peak value. This 
is illustrated in Figure 11–12. For a given sine wave, the peak value is constant and is 
represented by Vp or Ip. The peak value is also called the amplitude. The amplitude 
is measured from the mean or average value for a sine wave (in this case 0 V).

resented by Vpp or Ipp.
 
Vpp = 2Vp 
Equation 11–3
 
Ipp = 2Ip 
Equation 11–4
RMS Value
The term rms stands for root mean square. Most ac voltmeters display rms voltage. 
The 120 V at your wall outlet is an rms value. The rms value, also referred to as the 
effective value, of a sinusoidal voltage is actually a measure of the heating effect of 
the sine wave. For example, when a resistor is connected across an ac (sinusoidal) volt-
age source, as shown in Figure 11–14(a), a certain amount of heat is generated by the 
power in the resistor. Figure 11–14(b) shows the same resistor connected across a dc 
voltage source. The value of the dc voltage can be adjusted so that the resistor gives off 
the same amount of heat as it does when connected to the ac source.
The rms value of a sinusoidal voltage is equal to the dc voltage that produces the same 
amount of heat in a resistance as does the sinusoidal voltage.

When the same amount of heat is produced in both setups, the sinusoidal voltage has an rms value

The peak value of a sine wave can be converted to the corresponding rms value 
using the following relationships, derived in Appendix B, for either voltage or current:
 
Vrms = 0.707Vp 
Equation 11–5
 
 Irms = 0.707Ip 
Equation 11–6
Using these formulas, you can also determine the peak value if you know the rms 
value.
Vp = Vrms

Vp = 1.414Vrms

Ip = 1.414Irms

and
 
Ipp = 2.828Irms

446  ●  Introduction to Alternating Current and Voltage
Average Value
The average value of a sine wave taken over one complete cycle is always zero because 
the positive values (above the zero crossing) offset the negative values (below the zero 
crossing).
To be useful for certain purposes such as measuring types of voltages found in power 
supplies, the average value of a sine wave is defined over a half-cycle rather than over 
a full cycle. The average value is the total area under the half-cycle curve divided by 
the distance in radians of the curve along the horizontal axis. The result is derived in 
Appendix B and is expressed in terms of the peak value as follows for both voltage and 
current sine waves:
Vavg = a 2
pbVp
Equation 11–11 
Vavg = 0.637Vp
Iavg = a 2

Iavg = 0.637Ip
Determine Vp, Vpp, Vrms, and the half-cycle Vavg for the sine wave in Figure 11–15.
EXAMPLE 11–6
 
Solution 
Vp = 4.5 V is read directly from the graph. From this, calculate the other values.
Vpp = 2Vp = 2(4.5 V) = 9 V
 Vrms = 0.707Vp = 0.707(4.5 V) = 3.18 V
 Vavg = 0.637Vp = 0.637(4.5 V) = 2.86 V

Angular Measurement of a Sine Wave  ●  447
A sinusoidal voltage can be produced by an alternator, which is an ac genera-
tor. There is a direct relationship between the rotation of the rotor in an alternator 
and the sine wave output. Thus, the angular measurement of the rotor’s position is 
 directly related to the angle assigned to the sine wave.
Angular Measurement
A degree is an angular measurement corresponding to 1/360 of a circle or a complete 
revolution. A radian is the angular measurement along the circumference of a circle 
that is equal to the radius of the circle. One radian (rad) is equivalent to 57.3°, as 
 illustrated in Figure 11–16. In a 360° revolution, there are 2p radians.
The Greek letter P (pi) represents the ratio of the circumference of any circle to its 
diameter and has a constant value of approximately 3.1416.
Scientific calculators have a p function so that the actual numerical value does not 
have to be entered.
Table 11–1 lists several values of degrees and the corresponding radian values. 
These angular measurements are illustrated in Figure 11–17.
11–3 
angular MeasureMent of a sine wave
As you have seen, sine waves can be measured along the horizontal axis on a time 
basis; however, since the time for completion of one full cycle or any portion of a 
cycle is frequency-dependent, it is often useful to specify points on the sine wave in 
terms of an angular measurement expressed in degrees or radians.

Phase of a Sine Wave
The phase of a sine wave is an angular measurement that specifies the position of that 
sine wave relative to a reference. Figure 11–19 shows one cycle of a sine wave to be 
used as the reference. Note that the first positive-going crossing of the horizontal axis 
(zero crossing) is at 0° (0 rad), and the positive peak is at 90° (p/2 rad). The negative-
going zero crossing is at 180° (p rad), and the negative peak is at 270° (3p/2 rad). The 
cycle is completed at 360° (2p rad). When the sine wave is shifted left or right with 
respect to this reference, there is a phase shift.

Figure 11–20 illustrates phase shifts of a sine wave. In part (a), sine wave B is 
shifted to the right by 90° (p/2 rad) with respect to sine wave A. Thus, there is a phase 
angle of 90° between sine wave A and sine wave B. In terms of time, the positive 
peak of sine wave B occurs later than the positive peak of sine wave A because time 
increases to the right along the horizontal axis. In this case, sine wave B is said to lag 
sine wave A by 90° or p/2 radians. Stated another way, sine wave A leads sine wave B 
by 90°.

In Figure 11–20(b), sine wave B is shown shifted left by 90° with respect to sine

wave B. In this case, the positive peak of sine wave B occurs earlier in time than that 
of sine wave A; therefore, sine wave B is said to lead sine wave A by 90°.

450  ●  Introduction to Alternating Current and Voltage
What are the phase angles between the two sine waves in parts (a) and (b) of 
Figure 11–21?
EXAMPLE 11–8
 
Solution 
In Figure 11–21(a) the zero crossing of sine wave A is at 0°, and the corresponding 
zero crossing of sine wave B is at 45°. There is a 45° phase angle between the two 
waveforms with sine wave B lagging sine wave A.
In Figure 11–21(b) the zero crossing of sine wave B is at -30°, and the corre-
sponding zero crossing of sine wave A is at 0°. There is a 30° phase angle between 
the two waveforms with sine wave B leading sine wave A.
 
Related Problem 
If the positive-going zero crossing of one sine wave is at 15° and that of the 
 second sine wave is at 23°, what is the phase angle between them?
As a practical matter, when you measure the phase shift between two waveforms 
on an oscilloscope, you should make them appear to have the same amplitude. This 
is done by taking one of the oscilloscope channels out of vertical calibration and 
 adjusting the corresponding waveform until its apparent amplitude equals that of the 
other waveform. This procedure eliminates the error caused if both waveforms are 
not measured at their exact center.
Polyphase Power
One important application of phase-shifted sine waves is in electrical power systems. 
Electrical utilities generate ac with three phases that are separated by 120°, as shown in 
Figure 11–22. The reference is called neutral. Normally, three-phase power is delivered 
to the user with four lines (three hot lines and neutral). There are important advantages 
to three-phase power for ac motors. Three-phase motors are more efficient and simpler 
than an equivalent single-phase motor. Motors are discussed further in Section 11–8.

residential and small commercial buildings; it consists of two 120 V hot lines that 
are 180° out of phase with each other and a neutral, which is grounded at the service

axis; angular values run along the horizontal axis. The variable y is an instantaneous 
value that represents either voltage or current at a given angle, u. The symbol u is the 
Greek letter theta.
All electrical sine waves follow a specific mathematical formula. The general 
 expression for the sine wave curve in Figure 11–24 is
 
y = A sin u
Equation 11–15
This formula states that any point on the sine wave, represented by an instantaneous 
value (y), is equal to the maximum value A times the sine (sin) of the angle u at that 
point. For example, a certain voltage sine wave has a peak value of 10 V. You can 
calculate the instantaneous voltage at a point 60° along the horizontal axis as follows, 
where y = v and A = Vp:
v = Vpsin u = (10 V)sin 60° = (10 V)(0.866) = 8.66 V
Figure 11–25 shows this particular instantaneous value of the curve. You can find the 
sine of any angle on most calculators by first entering the value of the angle and then 
pressing the SIN key. Verify that your calculator is in the degree mode.

Expressions for Phase-Shifted Sine Waves
When a sine wave is shifted to the right of the reference (lagging) by a certain angle, f 
(Greek letter phi), as illustrated in Figure 11–26(a) where the reference is the vertical 
axis, the general expression is
 
y = A sin (u - f)
Equation 11–16
where y represents instantaneous voltage or current, and A represents the peak value 
(amplitude). When a sine wave is shifted to the left of the reference (leading) by a cer-
tain angle, f, as shown in Figure 11–26(b), the general expression is
 
y = A sin (u + f)

Determine the instantaneous value at the 90° reference point on the horizontal 
axis for each voltage sine wave in Figure 11–27.
EXAMPLE 11–9
 
Solution 
Sine wave A is the reference. Sine wave B is shifted left by 20° with respect to A,  
so it leads. Sine wave C is shifted right by 45° with respect to A, so it lags.
vA = Vpsin u
= (10 V)sin(90°) = (10 V)(1) = 10 V
 vB = Vpsin(u + fB)
= (5 V)sin(90° + 20°) = (5 V)sin(110°) = (5 V)(0.9397) = 4.70 V
vC = Vpsin(u - fC)
= (8 V)sin(90° - 45°) = (8 V)sin(45°) = (8 V)(0.7071) = 5.66 V

Phasors provide a graphic means for representing quantities that have both mag-
nitude and direction (angular position). Phasors are especially useful for repre-
senting sine waves in terms of their magnitude and phase angle and also for the

You may already be familiar with vectors. In math and science, a vector is any 
quantity with both magnitude and direction. Examples of vector quantities are force, 
velocity, and acceleration. The simplest way to describe a vector is to assign a magni-
tude and an angle to a quantity.
In electronics, a phasor is a rotating vector. Examples of phasors are shown in 
Figure 11–28. The length of the phasor “arrow” represents the magnitude of a quantity. 
The angle, u (relative to 0°), represents the angular position, as shown in part (a) for a 
positive angle. The specific phasor example in part (b) has a magnitude of 2 and a phase 
angle of 45°. The phasor in part (c) has a magnitude of 3 and a phase angle of 180°. The 
phasor in part (d) has a magnitude of 1 and a phase angle of -45° (or +315°). Notice 
that positive angles are measured counterclockwise (CCW) from the reference (0°) and 
negative angles are measured clockwise (CW) from the reference.

Phasor Representation of a Sine Wave
A full cycle of a sine wave can be represented by rotation of a phasor through 360 degrees.
The instantaneous value of the sine wave at any point is equal to the vertical distance 
from the tip of the phasor to the horizontal axis.
Figure 11–29 shows how the phasor traces out the sine wave as it goes from 0° to 360°. 
You can relate this concept to the rotation in an ac generator. Notice that the length 
of the phasor is equal to the peak value of the sine wave (observe the 90° and the 270° 
points). The angle of the phasor measured from 0° is the corresponding angular point 
on the sine wave.

Phasors and the Sine Wave Formula
Let’s examine a phasor representation at one specific angle. Figure 11–30 shows a 
voltage phasor at an angular position of 45° and the corresponding point on the sine 
wave. The instantaneous value of the sine wave at this point is related to both the 
position and the length of the phasor. As previously mentioned, the vertical distance 

Introduction to Phasors  ●  455
from the phasor tip down to the horizontal axis represents the instantaneous value 
of the sine wave at that point.
Notice that when a vertical line is drawn from the phasor tip down to the horizon-
tal axis, a right triangle is formed, as shown shaded in Figure 11–30. The length of 
the phasor is the hypotenuse of the triangle, and the vertical projection is the opposite 
side. From trigonometry,
The opposite side of a right triangle is equal to the hypotenuse times the sine of the 
angle U.
The length of the phasor is the peak value of the sinusoidal voltage, Vp. Thus, the 
 opposite side of the triangle, which is the instantaneous value, can be expressed as
v = Vpsin u
Recall that this formula is the one stated earlier for calculating instantaneous 
 sinusoidal voltage. A similar formula applies to a sinusoidal current.
i = Ipsin u
Positive and Negative Phasor Angles
The position of a phasor at any instant can be expressed as a positive angle, as you have 
seen, or as an equivalent negative angle. Positive angles are measured counterclock-
wise from 0°. Negative angles are measured clockwise from 0°. For a given positive 
angle u, the corresponding negative angle is u - 360°, as illustrated in Figure 11–31(a). 
In part (b), a specific example is shown. The angle of the phasor in this case can be 
expressed as +225° or -135°.

(b) v = (10 V)sin 30° = (10 V)(0.5) = 5 V

90° - 360° = ∙270∙
(d) v = (10 V)sin 135° = (10 V)(0.707) = 7.07 V
135° - 360° = ∙225∙
(e) v = (10 V)sin 270° = (10 V)(-1) = ∙10 V

458  ●  Introduction to Alternating Current and Voltage
Angular Velocity of a Phasor
As you have seen, one cycle of a sine wave is traced out when a phasor is rotated 
through 360 degrees or 2p radians. The faster it is rotated, the faster the sine wave 
cycle is traced out. Thus, the period and frequency are related to the velocity of rota-
tion of the phasor. The velocity of rotation is called the angular velocity and is desig-
nated v (the small Greek letter omega).
When a phasor rotates through 2p radians, one complete cycle is traced out. 
Therefore, the time required for the phasor to go through 2p radians is the period of 
the sine wave. Because the phasor rotates through 2p radians in a time equal to the 
period, T, the angular velocity can be expressed as
v = 2p
T
Since f = 1/T,
Equation 11–18 
v = 2pf
When a phasor is rotated at an angular velocity v, then vt is the angle through 
which the phasor has passed at any instant. Therefore, the following relationship can 
be stated:
Equation 11–19 
u = vt
Substituting 2pf  for v results in u = 2pft. With this relationship between angle and 
time, the equation for the instantaneous value of a sinusoidal voltage, v = Vpsin u, 
can be written as
Equation 11–20 
v = Vpsin 2pft
You can calculate the instantaneous value at any point in time along the sine wave 
curve if you know the frequency and peak value. The unit of 2pft is the radian so your 
calculator must be in the radian mode.
What is the value of a sinusoidal voltage at 3 ms from the positive-going zero 
crossing when Vp = 10 V and f = 50 kHz?
 
Solution 
 
 
v = Vp sin 2pft
= (10 V) sin 32p(50 kHz)(3 * 10-6 s)4 = 8.09 V

Analysis of AC Circuits  ●  459
If a sinusoidal voltage is applied across a resistor as shown in Figure 11–37, there 
is a sinusoidal current. The current is zero when the voltage is zero and is maxi-
mum when the voltage is maximum. When the voltage changes polarity, the current 
 reverses direction. As a result, the voltage and current are said to be in phase with 
each other.

ues, both as average values, and so on. Kirchhoff’s voltage and current laws apply to 
ac circuits as well as to dc circuits. Figure 11–38 illustrates Kirchhoff’s voltage law in 
a resistive circuit that has a sinusoidal voltage source. The source voltage is the sum of

Figure 11–41 shows a dc source and an ac source in series. These two voltages will add al-
gebraically to produce an ac voltage “riding” on a dc level, as measured across the resistor.
If VDC is greater than the peak value of the sinusoidal voltage, the combined voltage 
is a sine wave that never reverses polarity and is therefore nonalternating. This voltage, 
for which the amplitude periodically varies over time but never changes polarity, is com-
monly referred to as pulsating dc. That is, the sine wave is riding on a dc level, as shown 
in Figure 11–42(a). If VDC is less than the peak value of the sine wave, the sine wave will 
be negative during a portion of its lower half-cycle, as illustrated in Figure 11–42(b), and 
is therefore alternating. In either case, the sine wave will reach a maximum voltage equal 
to VDC + Vp, and it will reach a minimum voltage equal to VDC - Vp.

464  ●  Introduction to Alternating Current and Voltage
Simplified Alternator
Both the dc generator and the alternator, which generates ac voltage, are based on the 
principle of electromagnetic induction that produces a voltage when there is relative 
motion between a magnetic field and a conductor. For a simplified alternator, a single 
rotating loop passes permanent magnetic poles. The natural voltage that is generated 
by a rotating loop is ac. In an alternator, instead of the split rings used in a dc genera-
tor, solid rings called slip rings are used to connect to the rotor, and the output is ac. 
The simplest form of an alternator has the same appearance as a dc generator (see 
Figure 10–35) except for the slip rings, as shown in Figure 11–45.
11–7 
the alternator (ac generator)
An alternator is an ac generator that converts energy of motion into electrical 
 energy. Although it is similar to a dc generator, the alternator is more efficient 
than the dc generator. Alternators are widely used in vehicles, boats, and other 
 applications even when dc is the final output.

Frequency
In the simplified alternator in Figure 11–45, each revolution of the loop produces one 
cycle of a sine wave. The positive and negative peaks occur when the loop cuts the 
maximum number of flux lines. The rate the loop spins determines the time for one 
complete cycle and the frequency. If it takes 1/60 of a second to make a revolution, the 
period of the sine wave is 1/60 of a second and the frequency is 60 Hz. Thus, the faster 
the loop rotates, the higher the frequency.
Another way of achieving a higher frequency is to use more magnetic poles. When 
four poles are used instead of two, as shown in Figure 11–46, the conductor passes under 
a north and a south pole during one-half a revolution, which doubles the frequency. 

The Alternator (AC Generator)  ●  465
Practical Alternators
The single loop used in our simplified alternator produces only a tiny voltage. In a prac-
tical alternator, hundreds of loops are wound on a magnetic core, which forms the rotor. 
Practical alternators usually have fixed windings surrounding the rotor instead of per-
manent magnets. Depending on the type of alternator, these fixed windings can either 
provide the magnetic field (in which case they are called field windings) or act as the fixed 
conductors that produce the output (in which case they are the armature windings).
Rotating-Armature Alternators In a rotating-armature alternator, the magnetic 
field is stationary and is supplied by permanent magnets or electromagnets operated 
from dc. With electromagnets, field windings are used instead of permanent magnets 
and provide a fixed magnetic field that interacts with the rotor coils. Power is gener-
ated in the rotating assembly and supplied to the load through the slip rings.
In a rotating-armature alternator, the rotor is the component from which power is 
taken. In addition to hundreds of windings, the practical rotating-armature alterna-
tor usually has many pole pairs in the stator that alternate as north and south poles, 
which serve to increase the output frequency.
Rotating-Field Alternator The rotating-armature alternator is generally limited to 
low-power applications because all output current must pass through the slip rings 
and brushes. To avoid this problem, rotating-field alternators take the output from

466  ●  Introduction to Alternating Current and Voltage
Rotor Current
A wound rotor offers important control advantages to alternators. A wound rotor 
 enables control over the strength of the magnetic field by controlling the rotor current 
and hence the output voltage. For wound rotors, dc must be supplied to the rotor. This 
current is usually supplied through brushes and slip rings, which are made of a contin-
uous ring of material (unlike a commutator, which is segmented). Because the brushes 
need to pass only the magnetizing rotor current, they last longer and are smaller than 
the brushes in an equivalent dc generator, which pass all of the output current.
In wound-rotor alternators, the only current through the brushes and slip rings is 
the dc that is used to maintain its magnetic field. The dc is usually derived from a small 
portion of the output current, which is taken from the stator and converted to dc. 
Large alternators, such as in power stations, may have a separate dc generator, called 
an exciter, to supply current to the field coils. An exciter can respond very fast to 
changes in output voltage to keep the alternator’s output constant, an important con-
sideration in high-power alternators. Some exciters are set up using a stationary field 
with the armature on the rotating main shaft. The result is a brushless system because 
the exciter output is on the rotating shaft. A brushless system eliminates the primary 
maintenance issue with large alternators in cleaning, repairing, and replacing brushes.
the stator coils and use a rotating magnet, hence the name. Small alternators may have 
a permanent magnet for a rotor, but most use an electromagnet formed by a wound 
rotor. A relatively small amount of dc is supplied to the rotor (through the slip rings) 
to power the electromagnet. As the rotating magnetic field sweeps by the stator wind-
ings, power is generated in the stator. The stator is therefore the armature in this case.
Figure 11–47 shows how a rotating-field alternator can generate three-phase sine 
waves. (For simplicity, a permanent magnet is shown for the rotor.) AC is generated 
in each winding as the north pole and the south pole of the rotor alternately sweep 
by a stator winding. If the north pole generates the positive portion of the sine wave, 
the south pole will generate the negative portion; thus, one rotation produces a com-
plete sine wave. Each winding has a sine wave output; but because the windings are 
separated by 120°, the three sine waves are also shifted by 120°. This produces the 
three-phase output as shown. Most alternators generate three-phase voltage because 
it is more efficient to produce and is widely used in industry. If the final output is dc, 
three-phase is easier to convert to dc.

The Alternator (AC Generator)  ●  467
An Application
Alternators are used in nearly all modern automobiles, trucks, tractors, and other ve-
hicles. In vehicles, the output is usually three-phase ac taken from stator windings and 
then converted to dc with diodes that are housed inside the alternator case. (In alterna-
tors, diodes are solid-state devices that allow current in only one direction.) Current to 
the rotor is controlled by a voltage regulator, which is also internal to the alternator. 
The voltage regulator keeps the output voltage relatively constant for engine speed 
changes or changing loads. Alternators have replaced dc generators in automobiles 
and most other applications because they are more efficient and more reliable.
Important parts of a small alternator, such as you might find in an automobile are 
shown in Figure 11–48. Like the self-excited generator discussed in Chapter 10, the 
rotor has a small residual magnetism to begin with, so an ac voltage is generated in 
the stators as soon as the rotor starts spinning. This ac is converted to dc by a set of 
diodes. A portion of the dc is used to provide current to the rotor; the rest is available 
for the loads. The amount of current required by the rotor is much less than the total 
current from the alternator, so it can easily provide the required current to the load.

Expanded and simplified view of a rotor, stator, and diode plate for a small alternator that produces dc.
In addition to the fact that three-phase voltage is more efficient to produce, it can 
produce a stable dc output easily by using two diodes in each winding. Since vehicles 
require dc for the charging system and loads, the output of the alternator is converted 
to dc internally using a diode array mounted on a diode plate. Thus, a standard three-
phase automotive alternator will normally have six diodes inside to convert the out-
put to dc. (Some alternators have six independent stator coils and 12 diodes.)

Motors are electromagnetic devices that represent the most common loads for ac in 
power applications. AC motors are used to operate household appliances such as heat 
pumps, refrigerators, washers, dryers, and vacuums. In industry, ac motors are used in 
many applications to move and process materials as well as refrigeration and heating 
units, machining operations, pumps, and much more. In this section, the two major 
types of ac motors, induction motors and synchronous motors, are introduced.

the ac Motor
AC Motor Classification
The two major classifications of ac motors are induction motors and synchronous 
motors. Several considerations determine which of these types are best for any given 
application. These considerations include the speed and power requirements, voltage 
rating, load characteristics (such as starting torque required), efficiency requirements, 
maintenance requirements, and operating environment (such as underwater operation 
or high temperatures).
An induction motor is so named because a magnetic field induces current in the 
rotor, creating a magnetic field that interacts with the stator field. Normally, there 
is no electrical connection to the rotor, so there is no need for slip rings or brushes, 
which tend to wear out. The rotor current is caused by electromagnetic induction, 
which also occurs in transformers (covered in Chapter 14), so induction motors are 
said to work by transformer action.
In a synchronous motor, the rotor moves in sync (at the same rate) as the  rotating 
field of the stator. Synchronous motors are used in applications where maintaining 
constant speed is important. Synchronous motors are not self-starting and must receive 
starting torque from an external source or from built-in starting windings. Like alter-
nators, synchronous motors use slip rings and brushes to provide current to the rotor.
Rotating Stator Field
Both synchronous and induction ac motors have a similar arrangement for the stator 
windings, which allow the magnetic field of the stator to rotate. The rotating stator 
field is equivalent to moving a magnet in a circle except that the rotating field is pro-
duced electrically, with no moving parts.
How can the magnetic field in the stator rotate if the stator itself does not move? 
The rotating field is created by the changing ac itself. Let’s look at a rotating field with 
a three-phase stator, as shown in Figure 11–49. Notice that one of the three phases 
“ dominates” at different times. When phase 1 is at 90°, the current in the phase 1 wind-
ing is at a maximum and current in the other windings is smaller. Therefore, the sta-
tor magnetic field will be oriented toward the phase-1 stator winding. As the phase-1 
current declines, the phase-2 current increases, and the field rotates toward the phase-2 
 winding. The magnetic field will be oriented toward the phase-2 winding when current 
in it is a maximum. As the phase-2 current declines, the phase-3 current increases, and 
the field rotates toward the phase-3 winding. The process repeats as the field returns to 

The AC Motor  ●  469
the phase-1 winding. Thus, the field rotates at a rate determined by the frequency of the 
applied voltage. With a more detailed analysis, it can be shown that the magnitude of the 
field is unchanged; only the direction of the field changes. Although the rotating field in a 
three-phase motor eliminates the need for an external starter or extra starting windings, 
larger three-phase motors will generally have an external motor starter, which is a device 
that isolates the motor from the main power source, protects it against short circuits and 
overloads, and enables progressive  start-up to avoid high currents at start-up.
As the stator field moves, the rotor moves in sync with it in a synchronous motor 
but lags behind in an induction motor. The rate the stator field moves is called the 
synchronous speed of the motor.
Induction Motors
The theory of operation is essentially the same for both single-phase and three-
phase induction motors. Both types use the rotating field described previously, but 
the  single-phase motor requires starting windings or other method to produce torque 
for starting the motor, whereas the three-phase motor is self-starting. When starting 
windings are employed in a single-phase motor, they are removed from the circuit by a 
mechanical centrifugal switch as the motor speeds up.
The core of the induction motor’s rotor consists of an aluminum frame that forms 
the conductors for the circulating current in the rotor. (Some larger induction motors 
use copper bars.) The aluminum frame is similar in appearance to the exercise wheel 
for pet squirrels (common in the early 20th century), so it is aptly called a  squirrel 
cage, illustrated in Figure 11–50. The aluminum squirrel cage itself is the electrical 
path; it is embedded within a ferromagnetic material to provide a low reluctance

magnetic path through the rotor. In addition, the rotor has cooling fins that may be 
molded into the same piece of aluminum as the squirrel cage. The entire assembly 
must be balanced so that it spins easily and without vibrating.
Operation of an Induction Motor When the magnetic field from the stator moves 
across the squirrel cage of the inductor, a current is generated in the squirrel cage. This 
current creates a magnetic field that reacts with the moving field of the stator, caus-
ing the rotor to start turning. The rotor will try to “catch up” with the moving field, 
but cannot, in a condition known as slip. Slip is defined as the difference between the 
synchronous speed of the stator and the rotor speed. The rotor can never reach the 
synchronous speed of the stator field because, if it did, it would not cut any field lines 
and the torque would drop to zero. Without torque, the rotor could not turn itself.
Initially, before the rotor starts moving, there is no back emf, so the stator current 
is high. As the rotor speeds up, it generates a back emf that opposes the stator cur-
rent. As the motor speeds up, the torque produced balances the load and the current 
is just enough to keep the rotor turning. The running current is significantly lower 
than the initial start-up current because of the back emf. If the load on the motor 
is then increased, the motor will slow down and generate less back emf. This increases 
the current to the motor and increases the torque it can apply to the load. Thus, an 
induction motor can operate over a range of speeds and torque. Maximum torque 
 occurs when the rotor is spinning at about 75% of the synchronous speed.
Synchronous Motors
Recall that an induction motor develops no torque if it runs at the synchronous 
speed, so it must run slower than the synchronous speed, depending on the load. The 
synchronous motor will run at the synchronous speed and still develop the required 
torque for different loads. The only way to change the speed of a synchronous motor 
is to change the frequency.
The fact that synchronous motors maintain a constant speed for all load condi-
tions is a major advantage in certain industrial operations and in applications where 
clock or timing requirements are involved (such as a telescope drive motor or a chart 
recorder). In fact, the first application of synchronous motors was in electric clocks 
(in 1917).
Another important advantage to large synchronous motors is their efficiency. 
Although their original cost is higher than a comparable induction motor, the savings 
in power will often pay for the cost difference in a few years.
Operation of a Synchronous Motor Essentially, the rotating stator field of the syn-
chronous motor is identical to that of an induction motor. The primary difference in 
the two motors is in the rotor. The induction motor has a rotor that is electrically iso-
lated from a supply and the synchronous motor uses a magnet to follow the rotating 
stator field. Small synchronous motors use a permanent magnet for the rotor; larger 
motors use an electromagnet. When an electromagnet is used, dc is supplied from an 
external source via slip rings as in the case of the alternator.

Nonsinusoidal Waveforms  ●  471
Pulse Waveforms
Basically, a pulse can be described as a very rapid transition (leading edge) from one 
voltage or current level (baseline) to an amplitude level, and then, after an interval of 
time, a very rapid transition (trailing edge) back to the original baseline level. The transi-
tions in level are also called steps. An ideal pulse consists of two opposite-going steps of 
equal amplitude. When the leading or trailing edge is positive-going, it is called a  rising 
edge. When the leading or trailing edge is negative-going, it is called a falling edge.
Figure 11–51(a) shows an ideal positive-going pulse consisting of two equal but 
opposite instantaneous steps separated by an interval of time called the pulse width. 
Part (b) of Figure 11–51 shows an ideal negative-going pulse. The height of the pulse 
measured from the baseline is its voltage (or current) amplitude.

Ideal pulses.
In many applications, analysis is simplified by treating all pulses as ideal (com-
posed of instantaneous steps and perfectly rectangular in shape). Actual pulses, how-
ever, are never ideal. All pulses possess certain characteristics that cause them to be 
different from the ideal.

472  ●  Introduction to Alternating Current and Voltage
In practice, pulses cannot change from one level to another instantaneously. Time 
is always required for a transition (step), as illustrated in Figure 11–52(a). As you can 
see, there is an interval of time during the rising edge in which the pulse is going from 
its lower value to its higher value. This interval is called the rise time, tr.
Rise time is the time required for the pulse to go from 10% of its amplitude to 90% 
of its amplitude.

Nonideal pulse.
The interval of time during the falling edge in which the pulse is going from its 
higher value to its lower value is called the fall time, tf.
Fall time is the time required for the pulse to go from 90% of its amplitude to 10% of 
its amplitude.
Pulse width, tW, also requires a precise definition for the nonideal pulse because the 
rising and falling edges are not vertical.
Pulse width is the time between the point on the rising edge, where the value is 50% 
of amplitude, to the point on the falling edge, where the value is 50% of amplitude.
Pulse width is shown in Figure 11–52(b).
Repetitive Pulses Any waveform that repeats itself at fixed intervals is periodic. 
Some examples of periodic pulse waveforms are shown in Figure 11–53. Notice that, 
in each case, the pulses repeat at regular intervals. The rate at which the pulses repeat 
is the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) or pulse repetition rate (PRR), which is the 
fundamental frequency of the waveform. The frequency can be expressed in hertz or 
in pulses per second. The time from one pulse to the corresponding point on the next 
pulse is the period, T. The relationship between frequency and period is the same as 
with the sine wave, f = 1/T.

The Average Value of a Pulse Waveform The average value (Vavg) of a pulse wave-
form is equal to its baseline value plus its duty cycle times its amplitude. The lower 
level of a positive-going waveform or the upper level of a negative-going waveform is 
taken as the baseline. The formula is as follows:
An important characteristic of repetitive pulse waveforms is the duty cycle.
The duty cycle is the ratio of the pulse width (tW) to the period (T ) and is usually 
expressed as a percentage.

Triangular and Sawtooth Waveforms
Triangular and sawtooth waveforms are formed by voltage or current ramps. A ramp is 
a linear increase or decrease in the voltage or current. Figure 11–57 shows both  positive- 
and negative-going ramps. In part (a), the ramp has a positive slope; in part (b), the 
ramp has a negative slope. The slope of a voltage ramp is {V/t and is expressed in units 
of V/s. The slope of a current ramp is {I/t and is expressed in units of A/s.
 
Solution 
In Figure 11–56(a), the baseline is at 0 V, the amplitude is 2 V, and the duty cycle is 
10%. The average value is
Vavg = baseline + (duty cycle)(amplitude) 
 = 0 V + (0.1)(2 V) = 0.2 V
The waveform in Figure 11–56(b) has a baseline of +1 V, an amplitude of 5 V, 
and a duty cycle of 50%. The average value is
Vavg = baseline + (duty cycle)(amplitude) 
= 1 V + (0.5)(5 V) = 1 V + 2.5 V = 3.5 V
Figure 11–56(c) shows a square wave with a baseline of -1 V and an amplitude 
of 2 V. The average value is
Vavg = baseline + (duty cycle)(amplitude)
= -1 V + (0.5)(2 V) = -1 V + 1 V = 0 V
This is an alternating square wave, and, as with an alternating sine wave, it has an 
average of zero.

This particular triangular waveform is alternating and has an average value of zero.

Sawtooth Waveforms The sawtooth waveform is actually a special case of the tri-
angular wave consisting of two ramps, one of much longer duration than the other. 
Sawtooth waveforms are used in many electronic systems. For example, the electron 
beam that sweeps across the screen of a cathode ray tube (CRT) TV, creating the 
picture, or analog oscilloscope creating the signal image, is controlled by sawtooth 
voltages and currents. The slow ramp sweeps the electron beam from left to right 
(the beam trace) to create the image on the CRT screen, and the fast ramp returns 
the beam to the left side of the screen much more quickly (the beam retrace) for the 
next trace. One sawtooth wave produces the horizontal beam movement, and the 
other produces the vertical beam movement. A sawtooth voltage is sometimes called 
a sweep voltage.
Figure 11–61 is an example of a sawtooth wave. Notice that it consists of a 
 positive-going ramp of relatively long duration, followed by a negative-going ramp 
of relatively short duration.

476  ●  Introduction to Alternating Current and Voltage
Harmonics
A repetitive nonsinusoidal waveform is composed of a fundamental frequency and har-
monic frequencies. The fundamental frequency is the repetition rate of the waveform, 
and the harmonics are higher frequency sine waves that are multiples of the fundamental.
Odd Harmonics Odd harmonics are frequencies that are odd multiples of the fun-
damental frequency of a waveform. For example, a 1 kHz square wave consists of a 
fundamental of 1 kHz and odd harmonics of 3 kHz, 5 kHz, 7 kHz, and so on. The 
3 kHz frequency in this case is called the third harmonic, the 5 kHz frequency is the 
fifth harmonic, and so on.
Even Harmonics Even harmonics are frequencies that are even multiples of the fun-
damental frequency. For example, if a certain wave has a fundamental of 200 Hz, 
the second harmonic is 400 Hz, the fourth harmonic is 800 Hz, the sixth harmonic is 
1,200 Hz, and so on. These are even harmonics.
Composite Waveform Any variation from a pure sine wave produces harmonics. 
A nonsinusoidal wave is a composite of the fundamental and the harmonics. Some 
types of waveforms have only odd harmonics, some have only even harmonics, and 
some contain both. The shape of the wave is determined by its harmonic content. 
Generally, only the fundamental and the first few harmonics are of significant impor-
tance in determining the wave shape.
A square wave is an example of a waveform that consists of a fundamental and 
only odd harmonics. When the instantaneous values of the fundamental and each 
odd harmonic are added algebraically at each point, the resulting curve will have the 
shape of a square wave, as illustrated in Figure 11–62. In part (a) of the figure, the 
fundamental and the third harmonic produce a wave shape that begins to resemble a 
square wave. In part (b), the fundamental, third, and fifth harmonics produce a closer 
resemblance. When the seventh harmonic is included, as in part (c), the resulting wave 
shape becomes even more like a square wave. As more harmonics are included, a 
 periodic square wave is approached.

A mixed signal (digital and analog) oscilloscope is shown in Figure 11–64.
Two basic types of oscilloscopes, digital and analog, can be used to view digital 
waveforms. The digital scope converts the measured waveform to digital information 
by a sampling process in an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The sampled informa-
tion is processed and used to reconstruct the waveform on a raster type display. The 
analog scope works by applying the measured waveform directly to control the up and 
down motion of the electron beam on a cathode ray tube (CRT) as it sweeps across the 
screen. As a result, the beam traces out the waveform directly on the screen in real time.
The digital scope is able to store measured waves, and it is usually referred to as 
a digital storage oscilloscope (DSO). DSOs are much more versatile and automated 
than analog scopes and are much more widely used than analog scopes. While repeti-
tive signals can be observed on either type of oscilloscope, digital scopes can capture 
and store both repetitive and non-repetitive waves. They can show signals that may 
happen only once, such as signals from destructive testing. (Specialized analog stor-
age scopes can also store waveforms.) Digital scopes can also make automated mea-
surements such as frequency, period, and peak-to-peak voltage. Measured values can 
be displayed as selected by the user.
The fundamental controls for either type of oscilloscope can be grouped into 
three areas: vertical, horizontal, and trigger. If you understand the basic functions of 
these controls, you can operate either type of scope. Analog scopes will include dis-
play controls. Digital scopes will include controls for automated measurements and 
storage functions. These are described in more detail in the following paragraphs.
Basic Operation of Analog Oscilloscopes
To measure a voltage, a probe must be connected from the scope to the point in a 
circuit at which the voltage is present. Generally, a *10 probe is used that reduces 
(attenuates) the signal amplitude by 10. The purpose of the probe is to couple the 
signal to the scope with minimum distortion, avoid noise pickup, and extend mea-
surements to higher frequencies than are possible without the probe. The ground 
on the probe is connected to a nearby ground on the circuit board. The signal goes 
through the probe into the vertical circuits where it is either further attenuated or 
amplified, depending on the actual amplitude and on where you set the vertical con-
trol of the scope. The vertical circuits then drive the vertical deflection plates of the 
CRT. Also, the signal goes to the trigger circuits that trigger the horizontal circuits 
to initiate repetitive horizontal sweeps of the electron beam across the screen using

Basic Operation of Digital Oscilloscopes
Some parts of a digital scope are similar to the analog scope. However, the digital 
scope is more complex than an analog scope and uses a raster screen (a dot matrix 
structure) rather than the phosphor display of a CRT. There is typically a very slight 
delay between the acquisition and the displaying of the waveform depending upon how 
many data points the oscilloscope configuration must acquire and store. The digital 
scope first acquires the measured analog waveform and converts it to a digital format 
using an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The digital data is stored and processed.  
a sawtooth waveform. There are many sweeps per second so that the beam appears 
to form a continuous line across the screen in the shape of the waveform. This basic 
operation is illustrated in Figure 11–65.

The data then goes to the reconstruction and display circuits for display in its original 
analog form. Figure 11–66 shows a basic block diagram for a digital oscilloscope.
Oscilloscope Controls
A front panel view of a typical dual-channel oscilloscope is shown in Figure 11–67. 
Instruments vary depending on model and manufacturer, but most have certain 
common features. For example, the two vertical sections contain a Position control, 
a channel menu button, and a Volts/Div control. The horizontal section contains a  
Sec/Div control.
Some of the main controls are now discussed. Refer to the user manual for com-
plete details of your particular scope.
Vertical Controls In the vertical section of the scope in Figure 11–67, there are iden-
tical controls for each of the two channels (CH1 and CH2). The Position control lets 
you move a displayed waveform up or down vertically on the screen. The buttons 
immediately right of the screen provide for the selection of several items that appear 
on the screen, such as the coupling modes (ac, dc, or ground), coarse or fine adjust-
ment for the Volts/Div, signal inversion, and other parameters. The Volts/Div control 
adjusts the number of volts represented by each vertical division on the screen. The 
Volts/Div setting for each channel is displayed on the bottom of the screen.
Horizontal Controls In the horizontal section, the controls apply to both channels. 
The Position control lets you move a displayed waveform left or right horizontally on 
the screen. The Horizontal Menu button provides for the selection of several items 
that appear on the screen such as the main time base, expanded view of a portion of 
a waveform, and other parameters. The Sec/Div control adjusts the time represented 
by each horizontal division or main time base. The Sec/Div setting is displayed at the 
bottom of the screen.

The Oscilloscope  ●  481
Trigger Controls In the Trigger section, the Level control determines the point on 
the triggering waveform where triggering occurs to initiate the sweep to display input 
waveforms. The Trigger Menu button provides for the selection of several items that 
appear on the screen including edge or slope triggering, trigger source, trigger mode, 
and other parameters. There is also an input for an external trigger signal.
Triggering stabilizes a waveform on the screen and properly triggers on a pulse 
that occurs only one time or randomly. Also, it allows you to observe time delays 
between two waveforms. Figure 11–68 compares a triggered to an untriggered signal. 
The untriggered signal tends to drift across the screen producing what appears to be 
multiple waveforms.

Coupling a Signal into the Scope Coupling is the method used to connect a signal 
voltage to be measured into the oscilloscope. The DC and AC coupling modes are 
selected from the Vertical menu. DC coupling allows a waveform including its dc 
component to be displayed. AC coupling blocks the dc component of a signal so that 
you see the waveform centered at 0 V. The Ground mode allows you to connect the 
channel input to ground to see where the 0 V reference is on the screen. Figure 11–69 
illustrates the result of DC and AC coupling using a sinusoidal waveform that has a 
dc component.
A general-purpose standard passive probe is shown in Figure 11–70. It is used for 
connecting a signal to the scope. The short lead on the side of the probe is a ground 
lead and allows you to connect the oscilloscope ground to a nearby point in the circuit 

482  ●  Introduction to Alternating Current and Voltage
The probe has an adjustment that allows you to compensate for the input capaci-
tance of the scope. (Capacitance is discussed in Chapter 12.) Most scopes have a probe 
compensation output that provides a calibrated square wave for probe compensation. 
Before making a measurement, you should make sure that the probe is properly com-
pensated to eliminate any distortion introduced. Typically, there is a screw or other 
means of adjusting compensation on a probe. Figure 11–71 shows scope waveforms 
for three probe conditions: properly compensated, undercompensated, and overcom-
pensated. If the waveform appears either over- or undercompensated, adjust the probe 
until the properly compensated square wave is achieved.
that is being probed. This helps eliminate stray ground currents and reduces induc-
tance on the ground lead. Since all instruments tend to affect the circuit being mea-
sured due to loading, most scope probes provide a high series resistance to minimize 
loading effects. Probes that have a series resistance 10 times larger than the input 
resistance of the scope are called *10 (times 10) probes. Probes with no series resis-
tance are called *1 (times one) probes. The oscilloscope adjusts its calibration for the 
attenuation of the type of probe being used. For most measurements, the *10 probe 
should be used because it presents a higher resistive load to the circuit under test and 
can display higher frequencies more accurately. However, if you are measuring very 
small signals, a *1 may be the best choice.

Application Activity
As you learned in this chapter, 
nonsinusoidal waveforms contain 
a combination of various harmonic frequencies. Each of these 
harmonics is a sinusoidal waveform with a certain frequency. 
Certain sinusoidal frequencies are audible; that is, they can be 
heard by the human ear. A single audible frequency, or pure sine 
wave, is called a tone and generally falls in the frequency range 
from about 300 Hz to about 15 kHz. When you hear a tone re-
produced through a speaker, its loudness, or volume, depends on 
its voltage amplitude. You will use your knowledge of sine wave 
 characteristics and the operation of an oscilloscope to measure 
the frequency and amplitude of signals at various points in a 
basic radio receiver.
Actual voice or music signals that are picked up by a radio 
receiver contain many harmonic frequencies with different volt-
age values. A voice or music signal is continuously changing,

so its harmonic content is also changing. However, if a single 
sinusoidal frequency is transmitted and picked up by the 
 receiver, you will hear a constant tone from the speaker.
Although at this point you do not have the background 
to study amplifiers and receiver systems in detail, you can 
observe the signals at various points in the receiver. A block 
diagram of a typical AM receiver is shown in Figure 11–73. 
AM stands for amplitude modulation, a topic that will be 
covered in another course. Figure 11–74 shows what a basic 
AM signal looks like, and for now that’s all you need to know. 
As you can see, the amplitude of the sinusoidal waveform is 
changing. The higher radio frequency (RF) signal is called 
the carrier; and its amplitude is varied or modulated by a 
lower frequency signal, which is the audio (a tone in this case). 
 Normally, however, the audio signal is a complex voice or 
music waveform.
Oscilloscope Measurements
Signals that are indicated by circled numbers at several test 
points on the receiver block diagram in Figure 11–73 are 
displayed on the oscilloscope screen in Figure 11–75 as indi-
cated by the same corresponding circled numbers. In all cases, 
the upper waveform on the screen is channel 1 and the lower 
waveform is channel 2. The readings on the bottom of the 
screen show readings for both channels.
The signal at point 1 is an AM signal, but you can’t see 
the amplitude variation because of the short time base. The 
waveform is spread out too much to see the modulating audio 
signal, which causes amplitude variations; so what you see 
is just one cycle of the carrier. At point 3, the higher carrier 
frequency is difficult to determine because the time base was 
selected to allow viewing of one full cycle of the modulat-
ing signal. In an AM receiver, this intermediate frequency is 
455 kHz. In actual practice, the modulated carrier signal at 
point 3 cannot easily be viewed on the scope because it con-
tains two frequencies that make it difficult to synchronize in 
order to obtain a stable pattern. Sometimes external triggering 
using the modulating signal or TV field is used to obtain a 
stable display. A stable pattern is shown in this case to illus-
trate what the modulated waveform looks like.
1. For each waveform in Figure 11–75, except point 3, deter-
mine the frequency and rms value. The signal at point 4 
is the modulating tone extracted by the detector from the 
higher intermediate frequency (455 kHz).
Amplifier Analysis
2. All voltage amplifiers have a characteristic known as 
voltage gain. The voltage gain is the amount by which 
the amplitude of the output signal is greater than the 
amplitude of the input signal. Using this definition and 
the appropriate scope measurements, determine the gain 
of the audio preamplifier in this particular receiver.
3. When an electrical signal is converted to sound by a 
speaker, the loudness of the sound depends on the ampli-
tude of the signal applied to the speaker. Based on this, 
explain how the volume control potentiometer is used to 
adjust the loudness (volume) of the sound and determine 
the rms amplitude at the speaker.

INTRODUCTION
In previous chapters, the resistor has been the only passive 
electrical component that you have studied. Capacitors and 
inductors are other types of basic passive electrical compo-
nents. You will study inductors in Chapter 13.
In this chapter, you will learn about the capacitor and its 
characteristics. The physical construction and electrical prop-
erties are examined, and the effects of connecting capacitors 
in series and in parallel are analyzed. How a capacitor works 
in both dc and ac circuits is an important part of this cover-
age and forms the basis for the study of reactive circuits in 
terms of both frequency response and time response.
The capacitor is an electrical device that can store electri-
cal charge, thereby creating an electric field that, in turn, 
stores energy. The measure of the energy-storing ability of a 
capacitor is its capacitance. When a sinusoidal signal is ap-
plied to a capacitor, it reacts in a certain way and produces 
an opposition to current, which depends on the frequency  
of the applied signal. This opposition to current is called 
 capacitive reactance.

Basic Construction
In its simplest form, a capacitor is an electrical device that stores electrical charge 
and is constructed of two parallel conductive plates separated by an insulating mate-
rial called the dielectric. Connecting leads are attached to the parallel plates. A basic 
 capacitor is shown in Figure 12–1(a), and a schematic symbol is shown in part (b).

How a Capacitor Stores Charge
In the neutral state, both plates of a capacitor have an equal number of free electrons, 
as indicated in Figure 12–2(a). When the capacitor is connected to a voltage source 
through a resistor, as shown in part (b), electrons (negative charge) are removed 
from plate A, and an equal number are deposited on plate B. As plate A loses elec-
trons and plate B gains electrons, plate A becomes positive with respect to plate B.  
During this charging process, electrons flow only through the connecting leads. No 
electrons flow through the dielectric of the capacitor because it is an insulator; how-
ever, the dielectric becomes polarized. The movement of electrons ceases when the 
voltage across the capacitor equals the source voltage, as indicated in Figure 12–2(c). 
If the capacitor is disconnected from the source, it retains the stored charge for a 
long period of time (the length of time depends on the type of capacitor) and still 
has the voltage across it, as shown in Figure 12–2(d). A charged capacitor can act as 
a temporary battery.
Capacitors are capable of storing 
dangerous electrical charge for a 
long time after power has been 
turned off in a circuit. Be careful 
when touching or handling capaci-
tors in or out of a circuit. If you 
touch the leads, you may be in for 
a shock as the capacitor discharges 
through you! It is usually good 
practice to discharge a capaci-
tor using a shorting tool with an 
insulated grip of some sort before 
handling the capacitor.
A capacitor is a passive electrical component that stores electrical charge and has 
the property of capacitance.

Capacitance
The amount of charge that a capacitor can store per unit of voltage across its plates is 
its capacitance, designated C. That is, capacitance is a measure of a capacitor’s ability 
to store charge. The more charge per unit of voltage that a capacitor can store, the 
greater its capacitance, as expressed by the following formula:

The Unit of Capacitance The farad (F) is the basic unit of capacitance. Recall that 
the coulomb (C) is the unit of electrical charge.
One farad is the amount of capacitance when one coulomb (C) of charge is stored 
with one volt across the plates.
Most capacitors that are used in electronics work have capacitance values that 
are specified in microfarads (mF) and picofarads (pF). A microfarad is one- millionth 
of a farad (1 mF = 1 * 10-6 F), and a picofarad is one-trillionth of a farad

(1 pF = 1 * 10-12 F). These are the most common units for marking capacitors, but 
nF is commonly used in schematics and programs like Multisim and LTSpice. The 
unit mF is occasionally used but less so because it is so large. Conversions for farads, 
microfarads, and picofarads are given in Table 12–1.

How a Capacitor Stores Energy
A capacitor stores energy in the form of an electric field that is established by the opposite 
charges stored on the two plates. The electric field is represented by lines of force between 
the positive and negative charges and is concentrated within the dielectric, as shown in 
Figure 12–3. Although current does not flow through the dielectric, molecules in the di-
electric orient themselves with the electric field, creating a polarized region within the di-
electric. The polarized molecules within the dielectric create an electric field that reduces 
the overall field within the dielectric. A good dielectric is one which is easily polarized.

▶FIGURE 12–3
The electric field stores energy in a 
capacitor.
The plates in Figure 12–3 have acquired a charge because they are connected to a 
battery. This creates an electric field between the plates, which stores energy. The en-
ergy stored in the electric field is directly related to the size of the capacitor and to the 
square of the voltage as given by the following equation for the energy stored:
Equation 12–4 
W = 1
2
 CV 2
When capacitance (C) is in farads and voltage (V) is in volts, the energy (W) is in joules.
Voltage Rating
Every capacitor has a limit on the amount of voltage that it can withstand across its 
plates. The voltage rating specifies the maximum dc voltage that can be applied without 
risk of damage to the device. If this maximum voltage, commonly called the breakdown 
voltage or working voltage, is exceeded, permanent damage to the capacitor can result.
You must consider both the capacitance and the voltage rating before you use a ca-
pacitor in a circuit application. The choice of capacitance value is based on particular 
circuit requirements. The voltage rating should always be above the maximum volt-
age expected in a particular application.
Dielectric Strength The breakdown voltage of a capacitor is determined by the di-
electric strength of the dielectric material used. The dielectric strength is expressed in 
V/mil (1 mil = 0.001 in. = 25.4 * 10-6 m = 25.4 mm = 25.4 microns). Table 12–2 
lists typical values for several materials. Exact values vary depending on the specific 
composition of the material.

▶TABLE 12–2
Some common dielectric materials 
and their dielectric strengths.

The Basic Capacitor  ●  507
A capacitor’s dielectric strength can best be explained by an example. Assume that 
a certain capacitor has a plate separation of 1 mil and that the dielectric material is 
ceramic. This particular capacitor can withstand a maximum voltage of 1,000 V be-
cause its dielectric strength is 1,000 V/mil. If the maximum voltage is exceeded, the 
dielectric may break down (i.e., puncture the dielectric) and conduct current, causing 
permanent damage to the capacitor. Similarly, if the ceramic capacitor has a plate 
separation of 2 mils, its breakdown voltage is 2,000 V.
Temperature Coefficient
The temperature coefficient indicates the amount and direction of a change in ca-
pacitance value with temperature. A positive temperature coefficient means that the 
capacitance increases with an increase in temperature or decreases with a decrease 
in temperature. A negative coefficient means that the capacitance decreases with an 
increase in temperature or increases with a decrease in temperature.
Temperature coefficients are typically specified in parts per million per Celsius de-
gree (ppm/°C). For example, a negative temperature coefficient of 150 ppm/°C for a 
1 mF capacitor means that for every degree rise in temperature, the capacitance de-
creases by 150 pF (there are one million picofarads in one microfarad).
Leakage
No insulating material is perfect. The dielectric of any capacitor will conduct some 
very small amount of current. Thus, the charge on a capacitor will eventually leak 
off. Some types of capacitors, such as large electrolytic types, have higher leakages 
than others. An equivalent circuit for a nonideal capacitor is shown in Figure 12–4. 
The parallel resistor Rleak represents the extremely high resistance (several hundred 
kilohms or more) of the dielectric material through which there is leakage current.
Physical Characteristics of a Capacitor
The following parameters are important in establishing the capacitance and the volt-
age rating of a capacitor: plate area, plate separation, and dielectric constant.
Plate Area Capacitance is directly proportional to the physical size of the plates as deter-
mined by the plate area, A. A larger plate area produces more capacitance, and a smaller 
plate area produces less capacitance. Figure 12–5(a) shows that the plate area of a parallel 
plate capacitor is the area of one of the plates. If the plates are moved in relation to each 
other, as shown in Figure 12–5(b), the overlapping area determines the effective plate area. 
This variation in effective plate area is the basis for a certain type of variable capacitor.

Plate Separation Capacitance is inversely proportional to the distance between the 
plates. The plate separation is designated d, as shown in Figure 12–6. A greater 
separation of the plates produces a smaller capacitance, as illustrated in the figure.

508  ●  Capacitors
As previously discussed, the breakdown voltage is directly proportional to the plate 
separation. The further the plates are separated, the greater the breakdown voltage.
Dielectric Constant As you know, the insulating material between the plates of a ca-
pacitor is called the dielectric. Dielectric materials tend to reduce the voltage between 
plates for a given charge and thus increase the capacitance. If the voltage is fixed, more 
charge can be stored due to the presence of a dielectric than can be stored without a 
dielectric. The measure of a material’s ability to establish an electric field is called the 
dielectric constant or relative permittivity, symbolized by er. (e is the Greek letter epsilon.)
Capacitance is directly proportional to the dielectric constant. The dielectric con-
stant of a vacuum is defined as 1 and that of air is very close to 1. These values are 
used as a reference, and all other materials have values of er specified with respect to 
that of a vacuum or air. For example, a material with er = 8 can result in a capaci-
tance eight times greater than that of air with all other factors being equal.
Table 12–3 lists several common dielectric materials and a typical dielectric constant for 
each. The values can vary because it depends on the specific composition of the material.

The dielectric constant (relative permittivity) is dimensionless because it is a rela-

permittivity of a vacuum, e0, as expressed by the following formula:
Equation 12–5 
er = e

The value of e0 is 8.85 * 10 -12 F/m (farads per meter).
Formula You have seen how capacitance is directly related to plate area, A, and the 
dielectric constant, er, and inversely related to plate separation, d. An exact formula 
for calculating the capacitance in terms of these three quantities is

where A is in square meters (m2), d is in meters (m), and C is in farads (F). Recall that

permittivity of a dielectric (e), as derived from Equation (12–5), is
e = er(8.85 * 10-12 F/m)

Mica Capacitors Two types of mica capacitors are stacked-foil and silver-mica. The 
basic construction of the stacked-foil type is shown in Figure 12–7. It consists of alter-
nate layers of metal foil and thin sheets of mica. The metal foil forms the plate, with 
alternate foil sheets connected together to increase the plate area. More layers are 
used to increase the plate area, thus increasing the capacitance. The mica/foil stack is 
encapsulated in an insulating material such as Bakelite®, as shown in Figure 12–7(b). 
A silver-mica capacitor is formed in a similar way by stacking mica sheets with silver 
electrode material screened on them.

Mica capacitors are available with capacitance values ranging from 1 pF to 0.1 mF and 
voltage ratings from 100 V dc to 2,500 V dc. Mica has a typical dielectric constant of 5.
Ceramic Capacitors Ceramic dielectrics provide very high dielectric constants 
(1,200 is typical). As a result, comparatively high capacitance values can be achieved 
in a small physical size. Ceramic capacitors are commonly available in a ceramic disk 
form, as shown in Figure 12–8, in a multilayer radial-lead configuration, as shown 
in Figure 12–9, or in a leadless ceramic chip, as shown in Figure 12–10, for surface 
mounting on printed circuit boards.
Ceramic capacitors typically are available in capacitance values ranging from 1 pF 
to 100 mF with voltage ratings up to 6 kV.

include polycarbonate, propylene, polyester, polystyrene, polypropylene, and mylar. 
Some of these types have capacitance values up to 100 mF but most are less than 1 mF.

strips that act as plates. One lead is connected to the inner plate and one is connected 
to the outer plate as indicated. The strips are then rolled in a spiral configuration and 
encapsulated in a molded case. Thus, a large plate area can be packaged in a relatively 
small physical size, thereby achieving large capacitance values. Another method uses 
metal deposited directly on the film dielectric to form the plates.

Be extremely careful with 
 electrolytic capacitors because 
it does make a difference which 
way an electrolytic capacitor is 
 connected. Always observe the 
proper polarity. If a polarized 
 capacitor is connected backwards, 
it may explode and cause injury.
Electrolytic Capacitors Electrolytic capacitors are polarized so that one plate is 
positive and the other negative. These capacitors are used for capacitance values 
from 1 mF up to over 200,000 mF, but they have relatively low breakdown voltages 
(350 V is a typical maximum but some are rated for much lower voltages). Electrolytic 
 capacitors typically have high leakage current. In this text, capacitors with values of 
1 mF or greater are considered to be polarized.
In recent years, manufacturers have developed new electrolytic capacitors with much 
larger capacitance values; however, these new capacitors have lower voltage ratings than 
smaller-value capacitors and tend to be expensive. Super capacitors with capacitances 
of hundreds of farads are available. These capacitors are useful for battery backup and 
for applications like small motor starters that require a very large capacitance.
Electrolytic capacitors offer much higher capacitance values than mica or ceramic 
capacitors, but their voltage ratings are typically lower. Aluminum electrolytics are 
probably the most commonly used type. While other capacitors use two similar plates, 
the electrolytic consists of one plate of aluminum foil and another plate made of a 
conducting electrolyte applied to a material such as plastic film. These two “plates” 
are separated by a layer of aluminum oxide that forms on the surface of the aluminum 
plate. Figure 12–13(a) illustrates the basic construction of a typical aluminum elec-
trolytic capacitor with axial leads. Other electrolytics with radial leads are shown in 
Figure 12–13(b); the symbol for an electrolytic capacitor is shown in part (c).
Tantalum electrolytics can be in either a tubular configuration similar to Figure 12–13 
or “tear drop” shape as shown in Figure 12–14. In the tear drop configuration, the posi-
tive plate is actually a pellet of tantalum powder rather than a sheet of foil. Tantalum 
pentoxide forms the dielectric, and manganese dioxide forms the negative plate.
Because of the process used for the insulating oxide dielectric, the metallic (alumi-
num or tantalum) plate must be connected so that it is always positive with respect 

Types of Capacitors  ●  513
to the electrolyte plate, and, thus all electrolytic capacitors are polarized. The metal 
plate (positive lead) is usually indicated by a plus sign or some other obvious marking 
and must always be connected in a dc circuit where the voltage across the capacitor 
does not change polarity regardless of any ac present. Reversal of the polarity of the 
voltage will usually result in complete destruction of the capacitor.
The problem of dielectric absorption occurs mostly in electrolytic capacitors when 
they do not completely discharge during use and retain a residual charge. Dielectric ab-
sorption is the spontaneous development of a capacitor voltage due to delayed dipole 
discharge within the dielectric when a capacitor is briefly discharged after being charged 
for a long time. Approximately 25% of defective capacitors exhibit this condition.

514  ●  Capacitors
Variable Capacitors
Variable capacitors are used in a circuit when there is a need to adjust the capacitance 
value either manually or automatically. These capacitors are generally less than 300 pF 
but are available in larger values for specialized applications. The schematic symbol 
for a variable capacitor is shown in Figure 12–15(a). Figure 12–15(b) shows a vari-
able capacitor with a rotary control in which capacitance is varied by increasing or 
decreasing the overlap of the capacitor plates.
Adjustable capacitors that normally have slotted screw-type adjustments and are 
used for very fine adjustments in a circuit are called trimmers. Ceramic or mica is a 
common dielectric in these types of capacitors, and the capacitance usually is changed 
by adjusting the plate separation. Generally, trimmer capacitors have values less than 
100 pF. Figure 12–16 shows some typical devices.

The varactor is a semiconductor device that exhibits a capacitance characteristic 
that is varied by changing the voltage across its terminals. This device usually is cov-
ered in detail in a course on electronic devices.
Capacitor Labeling
Capacitor values are indicated on the body of the capacitor either by typographical 
labels or by color codes. Typographical labels consist of letters and numbers that indi-
cate various parameters such as capacitance, voltage rating, and tolerance.
Some capacitors carry no unit designation for capacitance. In these cases, the units 
are implied by the value indicated and are recognized by experience. For example, 
a ceramic capacitor marked .001 or .01 has units of microfarads because picofarad 
values that small are not available. As another example, a ceramic capacitor labeled 
50 or 330 has units of picofarads because microfarad units that large normally are not 
available in this type. In some cases, a 3-digit designation is used. The first two digits 
are the first two digits of the capacitance value. The third digit is the number of zeros 
after the second digit. For example, 103 means 10,000 pF. In some instances, the units 
are labeled as pF or mF; sometimes the microfarad unit is labeled as MF or MFD.
A voltage rating appears on some types of capacitors with WV or WVDC and 
is omitted on others. When it is omitted, the voltage rating can be determined from 
information supplied by the manufacturer. The tolerance of the capacitor is usually 
labeled as a percentage, such as {10,. The temperature coefficient is indicated by 
a parts per million marking. This type of label consists of a P or N followed by a 
number. For example, N750 means a negative temperature coefficient of 750 ppm/°C, 
and P30 means a positive temperature coefficient of 30 ppm/°C. An NP0 designation 
means that the positive and negative coefficients are zero; thus the capacitance does 
not change with temperature. Certain types of capacitors are color coded. Refer to 
Appendix C for additional capacitor labeling and color code information.
Capacitance Measurement
A capacitance meter such as the one shown in Figure 12–17 can be used to check the 
value of a capacitor. Also, many DMMs provide a capacitance measurement feature. 
No matter what meter you use, it is important to discharge the capacitor before at-
tempting to measure its value. Most capacitors change value over a period of time, some

more than others. Ceramic capacitors, for example, often exhibit a 10% to 15% change 
in value during the first year. Electrolytic capacitors are particularly subject to value 
change due to drying of the electrolytic solution. Capacitor aging is a principle reason 
that circuit designers derate capacitors in their designs. In other cases, capacitors may be 
labeled incorrectly or the wrong value may have been installed in the  circuit. Although a 
value change represents less than 25% of defective capacitors, a value check can quickly 
eliminate this as a source of trouble when troubleshooting a circuit.
For the B and K Precision 890C capacitance meter (shown), capacitors up to 
50,000 mF can be measured. Some capacitance meters can also be used to check for 
leakage current in capacitors. In order to check for leakage, a sufficient voltage must 
be applied across the capacitor to simulate operating conditions. This is automati-
cally done by the test instrument. Over 40% of all defective capacitors have excessive 
leakage current and electrolytics are particularly susceptible to this problem.

Total Capacitance
When capacitors are connected in series, the total capacitance is less than the smallest 
capacitance value because the effective plate separation increases. The calculation of 
total series capacitance is analogous to the calculation of total resistance of parallel 
resistors (Chapter 6).
Consider the generalized circuit in Figure 12–18(a), which has n capacitors in series 
with a voltage source and a switch. When the switch is closed, the capacitors charge as

current is established through the circuit. Since this is a series circuit, the current must 
be the same at all points, as illustrated. Since current is the rate of flow of charge, the 
amount of charge stored by each capacitor is equal to the total charge, expressed as
Equation 12–7 
QT = Q1 = Q2 = Q3 = g = Qn
Next, according to Kirchhoff’s voltage law, the sum of the voltages across the 
charged capacitors must equal the total voltage, VT, as shown in Figure 12–18(b). 
This is expressed in equation form as
VT = V1 + V2 + V3 + g + Vn
From Equation 12–3, V = Q/C. When this relationship is substituted into each 
term of the voltage equation, the following result is obtained:
QT

Capacitor Voltages
A series connection of charged capacitors acts as a voltage divider. The voltage across 
each capacitor in series is inversely proportional to its capacitance value, as shown by 
the formula V = Q/C. You can determine the voltage across any individual capacitor 
in series with the following formula:
Equation 12–12 
Vx = aCT
Cx
bVT
where Cx is any capacitor in series (such as C1, C2, or C3), Vx is the voltage across Cx, 
and VT is the total voltage across the capacitors. The derivation is as follows: Since the 
charge on any capacitor in series is the same as the total charge (Qx = QT), and since 
Qx = VxCx and QT = VTCT,
VxCx = VTCT
Solving for Vx yields
Vx = CTVT

The largest-value capacitor in a series connection will have the smallest voltage 
across it. The smallest-value capacitor will have the largest voltage across it.

When capacitors are connected in parallel, the total capacitance is the sum of the 
individual capacitances because the effective plate area increases. The calculation 
of total parallel capacitance is analogous to the calculation of total series resistance 
(Chapter 5).
Consider what happens when the switch in Figure 12–24 is closed. The total charg-
ing current from the source divides at the junction of the parallel branches. There is 
a separate charging current through each branch so that a different charge can be 
stored by each capacitor. By Kirchhoff’s current law, the sum of all of the charging

moves electrons to plate B causing it to have a negative charge. The excess of electrons 
on plate B repels electrons from plate A, leaving it with a net positive charge consisting 
of the positive metal ions. The electrons from plate A return to the source as indicated 
by the arrows. This process is very fast and the voltage across the plates very soon is 
equal to the applied voltage, VS, but opposite in polarity, as shown in part (c). When 
the capacitor is fully charged, there is no current.
A capacitor blocks constant dc.
When the charged capacitor is disconnected from the source, as shown in 
Figure 12–27(d), it remains charged for long periods of time, depending on its  leakage 
resistance, and can cause severe electrical shock. The charge on an electrolytic 
 capacitor generally leaks off more rapidly than in other types of capacitors.
Discharging a Capacitor
When a wire is connected across a charged capacitor, as shown in Figure 12–28, the capac-
itor will discharge. (This is not recommended for large capacitors or high voltages—see  
Safety Note.) In this particular case, a very low resistance path (the wire) is connected 
across the capacitor with a switch. Before the switch is closed, the capacitor is charged to 
35 V, as indicated in part (a). When the switch is closed, as shown in part (b), the excess 
electrons on plate B move through the circuit to plate A and very quickly discharge the 
capacitor. As a result of the electrons moving through the low resistance of the wire, the 
energy stored by the capacitor is dissipated in the wire. At this time, the voltage across 
the capacitor is zero, and the capacitor is completely discharged, as shown in part (c).
Large capacitors used in high 
voltage circuits can store a lethal 
amount of energy long after 
power is removed. Even close 
proximity can cause a painful 
high-voltage arc to result in an 
electric shock. Normally, capaci-
tors are discharged through an 
insulated resistor that is rated 
for the current and power that 
it will dissipate. A shorting wire 
or bar is NOT recommended for 
large capacitors or high voltages 
as it can damage the capacitor. 
Commercially made capacitor dis-
charge tools are available in these 
cases but need to be rated for the 
specific voltage and capacitance.
Current and Voltage During Charging and Discharging
Notice in Figures 12–27 and 12–28 that the direction of electron flow during dis-
charge is opposite to that during charging. It is important to understand that ideally 
there is no current through the dielectric of the capacitor during charging or discharging

because the dielectric is an insulating material. There is current from one plate to the 
other only through the external circuit.
Figure 12–29(a) shows a capacitor connected in series with a resistor and a switch 
to a dc voltage source. Initially, the switch is open and the capacitor is uncharged with 
zero volts across its plates. At the instant the switch is closed, the current jumps to its 
maximum value and the capacitor begins to charge. The current is maximum initially 
because the capacitor has zero volts across it and, therefore, effectively acts as a short. 
From Kirchhoff’s voltage law, the source voltage is across R and the initial current 
is I = VS/R. As time passes and the capacitor charges, the current decreases and the 
voltage across the capacitor (VC) increases. The resistor voltage is proportional to the 
current during this charging period.
After a certain period of time, the capacitor reaches full charge. At this point, the 
current is zero and the capacitor voltage is equal to the dc source voltage, as shown 
in Figure 12–29(b). If the switch were opened now, the capacitor would retain its full 
charge (neglecting any leakage).
In Figure 12–29(c), the voltage source has been removed. When the switch is closed, 
the capacitor begins to discharge. The initial current is maximum and is given by VC/R 
but in a direction opposite to its direction during charging. As time passes, the current 
and capacitor voltage decrease. The resistor voltage is always proportional to the current. 
When the capacitor has fully discharged, the current and the capacitor voltage are zero.
Remember the following rules about capacitors in dc circuits:
1. A capacitor appears as an open to constant voltage.
2. A capacitor appears as a short to an instantaneous change in voltage.
Now let’s examine in more detail how the voltage and current change with time in

The RC Time Constant
In a practical situation, there cannot be capacitance without some resistance in a 
 circuit. It may simply be the small resistance of a wire, a Thevenin source resistance, or 
it may be a physical resistor. Because of this, the charging and discharging character-
istics of a capacitor must always be considered with the associated resistance. The re-
sistance introduces the element of time in the charging and discharging of a capacitor.
When a capacitor charges or discharges through a resistance, a certain time is re-
quired for the capacitor to charge fully or discharge fully. The voltage across a capaci-
tor cannot change instantaneously because a finite time is required to move charge 
from one point to another. The time constant of a series RC circuit determines the 
rate at which the capacitor charges or discharges.
The RC time constant is a fixed time interval that equals the product of the resis-
tance and the capacitance in a series RC circuit.
The time constant is expressed in seconds when resistance is in ohms and capaci-
tance is in farads. It is symbolized by t (Greek letter tau), and the formula is
Equation 12–16 
t = RC
Recall that I = Q/t. The current depends on the amount of charge moved in a given 
time. When the resistance is increased, the charging current is reduced, thus increasing the 
charging time of the capacitor. When the capacitance is increased, the amount of charge 
increases; thus, for the same current, more time is required to charge the capacitor.
It is useful to show that the unit for resistance multiplied by the unit for capaci-
tance produces the unit for time. This is a common check to verify that an equation is 
consistent called dimensional analysis. (It does not prove that an equation is correct, 
but it can indicate a problem.) By Ohm’s law, R = V

 , so the unit for resistance can 
be written as

When a capacitor is charging or discharging between two voltage levels, the charge 
on the capacitor changes by approximately 63% of the difference in the levels in one 
time constant. An uncharged capacitor charges to 63% of its fully charged voltage in 
one time constant. When a capacitor is discharging, its voltage drops to approximately 
100, - 63, = 37, of its initial value in one time constant, which is a 63% change.
The Charging and Discharging Curves
A capacitor charges and discharges following a nonlinear curve, as shown in Figure 12–30. 
In these graphs, the approximate percentage of full charge is shown at each time- 
constant interval. This type of curve follows a precise mathematical formula and is 

Capacitors in DC Circuits  ●  525
called an exponential curve. The charging curve is an increasing exponential, and the 
discharging curve is a decreasing exponential. It takes five time constants to change the 
voltage by 99% (considered 100%). This five time-constant interval is generally accepted 
as the time to fully charge or discharge a capacitor and is called the transient time.
General Formula The general expressions for either increasing or decreasing expo-
nential curves are given in the following equations for both instantaneous voltage and 
instantaneous current.
 
 v = VF + (Vi - VF)e-t/t  
Equation 12–17
 
 i = IF + (Ii - IF)e-t/t  
Equation 12–18
where VF and IF are the final values of voltage and current, and Vi and Ii are the initial 
values of voltage and current. The lowercase italic letters v and i are the instantaneous 
values of the capacitor voltage and current at time t, and e is the base of natural loga-
rithms. The ex key on a calculator makes it easy to work with this exponential term.
Charging from Zero The formula for the special case in which an increasing expo-
nential voltage curve begins at zero (Vi = 0), as shown in Figure 12–30(a), is given 
in Equation 12–19. It is developed as follows, starting with the general formula, 
Equation 12–17.
v = VF + (Vi - VF)e-t/t = VF + (0 - VF)e-t/RC = VF - VFe-t/RC
Factoring out VF, you have
 
v = VF (1 - e-t/RC)  
Equation 12–19
Using Equation 12–19, you can calculate the value of the charging voltage of a capac-
itor at any instant of time if it is initially uncharged. You can calculate an increasing 
current by substituting i for v and IF for VF in Equation 12–19.
Graph the general formula exponential charging curve for an RC circuit using the 
TI-84 graphing calculator.
 
Solution 
In Equation 12–19, the dependent variable is v (instantaneous voltage) and the 
 independent variable is t (time). On the calculator, y will represent v and x will 
 represent t. Let VF = 100 V; it can then represent 100% in reading the graph. 
Let RC = 1, so that the time axis will represent t.
Press y=  and enter the equation. Since RC = 1, it is not necessary to enter it as 
you are dividing by 1. Figure 12–31 shows the screen after entering the equation:

In Figure 12–34, determine the capacitor voltage 50 ms after the switch is closed if 
the capacitor is initially uncharged. Draw the charging curve.
EXAMPLE 12–13
 
Solution 
The time constant is RC = (8.2 kΩ)(0.01 mF) = 82 ms. The voltage to which the 
capacitor will fully charge is 50 V (this is VF). The initial voltage is zero. Notice 
that 50 ms is less than one time constant; so the capacitor will charge less than 
63% of the full voltage in that time.
 vC = VF(1 - e -t/RC) = (50 V)(1 - e -50 ms/82 ms)
 = (50 V)(1 - e - 0.61) = (50 V)(1 - 0.543) = 22.8 V

Discharging to Zero The formula for the special case in which a decreasing expo-
nential voltage curve ends at zero (VF = 0), as shown in Figure 12–30(b), is derived 
from the general formula as follows:
v = VF + (Vi - VF)e -t/t = 0 + (Vi - 0)e -t/RC
This reduces to
Equation 12–20 
v = Vie -t/RC
where Vi is the voltage at the beginning of the discharge. You can use this formula to 
calculate the discharging voltage at any instant, as Example 12–14 illustrates.
Determine the capacitor voltage in Figure 12–37 at a point in time 6 ms after the 
switch is closed. Draw the discharging curve.
EXAMPLE 12–14
 
Solution 
The discharge time constant is RC = (10 kΩ)(2.2 mF) = 22 ms. The initial capaci-
tor voltage is 10 V. Notice that 6 ms is less than one time constant, so the capacitor 
will discharge less than 63%. Therefore, it will have a voltage greater than 37% of 
the initial voltage at 6 ms.
vC = Vie -t/RC = (10 V)e -6 ms/22 ms = (10 V)e -0.27 = (10 V)(0.761) = 7.61 V
The discharging curve for the capacitor is shown in Figure 12–38.

How long will it take the initially uncharged capacitor in Figure 12–40 to charge 
to 75 V? What is the capacitor voltage 2 ms after the switch is closed? Use the nor-
malized universal exponential curves in Figure 12–39 to determine the answers.
EXAMPLE 12–15
 
Solution 
The full charge voltage is 100 V, which is at the 100% level (1.0) on the normal-
ized vertical scale of the graph. The value 75 V is 75% of maximum, or 0.75 on the 
graph. You can see that this value occurs at 1.4 time constants. In this circuit, one 
time  constant is RC = (100 kΩ)(0.01 mF) = 1 ms. Therefore, the capacitor voltage 
reaches 75 V at 1.4 ms after the switch is closed.
On the universal exponential curve, you see that the capacitor is at approxi-
mately 87 V (0.87 on the vertical axis) in 2 ms, which is 2 time constants. These 
graphic solutions are shown in Figure 12–41.

Solving for Time
Occasionally, it is necessary to determine how long it will take a capacitor to charge 
or discharge to a specified voltage. Equations 12–17 and 12–19 can be solved for t if 
v is specified. The natural logarithm (abbreviated ln) of e-t/RC is the exponent –t/RC. 
Therefore, taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation allows you to 
solve for time. This procedure is done as follows for the decreasing exponential for-
mula when VF = 0 (Equation 12–20).

Response to a Square Wave
A common case that illustrates the rising and falling exponential occurs when an 
RC circuit is driven with a square wave that has a long period compared to the time 
constant. The square wave provides on and off action but, unlike a single switch, 
it provides a discharge path back through the generator when the wave drops back 
to zero.
When the square wave rises, the voltage across the capacitor rises exponentially 
toward the maximum value of the square wave in a time that depends on the time 
constant. When the square wave returns to the zero level, the capacitor voltage de-
creases exponentially, again depending on the time constant. The Thevenin resis-
tance of the generator is part of the RC time constant; however, it can be ignored if 
it is small compared to R. Example 12–17 shows the waveforms for the case where 
the period is long compared to the time constant; other cases will be covered in detail 
in Chapter 20.
In Figure 12–42, how long will it take the capacitor to discharge to 25 V when the 
switch is closed?

In Figure 12–43, calculate the voltage across the capacitor every 0.1 ms for one 
complete period of the input. Then sketch the capacitor waveform. Assume the 
Thevenin resistance of the generator is negligible.
EXAMPLE 12–17
 
Solution 
t = RC = (15 kΩ)(0.0056 mF) = 0.084 ms
 
 
The period of the square wave is 1 ms, which is approximately 12t. This means that 
6t will elapse after each change of the pulse, allowing the capacitor to fully charge 
and fully discharge.
For the increasing exponential,
v = VF (1 - e-t/RC) = VF (1 - e-t/t)
At 0.1 ms: v = 2.5 V(1 - e-0.1 ms/0.084 ms) = 1.74 V
At 0.2 ms: v = 2.5 V(1 - e-0.2 ms/0.084 ms) = 2.27 V
At 0.3 ms: v = 2.5 V(1 - e-0.3 ms/0.084 ms) = 2.43 V
At 0.4 ms: v = 2.5 V(1 - e-0.4 ms/0.084 ms) = 2.48 V
At 0.5 ms: v = 2.5 V(1 - e-0.5 ms/0.084 ms) = 2.49 V
For the decreasing exponential,
v = Vi (e-t/RC) = Vi (e-t/t)
In the equation, time is shown from the point when the change occurs (subtracting  
0.5 ms from the actual time). For example, at 0.6 ms, t = 0.6 ms - 0.5 ms = 0.1 ms.
At 0.6 ms: v = 2.5 V(e-0.1 ms/0.084 ms) = 0.760 V
At 0.7 ms: v = 2.5 V(e-0.2 ms/0.084 ms) = 0.231 V
At 0.8 ms: v = 2.5 V(e-0.3 ms/0.084 ms) = 0.070 V
At 0.9 ms: v = 2.5 V(e-0.4 ms/0.084 ms) = 0.021 V
At 1.0 ms: v = 2.5 V(e-0.5 ms/0.084 ms) = 0.007 V

Capacitors in AC Circuits  ●  533
To explain fully how capacitors work in ac circuits, the concept of the derivative 
must be introduced. The derivative of a time-varying quantity is the instantaneous rate 
of change of that quantity.
Recall that current is the rate of flow of charge (electrons). Therefore, instanta-
neous current, i, can be expressed as the instantaneous rate of change of charge, q, 
with respect to time, t.

The term dq/dt is the derivative of q with respect to time and represents the instan-
taneous rate of change of q. Also, in terms of instantaneous quantities, q = Cv. 
Therefore, from a basic rule of differential calculus, the derivative of q with respect to 
time is dq/dt = C(dv/dt). Since i = dq/dt, we get the following relationship:
 
i = C adv

The instantaneous capacitor current is equal to the capacitance times the instanta-
neous rate of change of the voltage across the capacitor.
The faster the voltage across a capacitor changes, the greater the current.
Phase Relationship of Current and Voltage in a Capacitor
Consider what happens when a sinusoidal voltage is applied across a capacitor, as 
shown in Figure 12–45(a). The voltage waveform has a maximum rate of change 
(dv/dt = max) at the zero crossings and a zero rate of change (dv/dt = 0) at the peaks, 
as indicated in Figure 12–45(b).

Phase relation of VC and IC in a capacitor. Current always leads the capacitor voltage by 90°.
The phase relationship between the current and the voltage occurs when the capac-
itor can be established from Equation 12–24. When dv/dt = 0, i is also zero because 
i = C(dv/dt) = C(0) = 0. When dv/dt is a positive-going maximum, i is a positive 
maximum; when dv/dt is a negative-going maximum, i is a negative maximum.
When a sinusoidal voltage is applied to a capacitor, the voltage across the capaci-
tor can be expressed mathematically as v(t) = Vp(sin 2pft). The voltage curve has the 
same shape as the mathematical sine curve as shown in Figure 12–46(a). The rate of 
change of the sine function is the cosine function, which leads the sine function by 90°. 
Because the current is the rate of change of voltage, current in an ideal capacitor leads 
voltage by 90° as shown in Figure 12–46(b).
Capacitive Reactance, XC
Capacitive reactance is the opposition to sinusoidal current, expressed in ohms. The 
symbol for capacitive reactance is XC.
To develop a formula for XC, we use the relationship i = C(dv/dt) and the curves 
in Figure 12–47. The rate of change of voltage is directly related to frequency. The 
faster the voltage changes, the higher the frequency. For example, you can see that 
in Figure 12–47 the slope of sine wave A at the zero crossings is steeper than that of  

Capacitors in AC Circuits  ●  535
sine wave B. The slope of a curve at a point indicates the rate of change at that point. 
Sine wave A has a higher frequency than sine wave B, as indicated by a greater maxi-
mum rate of change (dv/dt is greater at the zero crossings).
When frequency increases, dv/dt increases, and thus i increases. When frequency 
decreases, dv/dt decreases, and thus i decreases.
c      c
i = C(dv/dt) and i = C(dv/dt)
T     T
An increase in i means that there is less opposition to current (XC is less), and a 
decrease in i means a greater opposition to current (XC is greater). Therefore, XC is 
inversely proportional to i and thus inversely proportional to frequency.
XC is inversely proportional to f, shown as 1
f .
From the same relationship i = C(dv/dt), you can see that if dv/dt is constant and 
C is varied, an increase in C produces an increase in i, and a decrease in C produces 
a decrease in i.
c      c
i = C(dv/dt) and i = C(dv/dt)
T   T
Again, an increase in i means less opposition (XC is less), and a decrease in i means 
greater opposition (XC is greater). Therefore, XC is inversely proportional to i and 
thus inversely proportional to capacitance.
The capacitive reactance is inversely proportional to both f and C.
XC is inversely proportional to fC, shown as 1
fC .
Thus far, we have determined a proportional relationship between XC and 1/fC. 
Equation 12–25 is the complete formula for calculating XC. The derivation is given in

Reactance for Series Capacitors
When capacitors are in series in an ac circuit, the total capacitance is smaller than 
the smallest individual capacitance. Because the total capacitance is smaller, the total 
capacitive reactance (opposition to current) must be larger than any individual capaci-
tive reactance. With series capacitors, the total capacitive reactance (XC(tot)) is the sum 
of the individual reactances.
Equation 12–26 
XC(tot) = XC1 + XC2 + XC3 + . . . + XCn
Compare this formula with Equation 5–1 for finding the total resistance of series 
 resistors. In both cases, you simply add the individual oppositions.
Reactance for Parallel Capacitors
In ac circuits with parallel capacitors, the total capacitance is the sum of the capaci-
tances. Recall that the capacitive reactance is inversely proportional to the capacitance. 
Because the total parallel capacitance is larger than any individual capacitances, the total 
capacitive reactance must be smaller than the reactance of any individual  capacitor. 
With parallel capacitors, the total reactance is found by

XC(tot) =

Compare this formula with Equation 6–2 for parallel resistors. As in the case of paral-
lel resistors, the total opposition (resistance or reactance) is the reciprocal of the sum 
of the reciprocals of the individual oppositions.
For two capacitors in parallel, Equation 12–27 can be reduced to the product-
over-sum form. This is useful because, for most practical circuits, more than two ca-
pacitors in parallel is not common.

XC(tot) = XC1 + XC2 = 3.18 kΩ+ 468 Ω= 3.65 k𝛀
Alternatively, you can obtain the total series reactance by first finding the total 
capacitance using Equation 12–10. Then calculate the total reactance.

Capacitive Voltage Divider
In ac circuits, capacitors can be used in applications that require a voltage divider. (Some 
oscillator circuits use this method to tap off a fraction of the output.) The voltage across 
a series capacitor was given as Equation 12–12, which is repeated here (VT = Vs).

A resistive voltage divider is expressed in terms of a resistance ratio, which is a 
ratio of oppositions. You can think of the capacitive voltage divider by applying this 
idea from a resistive divider, but using reactance in place of resistance. The equation 
for the voltage across a capacitor in a capacitive voltage divider can be written as
Equation 12–28 
Vx = a XCx

where XCx is the reactance of capacitor Cx, XC(tot) is the total capacitive reactance, 
and Vx is the voltage across capacitor Cx. Either Equation 12–12 or Equation 12–28

Power in a Capacitor
As discussed earlier in this chapter, a charged capacitor stores energy in the electric field 
within the dielectric. An ideal capacitor does not dissipate energy; it only stores it tem-
porarily. When an ac voltage is applied to a capacitor, energy is stored by the capacitor 
during a portion of the voltage cycle; then the stored energy is returned to the source 
during another portion of the cycle. Ideally, there is no net energy loss. Figure 12–53 
shows the power curve that results from one cycle of capacitor voltage and current.
Instantaneous Power (p) The product of v and i gives instantaneous power. At 
points where v or i is zero, p is also zero. When both v and i are positive, p is also 
positive. When either v or i is positive and the other is negative, p is negative. When 
both v and i are negative, p is positive. As you can see, the power follows a sinusoidal-
shaped curve. Positive values of power indicate that energy is stored by the capacitor. 
Negative values of power indicate that energy is returned from the capacitor to the 
source. Note that the power alternates at a frequency twice that of the voltage or cur-
rent as energy is alternately stored and returned to the source.
True Power (Ptrue) Ideally, all of the energy stored by a capacitor during the posi-
tive portion of the power cycle is returned to the source during the negative portion. 
No net energy is lost due to conversion to heat in the capacitor, so the true power is 
zero. Actually, because of leakage and foil resistance in a practical capacitor, a small 
percentage of the total power is dissipated in the form of true power.

Reactive Power (Pr ) The rate at which a capacitor stores or returns energy is called 
its reactive power. The reactive power is a nonzero quantity, because at any instant in 
time, the capacitor is actually taking energy from the source or returning energy to it.  
Reactive power does not represent an energy loss. The following formulas apply:

Capacitor Applications  ●  541
If you pick up any circuit board, open any power supply, or look inside any piece 
of electronic equipment, chances are you will find capacitors of one type or another. 
These components are used for a variety of reasons in both dc and ac applications.
Electrical Storage
One of the most basic applications of a capacitor is as a backup voltage source for low-
power circuits such as certain types of semiconductor memories in computers. This 
particular application requires a very high capacitance value and negligible leakage.
The storage capacitor is connected between the dc power supply input to the cir-
cuit and ground. When the circuit is operating from its normal power supply, the 
capacitor remains fully charged to the dc power supply voltage. If the normal power 
source is disrupted, effectively removing the power supply from the circuit, the stor-
age capacitor temporarily becomes the power source for the circuit.
A capacitor provides voltage and current to a circuit as long as its charge remains 
sufficient. As current is drawn by the circuit, charge is removed from the capacitor 
and the voltage decreases. For this reason, the storage capacitor can only be used as 
a temporary power source. The length of time that a capacitor can provide sufficient 
power to the circuit depends on the capacitance and the amount of current drawn by 
the circuit. The smaller the current and the higher the capacitance, the longer the time 
a capacitor can provide power to a circuit.
Power Supply Filtering
A basic dc power supply consists of a circuit known as a rectifier followed by a filter. The 
rectifier converts the 120 V, 60 Hz sinusoidal voltage available at a standard outlet to a 
pulsating dc voltage that can be either a half-wave rectified voltage or a full-wave recti-
fied voltage, depending on the type of rectifier circuit. As shown in Figure 12–56(a), a 
half-wave rectifier removes each negative half-cycle of the sinusoidal voltage. As shown 
in Figure 12–56(b), a full-wave rectifier actually reverses the polarity of the negative por-
tion of each cycle. Both half-wave and full-wave rectified voltages are dc because, even 
though they are changing, they do not alternate polarity.
To be useful for powering electronic circuits, the rectified voltage must be changed to 
constant dc voltage because all circuits require constant power. The filter nearly elimi-
nates the fluctuations in the rectified voltage and ideally provides a smooth constant-
value dc voltage to the load that is the electronic circuit, as indicated in Figure 12–57.
The Capacitor as a Power Supply Filter Capacitors are used as filters in dc power 
supplies because of their ability to store electrical charge. Figure 12–58(a) shows a 
dc power supply with a full-wave rectifier and a capacitor filter. The operation can 
be described from a charging and discharging point of view as follows. Assume the 
capacitor is initially uncharged. When the power supply is first turned on and the first

Capacitor Applications  ●  543
cycle of the rectified voltage occurs, the capacitor will quickly charge through the low 
forward resistance of the rectifier. The capacitor voltage will follow the rectified volt-
age curve up to the peak of the rectified voltage. As the rectified voltage passes the 
peak and begins to decrease, the capacitor will begin to discharge very slowly through 
the high resistance of the load circuit, as indicated in Figure 12–58(b). The amount 
of discharge is typically very small and is exaggerated in the figure for purposes of 
illustration. The next cycle of the rectified voltage will recharge the capacitor back 
to the peak value by replenishing the small amount of charge lost since the previous 
peak. This pattern of a small amount of charging and discharging continues as long 
as the power is on.
A rectifier is designed so that it allows current only in the direction to charge the 
capacitor. The capacitor will not discharge back through the rectifier but will only 
discharge a small amount through the relatively high resistance of the load. The small 
fluctuation in voltage due to the charging and discharging of the capacitor is called 
the ripple voltage. A good dc power supply has a very small amount of ripple on its 
dc output. The discharge time constant of a power supply filter capacitor depends on 
its capacitance and the resistance of the load; consequently, the higher the capacitance 
value, the longer the discharge time and therefore, the smaller the ripple voltage.
DC Blocking and AC Coupling
Capacitors are commonly used to block the constant dc voltage in one part of a cir-
cuit from getting to another part. As an example of this, a capacitor is connected 
between two stages of an amplifier to prevent the dc voltage at the output of stage 1  
from affecting the dc voltage at the input of stage 2, as illustrated in Figure 12–59. 
Assume that, for proper operation, the output of stage 1 has a zero dc voltage and the 
input to stage 2 has a 3 V dc voltage. The capacitor prevents the 3 V dc at stage 2 from 
getting to the stage 1 output and affecting its zero value, and vice versa.

◀FIGURE 12–59
An application of a capacitor 
to block dc and couple ac in an 
amplifier.
If a sinusoidal signal voltage is applied to the input to stage 1, the signal voltage is 
increased (amplified) and appears on the output of stage 1, as shown in Figure 12–59. 
The amplified signal voltage is then coupled through the capacitor to the input of stage 2  
where it is superimposed on the 3 V dc level and then again amplified by stage 2. In 
order for the signal voltage to be passed through the capacitor without being reduced, 
the capacitor must be large enough so that its reactance at the frequency of the signal 
voltage is negligible. In this type of application, the capacitor is known as a coupling 

544  ●  Capacitors
capacitor, which ideally appears as an open to dc and as a short to ac. As the signal fre-
quency is reduced, the capacitive reactance increases and, at some point, the capacitive 
reactance becomes large enough to cause a significant reduction in ac voltage between 
stage 1 and stage 2.
Power Line Decoupling
Capacitors connected from the dc supply voltage line to ground are used on circuit boards 
to decouple unwanted voltage transients or spikes that occur on the dc supply voltage be-
cause of fast switching digital circuits. A voltage transient contains high frequencies that 
may affect the operation of the circuits. These transients are shorted to ground through 
the very low reactance of the decoupling capacitors. Several decoupling capacitors are 
often used at various points along the supply voltage line on a circuit board.
Bypassing
Another capacitor application is to bypass an ac voltage around a resistor in a circuit 
without affecting the dc voltage across the resistor. In amplifier circuits, for example, 
dc voltages called bias voltages are required at various points. For the amplifier to oper-
ate properly, certain bias voltages must remain constant and, therefore, any ac voltages 
must be removed. A sufficiently large capacitor connected from a bias point to ground 
provides a low reactance path to ground for ac voltages, leaving the constant dc bias volt-
age at the given point. At lower frequencies, the bypass capacitor becomes less effective 
because of its increased reactance. This bypass application is illustrated in Figure 12–60.

Signal Filters
Capacitors are essential to the operation of a class of circuits called filters that are used 
for selecting one ac signal with a certain specified frequency from a wide range of sig-
nals with many different frequencies or for selecting a certain band of frequencies and 
eliminating all others. A common example of this application is in radio and television 
receivers where it is necessary to select the signal transmitted from a given station and 
eliminate or filter out the signals transmitted from all the other stations in the area.

Switched-Capacitor Circuits  ●  545
When you tune your radio or TV, you are actually changing the capacitance in the 
tuner circuit (which is a type of filter) so that only the signal from the station or chan-
nel you want passes through to the receiver circuitry. Capacitors are used in conjunc-
tion with resistors, inductors (covered in the next chapter), and other components in 
these types of filters. The topic of filters will be covered in Chapter 18.
The main characteristic of a filter is its frequency selectivity, which is based on the 
fact that the reactance of a capacitor depends on frequency (XC = 1/2pfC).
Timing Circuits
Another important area in which capacitors are used is in timing circuits that gener-
ate specified time delays or produce waveforms with specific characteristics. Recall 
that the time constant of a circuit with resistance and capacitance can be controlled 
by selecting appropriate values for R and C. The charging time of a capacitor can be 
used as a basic time delay in various types of circuits; however, capacitors tend to have 
more tolerance variation than other components, so RC timing circuits are not used 
when timing is critical. An example application is the circuit that controls the turn 
indicators on your car where the light flashes on and off at regular intervals.
Computer Memories
Dynamic memories in computers use very tiny capacitors as the basic storage ele-
ment for binary information, which consists of two binary digits, 1 and 0. A charged 
capacitor can represent a stored 1 and a discharged capacitor can represent a stored 0. 
Patterns of 1s and 0s that make up binary data are stored in a memory that consists 
of an array of capacitors with associated circuitry. You will study this topic in a com-
puter or digital fundamentals course.

switched-caPacitor circuits
Another important application of capacitors is in programmable analog arrays,  
which are implemented in integrated circuit (IC) form. Switched capacitors are used 
to implement various types of programmable analog circuits in which capacitors take 
the place of resistors. Example applications include analog to digital converters and 
analog memory arrays. Capacitors can be implemented on an IC chip more easily than 
a resistor can, and they offer other advantages such as zero power dissipation. When 
a resistance is required in a circuit, the switched capacitor can be made to emulate a 
resistor. Using switched-capacitor emulation, resistor values can be readily changed  
by reprogramming and accurate and stable resistance values can be achieved.

Basic Operation
A general model of a switched-capacitor circuit is shown in Figure 12–61. It consists 
of a capacitor, two arbitrary voltage sources (V1 and V2), and a two-pole switch. In 
actual circuits, the switch is implemented with transistors. Let’s examine this circuit 
for a specified period of time, T, which is then repeated. Assume that V1 and V2 are 
constant during the time period T. Of particular interest is the average current I1 from 
the source V1 during the period of time, T.

Basic operation of a switched-capacitor circuit. The voltage source symbol represents a time-varying 
symbol.
During the first half of the time period T, the switch is in position 1, as indicated in 
Figure 12–61. Therefore, there is a current I1 due to V1 that is charging the capacitor 
during the interval from t = 0 to t = T/2. During the second half of the time period, 
the switch is in position 2, as indicated, and there is no current from V1; therefore, the 
average current from the source V1 over the time period T is
I1(avg) =
Q1(T/2) - Q1(0)
T
Q1(0) is the charge at t = 0 and Q1(T/2) is the charge at t = T/2. So, Q1(T/2) - Q1(0) is 
the net charge transferred while the switch is in position 1.
The capacitor voltage at T/2 is equal to V1, and the capacitor voltage at 0 or T is 
equal to V2. Using the formula Q = CV and substituting into the previous equation, 
you obtain
I1(avg) =
CV1(T/2) - CV2(0)
T

C(V1(T/2) - V2(0))

Since V1 and V2 are assumed to be constant during T, the average current can be ex-

This important result shows that a switched-capacitor circuit can emulate a resistor with

quency at which the switches are operated. In a programmable analog device, the switch-
ing frequency is a programmable parameter for each emulated resistor and can be set to 
achieve a precise resistor value. Since T = 1>f, the resistance in terms of frequency is

which the capacitor must be switched.

548  ●  Capacitors
Capacitors are used in certain 
types of amplifiers to couple the 
ac signal while blocking the dc voltage. Capacitors are used in 
many other applications, but in this application, you will focus 
on the coupling capacitors in an amplifier circuit. This topic was 
introduced in Section 12–7. A knowledge of amplifier circuits is 
not necessary for this assignment.
All amplifier circuits contain transistors that require dc 
 voltages to establish proper operating conditions for amplifying  
ac signals. These dc voltages are referred to as bias voltages. As 
indicated in Figure 12–63(a), a common type of dc bias circuit 
used in amplifiers is the voltage divider formed by R1 and R2, 
which sets up the proper dc voltage at the input to the amplifier.
When an ac signal voltage is applied to the amplifier, the 
input coupling capacitor, C1, prevents the internal resistance of 
the ac source from changing the dc bias voltage. Without the 
capacitor, the internal source resistance would appear in paral-
lel with R2 and drastically change the value of the dc voltage.
The coupling capacitance is chosen so that its reactance 
(XC) at the frequency of the ac signal is very small compared 
to the bias resistor values. The coupling capacitance therefore 
efficiently couples the ac signal from the source to the input 
of the  amplifier. On the source side of the input coupling 
 capacitor there is only ac but on the amplifier side there is 
ac plus dc (the signal voltage is riding on the dc bias voltage 
set by the voltage divider), as indicated in Figure 12–63(a). 
Capacitor C2 is the  output coupling capacitor, which couples

the amplified ac signal to another amplifier stage that would 
be connected to the output.
You will check three amplifier boards like the one in 
Figure 12–63(b) for the proper input voltages using an oscil-
loscope. If the voltages are incorrect, you will determine the 
most likely fault. For all measurements, assume the amplifier 
has no dc loading effect on the voltage-divider bias circuit.

SUMMARY
●◆A capacitor is composed of two parallel conducting plates separated by an insulating mate-
rial called the dielectric.
◆
●A capacitor stores energy in the electric field between the plates.
◆
●One farad is the amount of capacitance when one coulomb of charge is stored with one volt 
across the plates.
◆
●Capacitance is directly proportional to the plate area and inversely proportional to the plate 
separation.
◆
●The dielectric constant is an indication of the ability of a material to establish an electric field.
◆
●The dielectric strength is one factor that determines the breakdown voltage of a capacitor.
◆
●A capacitor blocks constant dc.
◆
●The time constant for a series RC circuit is the resistance times the capacitance.
◆
●In an RC circuit, the voltage and current in a charging or discharging capacitor make a 63% 
change during each time-constant interval.
◆
●Five time constants are required for a capacitor to charge fully or to discharge fully. This is 
called the transient time.
◆
●Charging and discharging follow exponential curves.
◆
●Total series capacitance is less than that of the smallest capacitor in series.
◆
●Capacitance adds in parallel.
◆
●Current leads voltage by 90° in a capacitor.
◆
●Capacitive reactance, XC, is inversely proportional to frequency and capacitance.
◆
●The total capacitive reactance of series capacitors is the sum of the individual reactances.
◆
●The total capacitive reactance of parallel capacitors is the reciprocal of the sum of the recip-
rocals of the individual reactances.
◆
●The true power in an ideal capacitor is zero; that is, no energy is lost in an ideal capacitor due 
to conversion to heat.
◆
●A switched capacitor circuit is used in certain integrated circuits to emulate a resistor.

INTRODUCTION
You have learned about the resistor and the capacitor. In this 
chapter, you will learn about a third type of basic  passive 
component, the inductor, and study its characteristics.
The basic construction and electrical properties of induc-
tors are discussed, and the effects of connecting them in 
series and in parallel are analyzed. How an inductor works in 
both dc and ac circuits is an important part of this coverage 
and forms the basis for the study of reactive circuits in terms 
of both frequency response and time response. You will also 
learn how to check for a faulty inductor.
The inductor, which is basically a coil of wire, is based 
on the principle of electromagnetic induction, which you 
studied in Chapter 10. Inductance is the property of a coil 
of wire that opposes a change in current. The basis for 
 inductance is the electromagnetic field that surrounds any 
 conductor when there is current through it. The electrical 
component designed to have the property of inductance 
is called an inductor, coil, or in certain high-frequency 
 applications a choke. All of these terms refer to the same 
type of device.

564  ●  Inductors
When a length of wire is formed into a coil, as shown in Figure 13–1, it becomes an 
inductor. The terms coil and inductor are used interchangeably. Current through the 
coil produces an electromagnetic field, as illustrated. The magnetic lines of force around 
each loop (turn) in the winding of the coil effectively add to the lines of force around the 
adjoining loops, forming a strong electromagnetic field within and around the coil. The 
net direction of the total electromagnetic field creates a north and a south pole.
To understand the formation of the total electromagnetic field in a coil, consider 
the interaction of the electromagnetic fields around two adjacent loops. The magnetic 
lines of force around adjacent loops are each deflected into a single outer path when 
the loops are brought close together. This effect occurs because the magnetic lines of 
force are in opposing directions between adjacent loops and therefore cancel out when 
the loops are close together, as illustrated in Figure 13–2. The total electromagnetic 
field for the two loops is depicted in part (b). This effect is additive for many closely 
Henry began his career as a 
 professor at a small school in 
Albany, NY, and later  became the 
first director of the  Smithsonian 
 Institution. He was the first 
 American since Franklin to 
 undertake original scientific 
 experiments. He was the first to 
 superimpose coils of wire wrapped 
on an iron core and first observed 
the effects of electromagnetic 
 induction in 1830, a year before 
Faraday, but he did not publish his 
findings. Henry did obtain credit 
for the discovery of self-induction, 
however. The unit of inductance 
is named in his honor. (Photo

adjacent loops in a coil; that is, each additional loop adds to the strength of the elec-
tromagnetic field. For simplicity, only single lines of force are shown, although there 
are many. Figure 13–3 shows a schematic symbol for an inductor.
Inductance
When there is current through an inductor, an electromagnetic field is established. 
When the current changes, the electromagnetic field also changes. An increase in cur-
rent expands the electromagnetic field, and a decrease in current reduces it. Therefore, 
a changing current produces a changing electromagnetic field around the inductor. In 
turn, the changing electromagnetic field causes an induced voltage across the coil in a 
direction to oppose the change in current. This property is called self-inductance but is 
usually referred to as simply inductance, symbolized by L.
Inductance is a measure of a coil’s ability to establish an induced voltage as a result 
of a change in its current, and that induced voltage is in a direction to oppose the 
change in current.
The inductance (L) of a coil and the time rate of change of the current (di>dt ) deter-
mine the induced voltage (v ind). A change in current causes a change in the electromag-
netic field, which, in turn, induces a voltage across the coil, as you know. The induced 
voltage is directly proportional to L and di>dt, as stated by the following formula:
L
▲
▲FIGURE 13–3
Symbol for inductor.
 
v ind = L adi
dt b 
Equation 13–1
This formula indicates that the greater the inductance, the greater the induced voltage. 
Also, it shows that the faster the coil current changes (greater di>dt), the greater the in-
duced voltage. Notice the similarity of Equation 13–1 to Equation 12–24: i = C (dv/dt).
The Unit of Inductance The henry (H) is the basic unit of inductance. By  definition, 
the inductance of a coil is one henry when current through the coil, changing at 
the rate of one ampere per second, induces one volt across the coil. The henry is a 
large unit, so in practical applications, millihenries (mH) and microhenries (mH) are 
the more common units.
Determine the induced voltage across a 1 henry (1 H) inductor when the current is 
changing at a rate of 2 A/s.
 
Solution 
v ind = L adi
dt b = (1 H)(2 A/s) = 2 V
 
Related Problem* 
Determine the inductance when a current changing at a rate of 40 mA/ms causes 
1.0 V to be induced.

*Answers are at the end of the chapter.
Energy Storage An inductor stores energy in the electromagnetic field created by 
the current. The energy stored is expressed as follows:
 
W = 1
2LI 2 
Equation 13–2
As you can see, the energy stored is proportional to the inductance and the square of 
the current. When current (I) is in amperes and inductance (L) is in henries, energy 
(W) is in joules.

566  ●  Inductors
Physical Characteristics of an Inductor
The following parameters are important in establishing the inductance of a coil: per-
meability of the core material, number of turns of wire, core length, and  cross-sectional 
area of the core.
Core Material An inductor is basically a coil of wire that surrounds a magnetic 
or nonmagnetic material called the core. Examples of magnetic materials are iron, 
nickel, steel, cobalt, or alloys. These materials have permeabilities that are hun-
dreds or thousands of times greater than that of a vacuum and are classified as 
 ferromagnetic. Ferrites (introduced in Section 10–2) are one of the most common 
types of ferromagnetic core materials used with inductors. They concentrate the 
magnetic field lines, which permits a stronger magnetic field and larger inductance. 
Examples of nonmagnetic materials are air, cardboard, plastic, and glass. The per-
meabilities of these  materials are the same as for a vacuum so they are classed with 
air-core inductors. These cores have no effect on the inductance but are used as a 
structure to wind the coils on and provide mechanical support. Some inductors do 
not have a core and are true air-core inductors.
As you learned in Chapter 10, the permeability ( m) of the core material determines 
how easily a magnetic field can be established, and is measured in Wb/At # m, which 
is the same as H/m. The inductance is directly proportional to the permeability of the 
core material.
Physical Parameters As indicated in Figure 13–4, the number of turns of wire, 
the length, and the cross-sectional area of the core are factors in setting the value 
of  inductance. The inductance is inversely proportional to the length of the core 
and  directly proportional to the cross-sectional area. Also, the inductance is directly 
 related to the number of turns squared. This relationship is as follows:
Equation 13–3 
L = N2mA
l
where L is the inductance in henries (H), N is the number of turns of wire, m is the per-
meability in henries per meter (H/m), A is the cross-sectional area in meters squared, 
and l is the core length in meters (m).
Determine the inductance of the coil in Figure 13–5. The permeability of the core 
is 0.25 * 10-3 H/m.

The Basic Inductor  ●  567
Winding Resistance
When a coil is made of a certain material, for example, insulated copper wire, that 
wire has a certain resistance per unit of length. When many turns of wire are used 
to construct a coil, the total resistance may be significant. This inherent resistance is 
called the dc resistance or the winding resistance (RW).
Although this resistance is distributed along the length of the wire, it effectively 
appears in series with the inductance of the coil, as shown in Figure 13–6. In many 
applications, the winding resistance may be small enough to be ignored and the coil 
can be considered an ideal inductor. In other cases, the resistance must be considered.
The wire has resistance distributed
along its length.

▲FIGURE 13–6

Winding Capacitance
When two conductors are placed side by side, there is always some capacitance between 
them. Thus, when many turns of wire are placed close together in a coil, a certain 
amount of stray capacitance, called winding capacitance (CW), is a natural side effect. 
In many applications, this winding capacitance is very small and has no significant 
 effect. In other cases, particularly at high frequencies, it may become quite important.
The equivalent circuit for an inductor with both its winding resistance (RW) and 
its winding capacitance (CW) is shown in Figure 13–7. The capacitance effectively 
acts in parallel. The total of the stray capacitances between each loop of the winding 
is indicated in a schematic as a capacitance appearing in parallel with the coil and its 
winding resistance, as shown in Figure 13–7(b).
Be careful when working with 
inductors because high induced 
voltages can be developed due to 
a rapidly changing magnetic field. 
This occurs when the current is 
interrupted or its value abruptly 
changed.
Stray capacitance between each loop
appears as a total parallel capacitance (CW).

568  ●  Inductors
Measuring Inductors
The value of an inductor can be measured by several means, including its response to 
a square wave, a bridge measurement, or by a special meter called an LCR meter. An 
LCR meter is used to measure the inductance (L), capacitance (C), or resistance (R). 
To measure inductance, some meters can also display the impedance at a selected test 
frequency. From this measurement, the inductance is determined and displayed. An 
LCR meter is discussed further in Section 16–9.
Review of Faraday’s Law
Recall from Section 10–5 that Faraday’s law has two parts. The first part states that:
The amount of voltage induced in a coil is directly proportional to the rate of change 
of the magnetic field with respect to the coil.
This principle is illustrated in Figure 13–8, where a bar magnet is moved through a 
coil of wire. An induced voltage is indicated by the voltmeter connected across the 
coil. The faster the magnet is moved, the greater the induced voltage.

▶FIGURE 13–8
Induced voltage created by a 
 changing magnetic field.
When a wire is formed into a certain number of loops or turns and is exposed to a 
changing magnetic field, a voltage is induced across the coil. The induced voltage is pro-
portional to the number of turns of wire in the coil, N, and to the rate at which the mag-
netic field changes. The rate of change of the magnetic field is designated df>dt, where 
f is the magnetic flux. The ratio df>dt, is expressed in webers/second (Wb/s). Faraday’s 
law states that the induced voltage across a coil is equal to the number of turns (loops) 
times the rate of flux change. It was given in Equation 10–8 and is restated here.
vind = N adf
dt b
Apply Faraday’s law to find the induced voltage across a coil with 500 turns 
 located in a magnetic field that is changing at a rate of 5 Wb/s.
 
Solution 
vind = N adf

Related Problem

change of the magnetic field?
EXAMPLE 13–3
Lenz’s Law
Lenz’s law was introduced in Chapter 10 and is restated here.
When the current through a coil changes, an induced voltage is created as a result of 
the changing electromagnetic field and the polarity of the induced voltage is such that 
it always opposes the change in current.

The Basic Inductor  ●  569
Figure 13–9 illustrates Lenz’s law. In part (a), the current is constant and is limited 
by R1. There is no induced voltage because the electromagnetic field is unchanging. 
In part (b), the switch suddenly is closed, placing R2 in parallel with R1 and thus 
 reducing the resistance. Naturally, the current tries to increase and the electromag-
netic field begins to expand, but the induced voltage opposes this attempted increase 
in current for an instant.

the electromagnetic field changes and induces a voltage in a direction that opposes that change in

570  ●  Inductors
In Figure 13–9(c), the induced voltage gradually decreases, allowing the current to 
increase. In part (d), the current has reached a constant value as determined by the 
parallel resistors, and the induced voltage is zero. In part (e), the switch has been sud-
denly opened, and, for an instant, the induced voltage prevents any decrease in cur-
rent, and arcing between the switch contacts results. In part (f), the induced voltage 
gradually decreases, allowing the current to decrease back to a value determined by 
R1. Notice that the induced voltage has a polarity that opposes any current change. 
The polarity of the induced voltage is opposite that of the battery voltage for an 
 increase in current and aids the battery voltage for a decrease in current.

5. Explain why inductors have some winding capacitance.
Inductors are made in a variety of shapes and sizes. Basically, they fall into two 
general categories: fixed and variable. The standard schematic symbols are shown in 
Figure 13–10.
Both fixed and variable inductors can be classified according to the type of core 
material. Three common types are the air core, the iron core, and the ferrite core. 
Each has a unique symbol, as shown in Figure 13–11.
Adjustable (variable) inductors usually have a screw-type adjustment that moves 
a sliding ferrite core in and out, thus changing the inductance. A wide variety of 
 inductors exist, and some are shown in Figure 13–12. Small fixed inductors are fre-
quently encapsulated in an insulating material that protects the fine wire in the coil.

Total Series Inductance
When inductors are connected in series, as in Figure 13–14, the total inductance, LT, 
is the sum of the individual inductances. The formula for LT is expressed in the 
 following equation for the general case of n inductors in series:
 
LT = L1 + L2 + L3 + g + Ln

Notice that the calculation of total inductance in series is analogous to the calculations 
of total resistance in series (Chapter 5) and total capacitance in parallel (Chapter 12).

Energy is stored in the electromagnetic field of an inductor when it is connected 
to a dc voltage source. The buildup of current through the inductor occurs in a 
predictable manner, which is dependent on the time constant of the circuit. The 
time constant is determined by the inductance and the resistance in a circuit.

The RL Time Constant
Because the inductor’s basic action is to develop a voltage that opposes a change 
in its current, it follows that current cannot change instantaneously in an induc-
tor. A certain time is required for the current to make a change from one value 
to another. The rate at which the current changes is determined by the RL time 
constant.
The RL time constant is a fixed time interval that equals the ratio of the inductance 
to the resistance.
The formula is
When there is constant direct current in an inductor, there is no induced voltage. 
There is, however, a voltage drop due to the winding resistance of the coil. The in-
ductance itself appears as a short to dc. Energy is stored in the electromagnetic field 
 according to the formula previously stated in Equation 13–2, W = 1>2LI 2. For 
the  inductor, the only energy conversion to heat occurs in the winding resistance 
(P = I 2RW). This condition is illustrated in Figure 13–18. Normally inductors are 
wound with fine wire. If the current is excessive, the inductor will open, so the dissi-
pated power must not exceed ratings. Current can be limited with an external resistor 
as shown below:

where t is in seconds when inductance (L) is in henries and resistance (R) is in ohms.
It is easy to show that the unit of inductance (henry), divided by the unit  
of resistance (ohm) is the second. From Equation 13–1, the henry can be written as 
a (volt-second)/ampere. The ohm (from Ohm’s law) is a volt/ampere. Substituting

Current in an Inductor
Increasing Current In a series RL circuit, the current will increase to approximately 
63% of its full value in one time-constant interval after voltage is applied. This buildup 
of current is analogous to the buildup of capacitor voltage during the charging in an RC 
circuit; they both follow an exponential curve and reach the  approximate percentages of 
the final current as indicated in Table 13–1 and as illustrated in Figure 13–19.
The change in current over five time-constant intervals is illustrated in Figure 13–20. 
As a practical matter, when the current reaches its final value at 5t, it ceases to change. 
At this time, the inductor acts as a short (except for winding resistance) to the constant 
current. The final value of the current is

The change in current over five time-constant intervals is illustrated in Figure 13–23. 
As a practical matter, when the current reaches its final value of approximately 0 A, 
it ceases to change. Before the switch is opened, the current through L is at a constant 
value of 10 mA, which is determined by R1 because L acts ideally as a short. When the 
switch is opened, the induced inductor voltage initially provides 10 mA through R2.

Response to a Square Wave
A good way to demonstrate both increasing and decreasing current in an RL circuit 
is to use a square wave voltage as the input. The square wave is a useful signal for 
 observing the dc response of a circuit because it automatically provides on and off 
 action similar to a switch. (Time response will be covered further in Chapter 20.) 
When the square wave goes from its low level to its high level, the current in the circuit 
responds by exponentially rising to its final value. When the square wave returns to the 
zero level, the current in the circuit responds by exponentially decreasing to its zero 
value. Figure 13–24 shows input voltage and current waveforms.
T E C H  N O T E
To measure the current waveform 
in a series RL circuit, you can 
measure the voltage across the 
resistor and apply Ohm’s law. If 
the resistor is ungrounded, as 
in Figure 13–24, you can use a 
 different measurement to view the 
resistor voltage by connecting one 
oscilloscope probe across each end 
of the resistor and selecting ADD 
and Invert on the oscilloscope. 
Both channels on the oscilloscope 
should be set to the same VOLTS/
DIV setting. Alternatively, you  
can reverse the components  
(see the Multisim problem in 
Example 13–8).

Voltages in a Series RL Circuit
As you know, when current changes in an inductor, a voltage is induced. Let’s exam-
ine what happens to the induced voltage across the inductor in the series circuit in 
Figure 13–25 during one complete cycle of a square wave input. Keep in mind that 
the generator produces a level that is like switching a dc source on and then puts an 
“automatic” low resistance (ideally zero) path across the source when it returns to its 
zero level.
An ammeter placed in the circuit shows the current in the circuit at any instant 
in time. The VL waveform is the voltage across the inductor. In Figure 13–25(a), 
the square wave has just transitioned from zero to its maximum value of 2.5 V. In 
 accordance with Lenz’s law, a voltage is induced across the inductor that opposes this 
change as the magnetic field surrounding the inductor builds up. There is no current 
in the circuit due to the equal but opposing voltages.
As the magnetic field builds up, the induced voltage across the inductor decreases, 
and current is in the circuit. After 1t, the induced voltage across the inductor has 
decreased by 63%, which causes the current to increase by 63% to 0.158 mA. This is 
shown in Figure 13–25(b) at the end of one time constant (0.1 ms).
The voltage on the inductor continues to exponentially decrease to zero, at which 
point the current is limited only by the circuit resistance. Then the square wave goes 
back to zero (at t = 0.5 ms) as shown in Figure 13–25(c). Again a voltage is induced 
For the circuit in Figure 13–24, what is the current at 0.1 ms and 0.6 ms?
 
Solution 
The RL time constant for the circuit is
t = L
R = 1.0 H
10 kΩ= 0.1 ms
If the square-wave generator period is long enough for the current to reach its 
maximum value in 5t, the current will increase exponentially and during each 
time constant interval will have a value equal to the percentage of the final current 
given in Table 13–1. The final current is
IF = VS
R = 2.5 V
10 kΩ= 0.25 mA
The current at 0.1 ms is
i = 0.632(0.25 mA) = 0.158 mA
At 0.6 ms, the square-wave input has been at the 0 V level for 0.1 ms, or 1t,  
and the current decreases from the maximum value toward its final value of 0 mA 
by 63.2%. Therefore,
i = 0.25 mA - 0.632(0.25 mA) = 0.092 mA
 
Related Problem 
What is the current at 0.2 ms and 0.8 ms?
Open the Multisim file E13-08. Notice that the inductor and resistor are reversed 
in order to ground one side of the resistor and make the measurement of the resis-
tor voltage simpler. The shape of the current in the circuit is the same as the shape 
of the resistor voltage. By applying Ohm’s law to the resistor voltage, you can find 
the current in the circuit at any instant in time. Confirm that the current at a time 
0.1 ms is close to the calculated value.

age is reversed due to the collapsing magnetic field. Although the source voltage is 0, 
the collapsing magnetic field maintains current in the same direction until the current 
decreases to zero, as shown in Figure 13–25(d).
The Exponential Formulas
The formulas for the exponential current and voltage in an RL circuit are similar to 
those used in Chapter 12 for the RC circuit, and the universal exponential curves in 
Figure 12–35 apply to inductors as well as capacitors. The general formulas for RL 
circuits are stated as follows:
 
 v = VF + (Vi - VF)e-Rt/L

Using Equation 13–10, you can calculate the value of the increasing inductor current 
at any instant of time. You can calculate voltage by substituting v for i and VF for IF in 
Equation 13–10. Notice that the exponent Rt>L can also be written as t>(L>R) = t>t.
where VF and IF are the final values of voltage and current, Vi and Ii are the initial 
values of voltage and current. The lowercase italic letters v and i are the instantaneous 
values of the inductor voltage and current at time t.
Increasing Current The formula for the special case in which an increasing expo-
nential current curve begins at zero is derived by setting Ii = 0 in Equation 13–9.

i = IF (1 - e-Rt/L)

Phase Relationship of Current and Voltage in an Inductor
From Equation 13–1, the formula for induced voltage, you can see that the faster the cur-
rent through an inductor changes, the greater the induced voltage will be. For example, if 
the rate of change of current is zero, the voltage is zero [vind = L(di>dt) = L(0) = 0 V]. 
When di>dt is a positive-going maximum, vind is a positive maximum; when di>dt is a 
negative-going maximum, vind is a negative maximum.
When a sinusoidal current is in an inductor, the current can be expressed math-
ematically as i(t) = Ip1sin  2pft2. The current curve has the same shape as the 
 mathematical sine curve as shown in Figure 13–32(a). The rate of change of the sine 
 function is the cosine function, which leads the sine function by 90°. Because the 
 induced voltage across the inductor is the rate of change of current, the voltage leads 
the current by 90° in an ideal inductor as shown in Figure 13–32(b).

Inductive Reactance, XL
Inductive reactance is the opposition to sinusoidal current, expressed in ohms. The 
symbol for inductive reactance is XL.
To develop a formula for XL, we use the relationship vind = L(di>dt) and the 
curves in Figure 13–33. The rate of change of current is directly related to frequency. 
The faster the current changes, the higher the frequency. For example, you can see 
that in Figure 13–33, the slope of sine wave A at the zero crossings is steeper than that 
of sine wave B. Recall that the slope of a curve at a point indicates the rate of change 
at that point. Sine wave A has a higher frequency than sine wave B, as indicated by a 
greater maximum rate of change (di>dt is greater at the zero crossings).

Slope indicates rate of change. Sine wave A has a greater rate of change at the zero crossing than B, 
and thus A has a higher frequency.
When frequency increases, di>dt increases, and thus vind increases. When frequency 
decreases, di>dt decreases, and thus vind decreases. The induced voltage is directly 
 dependent on frequency.

Inductors in AC Circuits  ●  587
An increase in induced voltage means more opposition (XL is greater). Therefore, 
XL is directly proportional to induced voltage and thus directly proportional to 
frequency.
XL is proportional to f.
Now, if di>dt is constant and the inductance is varied, an increase in L produces an 
increase in vind, and a decrease in L produces a decrease in vind.
c    c
vind = L(di>dt)  and  vind = L(di>dt)

Again, an increase in vind means more opposition (greater XL). Therefore, XL is directly 
proportional to induced voltage and thus directly proportional to inductance. The induc-
tive reactance is directly proportional to both f and L.
XL is proportional to fL.
The formula (derived in Appendix B) for inductive reactance, XL, is
 
XL = 2pfL 
Equation 13–12
Inductive reactance, XL, is in ohms when f is in hertz and L is in henries. As with 
 capacitive reactance, the 2p term is a constant factor in the equation, which comes 
from the relationship of a sine wave to rotational motion.
A sinusoidal voltage is applied to the circuit in Figure 13–34. The frequency is  
10 kHz. Determine the inductive reactance.
EXAMPLE 13–12
 
Solution 
Convert 10 kHz to 10 * 103 Hz and 5 mH to 5 * 10-3 H. Therefore, the inductive 
reactance is
XL = 2pfL = 2p(10 * 103 Hz)(5 * 10-3 H) = 314 𝛀
 
Related Problem 
What is XL in Figure 13–34 if the frequency is increased to 35 kHz?
Reactance for Series Inductors
As given in Equation 13–4, the total inductance of series inductors is the sum of the 
individual inductances. Because reactance is directly proportional to the inductance, 
the total reactance of series inductors is the sum of the individual reactances.
 
XL(tot) = XL1 + XL2 + XL3 + . . . + XLn 
Equation 13–13
Notice that Equation 13–13 has the same form as Equation 13–4. It also has the same 
form as the formulas for finding the total opposition to current such as the total  
 resistance of series resistors or the total reactance of series capacitors. When combining

Reactance for Parallel Inductors
In an ac circuit with parallel inductors, Equation 13–6 was given to find the total 
inductance. It stated that the total inductance is the reciprocal of the sum of the recip-
rocals of the inductors. Likewise, the total inductive reactance is the reciprocal of the 
sum of the reciprocals of the individual reactances.

same type of component in parallel (resistors, inductors, or capacitors), you take the

resistive circuits and capacitive circuits, and it is stated as follows for Figure 13–36.

Power in an Inductor
As discussed earlier, an inductor stores energy in its magnetic field when there is cur-
rent in the inductor. An ideal inductor (assuming no winding resistance) does not 
dissipate energy; it only stores it. When an ac voltage is applied to an ideal inductor, 
energy is stored by the inductor during a portion of the cycle, then the stored energy 
is returned to the source during another portion of the cycle. No net energy is lost in 
an ideal inductor due to conversion to heat. Figure 13–38 shows the power curve that 
results from one cycle of inductor current and voltage.

Power curve.
Instantaneous Power (p) The product of v and i gives instantaneous power. At 
points where v or i is zero, p is also zero. When both v and i are positive, p is also 
 positive. When either v or i is positive and the other negative, p is negative. When both 
v and i are negative, p is positive. As you can see in Figure 13–38, the power follows a 
sinusoidal-shaped curve. Positive values of power indicate that energy is stored by the 
inductor. Negative values of power indicate that energy is returned from the inductor 
to the source. Note that the power fluctuates at a frequency twice that of the voltage 
or current as energy is alternately stored and returned to the source.
True Power (Ptrue) Ideally, all of the energy stored by an inductor during the positive 
portion of the power cycle is returned to the source during the negative portion. No 
net energy is lost due to conversion to heat in the inductor, so the true power is zero. 
Actually, because of winding resistance in a practical inductor, some power is always 
dissipated, and there is a very small amount of true power, which can normally be 
neglected.
Equation  13–15 
Ptrue = (Irms)2RW
Reactive Power (Pr) The rate at which an inductor stores or returns energy is called 
its reactive power, with the unit of VAR (volt-ampere reactive). The reactive power 
is a nonzero quantity because at any instant in time the inductor is actually taking 
 energy from the source or returning energy to it. Reactive power does not represent 
an energy loss due to conversion to heat. The following formulas apply:

The Quality Factor (Q) of a Coil
The quality factor (Q) is the ratio of the reactive power in an inductor to the true 
power in the winding resistance of the coil or the resistance in series with the coil. It is a 
ratio of the power in L to the power in RW. The quality factor is important in resonant 
circuits, which are studied in Chapter 17. A formula for Q is developed as follows:
Q = reactive power
true power
= I 2XL
I 2RW
The current is the same in L and RW; thus, the I 2 terms cancel, leaving
 
Q = XL
RW
 
Equation 13–19
When the resistance is just the winding resistance of the coil, the circuit Q and the 
coil Q are the same. Note that Q is a ratio of like units and, therefore, has no unit  itself. 
The quality factor is also known as unloaded Q because it is defined with no load 
across the coil. Because XL is frequency dependent, Q is also frequency dependent.
A 10 V rms signal with a frequency of 1 kHz is applied to a 10 mH coil with a 
negligible winding resistance. Determine the reactive power (Pr).

First, calculate the inductive reactance and current values.

Noise Suppression
One of the most important applications of inductors has to do with suppressing 
 unwanted electrical noise. The inductors used in these applications are generally 
wound on a closed core to avoid having the inductor become a source of radiated 
noise itself. Two types of noise are conductive noise and radiated noise.
Conductive Noise Many systems have common conductive paths connecting dif-
ferent parts of the system, which can conduct high frequency noise from one part 
of the system to another. Consider the case of two circuits connected with common 
lines as shown in Figure 13–40(a). A path for high frequency noise exists though 
the common grounds, creating a condition known as a ground loop. Ground loops 
are particularly a problem in instrumentation systems, where a transducer may be 
located a distance from the recording system and noise current in the ground can 
affect the signal.
If the signal of interest changes slowly, a special inductor, called a longitudinal 
choke, can be installed in the signal line as shown in Figure 13–40(b). The longitu-
dinal choke is a form of transformer (covered in Chapter 14) that acts as inductors 
in each signal line. The ground loop sees a high impedance path, thus reducing the 
13–6 
inductor aPPlications
Inductors are not as versatile as capacitors and tend to be more limited in their 
application due, in part, to size, cost, and nonideal behavior (internal resistance, 
etc.). Also, for integrated circuits even small value inductors require a larger area 
than other components, which increases cost. Large inductors that require a core 
cannot be integrated. Two common applications for inductors are noise reduction 
applications and in tuned circuits. Another important application is in switching 
regulators, which are covered in Section 16–8.

noise, while the low-frequency signal is coupled through the low impedance of the 
choke.
Switching circuits also tend to generate high-frequency noise (above 10 MHz) by 
virtue of the high-frequency components present. (Recall from Section 11–9 that a 
pulse waveform contains many high-frequency harmonics.) Certain types of power 
supplies use high-speed switching circuits that are a source of conductive and radi-
ated noise.
Because an inductor’s impedance increases with frequency, inductors are good 
for blocking electrical noise from these supplies, which should carry only dc. 
Inductors are frequently installed in the power supply lines to suppress this con-
ductive noise, so that one circuit does not adversely affect another circuit. One 
or more capacitors may also be used in conjunction with the inductor to improve 
filtering action.
Radiated Noise Noise can also enter a circuit by way of an electromagnetic field. 
The noise source can be an adjacent circuit or a nearby power supply. There are sev-
eral approaches to reducing the effects of radiated noise. Usually, the first step is to 
determine the cause of the noise and isolate it using shielding or filtering.
Inductors are widely employed in filters that are used to suppress radio-frequency 
noise. The inductor used for noise suppression must be carefully selected so as not to 
become a source of radiated noise itself. For high frequencies (720 MHz), inductors 
wound on highly permeable toroidal cores are widely used, as they tend to keep the 
magnetic flux restricted to the core.
RF Chokes
Inductors used for the purpose of blocking very high frequencies are called radio 
frequency (RF) chokes. RF chokes are used for conductive or radiated noise. They 
are special inductors designed to block high frequencies from getting into or leav-
ing parts of a system by providing a high impedance path for high frequencies. In 
general, the choke is placed in series with the line for which RF suppression is re-
quired. Depending on the frequency of the interference, different types of chokes 
are required. A common type of electromagnetic interference (EMI) filter wraps 
the signal line on a  toroidal core several times. The toroidal configuration is desired 
because it contains the magnetic field so that the choke does not become a source 
of noise itself.
Another common type of RF choke is a ferrite bead such as the example in  
Figure 13–41. All wires have inductance, and the ferrite bead is a small ferromag-
netic material that is strung onto the wire to increase its inductance. The imped-
ance presented by the bead is a function of both the material and the frequency, 
as well as the size of the bead. It is an effective and inexpensive “choke” for high 
frequencies. Ferrite beads are common in high-frequency communication systems. 
Sometimes several are strung together in series to increase the effective inductance. 
In addition to beads that slip over wires, surface mount ferrite beads also are used 
in series on PCB traces to reject conducted high-frequency noise, similar to conven-
tional chokes.

594  ●  Inductors
Tuned Circuits
Inductors are used in conjunction with capacitors to provide frequency selection in 
communications systems. These tuned circuits allow a narrow band of frequencies to 
be selected while all other frequencies are rejected. The tuners in your TV and radio 
receivers are based on this principle and permit you to select one channel or station 
out of the many that are available.
Frequency selectivity is based on the fact that the reactances of both capacitors and 
inductors depend on the frequency and on the interaction of these two components 
when connected in series or parallel. Since the capacitor and the inductor produce 
 opposite phase shifts, their combined opposition to current can be used to obtain a 
desired response at a selected frequency. Tuned RLC circuits are covered in Chapter 17.

2. What do the letters EMI stand for?
3. How is a ferrite bead used?
In this application, you will see 
how you can test coils for their 
unknown inductance values using a test setup consisting of a 
square-wave generator and an oscilloscope. Two coils for which 
the inductance values are not known are tested using simple 
laboratory instruments to determine the inductance values. The 
method is to place the coil in series with a resistor with a known 
value and measure the time constant. Knowing the time con-
stant and the resistance value, the value of L can be calculated.
The method of determining the time constant is to apply 
a square wave to the circuit and measure the resulting voltage 
across the resistor. Each time the square-wave input voltage 
goes high, the inductor is energized and each time the square 
wave goes back to zero, the inductor is de-energized. The time it 
takes for the exponential resistor voltage to increase to approxi-
mately its final value equals five time constants. This operation 
is illustrated in Figure 13–42. To make sure that the winding 
resistance of the coil can be neglected, it must be measured and 
the value of the resistor used in the circuit must be selected to 
be considerably larger than the winding and source resistances.

Assume that the winding resistance of the coil in Figure 13–43

SUMMARY
●◆Inductance is a measure of a coil’s ability to establish an induced voltage as a result of a 
change in its current.
●◆An inductor opposes a change in its own current.
●◆Faraday’s law states that relative motion between a magnetic field and a coil induces a volt-
age across the coil.
●◆The amount of induced voltage is directly proportional to the inductance and to the rate of 
change in current.
●◆Lenz’s law states that the polarity of induced voltage is such that the resulting induced cur-
rent is in a direction that opposes the change in the magnetic field that produced it.
●◆Energy is stored by an inductor in its magnetic field.
●◆One henry is the amount of inductance when current, changing at the rate of one ampere per 
second, induces one volt across the inductor.
●◆Inductance is directly proportional to the square of the number of turns, the permeability, 
and the cross-sectional area of the core. It is inversely proportional to the length of the core.
●◆The permeability of a core material is an indication of the ability of the material to establish 
a magnetic field.
●◆The time constant for a series RL circuit is the inductance divided by the resistance.
●◆In an RL circuit, the increasing or decreasing voltage and current in an inductor make a 63% 
change during each time-constant interval.
●◆Increasing and decreasing voltages and currents follow exponential curves.
●◆Inductors add in series.
●◆Total parallel inductance is less than that of the smallest inductor in parallel.
●◆Voltage leads current by 90° in an inductor.
●◆Inductive reactance, XL, is directly proportional to frequency and inductance.
●◆The true power in an inductor is zero; that is, no energy is lost in an ideal inductor due to 
conversion to heat, only in its winding resistance.

INTRODUCTION
In Chapter 13, you learned about self-inductance. In this 
chapter, you will study mutual inductance, which is the basis 
for the operation of transformers. Transformers are used in 
all types of applications such as power supplies, electrical 
power distribution, and signal coupling in communications 
systems.
The operation of the transformer is based on the prin-
ciple of mutual inductance, which occurs when two or more 
coils are in close proximity. A simple transformer is actu-
ally two coils that are electromagnetically coupled by their 
mutual inductance. Because there is no electrical contact 
between two magnetically coupled coils, the transfer of en-
ergy from one coil to the other can be achieved in a situation 
of complete electrical isolation. In relation to transformers, 
the term winding or coil is commonly used to describe the 
primary and secondary.

A voltage is induced in the second 
coil as a result of the changing cur-
rent in the first coil, producing a 
changing electromagnetic field that 
links the second coil.
Recall from Chapter 10 that the electromagnetic field surrounding a coil of wire 
expands, collapses, and reverses as the current increases, decreases, and reverses.
When a second coil is placed very close to the first coil so that the changing mag-
netic lines of force cut through the second coil, the coils are magnetically coupled and 
a voltage is induced, as indicated in Figure 14–1. When two coils are magnetically 
coupled, they provide electrical isolation, a condition in which two circuits have no 
common electrically conductive path between them. If the current in the first coil is 
sinusoidal, the voltage induced in the second coil is also sinusoidal. The amount of 
voltage induced in the second coil as a result of the current in the first coil is  dependent 
on the mutual inductance (LM) which is the inductance between the two coils. The 
mutual inductance is established by the inductance of each coil and by the amount of 
coupling (k) between the two coils. To maximize coupling, the two coils are wound on 
a common core.
Coefficient of Coupling
The coefficient of coupling, k, between two coils is the ratio of the magnetic lines of force 
(flux) produced by coil 1 linking coil 2(f1 - 2) to the total flux produced by coil 1(f1).
Equation 14–1 
k = f1-2
f1
For example, if half of the total flux produced by coil 1 links coil 2, then k = 0.5. A 
greater value of k means that more voltage is induced in coil 2 for a certain rate of 
change of current in coil 1. Note that k has no units. Recall that the unit of magnetic 
lines of force (flux) is the weber, abbreviated Wb.
The coefficient of coupling, k, depends on the physical closeness of the coils and 
the type of core material on which they are wound. To maximize the coupling, coils 
are wound on a single core. The construction and shape of the core is also a factor in 
the coefficient of coupling.

the basic transforMer
A transformer is an electrical device constructed of two or more coils of wire 
 (windings) magnetically coupled to each other so that there is a mutual inductance 
for the transfer of power from one winding to the other. Although many transform-
ers have more than two windings, the coverage in this section is restricted to a basic 
two-winding transformer. Later, more complicated transformers are introduced.

A schematic of a basic transformer is shown in Figure 14–3(a). As shown, one coil 
is called the primary winding, and the other is called the secondary winding. The 
source voltage is applied to the primary winding, and the load is connected to the 
secondary winding, as shown in Figure 14–3(b). The primary winding is the input 
winding, and the secondary winding is the output winding. It is common to refer to 
the side of the transformer that has the source voltage as the primary, and the side 
that has the induced voltage as the secondary.
The windings of a transformer are formed around the core. The core provides both 
a physical structure for placement of the windings and a magnetic path so that the mag-
netic flux is concentrated close to the coils. There are three general categories of core ma-
terial: air, ferrite, and iron. The schematic symbol for each type is shown in Figure 14–4.
Iron-core transformers generally are used for audio frequency (AF) and power 
applications. These transformers consist of windings on a core constructed from 
laminated sheets of ferromagnetic material insulated from each other, as shown in 
Figure 14–5. This construction provides an easy path for the magnetic flux and in-
creases the amount of coupling between the windings. Figure 14–5 shows the basic

construction of two major configurations of iron-core transformers. In the core-
type construction, shown in part (a), the windings are on separate legs of the lami-
nated core. In the shell-type construction, shown in part (b), both windings are on 
the same leg. Each type has certain advantages. Generally, the core type has more 
room for insulation and can handle higher voltages. The shell type can produce 
higher magnetic fluxes in the core, resulting in the need for fewer turns.
Air-core and ferrite-core transformers generally are used for high-frequency applica-
tions and consist of windings on an insulating shell which is hollow (air) or constructed 
of ferrite, such as depicted in Figure 14–6. The wire is typically covered by a varnish-
type coating to prevent the windings from shorting together. The amount of mag-
netic coupling between the primary winding and the secondary winding is set by the 
type of core material and by the relative positions of the windings. In Figure 14–6(a), 
the windings are loosely coupled because they are separated, and in part (b) they are 
tightly coupled because they are overlapping. The tighter the coupling, the greater the 
induced voltage in the secondary for a given current in the primary.

High-frequency transformers tend to have fewer windings and smaller inductances 
than power transformers. A type of high-frequency transformer that has become pop-
ular in recent years is the planar transformer. Planar transformers are constructed 
with printed circuit (PC) board assembly methods (rather than wire winding) that 
 enable them to be produced with high precision and low cost. The windings are actu-
ally traces laid out on stacked PC boards. Planar transformers are available in a vari-
ety of sizes and wattage ratings. The low profile of a planar transformer (typically less 
than 0.5 inches) makes it particularly suited to cases where space is critical.

Some common types of transformers.
Turns Ratio
A transformer parameter that is useful in understanding how a transformer operates 
is the turns ratio. In this text, the turns ratio (n) is defined as the ratio of the number 
of turns in the secondary winding (Nsec) to the number of turns in the primary wind-
ing (Npri).
Equation 14–3 
n = Nsec
Npri
This definition of turns ratio is based on the IEEE standard for electronics power 
transformers as specified in the IEEE dictionary. Other categories of transformer may 
have a different definition, so some sources define the turns ratio as Npri/Nsec. Either 
definition is correct as long as it is clearly stated and used consistently. The turns ratio 
of a transformer is rarely if ever given as a transformer specification. Generally, the 
input and output voltages and the power rating are the key specifications. However, 
the turns ratio is useful in studying the operating principle of a transformer.
EXAMPLE 14–3
A transformer primary winding has 100 turns, and the secondary winding has 
400 turns. What is the turns ratio?
 
Solution 
Nsec = 400 and Npri = 100; therefore, the turns ratio is
n = Nsec
Npri
= 400
100 = 4
 
Related Problem 
A certain transformer has a turns ratio of 10. If Npri = 500, what is Nsec?
Direction of Windings
Another important transformer parameter is the direction in which the windings are 
placed around the core. As illustrated in Figure 14–8, the direction of the windings 
 determines the polarity of the voltage across the secondary winding (secondary voltage) 
with respect to the voltage across the primary winding (primary voltage). Phase dots are 
sometimes used on the schematic symbols to indicate polarities, as shown in Figure 14–9.

612  ●  Transformers
The Step-Up Transformer
A transformer in which the secondary voltage is greater than the primary voltage is 
called a step-up transformer. The amount that the voltage is stepped up depends on 
the turns ratio.
The ratio of secondary voltage (Vsec) to primary voltage (Vpri) is equal to the ratio 
of the number of turns in the secondary winding (Nsec) to the number of turns in the 
primary winding (Npri).
Equation 14–4 
Vsec
Vpri
= Nsec
Npri
Recall that Nsec /Npri defines the turns ratio, n. Therefore, from this relationship,
Equation 14–5 
Vsec = nVpri
Equation 14–5 shows that the secondary voltage is equal to the turns ratio times the 
primary voltage. This condition assumes that the coefficient of coupling is 1, and a 
good iron-core transformer approaches this value.
The turns ratio for a step-up transformer is always greater than 1 because the num-
ber of turns in the secondary winding (Nsec) is always greater than the number of turns 
in the primary winding (Npri).
The Step-Down Transformer
A transformer in which the secondary voltage is less than the primary voltage is called 
a step-down transformer. The amount by which the voltage is stepped down depends 
on the turns ratio. Equation 14–5 also applies to a step-down transformer.
The turns ratio of a step-down transformer is always less than 1 because the num-
ber of turns in the secondary winding is always fewer than the number of turns in the 
primary winding.
EXAMPLE 14–4
The transformer in Figure 14–10 has a turns ratio of 3. What is the voltage across 
the secondary winding? RMS voltage is assumed.
 
Solution 
The secondary voltage is
Vsec = nVpri = (3)120 V = 360 V
Note that the turns ratio of 3 is indicated on the schematic as 1:3, meaning that 
there are three secondary turns for each primary turn.

DC Isolation
As illustrated in Figure 14–12(a), if there is dc in the primary of a transformer, nothing 
happens in the secondary. The reason is that a changing current in the primary wind-
ing is necessary to induce a voltage in the secondary winding, as shown in part (b). 
Therefore, the transformer isolates the secondary circuit from any dc in the primary 
circuit. A transformer that is used strictly for isolation has a turns ratio of 1.

The transformer in Figure 14–11 has a turns ratio of 0.2. What is the secondary 
voltage?
 
Solution

DC isolation and ac coupling.
Isolation transformers are often packaged as part of a total ac line-conditioning 
 device. In addition to the isolation transformer, the line conditioning includes surge pro-
tection, filters to eliminate interference, and sometimes automatic voltage regulation. 
Line conditioning is useful to isolate sensitive equipment such as  microprocessor-based 
controllers. Specialized line conditioners for patient-monitoring equipment in hospi-
tals provide a high degree of electrical isolation and protection from shock.
Small transformers that are used to isolate the dc bias from one stage of an ampli-
fier to the next stage are called coupling transformers because the ac signal is passed 
(“coupled”) but the dc is blocked. Coupling transformers are widely used at high fre-
quencies where they are designed to pass only a selected band of frequencies by mak-
ing the primary and secondary coils part of a parallel tuned circuit (resonant circuit). 
(Tuned circuits are discussed in Chapter 17.) A typical transformer-coupled amplifier 
arrangement is shown in Figure 14–13. Frequently, the core of a coupling transformer 
can be adjusted to fine-tune the frequency response. Coupling transformers are also 
commonly used to couple a signal from an amplifier to a speaker.

loading the secondary
When a load resistor is connected to the secondary winding, as shown in Figure 14–14, 
there is current through the resulting secondary circuit because of the voltage induced in 
the secondary coil. It can be shown that the ratio of the primary current, Ipri, to the sec-
ondary current, Isec, is equal to the turns ratio, as expressed in the following equation:

Loading the Secondary  ●  615
Primary Power Equals Load Power
When a load is connected to the secondary winding of a transformer, the power trans-
ferred to the load can never be greater than the power in the primary winding. For an 
ideal transformer, the power delivered to the primary equals the power delivered by 
the secondary to the load. When losses are considered, some of the power is dissipated 
in the transformer rather than the load; therefore, the load power is always less than 
the power delivered to the primary.
Power is dependent on voltage and current, and there can be no increase in power 
in a transformer. Therefore, if the voltage is stepped up, the current is stepped down 
and vice versa. In an ideal transformer, the secondary power is equal to the primary 
power regardless of the turns ratio, as the following equations show. The power de-
livered to the primary is
Ppri = VpriIpri
and the power delivered to the load is
Psec = VsecIsec
A manipulation of the terms in Equation 14–6 gives Equation 14–7, which shows 
that Isec is equal to Ipri times the reciprocal of the turns ratio.
Isec = a1
nbIpri
Thus, for a step-up transformer, in which n is greater than 1, the secondary current is 
less than the primary current. For a step-down transformer, n is less than 1, and Isec is 
greater than Ipri. When the secondary voltage is greater than the primary voltage, the 
secondary current is lower than the primary current and vice versa.
Equation 14–7
EXAMPLE 14–6
The two ideal transformers in Figure 14–15 have loaded secondary windings. If

Isec = a1
nbIpri = (0.1)100 mA = 10 mA
In Figure 14–15(b), the turns ratio is 0.5. The current through the load is

reflected load
Resistance (by Ohm’s law) is voltage divided by current. Because a transformer can 
change both the voltage and current, the resistance “seen” by the primary is not 
necessarily equal to the actual resistance of the load. The actual load is “reflected” 
into the primary as determined by the turns ratio. This reflected load is what the 
primary source effectively sees, and it determines the amount of primary current.

Ideally, the load appears to the source in the primary to be a resistance (Rpri) with a 
value determined by the turns ratio and the actual value of the load resistance. The

The resistance in the primary of Figure 14–16 is Rpri = Vpri/Ipri. The resistance 
in the secondary is RL = Vsec/Isec. From Equations 14–4 and 14–6, you know that 
Vsec/Vpri = n and Ipri/Isec = n. Using these relationships, a formula for Rpri in terms of

iMPedance Matching
One application of transformers is in the matching of a load impedance to a 
source impedance to achieve maximum transfer of power or other results. This 
technique is called impedance matching. In audio systems, special wide-band 
transformers are often used to get the maximum amount of available power from 
the amplifier to the speaker by proper selection of the turns ratio. Transformers 
designed specifically for impedance matching usually show the input and output 
impedance they are designed to match. A special type of impedance-matching 
transformer called the balun is introduced.

◆
◆Describe a balun transformer
Recall that the maximum power transfer theorem (discussed in Section 8–7) states 
that maximum power is transferred from a source to a load when the load resistance 
is equal to the source resistance. In ac circuits, the total opposition to current is re-
ferred to as impedance, which can be resistance, reactance, or a combination of both. 
The term impedance matching is used to show that the source and load impedances 
are effectively equal. For this section, we will confine our usage to resistance only.
Figure 14–19(a) shows an ac source with a fixed internal resistance. Some fixed in-
ternal resistance is inherent in all sources due to their internal circuitry. Part (b) shows 
a load connected to the source. In this case, the objective is often to transfer as much 
power to the load as possible. It is important to verify that the impedance-matching 
transformer is rated for this power.
In most practical situations, the internal source resistance of various types of 
sources is fixed. Also, in many cases, the resistance of a device that acts as a load is 
fixed and cannot be altered. If you need to connect a given source to a given load, 
remember that only by chance will their resistances match. In this situation, a special 
type of wide band transformer comes in handy. You can use the reflected-resistance 
characteristic provided by a transformer to make the load resistance appear to have 
the same value as the source resistance. This technique is called impedance match-
ing, and the transformer is called an impedance-matching transformer because it also 
transforms reactances as well as resistances.

In this example, a source with an internal resistance of 75 Ω is driving a 300 Ω load. 
The impedance-matching transformer needs to make the load resistance look like a 
75 Ω resistance to the source in order to deliver maximum power to the load. To select 
the right transformer, you need to know how the turns ratio affects the impedance. 
You can use Equation 14–8 to determine the turns ratio, n, to achieve  impedance 
matching when you know the values for RL and Rpri.

What must be the turns ratio in Figure 14–21 to provide maximum power to two 
8 Ω speakers in parallel?
Frequently, the specification sheet for an impedance-matching transformer  simply 
shows the primary and secondary impedances that are designed to be matched, rather 
than the turns ratio. For example, an audio amplifier that is designed to match the 
high impedance output of an amplifier to a low impedance speaker will show the 
primary impedance, the secondary impedance it matches, and the wattage rating. 
The frequency range and physical characteristics are also on the specification sheet.
The Balun Transformer An application for impedance matching is used in high-
frequency antennas. In addition to impedance matching, many transmitting anten-
nas also require that an unbalanced signal from the transmitter be converted to a 
balanced signal. A balanced signal is composed of two equal-amplitude signals that 
are 180° out-of-phase with each other. An unbalanced signal is one that is referenced 
to ground. A special type of transformer called a balun, a contraction of the words 
“balanced-unbalanced” is used to convert the unbalanced signal from the transmitter 
to a balanced signal at the antenna, as shown in Figure 14–22.
The transmitter is usually connected to the balun with a coaxial cable (coax). A 
coax is basically a conductor surrounded by an insulating region and an outer con-
ductor called the shield. In Figure 14–22, the signal from the transmitter is referenced 
to ground, which is connected to the outer shield of the coax, so it is an unbalanced 
signal. The shield on the coax minimizes pickup of radiated noise.

The coax has a certain characteristic impedance associated with it. The turns ratio 
of the balun is set to match the coax impedance to the antenna impedance. For ex-
ample, if the transmitting antenna represents a 300 Ω impedance and the coax has a 
characteristic impedance of 75 Ω, the balun can provide the impedance match with 
a turns ratio of 2, as was shown earlier. Baluns can also be used to convert from 
 balanced signals to unbalanced signals.

transforMer ratings and characteristics
Transformer operation has been discussed from an ideal point of view. That is, 
the winding resistance, the winding capacitance, and nonideal core characteristics 
were all neglected and the transformer was treated as if it had an efficiency of 
100%. For studying the basic concepts and in many applications, the ideal model 
is valid. However, the practical transformer has  several nonideal characteristics.
After completing this section, you should be able to

Ratings
Power Rating A power transformer is typically rated in volt-amperes (VA), primary/
secondary voltage, and operating frequency. For example, a given transformer rating 
may be specified as 2 kVA, 500/50, 60 Hz. The 2 kVA value is the apparent power  
rating. The 500 and the 50 can be either secondary or primary  voltages. The 60 Hz is 
the operating frequency.
The transformer rating can be helpful in selecting the proper transformer for a 
given application. Let’s assume, for example, that 50 V is the secondary voltage. In 
this case the load current is
IL = Psec
Vsec
= 2 kVA
50 V
= 40 A
On the other hand, if 500 V is the secondary voltage, then
IL = Psec
Vsec
= 2 kVA
500 V = 4 A
These are the maximum currents that the secondary can handle in either case.
The reason that the power rating is in volt-amperes (apparent power) rather than 
in watts (true power) is as follows: If the transformer load is purely capacitive or 
purely inductive, the true power (watts) delivered to the load is zero. However, the 
current for Vsec = 500 V and XC = 100 Ω at 60 Hz, for example, is 5 A. This current 
exceeds the maximum that the 2 kVA secondary can handle, and the transformer may 
be damaged. So it is meaningless to specify power in watts for transformers.

622  ●  Transformers
Voltage and Frequency Ratings In addition to the apparent power rating, most power 
transformers will have voltage and frequency ratings placed on the transformer. The 
voltage ratings include the primary voltage for which it is designed and the secondary 
voltage that is present when the rated load is connected to the secondary and the pri-
mary is connected to the rated input voltage. Frequently, there will be a small schematic 
drawing showing the windings and voltage rating for each winding. The frequency for 
which the transformer is designed will also be specified; for power transformers this is 
generally 50/60 Hz. A transformer operated on the wrong frequency can be damaged, 
so it is important to note the frequency specification. These are minimum specifications 
you need to know in order to select a power transformer for an application.
Characteristics
Winding Resistance Both the primary and the secondary windings of a practical 
transformer have winding resistance. You learned about the winding resistance of 
inductors in Chapter 13. The winding resistances of a practical transformer are repre-
sented as resistors in series with the windings as shown in Figure 14–23.
Winding resistance in a practical transformer results in less voltage across a secondary 
load. Voltage drops due to the winding resistance effectively subtract from the primary 
and secondary voltages and result in load voltage that is less than that predicted by the 
relationship Vsec = nVpri. In many cases, the effect is relatively small and can be neglected.
Losses in the Core There is always some energy conversion in the core material of a 
practical transformer. This conversion is seen as a heating of ferrite and iron cores, but 
it does not occur in air cores. Part of this energy conversion is because of the continuous 
reversal of the magnetic field due to the changing direction of the primary current; this 
component of the energy conversion is called hysteresis loss. The rest of the energy con-
version to heat is caused by eddy currents produced when voltage is induced in the core 
material by the changing magnetic flux, according to Faraday’s law. The eddy currents 
occur in circular patterns in the core resistance, thus producing heat. This conversion to 
heat is greatly reduced by the use of laminated construction of iron cores. The thin lay-
ers of ferromagnetic material are insulated from each other to minimize the buildup of 
eddy currents by confining them to a small area and to keep core losses to a minimum.
Magnetic Flux Leakage In an ideal transformer, all of the magnetic flux produced 
by the primary current is assumed to pass through the core to the secondary winding, 
and vice versa. In a practical transformer, some of the magnetic flux lines break out of 
the core and pass through the surrounding air back to the other end of the winding, 
as illustrated in Figure 14–24 for the magnetic field produced by the primary current. 
Magnetic flux leakage results in a reduced secondary voltage.
The percentage of magnetic flux that actually reaches the secondary winding deter-
mines the coefficient of coupling of the transformer. For example, if nine out of ten 
flux lines remain inside the core, the coefficient of coupling is 0.90 or 90%. Most iron-
core transformers have very high coefficients of coupling (greater than 0.99), while 
ferrite-core and air-core devices have lower values.

Transformer Ratings and Characteristics  ●  623
Winding Capacitance As you learned in Chapter 13, there is always some stray capaci-
tance between adjacent turns of a winding. These stray capacitances result in an effective 
capacitance in parallel with each winding of a transformer, as indicated in Figure 14–25.
EXAMPLE 14–10
A certain type of transformer has a primary current of 5 A and a primary volt-
age of 4,800 V. The secondary current is 90 A, and the secondary voltage is 240 V. 
Determine the efficiency of this transformer.
 
Solution 
The input power is
Pin = VpriIpri = (4,800 V)(5 A) = 24 kVA
The output power is
Pout = VsecIsec = (240 V)(90 A) = 21.6 kVA
The efficiency is
h = aPout

secondary current is 30 A and the secondary voltage is 100 V. What is the efficiency?

1. Explain how a practical transformer differs from the ideal model.
2. The coefficient of coupling of a certain transformer is 0.85. What does this mean?
3. A certain transformer has a rating of 10 kVA. If the secondary voltage is 250 V, how 
much load current can the transformer handle?
These stray capacitances have very little effect on the transformer’s operation at low 
frequencies (such as power line frequencies) because the reactances (XC) are very high. 
However, at higher frequencies, the reactances decrease and begin to produce a bypass-
ing effect across the primary winding and across the secondary load. As a result, less of 
the total primary current is through the primary winding, and less of the total secondary 
current is through the load. This effect reduces the load voltage as the frequency goes up.
Transformer Efficiency Recall that the power delivered to the load is equal to the 
power delivered to the primary in an ideal transformer. Because the nonideal charac-
teristics just discussed result in a power loss in the transformer, the secondary (output) 
power is always less than the primary (input) power. The efficiency (H) of a transformer 
is a measure of the percentage of the input power that is delivered to the output.
Most power transformers have efficiencies in excess of 95% under load.

Operation of a center-tapped transformer.
The voltages between either end of the secondary winding and the center tap are, at 
any instant, equal in magnitude but opposite in polarity, as illustrated in Figure 14–26(b). 
Here, for example, at some instant on the sinusoidal voltage, the polarity across the  entire 
secondary winding is as shown (top end +, bottom -). At the center tap, the voltage is 
less positive than the top end but more positive than the bottom end of the secondary. 
Therefore, measured with respect to the center tap, the top end of the secondary is posi-
tive, and the bottom end is negative. This center-tapped feature is used in many power 
supply rectifiers in which the ac voltage is converted to dc, as illustrated in Figure 14–27.

Tapped and Multiple-Winding Transformers  ●  625
Some tapped transformers have taps on the secondary winding at points other 
than the electrical center. Also, single and multiple primary and secondary taps are 
sometimes used in certain applications, such as impedance-matching transformers 
that normally have a center-tapped primary. Examples of these types of transformers 
are shown in Figure 14–28.

◀FIGURE 14–28
Tapped transformers.
Utility companies use many tapped transformers in distribution systems. Normally, 
power is generated and transmitted as three-phase power. At some point, the three-phase 
power is converted to single-phase for residential use. An example of a utility-pole trans-
former is shown in Figure 14–29 for the case where the high-voltage three-phase power 
has previously been converted to single-phase power (by tapping one of the three phases). 
It still needs to be converted to 120 V/240 V for residential customers, so a single-phase 
tapped transformer is used. By selecting the appropriate tap on the primary side, the util-
ity company can make minor adjustments in the voltage that is delivered to the customer. 
The center tap on the secondary side is the neutral conductor that is the return line for 
current. Within the building, the wires are identified by color. For a 120 V Romex cable, 
the hot wire in a multiple sheathed cable is in black (or red if there is a second hot wire), 
neutral is in white or gray color, and the safety ground is either green or bare.

Multiple-Winding Transformers
Some transformers are designed to operate from either 120 V ac or 240 V ac lines. 
These transformers usually have two primary windings, each of which is designed for 
120 V ac. When the two are connected in series, the transformer can be used for 240 V 
ac operations, as illustrated in Figure 14–30.

626  ●  Transformers
More than one secondary can be wound on a common core. Transformers with 
several secondary windings are often used to achieve several voltages by either step-
ping up or stepping down the primary voltage. These types are commonly used in 
power supply applications in which several voltage levels are required for the opera-
tion of an electronic instrument.
A typical schematic of a multiple-secondary transformer is shown in Figure 14–31; 
this transformer has three secondaries. Sometimes you will find combinations of 
 multiple-primary, multiple-secondary, and tapped transformers all in one unit.

Tapped and Multiple-Winding Transformers  ●  627
Autotransformers
In an autotransformer, one winding serves as both the primary and the secondary. The 
winding is tapped at the proper points to achieve the desired turns ratio for stepping 
up or stepping down the voltage. The primary and secondary have some or all of their 
turns in common.
Autotransformers differ from conventional transformers in that there is no electri-
cal isolation between the primary and the secondary because both share a common 
winding. Autotransformers normally are smaller and lighter than equivalent conven-
tional transformers because they require a much lower kVA rating for a given load. 
Many autotransformers provide an adjustable tap using a sliding contact mechanism 
so that the output voltage can be varied (these are often called variacs). Figure 14–33 
shows schematic symbols for various types of autotransformers. Autotransformers 
are used in starting industrial induction motors and regulating transmission line 
voltages.
Example 14–12 illustrates why an autotransformer has a kVA requirement that is 
less than the input or output kVA.

Three-Phase Transformers
Three-phase power was introduced in Chapter 11 in relation to generators and motors. 
Three-phase transformers are widely used in power distribution systems. Three-phase 
power is the most common way in which power is produced, transmitted, and used. 
Although widely used in commercial and industrial applications, three-phase power is 
generally not used in residential applications.
A three-phase transformer consists of three sets of primary and secondary 
 windings. Each set is wound on one leg of an iron-core assembly. Basically, it is three 
single-phase transformers sharing a common core, as shown in Figure 14–35. It is 
possible (but more expensive) to connect three single-phase transformers together 
to achieve the same result. In a three-phase transformer, the three identical primary

The output power is the load voltage, V3, times the load current, I3.

V1I1 = V3I3
Solving for I1 yields
I1 = V3I3
V1
= (170 V)(21.3 A)
240 V
= 15.1 A
Applying Kirchhoff’s current law at the tap junction,
I1 = I2 + I3
Solving for I2, the current through winding B, yields
I2 = I1 - I3 = 15.1 A - 21.3 A = -6.2 A
The minus sign indicates I2 is out of phase with I1.
The input and output power are
Pin = Pout = V3I3 = (170 V)(21.3 A) = 3.62 kVA
The power in winding A is
PA = V2I1 = (70 V)(15.1 A) = 1.05 kVA
The power in winding B is
PB = V3I2 = (170 V)(6.2 A) = 1.05 kVA
Thus, the power rating required for each winding is less than the power that is deliv-
ered to the load.

windings and the three identical secondary windings are connected in either of two 
ways, a delta (∆) configuration or a wye (Y) configuration, to form a complete trans-
former unit. Delta and wye connections are shown in Figure 14–36.
In a three-phase transformer the possible combinations of delta and wye configu-
rations are
1. Delta-to-wye (∆@Y). The primary winding is a delta and the secondary wind-
ing is a wye. This common configuration is used in commercial and industrial 
applications.
2. Delta-to-delta (∆@∆). The primary and secondary windings are both connected 
in the delta configuration. This is also commonly used in industrial applications.
3. Wye-to-delta (Y@∆). The primary winding is a wye and the secondary winding is a 
delta. This is used in high-voltage transmission applications.
4. Wye-to-wye (Y@Y). The primary and secondary windings are both connected in 
the wye configuration. It is used in high-voltage, low kVA applications.
The delta-to-wye connections are shown in Figure 14–37. The proper winding 
phasing must be observed when connecting the transformers. The windings in the 
delta must be + to -; the polarity for each winding in the wye must be the same at 
the center point.

troubleshooting
Transformers are reliable devices when they are operated within their specified 
range. Common failures in transformers are opens in either the primary or the 
secondary windings. One cause of such failures is the operation of the device 
under conditions that exceed its ratings. Normally, when a transformer fails, it is 
difficult to repair and therefore the simplest procedure is to replace it. A few trans-
former failures and the associated symptoms are covered in this section.

Open Primary Winding
When there is an open primary winding, there is no primary current and, there-
fore, no induced voltage or current in the secondary. This condition is illustrated in 
Figure 14–39(a), and the method of checking with an ohmmeter is shown in part (b).

Troubleshooting  ●  631
Open Secondary Winding
When there is an open secondary winding, there is no current in the secondary circuit 
and, as a result, no voltage across the load. Also, an open secondary causes the pri-
mary current to be very small (there is only a small magnetizing current). This condi-
tion is illustrated in Figure 14–40(a), and the ohmmeter check is shown in part (b).

Shorted or Partially Shorted Windings
Shorted windings are very rare, and if they do occur they are very difficult to find 
unless there is a visual indication or a large number of windings are shorted. A com-
pletely shorted primary winding will draw excessive current from the source; unless 
there is a breaker or a fuse in the circuit, either the source or the transformer or both 
will burn out. A partial short in the primary winding can cause higher than normal or 
even excessive primary current.
In the case of a shorted or partially shorted secondary winding, there is an excessive 
primary current because of the low reflected resistance due to the short. Often, this 
excessive current will burn out the primary winding and result in an open. The short-
circuit current in the secondary winding causes the load current to be zero (full short) 
or smaller than normal (partial short), as demonstrated in Figure 14–41(a) and (b). 
The ohmmeter check for this condition is shown in part (c).

CHECKUP
1. Name two possible failures in a transformer and state the most likely one.
2. What is often the cause of transformer failure?
A common application of the 
 transformer is in dc power 
 supplies. The transformer is used to change and couple 
the ac line voltage into the power supply circuitry where 
it is  converted to a dc voltage. You will troubleshoot four 
 identical  transformer-coupled dc power supplies and, based 
Application Activity
on a series of measurements, determine the fault, if any, 
in each.
The transformer (T1) in the power supply schematic of 
Figure 14–42 steps the 120 V from the ac outlet down to 10 V 
that can be converted by the diode bridge rectifier, filtered, 
and regulated to obtain a 6 V dc output. The diode  rectifier

changes the ac to a pulsating full-wave dc voltage that is 
smoothed by the capacitor filter C1. The voltage regulator 
is an integrated circuit that takes the filtered voltage and 
provides a constant 6 V dc over a range of load values and 
line voltage variations. Additional filtering is provided by 
capacitor C2. You will learn about these circuits in a later 
course. The circled numbers in Figure 14–42 correspond to 
measurement points on the power supply board.
The Power Supply
There are four identical power supply boards to troubleshoot 
like the one shown in Figure 14–43. The power line to the 
primary winding of transformer T1 is protected by the fuse. 
The secondary winding is connected to the circuit board con-
taining the rectifier, filter, and regulator. Measurement points 
are indicated by the circled numbers.
Measuring Voltages on Power Supply Board 1
After plugging the power supply into a standard wall outlet, 
an autoranging portable multimeter is used to measure the 
voltages. In an autoranging meter, the appropriate measure-
ment range is automatically selected instead of being manu-
ally selected as in a standard multimeter.
1. Determine from the meter readings in Figure 14–44 
whether or not the power supply is operating properly. 
If it is not, isolate the problem to one of the  following:

SUMMARY
◆
●A normal transformer consists of two or more coils that are magnetically coupled on a 
 common core.
◆
●There is mutual inductance between two magnetically coupled coils.
◆
●When current in one coil changes, voltage is induced in the other coil.
◆
●The primary is the winding connected to the source, and the secondary is the winding 
 connected to the load.
◆
●The number of turns in the primary and the number of turns in the secondary determine 
the turns ratio.
◆
●The relative polarities of the primary and secondary voltages are determined by the direction 
of the windings around the core.
◆
●A step-up transformer has a turns ratio greater than 1.
◆
●A step-down transformer has a turns ratio less than 1.
◆
●In an ideal transformer, the power from the source (input power) is equal to the power 
 delivered to the load (output power).
◆
●In a practical transformer, the power delivered to the load is always less than the power 
 delivered to the primary.

Formulas  ●  635
◆
●If the voltage is stepped up, the current is stepped down, and vice versa.
◆
●A load across the secondary winding of a transformer appears to the source as a reflected 
load having a value dependent on the reciprocal of the turns ratio squared.
◆
●Certain transformers can match a load resistance to a source resistance to achieve maximum 
power transfer to the load by selecting the proper turns ratio.
◆
●A balun is a type of transformer used to convert a balanced line (such as twisted pair wiring) 
to an unbalanced line (such as coaxial cable) or vice versa.
◆
●A typical transformer does not respond to dc.
◆
●Conversion of electrical energy to heat in an actual transformer results from winding resis-
tances, hysteresis loss in the core, eddy currents in the core, and flux leakage.
◆
●Three-phase transformers are commonly used in power distribution applications.

INTRODUCTION
An RC circuit contains both resistance and capacitance. In 
this chapter, basic series and parallel RC circuits and their re-
sponses to sinusoidal ac voltages are presented. Series-parallel 
combinations are also analyzed. True, reactive, and apparent 
power in RC circuits are discussed and some basic RC circuit 
applications are introduced. Applications of RC circuits include 
filters, amplifier coupling, oscillators, and wave-shaping circuits. 
Troubleshooting is also covered in this chapter.
Section 15–1 provides an introduction to complex num-
bers, an important tool for the analysis of ac circuits. The 
complex number system is a way to mathematically express 
a phasor quantity and allows phasor quantities to be added, 
subtracted, multiplied, and divided. You will use complex 
numbers throughout Chapters 15, 16, and 17.
COVERAGE OPTIONS
Following Section 15–1, The Complex Number System, this 
chapter and Chapters 16 and 17 are each divided into four parts: 
Series Circuits, Parallel Circuits, Series-Parallel Circuits, and 
Special Topics. This organization facilitates either of two options 
to the coverage of reactive circuits in Chapters 15, 16, and 17.
Option 1 Study the complex number system first; then 
study all RC circuit topics (Chapter 15), followed by all RL 
circuit topics (Chapter 16), and then all RLC circuit topics 
(Chapter 17). Using this approach, you simply cover Chapters 
15, 16, and 17 in sequence.
Option 2 After studying the complex number system, 
study series reactive circuits. Then study parallel reactive cir-
cuits, followed by series-parallel reactive circuits and finally 
special topics. Using this approach, you cover Section 15–1; 
then Part 1: Series Circuits in Chapters 15, 16, and 17; then 
Part 2:  Parallel Circuits in Chapters 15, 16, and 17; then Part 3:  
Series-Parallel Circuits in Chapters 15, 16, and 17. Finally, 
Part 4: Special Topics can be covered in each of the chapters.

Complex numbers allow mathematical operations with phasor quantities and 
are useful in the analysis of ac circuits. With the complex number system, you 
can add, subtract, multiply, and divide quantities that have both magnitude 
and angle, such as sine waves and other ac circuit quantities. Most scientific 
calculators can perform operations with complex numbers. Consult your user’s 
manual for the exact procedure.

Positive and Negative Numbers
Positive numbers are represented by points to the right of the origin on the horizontal 
axis of a graph, and negative numbers are represented by points to the left of the ori-
gin, as illustrated in Figure 15–1(a). Also, positive numbers are represented by points 
on the vertical axis above the origin, and negative numbers are represented by points 
below the origin, as shown in Figure 15–1(b).

The Complex Plane
To distinguish between values on the horizontal axis and values on the vertical axis, a 
complex plane is used. In the complex plane, the horizontal axis is called the real axis, 
and the vertical axis is called the imaginary axis, as shown in Figure 15–2. In electrical 
circuit work, a {j prefix is used to designate numbers that lie on the imaginary axis 
in order to distinguish them from numbers lying on the real axis. This prefix is known 

646  ●  RC Circuits
as the j operator. In mathematics, an i is used instead of a j, but in electric circuits, the 
i can be confused with instantaneous current, so j is used.
Angular Position on the Complex Plane Angular positions are represented on the 
complex plane, as shown in Figure 15–3. The positive real axis represents zero  degrees. 
Proceeding counterclockwise, the +j axis represents 90°, the negative real axis repre-
sents 180°, the -j axis is the 270° point, and, after a full rotation of 360°, you are back 
to the positive real axis. Notice that the plane is divided into four quadrants.
Representing a Point on the Complex Plane A point located on the complex 
plane is classified as real, imaginary ({j), or a combination of the two. For example, 
a point located 4 units from the origin on the positive real axis is the positive real 
number, +4, as shown in Figure 15–4(a). A point 2 units from the origin on the

negative real axis is the negative real number, -2, as shown in part (b). A point on 
the +j axis 6 units from the origin, as shown in part (c), is the positive imaginary 
number, +j6. Finally, a point 5 units along the -j axis is the negative imaginary 
number, -j5, as shown in part (d).
When a point lies on neither axis but somewhere in one of the four  quadrants, 
it is a complex number and is defined by its coordinates. For example, in  
Figure 15–5, the point located in the first quadrant has a real value of +4 and a j 
value of +j4 and is expressed as +4, +j4. The point located in the second quadrant 
has coordinates -3 and +j2. The point located in the third quadrant has coordi-
nates -3 and -j5. The point located in the fourth quadrant has coordinates of +6 
and -j4.

Value of j
If you multiply the positive real value of +2 by j, the result is +j2. This multiplication 
has effectively moved the +2 through a 90° angle to the +j axis. Similarly, multiplying 
+2 by -j rotates it -90° to the -j axis. Thus, j is considered a rotational operator.
Mathematically, the j operator has a value of 1-1. If +j2 is multiplied by j, you get
j22 = (1-1)(1-1)(2) = (-1)(2) = -2
This calculation effectively places the value on the negative real axis. Therefore, multi-
plying a positive real number by j2 converts it to a negative real number, which, in effect, 
is a rotation of 180° on the complex plane. This operation is illustrated in Figure 15–8.

Rectangular and Polar Forms
Rectangular and polar are two forms of complex numbers that are used to  represent 
phasor quantities. Each has certain advantages when used in circuit analysis, 
 depending on the particular application. A phasor quantity contains both mag-
nitude and angular position or phase. In this text, italic letters such as V and I are 
used to represent magnitude only, and boldfaced nonitalic letters such as V and I 
are used to represent complete phasor quantities.
Rectangular Form A phasor quantity is represented in rectangular form by the algebraic 
sum of the real value (A) of the coordinate and the j value (B) of the coordinate, expressed 
in the following general form:
A + jB
Examples of phasor quantities are 1 + j2, 5 - j3, -4 + j4, and -2 - j6, which are 
shown on the complex plane in Figure 15–9. As you can see, the rectangular coordi-
nates describe the phasor in terms of its values projected onto the real axis and the 
j axis. An “arrow” drawn from the origin to the coordinate point in the complex 
plane represents graphically the phasor quantity.
Polar Form Phasor quantities can also be expressed in polar form, which consists of 
the phasor magnitude (C) and the angular position relative to the positive real axis (u), 
expressed in the following general form:
C∠{u
Examples are 2∠45°, 5∠120°, 4∠-110°, and 8∠-30°. The first number is the mag-
nitude, and the symbol ∠ precedes the value of the angle. Figure 15–10 shows these 
phasors on the complex plane. The length of the phasor, of course, represents the

magnitude of the quantity. Keep in mind that for every phasor expressed in polar 
form, there is also an equivalent expression in rectangular form.
Conversion from Rectangular to Polar Form A phasor can exist in any of the four 
quadrants of the complex plane, as indicated in Figure 15–11. The phase angle u in 
each case is measured relative to the positive real axis (0°), and f (phi) is the angle in 
the 2nd and 3rd quadrants relative to the negative real axis, as shown below:
The first step to convert from rectangular form to polar form is to determine the 
magnitude of the phasor. A phasor can be visualized as forming a right triangle in the 
complex plane, as indicated in Figure 15–12, for each quadrant location. The horizontal 
side of the triangle is the real value, A, and the vertical side is the j value, B. The hypot-
enuse of the triangle is the length of the phasor, C, representing the magnitude, and can 
be expressed, using the Pythagorean theorem, as
Equation 15–1 
C = 2A2 + B2
Next, the angle u indicated in parts (a) and (d) of Figure 15–12 is expressed as an 
inverse tangent function.

u = tan-1a {B

The angle u indicated in parts (b) and (c) of Figure 15–12 is

Convert the following complex numbers from rectangular form to polar form by 
determining the magnitude and angle:
(a) 8 + j6 
(b) 10 - j5
 
Solution
(a) The magnitude of the phasor represented by 8 + j6 is

Since the phasor is in the first quadrant, use Equation 15–2. The angle is
u = tan-1a {B
A b = tan-1a6
8b = 36.9°
u is the angle relative to the positive real axis. The polar form of 8 + j6 is
C∠u = 10∠36.9°
(b) The magnitude of the phasor represented by 10 - j5 is
C = 2102 + (-5)2 = 1125 = 11.2
Since the phasor is in the fourth quadrant, use Equation 15–2. The angle is
u = tan-1a -5
10 b = -26.6°
u is the angle relative to the positive real axis. The polar form of 10 - j5 is
C∠u = 11.2∠∙26.6°

Convert the following polar quantities to rectangular form:
(a) 10∠30° 
(b) 200∠-45°
 
Solution
(a) The real part of the phasor represented by 10∠30° is

Multiplication Multiplication of two complex numbers in rectangular form is 
 accomplished by multiplying, in turn, each term in one number by both terms in the 
other number and then combining the resulting real terms and the resulting j terms 
(recall that j * j = -1). You can start with the “FOIL” rule for (First, Outside, 
Inside, Last). As an example,
(5 + j3)(2 - j4) = 10 - j20 + j6 + 12 = 22 - j14
Many calculators can perform mathematical operations on complex numbers. For 
example, on the TI-84, the terms are entered as shown above but the calculator uses i 
instead of j to represent values on the y-axis. (The multiply operation is implied.) For 
the TI-84, the i is selected by pressing

Solution
(a) (10∠45°)(5∠20°) = (10)(5)∠(45° + 20°) = 50∠65∙
(b) (2∠60°)(4∠-30°) = (2)(4)∠[60° + (-30°)] = 8∠30∙
 
Related Problem

Solution
(a) (3 + j4) - (1 + j2) = (3 - 1) + j(4 - 2) = 2 ∙j2
(b) (15 + j15) - (10 - j8) = (15 - 10) + j[15 - (-8)] = 5 ∙j23
 
Related Problem 
Subtract 3.5 - j4.5 from -10 - j9.
If your calculator does not work directly with complex numbers, multiplication of 
two complex numbers is easier when both numbers are in polar form, so it is best to 
convert to polar form before multiplying. The rule is
Multiply the magnitudes, and add the angles algebraically.

The Complex Number System  ●  655
Division Division of two complex numbers in rectangular form is accomplished by 
multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the 
denominator and then combining terms and simplifying. The complex conjugate of a 
number is found by changing the sign of the j term. As an example,
10 + j5
2 + j4 = (10 + j5)(2 - j4)
(2 + j4)(2 - j4) = 20 - j30 + 20
4 + 16
= 40 - j30
20
= 2 - j1.5
Alternatively, the problem can be entered into a calculator that performs complex 
arithmetic and solved directly.
If your calculator cannot represent complex numbers, division is easier when the 
numbers are in polar form, so it is best to convert to polar form before dividing. The 
rule is
Divide the magnitude of the numerator by the magnitude of the denominator to get 
the magnitude of the quotient. Then subtract the denominator angle from the numera-
tor angle to get the angle of the quotient.
Perform the following divisions:
(a) Divide 100∠50° by 25∠20°.
(b) Divide 15∠10° by 3∠-30°.
 
Solution
(a) 100∠50°

sinusoidal resPonse of series RC circuits
When a sinusoidal voltage is applied to a series RC circuit, each resulting 
 voltage drop and the current in the circuit are also sinusoidal and have the same 
frequency as the applied voltage. The capacitance causes a phase shift between 
the voltage and current that depends on the relative values of the resistance and 
the capacitive reactance.

As shown in Figure 15–14, the resistor voltage (VR), the capacitor voltage (VC), and 
the current (I) are all sine waves with the frequency of the source. Phase shifts are in-
troduced because of the capacitance. The resistor voltage and current lead the source 
voltage, and the capacitor voltage lags the source voltage. The phase angle between 
the current and the capacitor voltage is always 90°. These generalized phase relation-
ships are indicated in Figure 15–14.

The amplitudes and the phase relationships of the voltages and current depend on 
the values of the resistance and the capacitive reactance. When a circuit is purely resis-
tive, the phase angle between the applied (source) voltage and the total current is zero. 
When a circuit is purely capacitive, the phase angle between the applied voltage and 
the total current is 90°, with the current leading the voltage. When there is a combina-
tion of both resistance and capacitive reactance in a circuit, the phase angle between 
the applied voltage and the total current is somewhere between 0° and 90°, depending 
on the relative values of the resistance and the capacitive reactance.

iMPedance of series RC circuits
Impedance is the total opposition to sinusoidal current. Its unit is the ohm. The 
impedance of a series RC circuit consists of resistance and capacitive reactance. 
It causes a phase difference between the total current and the source voltage. 
Therefore, the impedance is a complex value that consists of a magnitude compo-
nent and a phase angle component.

In a purely resistive circuit, the impedance is simply equal to the total resistance. 
In a purely capacitive circuit, the impedance is equal to the total capacitive reactance. 
The impedance of a series RC circuit is determined by both the resistance and the 
 capacitive reactance. These cases are illustrated in Figure 15–15. The magnitude of

Equation 15–7
In ac analysis, both R and XC are as shown in the phasor diagram of Figure 15–17(a), 
with XC appearing at a -90° angle with respect to R. This relationship comes from the 
fact that the capacitor voltage in a series RC circuit lags the current, and thus the resistor 
voltage, by 90°. Since Z is the phasor sum of R and -jXC, its phasor representation is 
as shown in Figure 15–17(b). A repositioning of the phasors, as shown in part (c), forms 
a right triangle called the impedance triangle. The length of each phasor represents the 
magnitude in ohms, and the angle u is the phase angle of the RC circuit and represents 
the phase difference between the applied voltage and the current.

EXAMPLE 15–9
For each circuit in Figure 15–18, write the phasor expression for the impedance in 
both rectangular form and polar form.
 
Solution 
For the circuit in Figure 15–18(a), the impedance is
 Z = R - j0 = R = 56 𝛀  in rectangular form (XC = 0)
 Z = R∠0° = 56∠0∙ 𝛀  in polar form
The impedance is simply the resistance, and the phase angle is zero because pure 
resistance does not cause a phase shift between the voltage and current.
For the circuit in Figure 15–18(b), the impedance is
 Z = 0 - j XC = ∙j100 𝛀  in rectangular form (R = 0)
 Z = XC∠-90° = 100∠∙90∙ 𝛀  in polar form
The impedance is simply the capacitive reactance, and the phase angle is -90° 
 because the capacitance causes the current to lead the voltage by 90°.
For the circuit in Figure 15–18(c), the impedance in rectangular form is
Z = R - jXC = 56 𝛀∙j100 𝛀
The impedance in polar form is
 Z = 2R2 + X2
C∠-tan-1 aXC
R b
 = 2(56 Ω)2 + (100 Ω)2∠-tan-1 a100 Ω

Note that the unit (Ω) is written after the magnitude and angle for the result  
shown; however, some people prefer to write the unit with the magnitude  
(i.e., 115 Ω∠-60.8°). Either method is correct.
In this case, the impedance is the phasor sum of the resistance and the capacitive 
reactance. The phase angle is fixed by the relative values of XC and R. Rectangular to 
polar conversion can be done on a scientific calculator (refer to your user’s manual).

Ohm’s Law
The application of Ohm’s law to series RC circuits involves the use of the phasor 
quantities of Z, V, and I. Although rectangular forms directly represent the real (resis-
tive) and imaginary (reactive) components of electrical quantities, keep in mind that 
the use of boldface nonitalic letters indicates phasor quantities where both magnitude 
and angle are included. The three equivalent forms of Ohm’s law are as follows:
V = IZ
Equation 15–9
I = V
Z
Equation 15–10
Z = V
I
Equation 15–11
If you are not using a calculator that can do complex arithmetic, multiplication and 
division are most easily accomplished with the polar forms. Since Ohm’s law calcula-
tions involve multiplications and divisions, you should generally express the voltage, 
current, and impedance in polar form. The following two examples show the relation-
ship between the source voltage and source current. In Example 15–10, the current is 
the reference and in Example 15–11, the voltage is the reference. Notice that the refer-
ence is drawn along the x-axis in both cases. Rectangular form directly represents the 
real (resistive) and imaginary (reactive) components of electrical quantities, so it is a 
starting point for writing the impedance in the following examples.

Phase Relationships of Current and Voltages
In a series RC circuit, the current is the same through both the resistor and the 
 capacitor. Thus, the resistor voltage is in phase with the current, and the capacitor 
voltage lags the current by 90°. Therefore, there is a phase difference of 90° between 
the resistor voltage, VR, and the capacitor voltage, VC, as shown in the waveform dia-
gram of Figure 15–23.

age and current phasor diagram that represents the waveform diagram of Figure 15–23.
Variation of Impedance and Phase Angle with Frequency
As you know, capacitive reactance varies inversely with frequency. Since  
Z = 2R2 + X 2
C, you can see that when XC increases, the entire term under the 
square root sign increases and thus the magnitude of the total impedance also in-
creases; and when XC decreases, the magnitude of the total impedance also decreases. 
Therefore, in a series RC circuit, Z is inversely dependent on frequency.
Figure 15–26 illustrates how the voltages and current in a series RC circuit vary 
as the frequency increases or decreases, with the source voltage held at a constant 
value. In part (a), as the frequency is increased, XC decreases; so less voltage is 
dropped across the capacitor. Also, Z decreases as XC decreases, causing the current 
to  increase. An increase in the current causes more voltage across R.
In Figure 15–26(b), as the frequency is decreased, XC increases; so more voltage is 
dropped across the capacitor. Also, Z increases as XC increases, causing the current to 
decrease. A decrease in the current causes less voltage across R.
Changes in Z and XC can be observed as shown in Figure 15–27. As the frequency 
increases, the voltage across Z remains constant because Vs is constant. Also, the volt-
age across C decreases. The increasing current indicates that Z is decreasing. It does 
so because of the inverse relationship stated in Ohm’s law (Z = VZ/I). The increasing 
current also indicates that XC is decreasing (XC = VC/I). The decrease in VC corre-
sponds to the decrease in XC.

664  ●  RC Circuits
Since XC is the factor that introduces the phase angle in a series RC circuit, a change 
in XC produces a change in the phase angle. As the frequency is increased, XC becomes 
smaller, and thus the phase angle decreases. As the frequency is decreased, XC becomes 
larger, and thus the phase angle increases. The angle between Vs and VR is the phase 
angle of the circuit because I is in phase with VR. By measuring the phase of VR, you 
are effectively measuring the phase of I. An oscilloscope is normally used to observe 
the phase angle by measuring the phase angle between Vs and one of the component 
 voltages. You can also use the oscilloscope to observe a plot of the magnitude as a func-
tion of frequency by using a special function generator called a sweep generator to drive 
the circuit. In this case, the time base of the oscilloscope is converted to a frequency base.
Figure 15–28 uses the impedance triangle to illustrate the variations in XC, Z, and 
u as the frequency changes. Of course, R remains constant. The main point is that 
because XC varies inversely with the frequency, so also do the magnitude of the total 
impedance and the phase angle. Example 15–12 illustrates this.

Find the magnitude of the total impedance and the phase angle in Figure 15–29

A TI-84 Plus CE graphing calculator can be used to show how XC, Z, and u are depen-
dent on frequency. The values from Example 15–12 are used to illustrate this idea. For XC 
and Z, enter each equation separately and plot them both as shown in Figure 15–30(a). 
The red line represents the magnitude of XC and the blue line represents the magni-
tude of Z. Using the trace  function, you can read values for frequency and reactance or  
impedance. You can also view a table of values the calculator uses to draw the graph by 
selecting GRAPH-TABLE in the mode  menu. (Set up table parameters using

Figure 15–30(b) shows the result. Notice that at low frequencies, XC dominates the mag-
nitude of the impedance and at high frequencies, XC dominates the impedance. (Grid lines 
are at increments of f = 5,000 Hz and Z = 1,000 Ω.) You can also use the graphing cal-
culator to view how phase angle is affected by frequency in this example. Figure 15–30(c) 
shows the result. Grid lines in (c) are at increments of f = 5,000 Hz and u = 10°.
The RC Lag Circuit
An RC lag circuit is a phase shift circuit in which the output voltage lags the input  voltage 
by a specified amount. Figure 15–31(a) shows a series RC circuit with the output voltage 
taken across the capacitor. The source voltage is the input, Vin. As you know, u, the phase 
angle between the current and the input voltage, is also the phase angle between the resis-
tor voltage and the input voltage because VR and I are in phase with each other.
Since VC lags VR by 90°, the phase angle between the capacitor voltage and the input 
voltage is the difference between -90° and u, as shown in Figure 15–31(b). The capaci-
tor voltage is the output, and it lags the input, thus creating a basic lag circuit.
The input and output voltage waveforms of the lag circuit are shown in 
Figure 15–31(c). The amount of phase difference, designated f, between the input

and the output is dependent on the relative sizes of the capacitive reactance and the 
resistance, as is the magnitude of the output voltage.
Phase Difference Between Input and Output As already established, u is the phase 
angle between I and Vin. The angle between Vout and Vin is designated f (phi) and is 
developed as follows.
The polar expressions for the input voltage and the current are Vin∠0° and I∠u, 
respectively. The output voltage in polar form is
Vout = (I∠u)(XC∠-90°) = IXC∠(-90° + u)
The preceding equation states that the output voltage is at an angle of -90° + u with 
respect to the input voltage. Since u = -tan-1(XC/R), the angle f between the input 
and output is
f = -90° + tan-1aXC

age by a specified amount. When the output of a series RC circuit is taken across the resis-
tor rather than across the capacitor, as shown in Figure 15–35(a), it becomes a lead circuit.
EXAMPLE 15–14
For the lag circuit in Figure 15–33(b) (Example 15–13), determine the output volt-
age in phasor form when the input voltage has an rms value of 10 V. Draw the 
input and output voltage waveforms showing the proper phase relationship. The 
capacitive reactance XC (1.59 kΩ) and f (-23.1°) were found in Example 15–13.

Phase Difference Between Input and Output In a series RC circuit, the current 
leads the input voltage. Also, as you know, the resistor voltage is in phase with the 
current. Since the output voltage is taken across the resistor, the output leads the 
input, as indicated by the phasor diagram in Figure 15–35(b). The waveforms are 
shown in Figure 15–35(c).
As in the lag circuit, the amount of phase difference between the input and output 
and the magnitude of the output voltage in the lead circuit are dependent on the relative 
values of the resistance and the capacitive reactance. When the input voltage is assigned 
a reference angle of 0°, the angle of the output voltage is the same as u (the angle between 
total current and applied voltage) because the resistor voltage (output) and the current 
are in phase with each other. Therefore, since f = u in this case, the expression is
f = tan-1aXC
R b

This angle is positive because the output leads the input.

iMPedance and adMittance of Parallel RC circuits
Figure 15–38 shows a basic parallel RC circuit connected to an ac voltage source.
The expression for the total impedance is developed as follows, using complex 
numbers. Since there are only two circuit components, R and C, the total impedance 
can be found from the product-over-sum rule.
Z = (R∠0°)(XC∠-90°)

the denominator to polar form, you get

Conductance, Susceptance, and Admittance
Recall that conductance, G, is the reciprocal of resistance. The phasor expression for 
conductance is expressed as
G =
1
R∠0° = G∠0°
Two new terms are now introduced for use in parallel RC circuits. Capacitive 
susceptance (BC) is the reciprocal of capacitive reactance. The phasor expression for 
capacitive susceptance is
BC =
1
XC∠-90° = BC∠90° = +jBC

Impedance and Admittance of Parallel RC Circuits  ●  675
Admittance (Y) is the reciprocal of impedance. The phasor expression for admittance is
Y =
1
Z∠{u = Y∠∓u
The unit of each of these terms is the siemens (S), which is the reciprocal of the ohm.
In working with parallel circuits, it is often easier to use conductance (G), capaci-
tive susceptance (BC), and admittance (Y) rather than resistance (R), capacitive reac-
tance (XC), and impedance (Z). In a parallel RC circuit, as shown in Figure 15–40, 
the total admittance is simply the phasor sum of the conductance and the capacitive 
susceptance.

and the impedance of parallel components is best found by using polar form. The 
steps for analyzing a circuit with a series and a parallel component are illustrated in

angular form and the impedance of the parallel part in polar form. Next, convert the 
impedance of the parallel part to rectangular form and add it to the impedance of the 
series part. Once you determine the rectangular form of the total impedance, you can

late the current.

Example 15–23 shows two sets of series components in parallel. The approach is 
to first express each branch impedance in rectangular form and then convert each of 
these impedances to polar form. Next, calculate each branch current using polar no-
tation. Once you know the branch currents, you can find the total current by adding 
the two branch currents in rectangular form. In this particular case, the total imped-
ance is not required.

Measurement of Ztot
Now, let’s see how the value of Ztot for the circuit in Example 15–22 can be determined 
by measurement. First, the total impedance is measured as outlined in the following 
steps and as illustrated in Figure 15–55 (other ways are also possible):
Step 1:  Using a sine wave generator, set the source voltage to a known value (10 V) and 
the frequency to 5 kHz. If your generator is not accurate, then it is advisable 
to check the voltage with an ac voltmeter and the frequency with a frequency 
counter rather than relying on the marked values on the generator controls.
Calculate each branch current.
I1 = Vs

I2 = Vs
Z2
=
2∠0° V
59.3∠-37.6° Ω= 33.7∠37.6° mA
To get the total current, express each branch current in rectangular form so 
that they can be added.
I1 = 8.89 mA + j21.4 mA
I2 = 26.7 mA + j20.6 mA
The total current is
 Itot = I1 + I2
 = (8.89 mA + j21.4 mA) + (26.7 mA + j20.6 mA) = 35.6 mA + j42.0 mA
Converting Itot to polar form yields
Itot = 2(35.6 mA)2 + (42.0 mA)2∠tan-1a42.0 Ω
35.6 Ωb = 55.1 ∠ 49.7° mA

Step 2:  Connect an ac ammeter as shown in Figure 15–55, and measure the total 
current. Alternatively, you can measure the voltage across R1 with a volt-
meter and calculate the current.
Step 3: Calculate the total impedance by using Ohm’s law.
Measurement of Phase Angle, U
To measure the phase angle, the source voltage and the total current must be displayed 
on an oscilloscope screen in the proper time relationship. Two basic types of scope 
probes are available to measure the quantities with an oscilloscope: the voltage probe 
and the current probe. The current probe is a convenient device, but it is often not as 
readily available as a voltage probe. We will confine our phase measurement technique 
to the use of voltage probes in conjunction with the oscilloscope. Although there are 
special isolation methods, a typical oscilloscope voltage probe has two points that are 
connected to the circuit: the probe tip and the ground lead. Thus, all voltage measure-
ments must be referenced to ground.
Since only voltage probes are to be used, the total current cannot be measured 
directly. However, for phase measurement, the voltage across R1 is in phase with the 
total current and can be used to establish the phase angle of the current.
Before proceeding with the actual phase measurement, there is a problem with 
displaying VR1. If the scope probe is connected across the resistor, as indicated in 
Figure 15–56(a), the ground lead of the scope will short point B to ground, thus by-
passing the rest of the components and effectively removing them from the circuit 
electrically, as illustrated in Figure 15–56(b) (assuming that the scope is not isolated 
from power line ground).
To avoid this problem, you can switch the generator output terminals so that one 
end of R1 is connected to the ground terminal, as shown in Figure 15–57(a). Now the 
scope can be connected across it to display VR1, as indicated in Figure 15–57(b). The 
other probe is connected across the voltage source to display Vs as indicated. Now 
channel 1 of the scope has VR1 as an input, and channel 2 has Vs. The scope should be 
triggered from the source voltage (channel 2 in this case).
Before connecting the probes to the circuit, you should align the two horizontal 
lines (traces) so that they appear as a single line across the center of the scope screen. 
To do so, ground the probe tips and adjust the vertical position knobs to move the 
traces toward the center line of the screen until they are superimposed. This procedure

ensures that both waveforms have the same zero crossing so that an accurate phase 
measurement can be made.
Once you have stabilized the waveforms on the scope screen, you can measure the 
period of the source voltage. Next, use the Volts/Div controls to adjust the amplitudes 
of the waveforms until they both appear to have the same amplitude. Now, spread 
the waveforms horizontally by using the Sec/Div control to expand the distance be-
tween them. This horizontal distance represents the time between the two waveforms.  
The number of divisions between the waveforms along any horizontal lines times the 
Sec/Div setting is equal to the time between them, ∆t. Also, you can use the cursors to 
determine ∆t if your oscilloscope has this feature.
Once you have determined the period, T, and the time between the waveforms, ∆t, 
you can calculate the phase angle with the following equation:

When the resistance in a series RC circuit is greater than the capacitive reactance, 
more of the total energy delivered by the source is converted to heat by the resistance 
than is stored by the capacitor. Likewise, when the reactance is greater than the resis-
tance, more of the total energy is stored and returned than is converted to heat.
The formulas for power in a resistor, sometimes called true power (Ptrue), and the 
power in a capacitor, called reactive power (Pr), are restated here. The unit of true 
power is the watt, and the unit of reactive power is the VAR (volt-ampere reactive).
 
Ptrue = I 2R

Power Triangle for RC Circuits
The generalized impedance phasor diagram for a series RC circuit is shown in  
Figure 15–59(a). A phasor relationship for the powers can also be represented by a sim-
ilar diagram because the respective magnitudes of the powers, Ptrue and Pr, differ from  
R and XC by a factor of I 2. This is shown in Figure 15–59(b).
15–8 
Power in RC circuits
In a purely resistive ac circuit, all of the energy delivered by the source is dissi-
pated in the form of heat by the resistance. In a purely capacitive ac circuit, all  
of the energy delivered by the source is stored by the capacitor during a portion 
of the voltage cycle and then returned to the source during another portion of 
the cycle so that there is no net energy conversion to heat. When there is both 
resistance and capacitance, some of the energy is alternately stored and returned 
by the capacitance and some is dissipated by the resistance during each alteration. 
The amount of energy converted to heat is determined by the relative values of  
the resistance and the capacitive reactance.

Equation 15–30 
Pa = I 2Z
The power phasor diagram in Figure 15–59(b) can be rearranged in the form of a 
right triangle, as shown in Figure 15–59(c). This is called the power triangle. Using the 
rules of trigonometry, Ptrue can be expressed as
Ptrue = Pa cos u
Since Pa equals I 2Z or VI, the equation for the true power dissipation in an  
RC circuit can be written as
Equation 15–31 
Ptrue = VI cos u
where V is the applied voltage and I is the total current.
For the case of a purely resistive current, u = 0° and cos 0° = 1, so Ptrue equals VI. 
For the case of a purely capacitive circuit, u = 90° and cos 90° = 0, so Ptrue is zero. 
As you already know, there is no power dissipation in an ideal capacitor.
Power Factor
The term cos u is called the power factor and is stated as
Equation 15–32 
PF = cos u
As the phase angle between applied voltage and total current increases, the power 
factor decreases, indicating an increasingly reactive circuit. The smaller the power fac-
tor, the smaller the power dissipation.
The power factor can vary from 0 for a purely reactive circuit to 1 for a purely 
resistive circuit. In an RC circuit, the power factor is referred to as a leading power 
factor because the current leads the voltage.
Determine the power factor and the true power in the circuit of Figure 15–60.

Significance of Apparent Power
As mentioned, apparent power is the power that appears to be transferred between 
the source and the load, and it consists of two components—a true power component 
and a reactive power component.
In all electrical and electronic systems, it is the true power that does work. The 
reactive power is simply shuttled back and forth between the source and load. Ideally, 
in terms of performing useful work, all of the power transferred to the load should be 
true power and none of it reactive power. However, in most practical situations the 
load has some reactance associated with it, and therefore you must deal with both 
power components.
In Chapter 14, the use of apparent power in relation to transformers was discussed. 
For any reactive load, there are two components of the total current: the resistive 
component and the reactive component. If you consider only the true power (watts) 
in a load, you are dealing with only a portion of the total current that the load de-
mands from a source. In order to have a realistic picture of the actual current that a 
load will draw, you must consider apparent power (VA).
A source such as an ac generator can provide current to a load up to some  maximum 
value. If the load draws more than this maximum value, the source can be damaged. 
Figure 15–61(a) shows a 120 V generator that can deliver a maximum current of 5 A 
to a load. Assume that the generator is rated at 600 W and is connected to a purely 
 resistive load of 24 Ω (power factor of 1). The ammeter shows that the current is 5 A, 
and the wattmeter indicates that the power is 600 W. The generator has no problem 
under these conditions, although it is operating at maximum current and power.

Now, consider what happens if the load is changed to a reactive one with an 
 impedance of 18 Ω and a power factor of 0.6, as indicated in Figure 15–61(b). The 
current is 120 V/18 Ω= 6.67 A, which exceeds the maximum. Even though the watt-
meter reads 480 W, which is less than the power rating of the generator, the excessive 
current probably will cause damage. This illustration shows that a true power rating 
can be deceiving and is inappropriate for ac sources. The ac generator should be rated 
at 600 VA, a rating that manufacturers generally use, rather than 600 W.

The Phase Shift Oscillator
As you know, a series RC circuit will shift the phase of the output voltage by an 
amount that depends on the values of R and C and the frequency of the signal. This 
ability to shift phase depending on frequency is vital in certain feedback oscillator cir-
cuits. An oscillator is a circuit that generates a periodic waveform and is an important 
circuit for many electronic systems. You will study oscillators in a devices course, so 
the focus here is on the application of RC circuits for shifting phase. The requirement 
is that a fraction of the output of the oscillator is returned to the input (called “feed-
back”) in the proper phase to reinforce the input and sustain oscillations. Generally, 
the requirement is to feed back the signal with a total of 180° of phase shift.
A single RC circuit is limited to phase shifts that are smaller than 90°. The basic 
RC lag circuit discussed in Section 15–4 can be “stacked” to form a complex RC 
network as shown in Figure 15–63, which shows a specific circuit called a phase-shift 
 oscillator. The phase shift oscillator typically uses three equal-component RC circuits 
that produce the required 180° phase shift at a certain frequency, which will be the fre-
quency at which the oscillator works. The output of the amplifier is phase shifted by 
the RC network and returned to the input of the amplifier, which provides sufficient 
gain to maintain oscillations.

The RC Circuit as a Filter
Filters are frequency-selective circuits that permit signals of certain frequencies to 
pass from the input to the output while blocking all others. That is, all frequencies but 
the selected ones are filtered out. Filters are covered in greater depth in Chapter 18 but 
are introduced here as an application example.
Series RC circuits exhibit a frequency-selective characteristic and therefore act as 
basic filters. There are two types. The first one that we examine, called a low-pass 
filter, is realized by taking the output across the capacitor, just as in a lag circuit. The 
second type, called a high-pass filter, is implemented by taking the output across the 
resistor, as in a lead circuit.
Low-Pass Filter You have already seen what happens to the output magnitude and 
phase angle in a lag circuit. In terms of its filtering action, we are interested primarily 
in the variation of the output magnitude with frequency.
Figure 15–65 shows the filtering action of a series RC circuit using specific values 
for illustration. In part (a) of the figure, the input is zero frequency (dc). Since the 
capacitor blocks constant direct current, the output voltage equals the full value of 
the input voltage because there is no voltage dropped across R. Therefore, the circuit 
passes all of the input voltage to the output (10 V in, 10 V out).
In Figure 15–65(b), the frequency of the input voltage has been increased to 1 kHz, 
causing the capacitive reactance to decrease to 159 Ω. For an input voltage of 10 V rms,

the output voltage is approximately 8.46 V rms, which can be calculated using the 
 voltage-divider approach or Ohm’s law.
In Figure 15–65(c), the input frequency has been increased to 10 kHz, causing the 
capacitive reactance to decrease further to 15.9 Ω. For a constant input voltage of 
10 V rms, the output voltage is now 1.57 V rms.
As the input frequency is increased further, the output voltage continues to decrease 
and approaches zero as the frequency becomes very high, as shown in Figure 15–65(d).
A description of the circuit action is as follows: As the frequency of the input increases, 
the capacitive reactance decreases. Because the resistance is constant and the capacitive 
reactance decreases, the voltage across the capacitor (output voltage) also decreases ac-
cording to the voltage-divider principle. The input frequency can be increased until it 
reaches a value at which the reactance is so small compared to the resistance that the 
output voltage can be neglected because it is very small compared to the input voltage. 
At this value of frequency, the circuit is essentially completely blocking the input signal.
As shown in Figure 15–65, the circuit passes dc (zero frequency) completely. As 
the frequency of the input increases, less of the input voltage is passed through to the 
output; that is, the output voltage decreases as the frequency increases. It is apparent 
that the lower frequencies pass through the circuit much better than the higher fre-
quencies. This RC circuit is therefore a very basic form of low-pass filter.
The frequency response of the low-pass filter circuit in Figure 15–65 is shown in 
Figure 15–66 with a graph of output voltage magnitude versus frequency. This graph, 
called a response curve, indicates that the output decreases as the frequency increases. 
Notice that the frequency scale is logarithmic, which is typically the way frequency 
responses are drawn for filters.

High-Pass Filter Figure 15–67 illustrates high-pass filtering action, where the out-
put is taken across the resistor, just as in a lead circuit. When the input voltage is 
dc (zero frequency) in part (a), the output is zero volts because the capacitor blocks 
 direct current; therefore, no voltage is developed across R.
In Figure 15–67(b), the frequency of the input signal has been increased to 100 Hz 
with an rms value of 10 V. The output voltage is 0.627 V rms. Thus, only a small per-
centage of the input voltage appears on the output at this frequency.
In Figure 15–67(c), the input frequency is increased further to 1 kHz, causing 
more voltage to be developed across the resistor because of the further decrease in the 
 capacitive reactance. The output voltage at this frequency is 5.32 V rms. As you can see,  

Basic Applications  ●  697
the output voltage increases as the frequency increases. A value of frequency is 
reached at which the reactance is negligible compared to the resistance, and most of 
the input voltage appears across the resistor, as shown in Figure 15–67(d).
As illustrated, this circuit tends to prevent lower frequencies from appearing on the 
output but allows higher frequencies to pass through from input to output. Therefore, 
this RC circuit is a basic form of high-pass filter.
The frequency response of the high-pass filter circuit in Figure 15–67 is shown 
in Figure 15–68 with a graph of output voltage magnitude versus frequency. This 
response curve shows that the output increases as the frequency increases and then 
levels off and approaches the value of the input voltage.
The Cutoff Frequency and the Bandwidth of a Filter The frequency at which 
the capacitive reactance equals the resistance in a low-pass or high-pass RC filter 
is called the cutoff frequency and is designated fc. This condition is expressed as 
1/(2pfcC) = R. Solving for fc results in the following formula:

above fc are considered to be passed by the filter, and all those below fc are consid-
ered to be rejected. The reverse is true for a low-pass filter.
The range of frequencies that is considered to be passed by a filter is called the 
bandwidth. Figure 15–69 illustrates the bandwidth and the cutoff frequency for a low-
pass filter.
Coupling an AC Signal into a DC Bias Circuit
Figure 15–70 shows an RC circuit that is used to create a dc voltage level with an ac 
voltage superimposed on it. This type of circuit is commonly found in amplifiers in 
which the dc voltage is required to bias the amplifier to the proper operating point and 
the signal voltage to be amplified is coupled through a capacitor and superimposed 
on the dc level. The capacitor prevents the low internal resistance of the signal source 
from affecting the dc bias voltage.

In this type of application, a relatively large value of capacitance is selected so 
that for the frequencies to be amplified, the reactance is very small compared to the 
resistance of the bias network. When the reactance is very small (ideally zero), there 
is practically no phase shift or signal voltage dropped across the capacitor. Therefore, 
all of the signal voltage passes from the source to the input of the amplifier.

Figure 15–71 illustrates the application of the superposition principle to the circuit 
in Figure 15–70. In part (a), the ac source has been effectively removed from the cir-
cuit and replaced with a short to represent its ideal internal resistance (actual genera-
tors typically have 50 Ω or 600 Ω of internal resistance). Since C is open to dc, the 
voltage at point A is determined by the voltage-divider action of R1 and R2 and the 
dc voltage source.

In Figure 15–71(b), the dc source has been effectively removed from the circuit and

short at the frequency of the ac, the signal voltage is coupled directly to point A and 
appears across the parallel combination of R1 and R2.

Effect of an Open Resistor It is easy to see how an open resistor affects the opera-
tion of a basic series RC circuit, as shown in Figure 15–72. Obviously, there is no 
path for current, so the capacitor voltage remains at zero; thus, the total voltage, Vs, 
appears across the open resistor.

Effect of a Shorted Capacitor Capacitors rarely short, although SMD (surface-

a dc short due to dendritic growth between the internal electrodes (plates). In case 
of a short, the voltage across it is zero, the current equals Vs/R, and the total voltage 
 appears across the resistor, as shown in Figure 15–74.

Effect of a Leaky Capacitor When a large electrolytic capacitor exhibits a high leak-
age current, the leakage resistance effectively appears in parallel with the capacitor, as 
shown in Figure 15–75(a). When the leakage resistance is comparable in value to the 
circuit resistance, R, the circuit response is drastically affected. The circuit, looking 
from the capacitor toward the source, can be thevenized, as shown in Figure 15–75(b).

Other Troubleshooting Considerations
So far, you have learned about specific component failures and the associated voltage 
measurements. Many times, however, the failure of a circuit to work properly is not 
the result of a faulty component. A loose wire, a bad contact, or a poor solder joint 
can cause an open circuit. A short can be caused by a wire clipping or solder splash. 
Things as simple as not plugging in a power supply or a function generator happen 
more often than you might think. Wrong values in a circuit (such as an  incorrect 
 resistor value), the function generator set at the wrong frequency, or the wrong output 
connected to the circuit can cause improper operation.
When you have problems with a circuit, always check to make sure that the instru-
ments are properly connected to the circuits and to a power outlet. Also, look for 
obvious things such as a broken or loose contact, a connector that is not completely 
plugged in, or a piece of wire or a solder bridge that could be shorting something out.
The point is that you should consider all possibilities, not just faulty components, 
when a circuit is not working properly. The following example illustrates this approach 
with a simple circuit using the APM (analysis, planning, and measurement) method.
To determine the output voltage, find the Thevenin equivalent voltage.

Related Problem 
What would the output voltage be if the capacitor were not leaky?
The circuit represented by the schematic in Figure 15–77 has no output voltage, 
which is the voltage across the capacitor. You expect to see about 7.4 V at the  output.  
The circuit is physically constructed on a protoboard. Use your troubleshooting skills 
to find the problem.
EXAMPLE 15–28
 
Solution 
Apply the APM method to this troubleshooting problem.
Analysis: First think of the possible causes for the circuit to have no output voltage.
1. There is no source voltage or the frequency is so high that the capacitive 
reactance is almost zero.

Troubleshooting  ●  703
2. There is a short between the output terminals. Either the capacitor could be 
internally shorted, or there could be some physical short in the circuit.
3. There is an open between the source and the output. This would prevent  
current and thus cause the output voltage to be zero. The resistor could 
be open, or the conductive path could be open due to a broken or loose 
 connecting wire or a bad protoboard contact.
4. There is an incorrect component value. The resistor could be so large that  
the current and, therefore, the output voltage are negligible. The capacitor 
could be so large that its reactance at the input frequency is near zero.
Planning: You decide to make some visual checks for problems such as the 
function generator power cord not plugged in or the frequency set at an incor-
rect value. Also, broken leads, shorted leads, as well as an incorrect resistor 
color code or capacitor label often can be found visually. If nothing is discov-
ered after a visual check, then you will make voltage measurements to track 
down the cause of the problem. You decide to use a digital oscilloscope and a 
DMM to make the measurements.
Measurement: Assume that you find the function generator is plugged in and 
the frequency setting appears to be correct. Also, you find no visible opens or 
shorts during your visual check, and the component values are correct.
The first step in the measurement process is to check the voltage from the 
source with the scope. Assume a 10 V rms sine wave with a frequency of 5 kHz 
is observed at the circuit input as shown in Figure 15–78(a). The correct voltage 
is present, so the first possible cause has been eliminated.
Next, check for a shorted capacitor by disconnecting the source and plac-
ing a DMM (set on the ohmmeter function) across the capacitor. If the capaci-
tor is good, an open will be indicated by an OL (overload) in the meter display 
after a short charging time. Assume the ohmmeter indicates OL as shown in 
Figure 15–78(b). The second possible cause has been eliminated.
Since the voltage has been “lost” somewhere between the input and the 
output, you must now look for the voltage. Reconnect the source and measure 
the voltage across the resistor with the DMM (set on the voltmeter function) 
from one resistor lead to the other. The voltage across the resistor is zero. This 
means there is no current, which indicates an open somewhere in the circuit.
Now, begin tracing the circuit back toward the source looking for the 
 voltage (you could also start from the source and work forward). You can use  
either the scope or the DMM but decide to use the multimeter with one lead 
connected to ground and the other used to probe the circuit. As shown in  
Figure 15–78(c), the voltage on the right lead of the resistor, point ◆, reads zero. 
Since you already have measured zero voltage across the resistor, the voltage 
on the left resistor lead at point ◆ must be zero as the meter indicates. Next, 
moving the meter probe to point ◆, you read 10 V. You have found the voltage! 
Since there is zero volts on the left resistor lead, and there is 10 V at point ◆, 
one of the two contacts in the protoboard hole into which the wire leads are 
inserted is bad. It could be that the small contacts were pushed in too far and 
were bent or broken so that the circuit lead does not make contact.
Move either or both the resistor lead and the wire to another hole in the 
same row. Assume that when the resistor lead is moved to the hole just above, 
you have voltage at the output of the circuit (across the capacitor).

Application Activity  ●  705
Application Activity
In Chapter 12, you studied the 
capacitively coupled input to an 
amplifier with voltage-divider bias. In this application, the out-
put voltage and phase lag of a similar amplifier’s input circuit 
are examined to determine how they change with frequency. If 
too much voltage is dropped across the coupling capacitor, the 
overall performance of the amplifier is adversely affected.
As you learned in Chapter 12, the coupling capaci-
tor (C1) in Figure 15–79 passes the input signal voltage 
to the input of the amplifier (point A to point B) without 
affecting the dc level at point B produced by the resistive 
voltage divider (R1 and R2). If the input frequency is high 
enough so that the reactance of the coupling capacitor is 
negligibly small,  essentially no ac signal voltage is dropped 
across the capacitor. As the signal frequency is reduced, 
the capacitive reactance increases and more of the signal 
voltage is dropped across the capacitor. This lowers the 
overall voltage gain of the amplifier and thus degrades its 
performance.
The amount of signal voltage that is coupled from the 
input source (point A) to the amplifier input (point B) is 
determined by the values of the capacitor and the dc bias 
resistors (assuming the amplifier has no loading effect) in 
Figure 15–79. These components actually form a high-pass 
RC filter, as shown in Figure 15–80. The voltage-divider bias 
resistors are effectively in parallel with each other as far as 
the ac source is concerned because the power supply has zero 
internal resistance. The lower end of R2 goes to ground and

INTRODUCTION
In this chapter you will study series and parallel RL circuits. 
The analyses of RL and RC circuits are similar. The major 
 difference is that the phase responses are opposite; inductive 
reactance increases with frequency, while capacitive reactance 
decreases with frequency.
An RL circuit contains both resistance and inductance.  
In this chapter, basic series and parallel RL circuits and their 
responses to sinusoidal ac voltages are presented. Series- 
 parallel combinations are also analyzed. True, reactive, 
and apparent power in RL circuits are discussed and some 
basic RL circuit applications are introduced. Applications 
of RL  circuits include filters and switching regulators. 
Troubleshooting is also covered in this chapter.
COVERAGE OPTIONS
If you chose Option 1 to cover all of Chapter 15 on RC 
 circuits, then all of this chapter should be covered next.
If you chose Option 2 to cover reactive circuits beginning 
in Chapter 15 on the basis of the four major parts, then the 
appropriate part of this chapter should be covered next, 
 followed by the corresponding part in Chapter 17.

Part 
1
In an RL circuit, the resistor voltage and the current lag the source voltage. The 
inductor voltage leads the source voltage. Ideally, the phase angle between the cur-
rent and the inductor voltage is always 90°. These generalized phase relationships are 
indicated in Figure 16–1. Notice how they differ from those of the RC circuit that was 
discussed in Chapter 15.
The amplitudes and the phase relationships of the voltages and current depend 
on the values of the resistance and the inductive reactance. When a circuit is purely 
inductive, the phase angle between the applied voltage and the total current is 90°, 
with the current lagging the voltage. When there is a combination of both resistance 
and inductive reactance in a circuit, the phase angle is somewhere between 0° and 90°, 
depending on the relative values of the resistance and the inductive reactance.
Recall that practical inductors have winding resistance, capacitance between wind-
ings, and other factors that prevent an inductor from behaving as an ideal component. 
16–1 
sinusoidal resPonse of series RL circuits
As with the RC circuit, all currents and voltages in a series RL circuit are sinu-
soidal when the input voltage is sinusoidal. The inductance causes a phase shift 
between the voltage and the current that depends on the relative values of the 
resistance and the inductive reactance.
After completing this section, you should be able to

1. A 1 kHz sinusoidal voltage is applied to an RL circuit. What is the frequency of the 
resulting current?
2. When the resistance in an RL circuit is greater than the inductive reactance, is the 
phase angle between the applied voltage and the total current closer to 0° or to 90°?
The impedance of a series RL circuit is determined by the resistance and the inductive 
reactance. Inductive reactance is expressed as a phasor quantity in rectangular form as
XL = jXL

and jXL and is expressed as

Impedance in a series RL circuit.
In ac analysis, both R and XL are as shown in the phasor diagram of Figure 16–3(a), 
with XL appearing at a +90° angle with respect to R. This relationship comes from 
the fact that the inductor voltage leads the current, and thus the resistor voltage, by 
90°. Since Z is the phasor sum of R and jXL, its phasor representation is as shown in 
Figure 16–3(b). A repositioning of the phasors, as shown in part (c), forms a right 
triangle called the impedance triangle. The length of each phasor represents the mag-
nitude of the quantity, and u is the phase angle between the applied voltage and the 
current in the RL circuit.
16–2 
iMPedance of series RL circuits
The impedance of a series RL circuit consists of resistance and inductive reac-
tance and is the total opposition to sinusoidal current. Its unit is the ohm. The 
impedance also results in a phase difference between the total current and the 
source voltage. Therefore, the impedance consists of a magnitude component and 
a phase angle component and is represented as a phasor quantity.

2. What is the phase angle for circuit in Question 1?
3. A series RL circuit has a total resistance of 33 kΩ and an inductive reactance of

The impedance equals the inductive reactance in this case, and the phase angle is 
+90° because the inductance causes the current to lag the voltage by 90°.
For the circuit in Figure 16–4(c), the impedance in rectangular form is

Ohm’s Law
The application of Ohm’s law to series RL circuits involves the use of the phasor 
quantities of Z, V, and I. The three equivalent forms of Ohm’s law were stated in 
Chapter 15 for RC circuits. They apply also to RL circuits and are restated here:
V = IZ   I = V
Z   Z = V
I
Recall that since Ohm’s law calculations involve multiplication and division opera-
tions, you should express the voltage, current, and impedance in polar form.
The current in Figure 16–5 is expressed in polar form as I = 0.2∠0° mA. 
Determine the source voltage expressed in polar form, and draw a phasor diagram 
showing the relationship between the source voltage and the current.
EXAMPLE 16–2
 
Solution 
The magnitude of the inductive reactance is
XL = 2pfL = 2p(10 kHz)(100 mH) = 6.28 kΩ
The impedance in rectangular form is
Z = R + jXL = 10 kΩ+ j6.28 kΩ
Converting to polar form yields
Z = 2R2 + X2
L∠tan-1aXL
R b
= 2(10 kΩ)2 + (6.28 kΩ)2∠tan-1a6.28 kΩ

Use Ohm’s law to determine the source voltage.
Vs = IZ = (0.2∠0° mA)(11.8∠32.1° kΩ) = 2.36∠32.1∙ V
The magnitude of the source voltage is 2.36 V at an angle of 32.1° with respect to 
the current; that is, the voltage leads the current by 32.1°, as shown in the phasor 
diagram of Figure 16–6.

Phase Relationships of Current and Voltages
In a series RL circuit, the current is the same through both the resistor and the inductor. 
Thus, the resistor voltage is in phase with the current, and the inductor voltage leads the 
current by 90°. Therefore, there is a phase difference of 90° between the resistor voltage, 
VR, and the inductor voltage, VL, as shown in the waveform diagram of Figure 16–7.

From Kirchhoff’s voltage law, the sum of the voltage drops must equal the applied 
voltage. However, since VR and VL are not in phase with each other, they must be 
added as phasor quantities with VL leading VR by 90°, as shown in Figure 16–8(a). As 
shown in part (b), Vs is the phasor sum of VR and VL.

Analysis of Series RL Circuits  ●  731
Since the resistor voltage and the current are in phase, u is also the phase angle 
between the source voltage and the current. Figure 16–9 shows a voltage and current 
phasor diagram that represents the waveform diagram of Figure 16–7.
Variation of Impedance and Phase Angle with Frequency
The impedance triangle is useful in visualizing how the frequency of the applied voltage 
affects the RL circuit response. As you know, inductive reactance varies directly with 
frequency. When XL increases, the magnitude of the total impedance also increases; 
and when XL decreases, the magnitude of the total impedance decreases. Thus, Z is 
directly dependent on frequency. The phase angle u also varies directly with frequency 
because u = tan-1(XL/R). As XL increases with frequency, so does u, and vice versa.
The impedance triangle is used in Figure 16–10 to illustrate the variations in XL, Z,

A graphing calculator can be used to show how XL, Z, and u are dependent on 
frequency. The values from Example 16–3 are used to illustrate this idea. For XL and 
Z, enter each equation separately and plot them both as shown in Figure 16–12(a). 
The red line represents the magnitude of XL, and the blue line represents the mag-
nitude of Z. Using the

tance or impedance. You can view a table of values the calculator uses to draw the

R dominates the magnitude of the impedance; and at high frequencies, XL domi-
nates the impedance. (Grid lines in [a] and [b] are at increments of f = 5,000 Hz and 
Z = 1,000 Ω.) You can also use the graphing calculator to view how phase angle is 
affected by frequency in this example as shown in Figure 16–12(c). Grid lines in (c)

was taken across the resistor. The source voltage is the input, Vin. As you know, u is the 
angle between the current and the input voltage; it is also the angle between the resis-
tor voltage and the input voltage because VR and I are in phase.
Since VL leads VR by 90°, the phase angle between the inductor voltage and the 
input voltage is the difference between 90° and u, as shown in Figure 16–13(b). 
The inductor voltage is the output; it leads the input, thus creating a basic lead 
circuit.
The input and output voltage waveforms of the lead circuit are shown in Figure 
16–13(c). The amount of phase difference, designated f, between the input and the 
output is dependent on the relative values of the inductive reactance and the resis-
tance, as is the magnitude of the output voltage.
Phase Difference Between Input and Output The angle between Vout and Vin is 
designated f (phi) and is developed as follows. The polar expressions for the input 
voltage and the current are Vin∠0° and I∠-u, respectively. The output voltage in 
polar form is
Vout = (I∠-u)(XL∠90°) = IXL∠(90° - u)
This expression shows that the output voltage is at an angle of 90° - u with respect 
to the input voltage. Since u = tan-1(XL /R), the angle f between the input and 
output is
f = 90° - tan-1aXL

magnitude, visualize the RL lead circuit as a voltage divider. A portion of the total

Phase Difference Between Input and Output In a series RL circuit, the current 
lags the input voltage. Since the output voltage is taken across the resistor, the output 
lags the input, as indicated by the phasor diagram in Figure 16–17(b). The waveforms 
are shown in Figure 16–17(c).
As in the lead circuit, the amount of phase difference between the input and out-
put and the magnitude of the output voltage in the lag circuit are dependent on the 
relative values of the resistance and the inductive reactance. When the input voltage 
is assigned a reference angle of 0°, the angle of the output voltage (f) with respect to 
the input voltage equals u because the resistor voltage (output) and the current are in 
phase with each other. The expression for the angle between the input voltage and the

Conversion from Parallel to Series Form
In Section 15–6, you saw how to convert a parallel RC circuit to an equivalent series 
RC circuit for a given frequency. The same basic procedure can be accomplished for a 
parallel RL circuit at a specific frequency. To obtain the equivalent series circuit for a 
given parallel RL circuit, first find the impedance. Writing the impedance in rectangu-
lar notation results in the equivalent series resistor and the equivalent series inductive 
reactance as given by the following equations:
Req = Z cos u
Equation 16–13
XL1eq2 = Z sin u

the applied voltage. The inductor current is 80 mA and lags the applied voltage 
by 90°. The total current is 96.8 mA and lags the voltage by 55.7°. The phasor

Analysis of series-parallel RL circuits uses complex mathematics that was intro-
duced in Section 15–1. Graphing calculators such as the TI-84 Plus CE, can handle the 
standard add, subtract, multiply and divide operations of complex numbers in either 
rectangular or polar form, so they do not require making tedious conversions between 
forms. In this section, we show the procedure for detailed solution of series-parallel 
RL circuits for cases where you are not using a calculator that can do complex math.
Recall that the impedance of series components is most easily expressed in rectangular 
form and that the impedance of parallel components is best found by using polar form. 
The steps for analyzing a circuit with a series and a parallel component are illustrated in 
Example 16–14. First express the impedance of the series part of the circuit in rectangu-
lar form and the impedance of the parallel part in polar form. Next, convert the imped-
ance of the parallel part to rectangular form and add it to the impedance of the series 
part. Once you determine the rectangular form of the total impedance, you can convert it 
to polar form in order to see the magnitude and phase angle and to calculate the current.

Solution 
(a) First, calculate the magnitudes of inductive reactance.
XL1 = 2pfL1 = 2p(500 kHz)(2.5 mH) = 7.85 kΩ
XL2 = 2pf L2 = 2p(500 kHz)(1mH) = 3.14 kΩ
One approach is to find the impedance of the series portion and the impedance of 
the parallel portion and combine them to get the total impedance. The impedance 
 of the series combination of R1 and L1 is
Z1 = R1 + jXL1 = 4.7 kΩ+ j7.85 kΩ
To determine the impedance of the parallel portion, first determine the admittance 
of the parallel combination of R2 and L2.

The series portion and the parallel portion are in series with each other.  
Combine Z1 and Z2 to get the total impedance.
Ztot = Z1 + Z2
 = (4.7 kΩ+ j7.85 kΩ) + (1.57 kΩ+ j1.65 kΩ) = 6.27 kΩ+ j9.50 kΩ

When the resistance in a series RL circuit is greater than the inductive reactance, 
more of the total energy delivered by the source is converted to heat by the resistance 
than is stored by the inductor. Likewise, when the reactance is greater than the resis-
tance, more of the total energy is stored and returned than is converted to heat.
As you know, the power dissipation in a resistance is called the true power. 
The power in an inductor is reactive power and is expressed as
16–7 
Power in RL circuits
In a purely resistive ac circuit, all of the energy delivered by the source is dis-
sipated in the form of heat by the resistance. In a purely inductive ac circuit, all 
of the energy delivered by the source is stored by the inductor in its magnetic 
field during a portion of the voltage cycle and then returned to the source 
during another portion of the cycle so that there is no net energy conversion 
to heat. When there is both resistance and inductance, some of the energy is 
stored and returned by the inductance and some is dissipated by the resistance 
on each alteration. The amount of energy converted to heat is determined by 
the relative values of the resistance and the inductive reactance.

Recall that the power factor equals the cosine of u (PF = cos u). As the phase 
angle between the applied voltage and the total current increases, the power factor 
decreases, indicating an increasingly reactive circuit. A smaller power factor indices 
less true power and more reactive power.
Significance of the Power Factor
As you learned in Chapter 15, the power factor (PF) is important in determining how much 
useful power (true power) is transferred to a load. The highest power factor is 1, which

indicates that all of the current to a load is in phase with the voltage (resistive). When the 
power factor is 0, all of the current to a load is 90° out of phase with the voltage (reactive).
In industrial systems with inductive loads (such as motors), a certain amount of 
reactive power is needed that is stored in the magnetic field. However, in general a 
power factor as close to 1 as possible is desirable because then most of the power trans-
ferred from the source to the load is the useful or true power. True power goes only 
one way—from source to load—and performs work on the load in terms of  energy 
 dissipation. Reactive power simply goes back and forth between the source and the 
load with no net work being done. Energy must be used in order for work to be done.
Many practical loads have inductance as a result of their particular function, and 
it is essential for their proper operation. Examples are transformers, electric motors, 
light ballasts, and speakers, to name a few. Therefore, inductive (and capacitive) loads 
are important considerations.
To see the effect of the power factor on system requirements, refer to Figure 16–39. 
This figure shows a representation of a typical inductive load consisting effectively 
of inductance and resistance in parallel. Part (a) shows a load with a relatively low 
power factor (0.75), and part (b) shows a load with a relatively high power factor 
(0.95). Both loads dissipate equal amounts of power as indicated by the wattmeters. 
Thus, an equal amount of work is done on both loads.

Illustration of the effect of the power factor on system requirements such as source rating (VA) and 
conductor size.
Although both loads are equivalent in terms of the amount of work done (true 
power), the low power factor load in Figure 16–39(a) draws more current from the 
source than does the high power factor load in Figure 16–39(b), as indicated by the 
ammeters. Therefore, the source in part (a) must have a higher VA rating than the one 
in part (b). Also, the lines connecting the source to the load in part (a) must be a larger 
wire gauge than those in part (b), a condition that becomes significant when very long 
transmission lines are required, such as in power distribution. In this case, the reactive 
power can be converted to I 2R loss in wiring, another undesirable aspect to a low PF.
Figure 16–39 has demonstrated that a higher power factor is an advantage in deliv-
ering power more efficiently to a load.
Power Factor Correction
The power factor of an inductive load can be increased by the addition of a capacitor 
in parallel, as shown in Figure 16–40. The capacitor compensates for the phase lag 
of the total current by creating a capacitive component of current that is 180° out of 
phase with the inductive component. This has a canceling effect and reduces the phase 
angle and the total current and increases the power factor, as illustrated in the figure.

754  ●  RL Circuits
The RL Circuit as a Filter
As with RC circuits, series RL circuits also exhibit a frequency-selective characteristic 
and therefore act as basic filters.
Low-Pass Filter You have seen what happens to the output magnitude and phase 
angle in a lag circuit. In terms of the filtering action, the variation of the magnitude of 
the output voltage as a function of frequency is important.
Figure 16–41 shows the filtering action of a series RL circuit using specific values 
for purposes of illustration. In part (a) of the figure, the input is zero frequency (dc). 
Since the inductor ideally acts as a short to constant direct current, the output voltage 
equals the full value of the input voltage (neglecting the winding resistance). Therefore, 
the circuit passes all of the input voltage to the output (10 V in, 10 V out).
In Figure 16–41(b), the frequency of the input voltage has been increased to 1 kHz, 
causing the inductive reactance to increase to 62.8 Ω. For an input voltage of 10 V rms,  
the output voltage is approximately 9.9 V rms, which can be calculated using the 
 voltage-divider approach or Ohm’s law.

In Figure 16–41(c), the input frequency has been increased to 10 kHz, causing the 
inductive reactance to increase further to 628 Ω. For a constant input voltage of 10 V 
rms, the output voltage is now 4.65 V rms.
As the input frequency is increased further, the output voltage continues to  
decrease as shown in Figure 16–41(d) for f = 50 kHz. To see the frequency response, 
you can input the values given into the basic voltage divider equation (using complex

reactance increases, the voltage across the inductor increases and that across the resistor 
(output voltage) decreases. The input frequency can be increased until it reaches a value 
at which the reactance is so large compared to the resistance that the output voltage can 
be neglected because it becomes very small compared to the input voltage.
As shown in Figure 16–41, the circuit passes dc (zero frequency) completely. As the 
frequency of the input increases, less of the input voltage is passed through to the output. 
That is, the output voltage decreases as the frequency increases. This RL circuit is there-
fore a basic type of low-pass filter.
High-Pass Filter Figure 16–43 illustrates high-pass filtering action, where the output 
is taken across the inductor. When the input voltage is dc (zero frequency) in part (a), 
the output is zero volts because the inductor ideally appears as a short across the output.
In Figure 16–43(b), the frequency of the input signal has been increased to 1 kHz 
with an rms value of 10 V. The output voltage is 1.87 V rms. Thus, only a small per-
centage of the input voltage appears at the output at this frequency.
In Figure 16–43(c), the input frequency is increased further to 10 kHz, causing more 
voltage to be developed as a result of the increase in the inductive reactance. The output 
voltage at this frequency is 8.85 V rms. As you can see, the output voltage increases as the 
frequency increases. A value of frequency is reached at which the reactance is very large 
compared to the resistance and most of the input voltage appears across the inductor. 
This is the case at 50 kHz, where the output is 9.95 V as shown in Figure 16–43(d).
This circuit tends to prevent lower frequency signals from appearing on the output 
but permits higher frequency signals to pass through from input to output; thus, it is 
a basic type of high-pass filter.

The Switching Regulator
In high-frequency switching power supplies, small inductors are used as an essen-
tial part of the filter section. A switching power supply is much more efficient at 
converting ac to dc than any other type of supply. For this reason it is widely used 
in computers and other electronic systems. A switching regulator precisely controls 
the dc voltage. One type of switching regulator is shown in Figure 16–45. It uses 
an electronic switch to change unregulated dc to high-frequency pulses. The output 
is the average value of the pulses. The pulse width is controlled by the pulse width 
modulator, which rapidly turns on and off a transistor switch and then is filtered 
by the filter section to produce regulated dc. (Ripple in the figure is exaggerated to 
show the cycle.) The pulse width modulator can increase pulse width if the output 
drops, or decrease it if the output rises, thus maintaining a constant average output 
for varying conditions.

an inductor, and a capacitor. The diode is a one-way device for current that you will 
study in a devices course. In this application, the diode acts as an on-off switch that 
allows current in only one direction.
An important component of the filter section is the inductor, which in this type 
of regulator will always have current in it. The average voltage and the load resistor

determine the amount of current. Recall that Lenz’s law states that an induced voltage 
is created across a coil that opposes a change in current. When the transistor switch 
is closed, the pulse is high and current is passed through the inductor and the load, as 
shown in Figure 16–46(a). The diode is off at this time. Notice that the inductor has 
an induced voltage across it that opposes a change in current. When the pulse goes 
low, as in Figure 16–46(b), the transistor is off and the inductor develops a voltage in 
the opposite direction than before. The diode acts as a closed switch, which provides 
a path for current. This action tends to keep the load current constant. The capacitor 
adds to this smoothing action by charging and discharging a small amount during 
the process.

Troubleshooting  ●  759
Effect of an Open Inductor The most common failure mode for inductors occurs 
when the winding opens as a result of excessive current or a mechanical contact 
 failure. It is easy to see how an open coil affects the operation of a basic series RL 
circuit, as shown in Figure 16–47. Obviously, there is no current path; therefore, the 
resistor voltage is zero, and the total applied voltage appears across the inductor. 
An open connection or a shorted resistor could also account for the source voltage 
appearing across the inductor. If you suspect an open coil, remove one or both leads 
from the circuit and check continuity with an ohmmeter.

Effect of an open resistor.
Open Components in Parallel Circuits In a parallel RL circuit, an open resistor 
or inductor will cause the total current to decrease because the total impedance will 
increase. Obviously, the branch with the open component will have zero current. 
Figure 16–49 illustrates these conditions.

760  ●  RL Circuits
Effect of an Inductor with Shorted Windings Although a rare occurrence, it is 
possible for some of the windings of coils to short together as a result of damaged 
 insulation. This failure mode is much less likely than the open coil and is difficult to 
detect. Shorted windings may result in a reduction in inductance because the induc-
tance of a coil is proportional to the square of the number of turns. A short between 
windings effectively reduces the number of turns, which may or may not have an 
 adverse effect on the circuit depending on the number of turns that are shorted.
Other Troubleshooting Considerations
The failure of a circuit to work properly is not always the result of a faulty compo-
nent. A loose wire, a bad contact, or a poor solder joint can cause an open circuit. 
A short can be caused by a wire clipping or solder splash. Things that can go wrong 
include not plugging in a power supply or a function generator or setting up a mea-
suring instrument incorrectly such as setting a DMM to dc when ac is wanted. Wrong 
values in a circuit (such as an incorrect resistor value), the function generator set at 
the wrong frequency, or the wrong output connected to the circuit can also cause 
 improper operation.
An LCR meter is a quick way to check an inductor for an incorrect value. 
Figure  16–50 shows an example of an auto-ranging source-measurement type of 
meter. The meter generates an ac signal that is across the component under test and 
measures the voltage and current. The impedance is calculated indirectly from the 
voltage and current measurements and can be shown on the display or converted to 
an inductance value for the display. To measure an inductor, the user must isolate the 
component from the circuit and select a test frequency; the test frequency should be as 
close as possible to the normal operating frequency. The user also selects an equiva-
lent series or parallel circuit for the inductor’s resistance. From this, the LCR meter 
can determine and show the Q for the inductor at the test frequency as well as other 
information.
Always check to make sure that the instruments are properly connected to the cir-
cuits and to a power outlet if required. Also, look for obvious things such as a broken 
or loose contact, a connector that is not completely plugged in, or a piece of wire or a 
solder bridge that could be shorting something out.
A consideration in high-speed circuits is the circuit traces can look like transmis-
sion lines, where inductance and resistance are distributed continuously along the line 
rather than acting as discrete components. The circuit in the following example repre-
sents a simulation of a very long transmission line using a series of discrete elements 
to represent the line. The repeated elements model the distributed reactance of the line

and allow observation of the propagation of a signal along the line. The simulation 
was constructed on a protoboard. The fact that it is constructed on a protoboard is 
a consideration in troubleshooting it. The troubleshooting approach to the is to use 
APM (analysis, planning, and measurement) method and half-splitting.
The circuit represented by the schematic in Figure 16–51 has no output voltage. 
The circuit is physically constructed on a protoboard. Use your trouble-shooting 
skills to find the problem.
 
Solution 
Apply the APM method to this troubleshooting problem.
Analysis: First think of the possible causes for the circuit to have no output voltage.
1. There is no source voltage or the frequency is so high that the inductors appear to be 
open because their reactances are extremely high compared to the resistance values.
2. There is a short between one of the resistors and ground. Either a resistor 
could be shorted, or there could be some physical short. A shorted resistor is 
not a common fault.
3. There is an open between the source and the output. This would prevent cur-
rent and thus cause the output voltage to be zero. An inductor could be open, 
or the conductive path could be open due to a broken or loose connecting wire 
or a bad protoboard contact.
4. There is an incorrect component value. A resistor could be so small that the 
voltage across it is negligible. An inductor could be so large that its reactance at 
the input frequency is extremely high.
5. If the circuit is newly constructed and has never worked, it could be mis-wired. 
A careful visual check may show the problem.
Planning: You decide to make some visual checks for problems such as the func-
tion generator power cord not plugged in or the frequency set at an incorrect 
value. Also, broken leads, shorted leads, as well as an incorrect resistor color code 
or inductor value often can be found visually. If nothing is discovered after a 
visual check, then you will make voltage measurements to track down the cause 
of the problem. You decide to use a digital oscilloscope and a DMM to make the 
measurements using the half-splitting technique to more quickly isolate the fault.
Measurement: Assume that you find the function generator is plugged in and the 
frequency setting appears to be correct. Also, you find no visible opens or shorts 
during your visual check, and the component values are correct.
The first step in the measurement process is to check the voltage from the 
source with the scope. Assume a 10 V rms sine wave with a frequency of 5 kHz is 
observed at the circuit input as shown in Figure 16–52(a). The correct ac voltage is 
present, so the first possible cause has been eliminated.
Next, check for a short by disconnecting the source and placing the DMM 
(set on the ohmmeter function) across each resistor. If any resistor is shorted

(unlikely), the meter will read zero or a very small resistance. Assuming the meter 
readings are okay, the second possible cause has been eliminated.
Since the voltage has been “lost” somewhere between the input and the output, 
you must now look for the voltage. You reconnect the source and, using the half-
splitting approach, measure the voltage at point   (the middle of the circuit) with 
respect to ground. The DMM test lead is placed on the right lead of inductor L2,

as indicated in Figure 16–52(b). Assume the voltage at this point is zero. This tells 
you that the part of the circuit to the right of point   is probably okay and the 
fault is in the circuit between point   and the source.
Now, you begin tracing the circuit back toward the source looking for the 
voltage (you could also start from the source and work forward). Placing the 
 meter test lead on point  , at the left lead of inductor L2, results in a reading  
of 8.31 V as shown in Figure 16–52(b). This, of course, indicates that L2 is open. 
Fortunately, in this case, a component, and not a contact on the board, is faulty.  
It is usually easier to replace a component than to repair a bad contact.

INTRODUCTION
In this chapter, the analysis methods learned in Chapters 15 
and 16 are extended to the coverage of circuits with combi-
nations of resistive, inductive, and capacitive components. 
Series and parallel RLC circuits, plus series-parallel combina-
tions, are studied.
Circuits with both inductance and capacitance can exhibit 
the property of resonance, which is important in many types 
of applications. Resonance is the basis for frequency selectiv-
ity in communication systems. For example, the ability of a 
radio or television receiver to select a certain frequency that 
is transmitted by a particular station and, at the same time, 
to eliminate frequencies from other stations is based on the 
principle of resonance. The conditions in RLC circuits that 
produce resonance and the characteristics of resonant circuits 
are covered in this chapter.
COVERAGE OPTIONS
If you chose Option 1 to cover all of Chapter 15 and all of 
Chapter 16, then all of this chapter should be covered next.
If you chose Option 2 to cover reactive circuits in 
Chapters 15 and 16 on the basis of the four major parts, then 
the appropriate part of this chapter should be covered next, 
followed by the next part in Chapter 15, if applicable.

Part  
1
series circuits
A series RLC circuit is shown in Figure 17–1. It contains resistance, inductance, 
and capacitance.
As you know, inductive reactance (XL) causes the total current to lag the applied 
voltage. Capacitive reactance (XC) has the opposite effect: It causes the current to lead 
the voltage. Thus XL and XC tend to offset each other. When they are equal, they can-
cel, and the total reactance is zero. In any case, the magnitude of the total reactance 
in the series circuit is
Equation 17–1 
Xtot = ∙XL - XC ∙ 
The term ∙XL - XC ∙ means the absolute value of the difference of the two reactances. 
That is, the sign of the result is considered positive no matter which reactance is 
greater. For example, 3 - 7 = -4, but the absolute value is
∙3 - 7∙= 4
In a series circuit, when XL 7 XC, the circuit is predominantly inductive, and when 
XC 7 XL, the circuit is predominantly capacitive.
The total impedance for the series RLC circuit is stated in rectangular form in 
Equation 17–2 and in polar form in Equation 17–3.
17–1 iMPedance of series RLC circuits
A series RLC circuit contains resistance, inductance, and capacitance. Since  
inductive reactance and capacitive reactance have opposite effects on the circuit 
phase angle, the total reactance is less than either individual reactance.

2p(100 kHz)(470 pF) = 3.39 kΩ
XL = 2pfL = 2p(100 kHz)(10 mH) = 6.28 kΩ
In this case, XL is greater than XC, and thus the circuit is more inductive than 
capacitive. The magnitude of the total reactance is
Xtot = ∙XL - XC∙= ∙6.28 kΩ- 3.39 kΩ∙= 2.89 kΩ  inductive
The impedance in rectangular form is
Z = R + ( jXL - jXC) = 5.60 kΩ+ ( j6.28 kΩ- j3.39 kΩ) = 5.60 kΩ∙j2.90 kΩ

The positive angle shows that the circuit is inductive.
 
Related Problem* 
Determine Z in polar form if f is increased to 200 kHz.
 
*Answers are at the end of the chapter.
For the series RLC circuit in Figure 17–2, determine the total impedance. Express 
it in both rectangular and polar forms.
As you have seen, in a series circuit when the inductive reactance is greater than 
the capacitive reactance, the circuit appears inductive; so the current lags the applied 
voltage. When the capacitive reactance is greater, the circuit appears capacitive, and 
the current leads the applied voltage.
In Equation 17–3, 2R2 + (XL - XC)2 is the magnitude and tan-1(Xtot/R) is the 
phase angle between the total current and the applied voltage. If the circuit is pre-
dominately inductive, the phase angle is positive; and if predominately capacitive, the 
phase angle is negative.

780  ●  RLC Circuits and Resonance
Figure 17–3 shows that for a typical series RLC circuit, the total reactance  behaves 
as follows: Starting at a very low frequency, XC is high, and XL is low, and the  circuit 
is predominantly capacitive. As the frequency is increased, XC decreases and XL 
 increases until a value is reached where XC = XL and the two reactances cancel, mak-
ing the circuit purely resistive. This condition is series resonance and will be studied 
in Section 17–3. As the frequency is increased further, XL becomes greater than XC, 
and the circuit is predominantly inductive. Example 17–2 illustrates how the imped-
ance and phase angle change as the source frequency is varied.
The graph of XL is a straight line, and the graph of XC is curved, as shown in 
Figure 17–3. The general equation for a straight line is y = mx + b, where m is the 
slope of the line and b is the y-axis intercept point. The formula XL = 2pfL fits this 
general straight-line formula, where y = XL (a variable), m = 2pL (a constant), 
x = f  (a variable), and b = 0 as follows: XL = 2pLf + 0.
The XC curve is called a hyperbola, and the general equation of a hyperbola is xy = k. 
The equation for capacitive reactance, XC = 1/2pfC, can be rearranged as XC f = 1/2pC 
where x = XC (a variable), y = f  (a variable), and k = 1/2pC (a constant).
SECTION 17–1 
CHECKUP
Answers are at the end of the 
chapter.
1. In a given series RLC circuit, XC is 150 Ω and XL is 80 Ω. What is the total reactance 
in ohms? Is the circuit inductive or capacitive?
2. Determine the impedance in polar form for the circuit in Question 1 when 
R = 47 Ω. What is the magnitude of the impedance? What is the phase angle? Is 
the current leading or lagging the applied voltage?

The simplest way to solve a problem like this is with a graphing calculator. The first

At f = 1 kHz,
 XC =

2pfC =

2p(1 kHz)(0.022 mF) = 7.23 kΩ
 XL = 2pfL = 2p(1 kHz)(100 mH) = 628 Ω
The circuit is clearly capacitive, and the impedance is
Z = 2R2 + (XL - XC)2∠-tan-1aXtot
R b
= 2(3.3 kΩ)2 + (628 Ω- 7.23 kΩ)2∠-tan-1a6.60 kΩ
3.3 kΩb = 7.38∠∙63.5∙ k𝛀
The negative sign for the angle is used to indicate that the circuit is capacitive.
The TI-84 Plus CE is used to illustrate the solution. Start by entering the 
equations for capacitive reactance, inductive reactance, total impedance, and 
phase angle. Use the y=  key to enter the equations as shown in Figure 17–5. Y1 
is the equation for capacitive reactance, Y2 is inductive reactance, Y3 is the  total 
impedance and Y4 is the phase angle. The independent variable X stands for 
 frequency. Set up the table start and increments using the window menu. Start  
at X 1frequency2 = 0 and use increments (Xscl) of 1,000.

Analysis of Series RLC Circuits  ●  783
In a series RLC circuit, the capacitor voltage and the inductor voltage are always 
180∘ out of phase with each other. For this reason, VC and VL subtract from each 
other, and thus the voltage across L and C combined is always less than the larger 
individual voltage across either element, as illustrated in Figure 17–9 and in the wave-
form diagram of Figure 17–10.
In the next example, Ohm’s law is used to find the current and voltages in a series 
RLC circuit.

VCL is the algebraic sum of VL and VC. 
Because of the phase relationship, VL 
and VC effectively subtract.
Notice how the circuit changed from capacitive to inductive as the frequency 
increased. The phase condition changed from the current leading to the current 
lagging as indicated by the sign of the angle. Note that the impedance magnitude 
decreased to a minimum equal to the resistance and then began increasing again. 
Also, notice that the negative phase angle decreased as the frequency increased 
and the angle became positive when the circuit became inductive and then 
 increased with increasing frequency.

Solution 
First, find the total impedance.
Z = R + jXL - jXC = 75 kΩ+ j25 kΩ- j60 kΩ= 75 kΩ- j35 kΩ
Convert to polar form for convenience in applying Ohm’s law.

= 2(75 kΩ)2 + (35 kΩ)2∠-tan-1a35 kΩ

where Xtot = ∙XL - XC∙.
Apply Ohm’s law to find the current.
I = Vs
Z =

82.8∠-25° kΩ= 121∠25.0∙ MA
Now, apply Ohm’s law to find the voltages across R, L, and C.
VR = IR = (121∠25.0° mA)(75∠0° kΩ) = 9.06∠25.0∙ V
VL = IXL = (121∠25.0° mA)(25∠90° kΩ) = 3.02∠115∙ V
VC = IXC = (121∠25.0° mA)(60∠-90° kΩ) = 7.25∠∙65.0∙ V
The phasor diagram is shown in Figure 17–12. The magnitudes represent rms 
values. Notice that VL is leading VR by 90∘, and VC is lagging VR by 90∘. Also, there 
is a 180∘ phase difference between VL and VC. If the current phasor were shown,

purely resistive impedance. In a series RLC circuit, the total impedance was given in

At resonance, XL = XC and the j terms cancel; thus, the impedance is purely  resistive. 
These resonant conditions are stated in the following equations:
XL = XC
Zr = R
XL and XC Cancel at Resonance
At the series resonant frequency ( fr), the voltages across C and L are equal in magni-
tude because the reactances are equal. The same current is through both since they are 
in series (IXC = IXL). Also, VL and VC are always 180∘ out of phase with each other.
During any given cycle, the polarities of the voltages across C and L are opposite, 
as shown in parts (a) and (b) of Figure 17–15. The equal and opposite voltages across 
C and L cancel, leaving zero volts from point A to point B as shown. Since there is no 
voltage drop from A to B but there is still current, the total reactance must be zero, as 
indicated in part (c). Also, the voltage phasor diagram in part (d) shows that VC and 
VL are equal in magnitude and 180∘ out of phase with each other.

XL = XC at the resonant frequency. Thus, XC = XL = 500 𝛀. The impedance at 
resonance is

Current and Voltages in a Series RLC Circuit
At the series resonant frequency, the current is maximum (Imax = Vs/R). Above and 
below resonance, the current decreases because the impedance increases. This is 
 because at resonance XT is zero and the total impedance is R. Above and below reso-
nance, the total series reactance XT is not zero. A response curve showing the plot of 
current versus frequency is shown in Figure 17–17(a). The resistor voltage, VR, follows 
the current and is maximum (equal to Vs) at resonance and zero at f = 0 and at f = ∞, 
as shown in Figure 17–17(b). The general shapes of the VC and VL curves are indicated 
in Figure 17–17(c) and (d). Notice that VC = Vs when f = 0, because the capacitor 
appears open. Also notice that VL approaches Vs as f approaches infinity, because the 
inductor appears open. The voltage across the C and L combination  decreases as the 
frequency increases below resonance, reaching a minimum of zero at the resonant fre-
quency; then it increases above resonance, as shown in Figure 17–17(e).

VR = Vs at resonance, as indicated in Figure 17–18. Individually, VL and VC can be 
much greater than the source voltage, as you will see later. Keep in mind that VL and

Series Resonance  ●  789
Series RLC Impedance
At frequencies below fr, XC 7 XL; thus, the circuit is capacitive. At the reso-
nant frequency, XC = XL, so the circuit is purely resistive. At frequencies above 
fr, XL 7 XC; thus, the circuit is inductive. Notice that this is the result observed in 
Example 17–2.
The impedance magnitude is minimum at resonance (Z = R) and increases in value 
above and below the resonant point. The graph in Figure 17–20 illustrates how imped-
ance changes with frequency. At zero frequency, both XC and Z are infinitely large 
and XL is zero because the capacitor looks like an open at 0 Hz and the inductor looks 
like a short. As the frequency increases, XC decreases and XL increases. Since XC is 
larger than XL at frequencies below fr, Z decreases along with XC. At fr, XC = XL and 
Z = R. At frequencies above fr, XL becomes increasingly larger than XC, causing Z to 
increase.
 
Solution 
At resonance, I is maximum and equal to Vs/R.
I = Vs
R =

1.5 kΩ= 3.33 mA
Apply Ohm’s law to obtain the voltage magnitudes.
VR = IR = (3.33 mA)(1.5 kΩ) = 5.08 V
VL = IXL = (3.33 mA)(1 kΩ) = 3.33 V
VC = IXC = (3.33 mA)(1 kΩ) = 3.33 V
Notice that all of the source voltage is dropped across the resistor. Also, of course, 
VL and VC are equal in magnitude but opposite in phase. This causes these voltages 
to cancel, making the total reactive voltage zero.

2p(4.03 kHz)(0.01 mF) = 3.95 kΩ

Therefore, the impedance at fr - 1 kHz is
Z = 2R2 + (XL - XC)2 = 2(100 Ω)2 + (2.53 kΩ- 3.95 kΩ)2 = 1.42 k𝛀

2p(6.03 kHz)(0.01 mF) = 2.64 kΩ
XL = 2p(6.03 kHz)(100 mH) = 3.79 kΩ
Therefore, the impedance at fr + 1 kHz is
Z = 2(100 Ω)2 + (3.79 kΩ- 2.64 kΩ)2 = 1.16 k𝛀
In part (b) Z is capacitive, and in part (c) Z is inductive.

 because XL 7 XC. However, in a parallel circuit, the smaller quantity has the

at 40 kHz?

SECTION 17–4 
CHECKUP
1. In a certain parallel RLC circuit, the capacitive reactance is 600 Ω, and the inductive 
reactance is 1,000 Ω. Is the circuit predominantly capacitive or inductive?
2. Determine the admittance of a parallel circuit in which R = 1.0 kΩ, XC = 500 Ω,
and XL = 1.2 kΩ.
3. In Question 2, what is the impedance?
Recall that capacitive reactance varies inversely with frequency and that inductive 
reactance varies directly with frequency. In a parallel RLC circuit at low frequencies, 
the inductive reactance is less than the capacitive reactance; therefore, the circuit is 
inductive. As the frequency is increased, XL increases and XC decreases until a value 
is reached where XL = XC. This is the point of parallel resonance. As the frequency 
is increased further, XC becomes smaller than XL, and the circuit becomes capacitive.
Current Relationships
In a parallel RLC circuit, the current in the capacitive branch and the current in the 
inductive branch are always 180∘ out of phase with each other (neglecting any coil 
resistance). Because IC and IL add algebraically, the total current is actually the differ-
ence in their magnitudes. Thus, the total current into the parallel branches of L and C 
is always less than the largest individual branch current, as illustrated in Figure 17–28 
and in the waveform diagram of Figure 17–29. Of course, the current in the resistive 
branch is always 90∘ out of phase with both reactive currents, as shown in the current

is plotted on the negative y-axis.

Parallel Resonance  ●  799
Condition for Ideal Parallel Resonance
Ideally, parallel resonance occurs when XC = XL. The frequency at which resonance 
occurs is called the resonant frequency, just as in the series case. When XC = XL, the 
two branch currents, IC and IL, are equal in magnitude, and, of course, they are always 
180∘ out of phase with each other. Thus, the two currents cancel and the total current 
is zero, as shown in Figure 17–33.
Since the total current is zero, the impedance of the ideal parallel LC circuit is  
infinitely large (∞). These ideal resonant conditions are stated as follows:
XL = XC
Zr =
∞
Parallel Resonant Frequency
For an ideal (no resistance) parallel resonant circuit, the frequency at which resonance 
occurs is determined by the same formula as in series resonant circuits; that is,
fr =
1
2p1LC
Tank Circuit
The parallel resonant LC circuit is often called a tank circuit. The term tank circuit 
refers to the fact that the parallel resonant circuit stores energy in the magnetic field of 
the coil and in the electric field of the capacitor. The stored energy is transferred back 
and forth between the capacitor and the coil on alternate half-cycles as the current 
goes first one way and then the other when the inductor deenergizes and the capacitor 
charges, and vice versa. This concept is illustrated in Figure 17–34.

Energy storage in an ideal parallel resonant tank circuit.
At very low frequencies, XL is very small and XC is very high, so the total imped-
ance is essentially equal to that of the inductive branch. As the frequency goes up, the 
impedance also increases, and the inductive reactance dominates (because it is less 
than XC) until the resonant frequency is reached. At this point, of course, XL ≅XC 
(for Q 7 10) and the impedance is at its maximum. As the frequency goes above 
resonance, the capacitive reactance dominates (because it is less than XL) and the 
impedance decreases.
Recall that Example 17–9 illustrated the admittance curve as a function of fre-
quency. The impedance curve is obtained easily by calculating the reciprocal of 
the admittance curve. Figure 17–36(a) shows the equations from Example 17–9 
with the addition of the equation for the impedance, which is Y6 (which has been 
selected). You can see a plot of impedance for the circuit by changing the plot 
parameters and pressing graph. The grid lines are set at 10 kHz per division in X 
and 500 Ω per division in Y. The calculator can also find the resonant frequency 
by looking for the maximum point using the calculate menu (press

Current and Phase Angle at Resonance
In the ideal tank circuit, the total current from the source at resonance is zero because 
the impedance is infinite. In the nonideal case when the winding resistance is consid-
ered, there is some total current at the resonant frequency, and it is determined by the 
impedance at resonance.

Converting to rectangular form yields
Z2 = Z2cos u + jZ2sin u
 = (447 Ω)cos(-63.4°) + j447 sin(-63.4°) = 200 Ω- j400 Ω
The total impedance Ztot in rectangular form is
Ztot = Z1 + Z2 = (1,000 Ω+ j500 Ω) + (200 Ω- j400 Ω) = 1,200 Ω+ j100 Ω
Converting to polar form yields
Ztot = 2(1,200 Ω)2 + (100 Ω)2∠tan-1a 100 Ω
1,200 Ωb = 1204∠4.76° Ω
Now apply the voltage-divider formula to get VC.
VC = a Z2
Ztot
bVs = a447∠-63.4° Ω
1204∠4.76° Ωb5∠0° V = 1.86∠∙68.2∙ V
Therefore, VC is 1.86 V and lags Vs by 68.2∘.
The +j term in Ztot, or the positive angle in its polar form, indicates that 
the circuit is more inductive than capacitive. However, it is just slightly more 
inductive because the angle is small. This result may surprise you, because 
XC = XL = 500 Ω. However, the capacitor is in parallel with a resistor, so the 
capacitor actually has less effect on the total impedance than does the inductor. 
Figure 17–39 shows the phasor relationship of VC and Vs. Although XC = XL, this 
circuit is not at resonance because the j term of the total impedance is not zero 
due to the parallel combination of R2 and XC. You can see this by noting that the 
phase angle associated with Ztot is 4.76∘ and not zero.

tion is in parallel with R1. Call this impedance from point A to ground, ZA. To

bandwidth of resonant circuits
The current in a series RLC is maximum at the resonant frequency because the 
reactances cancel. The current in a parallel RLC is minimum at the resonant 
frequency because the inductive and capacitive currents cancel. This circuit 
 behavior relates to a characteristic called bandwidth.

Series Resonant Circuits
The current in a series RLC circuit is maximum at the resonant frequency (also known 
as center frequency) and drops off on either side of this frequency. Bandwidth, some-
times abbreviated BW, is an important characteristic of a resonant circuit. The band-
width is the range of frequencies for which the current is equal to or greater than 
70.7% of its resonant value.
Figure 17–51 illustrates bandwidth on the response curve of a series RLC circuit. 
Notice that the frequency f1 below fr is the point at which the current is 0.707Imax and 
is commonly called the lower critical frequency. The frequency f2 above fr, where the 
current is again 0.707Imax, is the upper critical frequency. Other names for f1 and f2 are 
-3 dB frequencies, cutoff frequencies, and half-power frequencies. The significance of 
the latter term is discussed later in the chapter.

Parallel Resonant Circuits
For a parallel resonant circuit, the impedance is maximum at the resonant frequency; 
so the total current is minimum. The bandwidth can be defined in relation to the 
impedance curve in the same manner that the current curve was used in the series 
circuit. Of course, fr is the frequency at which Z is maximum; f1 is the lower critical 
frequency at which Z = 0.707Zmax; and f2 is the upper critical frequency at which 
again Z = 0.707Zmax. The bandwidth is the range of frequencies between f1 and f2, 
as shown in Figure 17–52.
A certain series resonant circuit has a maximum current of 100 mA at the reso-
nant frequency. What is the value of the current at the critical frequencies?
 
Solution 
Current at the critical frequencies is 70.7% of maximum.
If 1 = If 2 = 0.707Imax = 0.707(100 mA) = 70.7 mA

Bandwidth of the parallel resonant 
response curve for Ztot.
Recall that in a parallel resonant circuit, the admittance is a minimum at reso-
nance. Because admittance is the reciprocal of impedance, you can also use the admit-
tance curve to determine the bandwidth. In this case, the critical frequencies are at 
Y =  1.41Ymin.
Formula for Bandwidth
The bandwidth for either series or parallel resonant circuits is the range of frequen-
cies between the critical frequencies for which the response curve (I or Z) is 0.707 of 
the maximum value. Thus, the bandwidth is actually the difference between f2 and f1.
The circuit in Example 17–9 has a lower critical frequency of 31.8 kHz and 
an upper critical frequency of 39.8 kHz.From this information, determine the 
 bandwidth and the ideal center (resonant) frequency.
EXAMPLE 17–17
Equation 17–18 
BW = f2 - f1
Ideally, fr is the center frequency and can be calculated as follows:
Equation 17–19 
fr = f1 + f2

Solution 
Half-Power Frequencies
As previously mentioned, the upper and lower critical frequencies are sometimes 
called the half-power frequencies. This term is derived from the fact that the power 
from the source at these frequencies is one-half the power delivered at the resonant 
frequency. The following shows that this is true for a series circuit. The same end result 
also applies to a parallel circuit. At resonance,
Pmax = I 2
maxR
The power at f1 or f2 is
Pf1 = I 2
f1R = (0.707Imax)2R = (0.707)2I 2
maxR = 0.5I 2
maxR = 0.5Pmax
Selectivity
The response curves in Figures 17–51 and 17–52 are also called selectivity curves. 
Selectivity defines how well a resonant circuit responds to a certain frequency and 
discriminates against all others. The narrower the bandwidth, the greater the selectivity.
Ideally, we assume that a resonant circuit accepts frequencies within its bandwidth 
and completely eliminates frequencies outside the bandwidth. Such is not actually the 
case, however, because signals with frequencies outside the bandwidth are not com-
pletely eliminated. Their magnitudes, however, are greatly reduced. The further the 
frequencies are from the critical frequencies, the greater the reduction, as illustrated in 
Figure 17–53(a). An ideal selectivity curve is shown in Figure 17–53(b).
Another factor that influences selectivity is the steepness of the slopes of the 
 response curve. The faster the curve drops off at the critical frequencies, the more 
selective the circuit is because it tends to respond only to the frequencies within 
 BW = f2 - f1 = 39.8 kHz - 31.8 kHz = 8.0 kHz
 fr = f1 + f2

= 39.8 kHz + 31.8 kHz

A higher value of circuit Q results in a narrower bandwidth. A lower value of Q causes

816  ●  RLC Circuits and Resonance
Wave Trap
A wave trap is resonant circuit designed to pass certain frequencies and block others. 
They are commonly used in communication systems to block interference. Wave traps 
are also used by electric utilities to allow power lines to double as communication 
lines between substations. The power line frequency (50 or 60 Hz) will pass but the 
high frequency communication signal is blocked. The wave trap is part of a system 
called power line carrier communications (PLCC). In the case of electric utilities, wave 
traps are basically parallel resonant circuits installed on the power lines to block the 
 communication signals from being passed to the power distribution portion of the 
substation. Figure 17–56 illustrates basic wave traps for a PLCC applications.

Tuned Amplifiers
A tuned amplifier is a circuit that amplifies signals within a specified band. Typically, a 
parallel resonant circuit is used in conjunction with an amplifier to achieve the selec-
tivity. In terms of the general operation, input signals with frequencies that range over 
a wide band are accepted on the amplifier’s input and are amplified. The resonant 
circuit allows only a relatively narrow band of those frequencies to be passed on. The 
variable capacitor allows tuning over the range of input frequencies so that a desired 
frequency can be selected, as indicated in Figure 17–57.
Antenna Input to a Receiver
Radio signals are sent out from a transmitter via electromagnetic waves that propa-
gate through the atmosphere. When the electromagnetic waves cut across the receiv-
ing antenna, small voltages are induced. Out of all the wide range of electromagnetic 
frequencies, only one frequency or a limited band of frequencies must be extracted.

by a transformer. A variable capacitor is connected across the transformer secondary 
to form a parallel resonant circuit.
Audio Crossover Networks
Most stereo systems have speakers designed for specific parts of the audio frequency 
spectrum. Audio crossover networks are filter networks that separate the audio sig-
nal into different frequency bands for the speakers while maintaining an overall flat 
 response. Crossover networks can be passive (meaning only inductors, capacitors, and 
resistors are used) or active (meaning transistor and operational amplifiers are used).
A three-way passive network includes a band-pass filter that is essentially a low-Q 
resonant filter designed to have a broad flat response. The design of passive crossover 
networks is complicated because of various factors that affect the overall response 
(such as variations of the speaker’s impedance as a function of frequency), but the 
basic concept is simple. The network separates the audio spectrum into three parts 
and passes each part to the appropriate speaker, as indicated in Figure 17–59. The 
network has three filters: a high-pass filter (usually only a single mylar or polystyrene 
capacitor) that passes high frequencies to the tweeter (or high-frequency speaker), a 
band-pass filter that passes middle frequencies to the mid-range speaker, and a low-
pass filter that passes low frequencies to the woofer (or low-frequency speaker).

Superheterodyne Receiver
Another example of resonant circuit (filter) applications is in the common AM  (amplitude 
modulation) receiver. The AM broadcast band ranges from 535 kHz to 1605 kHz. Each 
AM station is assigned a 10 kHz bandwidth within that range. The tuned circuits are 

818  ●  RLC Circuits and Resonance
designed to pass only the signals from the desired radio station, rejecting all others. To 
reject stations outside the one that is tuned, the tuned circuits must be selective, passing 
on only the signals in the 10 kHz band and rejecting all others. Too much selectivity is not 
desirable either, however. If the bandwidth is too narrow, some of the higher frequency 
modulated signals will be rejected, resulting in a loss of fidelity. Ideally, the resonant cir-
cuit must reject signals that are not in the desired passband. A simplified block diagram 
of a superheterodyne AM receiver is shown in Figure 17–60.
There are basically three parallel resonant circuits in the front end of the receiver. 
Each of these resonant circuits is gang-tuned by capacitors; that is, the capacitors 
are mechanically or electronically linked together so that they change together as the 
 tuning knob is turned. The front end is tuned to receive a desired station, for example, 
one that transmits at 600 kHz. The input resonant circuit from the antenna and the 
RF (radio frequency) amplifier resonant circuit select only a frequency of 600 kHz 
out of all the frequencies crossing the antenna.
The actual audio (sound) signal is carried by the 600 kHz carrier frequency by 
modulating the amplitude of the carrier so that it follows the audio signal as indi-
cated. The variation in the amplitude of the carrier corresponding to the audio signal 
is called the envelope. The 600 kHz is then applied to a circuit called the mixer.
The local oscillator (LO) is tuned to a frequency that is 455 kHz above the selected 
frequency (1055 kHz, in this case). By a process called heterodyning or beating, the AM 
signal and the local oscillator signal are mixed together, and the 600 kHz AM signal is 
converted by the mixer to a 455 kHz AM signal (1055 kHz - 600 kHz = 455 kHz).
The 455 kHz is the intermediate frequency (IF) for standard AM receivers. No 
matter which station within the broadcast band is selected, its frequency is always 
converted to the 455 kHz IF. The amplitude-modulated IF is amplified by the IF am-
plifier which is tuned to 455 kHz. The output of the IF amplifier is applied to an audio 
detector which removes the IF, leaving only the envelope which is the audio signal. 
The audio signal is then amplified and applied to the speaker.

Application Activity
In the Chapter 11 application 
 activity, you worked with a re-
ceiver system to learn basic ac measurements. In this chapter, the 
receiver is again used to illustrate one application of resonant 
circuits. We will focus on a part of the “front end” of the re-
ceiver system that contains resonant circuits. Generally, the front 
end includes the RF amplifier, the local oscillator, and the mixer. 
In this application activity, the RF amplifier is the focus. A 
knowledge of amplifier circuits is not necessary at this time.
A basic block diagram of an AM radio receiver is shown 
in Figure 17–61. In this particular system, the “front end” 
includes the circuitry used for tuning in a desired  broadcasting 
station by frequency selection and then converting that 
 selected frequency to a standard intermediate frequency (IF). 
AM radio stations transmit in the frequency range from 
535 kHz to 1605 kHz. The purpose of the RF amplifier is to 
take the signals picked up by the antenna, reject all but the sig-
nal from the desired station, and amplify it to a higher level.
A schematic of the RF amplifier is shown in Figure 17–62. 
The parallel resonant tuning circuit consists of L, C1, and C2. 
This particular RF amplifier does not have a resonant circuit 
on the output. C1 is a varactor, which is a semiconductor 
device that you will learn more about in a later course. All that 
you need to know at this point is that the varactor is basically a 
variable capacitor whose capacitance is varied by changing the 
dc voltage across it. In this circuit, the dc voltage comes from 
the wiper of the potentiometer used for tuning the receiver.
The voltage from the potentiometer can be varied from 
+1 V to +9 V. The particular varactor used in this circuit can 
be varied from 200 pF at 1 V to 5 pF at 9 V. The capacitor C2 
is a trimmer capacitor that is used for initially adjusting the 
resonant circuit. Once it is preset, it is left at that value. C1 and 
C2 are in parallel and their capacitances add to produce the 
total capacitance for the resonant circuit. C3 has a minimal 
effect on the resonant circuit and can be ignored. The purpose 
of C3 is to allow the dc voltage to be applied to the varactor 
while providing an ac ground.
In this application activity, you will focus on the RF 
amplifier circuit board in Figure 17–63. Although all of the 
amplifier components are on the board, the part that you  
are to focus on is the resonant circuit indicated by the 
 highlighted area.

Capacitance in the Resonant Circuit
1. Calculate a capacitance setting for C2 that will ensure a 
complete coverage of the AM frequency band as the varac-
tor is varied over its capacitance range. C3 can be ignored. 
The full range of resonant frequencies for the tuning circuit 
should more than cover the AM band, so that at the maxi-
mum varactor capacitance, the resonant frequency will be 
less than 535 kHz and at the minimum varactor capaci-
tance, the resonant frequency will be greater than 1605 kHz.
2. Using the value of C2 that you have calculated,  determine 
the values of the varactor capacitance that will produce a 
resonant frequency of 535 kHz and 1605 kHz, respectively.
Testing the Resonant Circuit
3. Suggest a procedure for testing the resonant circuit using 
the instruments in the test bench setup of Figure 17–64. 
Develop a test setup by creating a point-to-point hook-
up of the board and the instruments.
4. Using the graph in Figure 17–65 that shows the variation 
in varactor capacitance versus varactor voltage, deter-
mine the resonant frequency for each indicated setting 
from the B outputs of the dc power supply (rightmost 
output terminals). The A output of the power supply is 
used to provide 9 V to the amplifier. The B output of 
the power supply is used to simulate the potentiometer 
voltage.

INTRODUCTION
The concept of filters was introduced in Chapters 15, 16, and 
17 to illustrate applications of RC, RL, and RLC circuits. This 
chapter is essentially an extension of the earlier material 
and provides additional coverage of the important topic of 
filters.
Passive filters are discussed in this chapter. Passive filters 
use various combinations of resistors, capacitors, and induc-
tors. In a later course, you will study active filters that use 
passive components combined with amplifiers. You have 
already seen how basic RC, RL, and RLC circuits can be used 
as filters. Now, you will learn that passive filters can be 
placed in four general categories according to their response 
characteristics: low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, and band-
stop. Within each category, there are several common types 
that will be examined.

834  ●  Passive Filters
Figure 18–1 shows a block diagram and a general response curve for a low-pass 
filter. The range of frequencies passed by a filter within specified limits is called the 
passband of the filter. The point considered to be the upper end of the passband is at 
the critical frequency, fc, as illustrated in Figure 18–1(b). The critical frequency (  fc) 
is the frequency at which the filter’s output voltage is 70.7% of the maximum. The 
filter’s critical frequency is also called the cutoff frequency, break frequency, or -3 dB 
frequency because the output voltage is down 3 dB from its passband amplitude at 
this frequency. The term dB (decibel) is a commonly used unit in filter measurements.
Decibels
The basis for the decibel unit stems from the logarithmic response of the human ear 
to the intensity of sound. The decibel is a logarithmic measurement of the ratio of one 
power to another or one voltage to another, which can be used to express the input-
to-output relationship of a filter. The following equation expresses a power ratio in 
decibels:
dB = 10 log aPout

Low-Pass Filters  ●  835
From the properties of logarithms, the following decibel formula for a voltage ratio 
is derived. (This equation is based on the assumption that Vin and Vout are measured 
across the same value of resistance.)
RC Low-Pass Filter
A basic RC low-pass filter is shown in Figure 18–2. Notice that the output voltage is 
taken across the capacitor.
When the input is dc (0 Hz), the output voltage equals the input voltage because 
XC is infinitely large. As the input frequency is increased, XC decreases and, as a  
result, Vout gradually decreases until a frequency is reached where XC = R. This is the 
critical frequency, fc, of the filter.
dB = 20 log aVout

At a certain frequency, the output voltage of a filter is 5 V and the input is 10 V.

These calculations show that the output is 70.7% of the input when XC = R. The fre-
quency at which this occurs is, by definition, the critical frequency.
The ratio of output voltage to input voltage at the critical frequency can be 
 expressed in decibels as follows:
Vout = 0.707Vin

836  ●  Passive Filters
Roll-Off of the Response Curve
The blue line in Figure 18–3 shows an actual response curve for a low-pass filter. The 
maximum output is defined to be 0 dB as a reference. Zero decibels corresponds to 
Vout = Vin because 20 log(Vout/Vin) = 20 log 1 = 0 dB.  The output drops from 0 dB to 
-3 dB at the critical frequency and then continues to decrease at a fixed rate. This pat-
tern of decrease is called the roll-off of the frequency response. The red line shows an 
ideal output response that is considered to be “flat” out to the critical frequency. The 
output then decreases at the fixed rate.
Determine the critical frequency and Vout at fc for an input of 10 V for the RC 
low-pass filter in Figure 18–2.
 
Solution 
fc =
1
2pRC =
1
2p(100 Ω)(0.0047 mF) = 339 kHz

Related Problem 
A certain RC low-pass filter has R = 1.0 kΩ and C = 0.022 mF. Determine its 
critical frequency.
EXAMPLE 18–2
As you have seen, the output voltage of a low-pass filter decreases by 3 dB when the fre-
quency is increased to the critical value fc. As the frequency continues to  increase above fc, 
the output voltage continues to decrease. In fact, for each tenfold increase in frequency above 
fc, there is a 20 dB reduction in the output, as shown in the following steps.
Let’s take a frequency that is ten times the critical frequency ( f = 10fc). Since 
R = XC at fc, then R = 10XC at 10fc because of the inverse relationship of XC and f.
The attenuation is the reduction in voltage expressed as the ratio Vout/Vin and is 
developed as follows:

Low-Pass Filters  ●  837
A tenfold change in frequency is called a decade. So, for an RC circuit, the output 
voltage is reduced by 20 dB for each decade increase in frequency. A similar result 
can be derived for a high-pass circuit. The roll-off is a constant -20 dB/decade for 
a basic RC or RL filter. Figure 18–4 shows the ideal frequency response plot on a 
semilog scale, where each interval on the horizontal axis represents a tenfold increase 
in  frequency. This response curve is called a Bode plot. There are two versions of the 
Bode plot, a magnitude plot (illustrated in Figure 18–4), and a phase plot. Notice that 
the ratio of Vout>Vin in dB is plotted on the y-axis and frequency is plotted on the x-axis.
Make a Bode plot for the filter in Figure 18–5 for three decades of frequency. Use 
semilog graph paper.

Solution 
The critical frequency for this low-pass filter is
fc =

2pRC =

2p(1.0 kΩ)(0.0047 mF) = 33.9 kHz
The idealized Bode plot is shown with the red line on the semilog graph in 
Figure 18–6. The approximate actual response curve is shown with the blue line. 
Notice first that the horizontal scale is logarithmic and the vertical scale is linear. 
The frequency is on the logarithmic scale, and the filter output in decibels is on 
the linear scale.
The output is flat below fc (33.9 kHz). As the frequency is increased above fc, 
the output drops at a -20 dB/decade rate. Thus, for the ideal curve, every time the 
frequency is increased by ten, the output is reduced by 20 dB. A slight variation 
from this occurs in actual practice. The output is actually at -3 dB rather than 
0 dB at the critical frequency.

If you have the Multisim program available, it is easy to obtain a Bode 
plot using a fictitious instrument called the Bode Plotter. Figure 18–7 shows 
the circuit with the Bode Plotter connected across the input and output and set 
for a range of 1 kHz to 10 MHz. It is not necessary to set the ac source to any 
particular frequency. Move the plotter’s vertical cursor (on the left edge of the 
display) to read the frequency and the ratio of the output magnitude to input 
magnitude (in dB) or phase at any frequency on the plot. In Figure 18–7(a), the 
cursor is set approximately to the cutoff frequency. You can also plot the phase 
angle between the input and output by selecting the Phase button as shown in 
Figure 18–7(b).
You can also obtain a Bode plot with LTSpice. Figure 18–7(c) shows an

When the input is dc (0 Hz), the output voltage ideally equals the input voltage 
because XL is a short (if RW is neglected). As the input frequency is increased, XL

Phase Shift in a Low-Pass Filter
The RC low-pass filter acts as a lag circuit. Recall from Chapter 15 that the phase shift 
from input to output is expressed as
f = -tan-1a R
XC
b
At the critical frequency, XC = R and, therefore, f = -45°. As the input frequency 
is reduced, f decreases and approaches 0° when the frequency approaches zero. 
Figure 18–11, illustrates this phase characteristic.

842  ●  Passive Filters
The RL low-pass filter also acts as a lag circuit. Recall from Chapter 16 that the 
phase shift is expressed as
f = -tan-1aXL
R b
As in the RC filter, the phase shift from input to output is -45° at the critical fre-
quency and decreases for frequencies below fc.

A basic RC high-pass filter is shown in Figure 18–13. Notice that the output voltage 
is taken across the resistor.
When the input frequency is at its critical value, XC = R and the output voltage 
is 0.707Vin, just as in the case of the low-pass filter. As the input frequency increases 
above the critical frequency, XC decreases and, as a result, the output voltage increases

If the critical frequency of the low-pass filter, fc(l), is higher than the critical fre-

those between fc(h) and fc(l) are eliminated, as shown in Figure 18–22.

Series Resonant Band-Pass Filter
A basic series resonant band-pass filter is shown in Figure 18–23. As you learned in 
Chapter 17, a series resonant circuit has minimum impedance and maximum current 
at the resonant frequency, fr. Thus, most of the input voltage is dropped across the 
resistor at the resonant frequency. Therefore, the output across R has a band-pass char-
acteristic with a maximum output at the resonant frequency. The resonant frequency is 
called the center frequency, f0. The bandwidth is determined by the quality factor, Q, 
of the circuit and the resonant frequency, as was discussed in Chapter 17. Recall that 
Q = XL/R, where R is the resistance in the circuit.
A higher value of Q results in a smaller bandwidth. A lower value of Q causes a 
larger bandwidth. A formula for the bandwidth of a resonant circuit in terms of Q is 
stated in the following equation:

Parallel Resonant Band-Pass Filter
A type of band-pass filter using a parallel resonant circuit is shown in Figure 18–25. 
Recall that a parallel resonant circuit has maximum impedance at resonance. The 
circuit in Figure 18–25 acts as a voltage divider. At resonance, the impedance of 
the tank circuit is much greater than the resistance. Thus, most of the input volt-
age is across the tank circuit, producing a maximum output voltage at the resonant 
( center) frequency.

850  ●  Passive Filters
For frequencies above or below resonance, the tank circuit impedance drops off, 
and more of the input voltage is across R. As a result, the output voltage across the 
tank circuit drops off, creating a band-pass characteristic.
At very high frequencies, a factor to consider is that inductors do not act as pure  
inductors but have capacitance between windings. As a consequence, all inductors 
have a “self-resonant” frequency that acts like a parallel resonant circuit. When 
choosing an inductance for a high-frequency resonant filter, you should choose one 
that has a self-resonant frequency much higher than the cut-off frequency.

the responses. A band-stop filter allows all frequencies to pass except those

Low-Pass/High-Pass Filter
A band-stop filter can be formed from a low-pass and a high-pass filter, as shown in 
Figure 18–29.
If the low-pass critical frequency, fc(l), is set lower than the high-pass critical fre-
quency, fc(h), a band-stop characteristic is formed as illustrated in Figure 18–30.
Series Resonant Band-Stop Filter
A series resonant circuit used in a band-stop configuration is shown in Figure 18–31. 
Basically, it works as follows: At the resonant frequency, the impedance is minimum, 
and therefore the output voltage is minimum. Most of the input voltage is dropped 
across R. At frequencies above and below resonance, the impedance increases, causing 
more voltage across the output.
Figure 18–28 shows a general band-stop response curve.

Find the output voltage magnitude at f0 and the bandwidth in Figure 18–32.

mined using the voltage-divider formula.
Vout = a

To see the magnitude or phase of the Bode plot, you can construct a Multisim 
 circuit and use the Bode Plotter connected to the input and output. Multisim 
 allows you to choose ether magnitude or phase. To see details, change the resolu-
tion to 1,000 points in the “Set…” menu on the plotter. Choose an initial value  
(I) of 40 kHz and a final value (F) of 60 kHz. The result with these settings is 
shown in Figure 18–33(a). Optionally, you can construct the circuit using LTSpice 
and view the magnitude and phase Bode plot on the same diagram. The (b) figure 
shows the LTSpice output with both plots.

Parallel Resonant Band-Stop Filter
A parallel resonant circuit used in a band-stop configuration is shown in Figure 18–34. 
At the resonant frequency, the tank impedance is maximum, and so most of the input 
voltage appears across it. Very little voltage is across R at resonance. As the tank 
 impedance decreases above and below resonance, the output voltage increases.

Band-Stop Filters  ●  855
Find the center frequency of the filter in Figure 18–35. Draw the output response 
curve showing the minimum and maximum voltages.
EXAMPLE 18–12
 
Solution 
The center frequency is
f0 = 21 - R 2
WC/L
2p1LC
= 21 - (8.0 Ω)2(150 pF)/5.0 mH
2p1(5.0 mH)(150 pF)
= 5.81 MHz
At the center (resonant) frequency,
XL = 2pf0L = 2p(5.79 MHz)(5.0 mH) = 183 Ω
Q = XL
RW
= 183 Ω
8.0 Ω= 22.8
Zr = RW(Q2 + 1) = 8.0 Ω(22.82 + 1) = 4.17 kΩ (purely resistive)
Next, use the voltage-divider formula to find the minimum output voltage magnitude.
Vout(min) = a
RL
RL + Zr
bVin = a 560 Ω
4.73 kΩb10 V = 1.18 V
At zero frequency, the impedance of the tank circuit is RW because XC = ∞ 
and XL = 0 Ω. Therefore, the maximum output voltage below resonance is
Vout(max) = a
RL
RL + RW
bVin = a560 Ω
568 Ωb10 V = 9.86 V
As the frequency increases much higher than f0, XC approaches 0 Ω, and Vout 
approaches Vin (10 V). Figure 18–36 shows the Bode plot from Multisim plotted 
between 2 MHz and 10 MHz.

SUMMARY
◆
●Four categories of passive filters according to their response characteristics are low-pass, 
high-pass, band-pass, and band-stop.
◆
●In an RC low-pass filter, the output voltage is taken across the capacitor and the output lags the input.
◆
●In an RL low-pass filter, the output voltage is taken across the resistor and the output lags the input.
◆
●In an RC high-pass filter, the output is taken across the resistor and the output leads the input.
◆
●In an RL high-pass filter, the output is taken across the inductor and the output leads the input.

858  ●  Passive Filters
◆
●The roll-off rate of a basic RC or RL filter is -20 dB per decade.
◆
●A band-pass filter passes frequencies between the lower and upper critical frequencies and 
rejects all others.
◆
●A band-stop filter rejects frequencies between its lower and upper critical frequencies and 
passes all others.
◆
●The bandwidth of a resonant filter is determined by the quality factor (Q) of the circuit and 
the resonant frequency.
◆
●Critical frequencies are also called -3 dB frequencies, cutoff frequencies, or break frequencies.
◆
●The output voltage is 70.7% of its maximum at the critical frequencies.

INTRODUCTION
Four important theorems were covered in Chapter 8 with 
emphasis on their applications in the analysis of dc circuits. 
This chapter is a continuation of that coverage with empha-
sis on applications in the analysis of ac circuits with reactive 
components.
The theorems in this chapter make analysis easier for cer-
tain types of circuits. These methods do not replace Ohm’s 
law and Kirchhoff’s laws, but they are normally used in con-
junction with those laws in certain situations.
The superposition theorem helps you to deal with cir-
cuits that have multiple sources. Thevenin’s and Norton’s 
theorems provide methods for reducing a circuit to a simple 
equivalent form for easier analysis. The maximum power 
transfer theorem is used in applications where it is impor-
tant for a given circuit to provide maximum power to a load.

868  ●  Circuit Theorems in AC Analysis
The superposition theorem was introduced Section 8–4 for dc circuits and is 
 restated here for review with impedance replacing resistance. In ac circuits, the 
 superposition theorem is applied by using complex numbers for the algebraic sum 
but otherwise is applied in the same way as for dc circuits. It is applied only in cases 
where all sources have exactly the same frequency.
The current or voltage in any given branch of a multiple-source circuit can be 
found by determining the current or voltage in that particular branch produced by 
each source acting independently, with all other sources replaced by their internal 
impedances. The total current or voltage in the branch is the algebraic sum of the 
responses in that branch.
The steps are reviewed in Example 19–1 with two ideal voltage sources.

19–2 thevenin’s theoreM
Thevenin’s theorem was introduced in Section 8–5 for dc circuits. In this section, 
you will learn to apply Thevenin's theorem to linear ac circuits. Recall that with 
dc circuits, the Thevenin equivalent circuit consisted of a dc source in series with 

874  ●  Circuit Theorems in AC Analysis
By Thevenin’s theorem, the circuit in the block can be reduced to an equivalent 
form, as indicated in the beige area of Figure 19–13(b). The term equivalent means that 
when the same value of load is connected to both the original circuit and Thevenin’s 
equivalent circuit, the load voltages and currents are equal for both. Therefore, as 
far as the load is concerned, there is no difference between the original circuit and 
Thevenin’s equivalent circuit. The load “sees” the same current and voltage regardless 
of whether it is connected to the original circuit or to the Thevenin equivalent. For ac 
circuits, the equivalent circuit is for one particular frequency. When the frequency is 
changed, the equivalent circuit must be recalculated.
Thevenin’s Equivalent Voltage (Vth)
As you have seen, the equivalent voltage, Vth, is one part of the complete Thevenin 
equivalent circuit.
Equivalency
The form of Thevenin’s equivalent circuit for linear ac circuits is shown in Figure 19–12. 
Regardless of how complex the original circuit is, it can always be reduced to this equiva-
lent form with respect to two output terminals. The equivalent voltage source is desig-
nated Vth; the equivalent impedance is designated Zth (lowercase italic subscript denotes 
ac quantity). Notice that the impedance is represented by a block in the circuit diagram. 
This is because the equivalent impedance can be of several forms: purely resistive, purely 
reactive, or a combination of a resistance and a reactance.
Figure 19–13(a) shows a block diagram that represents an ac circuit of any given 
complexity. This circuit has two output terminals, A and B. A load impedance, ZL, is 
connected to the terminals. The circuit produces a certain voltage, VL, and a certain 
current, IL, as illustrated.

Thevenin’s Theorem  ●  875
Thevenin’s equivalent voltage is defined as the open circuit voltage between two speci-
fied terminals in a circuit.
To illustrate, let’s assume that an ac circuit of some type has a resistor connected 
between two specified terminals, A and B, as shown in Figure 19–14(a). We wish to 
find the Thevenin equivalent circuit for the circuit as “seen” by R. Vth is the voltage 
across terminals A and B, with R removed, as shown in part (b) of the figure. The 
circuit is viewed from the open terminals A and B, and R is considered external to the 
circuit for which the Thevenin equivalent is to be found.
The following three examples show how to find Vth.

Thevenin’s voltage for the circuit between terminals A and B is the voltage that

There is no voltage drop across R2 because the open between terminals

Thevenin’s Equivalent Impedance (Zth)
The previous examples illustrated how to find Vth. Now, let’s determine the Thevenin 
equivalent impedance, Zth, the second part of a Thevenin equivalent circuit. As 
 defined by Thevenin’s theorem,
Thevenin’s equivalent impedance is the total impedance appearing between two speci-
fied terminals in a given circuit with all sources replaced by their internal impedances.
To find Zth between any two terminals in a circuit, replace all the voltage sources by 
a short (any internal impedance remains in series). Replace all the current sources 
by an open (any internal impedance remains in parallel). Then determine the total 
impedance between the two terminals. The following three examples illustrate how 
to find Zth.
EXAMPLE 19–7
Find Zth for the part of the circuit in Figure 19–18 that is within the beige box as 
viewed from terminals A and B. This is the same circuit used in Example 19–4.

Thevenin’s Equivalent Circuit
The previous six examples have shown how to find the two equivalent components 
of a Thevenin circuit, Vth and Zth. Keep in mind that you can find Vth and Zth for any 
circuit. Once you have determined these equivalent values, you must connect them in 
series to form the Thevenin equivalent circuit. The following three examples use the 
previous examples to illustrate this final step.
EXAMPLE 19–10
Refer to Figure 19–24. Draw the Thevenin equivalent for the circuit within 
the beige box as viewed from terminals A and B. This is the circuit used in 
Examples 19–4 and 19–7.
 
Solution 
From Examples 19–4 and 19–7, respectively, Vth = 11.2∠63.4° V, and 
Zth = 44.7∠63.4° Ω. In rectangular form, the impedance is
Zth = 20 Ω+ j40 Ω
This form indicates that the impedance is a 20 Ω resistor in series with a 40 Ω 
inductive reactance. The Thevenin equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 19–25.

Summary of Thevenin’s Theorem
Remember that the Thevenin equivalent circuit is always a voltage source in series 
with an impedance regardless of the original circuit that it replaces. The significance 
of Thevenin’s theorem is that the equivalent circuit can replace the original circuit as 
far as any external load is concerned. Any load connected between the terminals of a 
Thevenin equivalent circuit experiences the same current and voltage as if it were con-
nected to the terminals of the original circuit.
A summary of steps for applying Thevenin’s theorem follows.
Step 1:  Open the two terminals between which you want to find the Thevenin cir-
cuit. This is done by removing the component from which the circuit is to 
be viewed.
Step 2: Determine the voltage across the two open terminals.
Step 3:  Determine the impedance viewed from the two open terminals with ideal 
voltage sources replaced with shorts and ideal current sources replaced 
with opens (zeroed).
Step 4:  Connect Vth and Zth in series to produce the complete Thevenin equivalent 
circuit.

The form of Norton’s equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 19–31. Regardless of 
how complex the original circuit is, it can be reduced to this equivalent form. The 
equivalent current source is designated In, and the equivalent impedance is Zn (lower-
case italic subscript denotes ac quantity).
Norton’s theorem shows you how to find In and Zn. Once they are known, simply 
connect them in parallel to get the complete Norton equivalent circuit.
Norton’s Equivalent Current Source (In)
In is one part of the Norton equivalent circuit; Zn is the other part.
Norton’s equivalent current is defined as the short-circuit current between two speci-
fied terminals in a given circuit.
Any load connected between these two terminals effectively “sees” a current source In 
in parallel with Zn.
To illustrate, let’s suppose that the circuit shown in Figure 19–32 has a load resis-
tor connected to terminals A and B, as indicated in part (a), and we wish to find the

Norton’s Equivalent Impedance (Zn)
Zn is defined the same as Zth: It is the total impedance appearing between two specified 
terminals of a given circuit viewed from the open terminals with all sources  replaced 
by their internal impedances.
Examples 19–13 and 19–14 showed how to find the two equivalent components of 
a Norton equivalent circuit. Keep in mind that you can find these values for any given 
ac circuit. Once you know In and Zn, connect them in parallel to form the Norton 
equivalent circuit, as Example 19–15 illustrates.

Solution 
First, replace Vs with its internal impedance (zero), as indicated in Figure 19–35.
Looking in between terminals A and B, C2 is in series with the parallel 
combination of R and C1. Thus,
Zn = XC2 +

Summary of Norton’s Theorem
Any load connected between the terminals of a Norton equivalent circuit will have 
the same current through it and the same voltage across it as it would when connected 
to the terminals of the original circuit. A summary of steps for theoretically applying 
Norton’s theorem is as follows:
Step 1:  Replace the load connected to the two terminals between which the Norton 
circuit is to be determined with a short.
Step 2: Determine the current through the short. This is In.
Step 3:  Open the terminals and determine the impedance between the two open ter-
minals with all sources replaced with their internal impedances. This is Zn.
Step 4: Connect In and Zn in parallel.
Norton/Thevenin Equivalency
There is a simple relationship between a Norton equivalent circuit and a Thevenin 
equivalent circuit. You probably noticed that Zth =  Zn. It is easy to show that 
Vth =  InRn and In =  Vth>Zth by simply applying Thevenin’s theorem to a Norton 
circuit or by applying Norton’s theorem to a Thevenin circuit. If one equivalent is 
desired, it is sometimes easier to initially derive the other circuit equivalent, and then 
using the equivalency obtain the equivalent you want. This equivalency is valid for 
both ac and dc circuits.

Maximum Power Transfer Theorem  ●  887
The complex conjugate of R - jXC is R + jXL and vice versa, where the re-
sistances are equal in magnitude and the reactances are equal in magnitude but 
 opposite in sign. The source impedance is effectively Thevenin’s equivalent im-
pedance viewed from the output terminals. When ZL is the complex conjugate of 
Zout, maximum power is transferred from an ac source to the load with a power 
factor of 1. An equivalent circuit with its source impedance and load is shown in 
Figure 19–38.
Example 19–16 shows that maximum power occurs when the impedances are con-
jugately matched.

EXAMPLE 19–16
The circuit to the left of terminals A and B in Figure 19–39 provides power 
to the load ZL. This can be viewed as simulating a power amplifier delivering 
power to a complex load. It is the Thevenin equivalent of a more complex cir-
cuit. Calculate and plot a graph of the power delivered to the load at 10 kHz 
intervals starting at 10 kHz going to 100 kHz.

the equations, press the y=  key. In this example, the equations represent 
XC, XL, Ztot, I, and PL in that order. The independent variable is frequency

Application Activity
In this application activity, 
you have a sealed band-pass 
filter module that has been removed from a system and two 
schematics. Both schematics indicate that the band-pass filter 
is implemented with a low-pass/high-pass combination. It is 
uncertain which schematic corresponds to the filter module, but 
one of them does. By certain measurements, you will determine 
which schematic represents the filter so that the filter circuit can 
be reproduced. Also, you will determine the proper load for 
maximum power transfer. The filter circuit contained in a sealed 
module and two schematics, one of which corresponds to the 
filter circuit, are shown in Figure 19–45.
Filter Measurement and Analysis
1. Based on the oscilloscope measurement of the filter out-
put shown in Figure 19–46, determine which schematic 
in Figure 19–45 represents the component values of the 
filter circuit in the module. A 10 V peak-to-peak voltage 
is applied to the input.
2. Based on the oscilloscope measurement in Figure 19–46, 
determine if the filter is operating at its approximate 
center frequency.
3. Using Thevenin’s theorem, determine the load imped-
ance that will provide for maximum power transfer at 
the center frequency when connected to the output of 
the filter. Assume the source impedance is zero.

INTRODUCTION
In Chapters 15 and 16, the frequency response of RC and 
RL circuits was covered. In this chapter, the time response 
of RC and RL circuits with pulse inputs is examined. Before 
starting this chapter, you should review the material in 
Sections 12–5 and 13–4. Understanding exponential changes 
of voltages and currents in capacitors and inductors is cru-
cial to the study of time response. Throughout this chapter, 
exponential formulas that were given in Chapters 12 and 13 
are used.
With pulse inputs, the time responses of circuits are im-
portant. In the areas of pulse and digital circuits, technicians 
are often concerned with how a circuit responds over an 
interval of time to rapid changes in voltages or current. The 
relationship of the circuit time constant to the input pulse 
characteristics, such as pulse width and period, determines 
the wave shapes of voltages in the circuit.
Integrator and differentiator, terms used throughout 
this chapter, refer to mathematical functions that are 
 approximated by these circuits under certain  conditions. 
Mathematical integration is a summation process, 
and  mathematical differentiation is a process for establish-
ing an instantaneous rate of change of a quantity.

the RC integrator
In terms of time response, a series RC circuit in which the output voltage is taken 
across the capacitor is a type of circuit known as an integrator. Recall that in 
terms of frequency response, this circuit is a basic low-pass filter. The term inte-
grator is derived from the mathematical process of integration, which this type of 
circuit approximates under certain conditions.

Charging and Discharging of a Capacitor
When an ideal pulse generator is connected to the input of an RC integrator, as shown 
in Figure 20–1, the capacitor will charge and discharge in response to the pulses. When 
the input goes from its low level to its high level, the capacitor charges toward the high 
level of the pulse through the resistor. This charging action is analogous to connecting 
a battery through a closed switch to the RC circuit, as illustrated in Figure 20–2(a). 
When the pulse goes from its high level back to its low level, the capacitor discharges 
back through the source. Compared to the resistance of the resistor, the resistance of 
the source is assumed to be negligible. This discharging action is analogous to replac-
ing the source with a closed switch, as illustrated in Figure 20–2(b).

Response of an RC Integrator to a Single Pulse  ●  903
As you learned in Chapter 12, a capacitor will charge and discharge following an 
exponential curve. Its rate of charging and discharging, of course, depends on the RC 
time constant, a fixed time interval determined by R and C (t = RC).
For an ideal pulse, both edges are considered to be instantaneous. Two basic rules 
of capacitor behavior help in understanding the response of RC circuits to pulse 
inputs.
1. The capacitor appears as a short to an instantaneous change in current and as an 
open to dc.
2. The voltage across the capacitor cannot change instantaneously—it can change 
only exponentially.
Capacitor Voltage
In an RC integrator, the output is the capacitor voltage. The capacitor charges during 
the time that the pulse is high. If the pulse is at its high level long enough, the capaci-
tor will fully charge to the voltage amplitude of the pulse, as illustrated in Figure 20–3. 
The capacitor discharges during the time that the pulse is low. If the low time between 
pulses is long enough, the capacitor will fully discharge to zero, as shown in the figure. 
Then when the next pulse occurs, it will charge again.

resPonse of an RC integrator to a single Pulse
From the previous section, you have a general idea of how an RC integrator responds 
to an input pulse. In this section, the response to a single pulse is  examined in detail.
After completing this section, you should be able to

◆
◆Define transient time
◆
◆Determine the response when the pulse width is equal to or greater than five 
time constants
◆
◆Determine the response when the pulse width is less than five time constants

904  ●  Time Response of Reactive Circuits
Two conditions of pulse response must be considered:
1. When the input pulse width (tW) is equal to or greater than five time constants 
(tW Ú 5t)
2. When the input pulse width is less than five time constants (tW 6 5t)
Recall that five time constants is accepted as the time for a capacitor to fully charge or 
fully discharge; this time is often called the transient time or transient response time. 
A capacitor will fully charge if the pulse width is equal to or greater than five time 
constants (5t). This condition is expressed as tW Ú 5t. At the end of the pulse, the  
capacitor fully discharges back through the source.
Figure 20–4 illustrates the output waveforms for various RC transient times and a 
fixed input pulse width. Notice that as the transient time becomes shorter, compared 
to the pulse width, the shape of the output pulse approaches that of the input. In each 
case, the output reaches the full amplitude of the input.

Figure 20–5 shows how a fixed time constant and a variable input pulse width  
affect the integrator output. Notice that as the pulse width is increased, the shape of 
the output pulse approaches that of the input. Again, this means that the transient 
time is short compared to the pulse width.

Response of an RC Integrator to a Single Pulse  ●  905
Now let’s examine the case in which the width of the input pulse is less than five 
time constants of the RC integrator. This condition is expressed as tW 6 5t. As you 
know, the capacitor charges for the duration of the pulse. However, because the pulse 
width is less than the time it takes the capacitor to fully charge (5t), the output volt-
age will not reach the full input voltage before the end of the pulse. The capacitor only 
partially charges, as illustrated in Figure 20–6 for several values of RC time constants. 
Notice that for longer time constants, the output reaches a lower voltage because the 
capacitor cannot charge as much. Of course, in the examples with a single pulse input, 
the capacitor fully discharges after the pulse ends.

▲FIGURE 20–6
Capacitor voltage for various time constants that are longer than the input pulse width. Dark blue is 
input and light blue is output.
When the time constant is much greater than the input pulse width, the capacitor 
charges very little, and, as a result, the output voltage becomes almost negligible, as 
indicated in Figure 20–6.
Figure 20–7 illustrates the effect of reducing the input pulse width for a fixed time 
constant value. As the input pulse width is reduced, the output voltage decreases  
because the capacitor has less time to charge. However, it takes the capacitor approxi-
mately the same length of time (5t) to discharge back to zero for each condition after 
the pulse is removed.

906  ●  Time Response of Reactive Circuits
EXAMPLE 20–1
A single 10 V pulse with a width of 100 ms is applied to the RC integrator in 
Figure 20–8.
(a) To what voltage will the capacitor charge?
(b) How long will it take the capacitor to discharge if the internal resistance of the 
pulse source is 50 Ω?
(c) Draw the output voltage waveform.
 
Solution 
(a)   The circuit time constant is
t = RC = (100 kΩ)(0.001 mF) = 100 ms
Notice that the pulse width is exactly equal to the time constant. Thus, the 
capacitor will charge approximately 63% of the full input amplitude in one time 
constant, so the output will reach a maximum voltage of
Vout = (0.63)10 V = 6.3 V
(b) The capacitor discharges back through the source when the pulse ends. You can 
neglect the 50 Ω source resistance in series with 100 kΩ. The total approximate 
discharge time, therefore, is
5t = 5(100 ms) = 500 Ms
(c) The output charging and discharging curve is shown in Figure 20–9.

Solution 
Calculate the time constant.
t = RC = (2.2 kΩ)(1.0 mF) = 2.2 ms
Because the pulse width is 5 ms, the capacitor charges for 2.27 time constants 
(5 ms/2.2 ms = 2.27). Use the exponential formula from Chapters 12  
(Eq. 12–19) to find the voltage to which the capacitor will charge. With VF = 25 V 
and t = 5 ms, the calculation is as follows:
 v = VF(1 - e-t/RC)
 = (25 V)(1 -  e- 5ms/2.2ms)
 = (25 V)(1 - 0.103) = (25 V)(0.897) = 22.4 V
These calculations show that the capacitor charges to 22.4 V during the 5 ms dura-
tion of the input pulse. It will discharge back to zero in five time constants when 
the pulse goes back to zero.

908  ●  Time Response of Reactive Circuits
If a periodic pulse waveform is applied to an RC integrator, as shown in Figure 20–12, 
the output waveshape depends on the relationship of the circuit time constant and the 
frequency (period) of the input pulses. The capacitor, of course, charges and discharges 
in response to a pulse input. The amount of charge and discharge of the capacitor  
depends both on the circuit time constant and on the input frequency, as mentioned.
If the pulse width and the time between pulses are each equal to or greater than five 
time constants, the capacitor will fully charge and fully discharge during each period 
(T) of the input waveform. This case is shown in Figure 20–12.
When the pulse width and the time between pulses are shorter than five time 
 constants, as illustrated in Figure 20–13 for a square wave, the capacitor will not 
 completely charge or discharge. We will now examine the effects of this situation on 
the output voltage of the RC integrator.

For illustration, let’s use an RC integrator with a charging and discharging 
time constant equal to the pulse width of a 10 V square wave input, as shown in 
Figure 20–14. This choice will simplify the analysis and will demonstrate the basic 
action of the integrator under these conditions. At this point, we do not care what

◀FIGURE 20–15
Input and output for the initially  
uncharged integrator in Figure 20–14.
First pulse During the first pulse, the capacitor charges. The output voltage reaches 
6.32 V (63.2% of 10 V), as shown in Figure 20–15.
Between first and second pulses The capacitor discharges, and the voltage decreases 
to 36.8% of the voltage at the beginning of this interval: 0.368(6.32 V) = 2.33 V.
Second pulse The capacitor voltage begins at 2.33 V and increases 63.2% of the way to 
10 V. This calculation is as follows: The total charging range is 10 V - 2.33 V = 7.67 V. 
The capacitor voltage will increase an additional 63.2% of 7.67 V, which is 4.85 V. Thus,  
at the end of the second pulse, the output voltage is 2.33 V + 4.85 V = 7.18 V, as 
shown in Figure 20–15. Notice that the average is building up.
Between second and third pulses The capacitor discharges during this time, and 
therefore the voltage decreases to 36.8% of the initial voltage by the end of the second 
pulse: 0.368(7.18 V) = 2.64 V.
Third pulse At the start of the third pulse, the capacitor voltage begins at 2.64 V. The 
capacitor charges 63.2% of the way from 2.64 V to 10 V: 0.632(10 V - 2.64 V) = 4.65 V. 
Therefore, the voltage at the end of the third pulse is 2.64 V + 4.65 V = 7.29 V.
Between third and fourth pulses The voltage during this interval decreases due to 
capacitor discharge. It will decrease to 36.8% of its value by the end of the third pulse. 
The final voltage in this interval is 0.368(7.29 V) = 2.68 V.

910  ●  Time Response of Reactive Circuits
Fourth pulse At the start of the fourth pulse, the capacitor voltage is 2.68 V. The 
voltage increases by 0.632(10 V - 2.68 V) = 4.63 V. Therefore, at the end of the 
fourth pulse, the capacitor voltage is 2.68 V + 4.63 V = 7.31 V. Notice that the val-
ues are leveling off as the pulses continue.
Between fourth and fifth pulses Between these pulses, the capacitor voltage drops to 
0.368(7.31 V) = 2.69 V.
Fifth pulse During the fifth pulse, the capacitor charges 0.632(10 V - 2.69 V) = 4.62 V. 
Since it started at 2.69 V, the voltage at the end of the pulse is 2.69 V +  4.62 V = 7.31 V.
Steady-State Time Response
In the preceding discussion, the output voltage gradually built up and then began 
leveling off. It takes approximately 5t for the output voltage to build up to a constant 
average value. This interval is the transient time of the circuit. Once the output volt-
age reaches the average value of the input voltage, a steady-state condition is reached 
that continues as long as the periodic input continues. This condition is illustrated in 
Figure 20–16 based on the values obtained in the preceding discussion.

The transient time for our example circuit is the time from the beginning of the first 
pulse to the end of the third pulse. The reason for this interval is that the capacitor 
voltage at the end of the third pulse is 7.29 V, which is about 99% of the final voltage.
The Effect of an Increase in Time Constant
What happens to the output voltage if the RC time constant of the integrator is 
 increased with a variable resistor, as indicated in Figure 20–17? As the time constant is 
increased, the capacitor charges less during a pulse and discharges less between pulses. 
The result is a smaller fluctuation in the output voltage for increasing values of time 
constant, as shown in Figure 20–18.

output voltage approaches a constant dc voltage, as shown in Figure 20–18(c). This

Obviously, the time constant is much longer than the input pulse width or the 
interval between pulses (notice that the input is not a square wave). In this case, 
the exponential formulas must be applied, and the analysis is relatively difficult. 
Follow the solution carefully.
1. Calculation for first pulse: Use the equation for an increasing exponential because 
C is charging. Note that VF is 5 V, and t equals the pulse width of 10 ms. Therefore,
 vC = VF (1 - e-t/RC) = (5 V)(1 - e-10ms/50ms) =  906 mV
This result is plotted in Figure 20–20(a).
2. Calculation for interval between first and second pulse: Use the equation for a 
decreasing exponential because C is discharging. Note that Vi is 906 mV because 
C begins to discharge from this value at the end of the first pulse. The discharge 
time is 15 ms. Therefore,
 vC = Vie-t/RC = (906 mV)e-15ms/50ms =  671 mV
This result is shown in Figure 20–20(b).
3. Calculation for second pulse: At the beginning of the second pulse, the output volt-
age is 671 mV. During the second pulse, the capacitor will again charge. In this case, 
it does not begin at zero volts. It already has 671 mV from the  previous charge and 
discharge. To handle this situation, you must use the general  exponential formula.
v = VF + (Vi - VF)e-t/t
Using this equation, you can calculate the voltage across the capacitor at the 
end of the second pulse as follows:
 vC = VF + (Vi - VF)e-t/RC
 = 5 V + (671 mV - 5 V)e-10ms/50ms
 = 5 V - 3.44 = 1.46 V
This result is shown in Figure 20–20(c).

Figure 20–21 shows an RC differentiator with a pulse input. The same action  
occurs in a differentiator as in an integrator, except the output voltage is taken across 
the resistor rather than across the capacitor. The capacitor charges exponentially at 
a rate depending on the RC time constant. The shape of the differentiator’s resistor 
voltage is determined by the charging and discharging action of the capacitor.
Notice that the output waveform builds up on successive input pulses. After 
approximately 5t, it will reach its steady state and will fluctuate between a 
constant maximum and a constant minimum, with an average equal to the aver-
age value of the input. You can see this pattern by carrying the analysis in this 
example further.

resPonse of an RC differentiator to a single Pulse
In terms of time response, a series RC circuit in which the output voltage is taken across 
the resistor is known as a differentiator. Recall that in terms of frequency response, it is 
a high-pass filter. The term differentiator is derived from the mathematical process of 
 differentiation, which this type of circuit approximates under certain conditions.

Pulse Response
To understand how the output voltage is shaped by a differentiator, you must consider 
the following:
1. The response to the rising pulse edge
2. The response between the rising and falling edges
3. The response to the falling pulse edge
Let’s assume that the capacitor is initially uncharged prior to the rising pulse edge. 
Prior to the pulse, the input is zero volts. Thus, there are zero volts across the capaci-
tor and also zero volts across the resistor, as indicated in Figure 20–22(a).
Response to the Rising Edge of the Input Pulse Let’s also assume that a 10 V 
pulse is applied to the input. When the rising edge occurs, point A goes to +10 V. 
Recall that the voltage across a capacitor cannot change instantaneously, and thus 
the capacitor appears instantaneously as a short. Therefore, if point A goes instantly 
to +10 V, then point B must also go instantly to +10 V, keeping the capacitor voltage

tW Ú 5t and tW 6 5t.

Response of an RC Differentiator to a Single Pulse  ●  915
zero for the instant of the rising edge. The capacitor voltage is the voltage from point 
A to point B.
The voltage at point B with respect to ground is the voltage across the resistor (and 
the output voltage). Thus, the output voltage suddenly goes to +10 V in response to 
the rising pulse edge, as indicated in Figure 20–22(b).
Response During Pulse When tW # 5T While the pulse is at its high level between the 
rising edge and the falling edge, the capacitor is charging. When the pulse width is equal 
to or greater than five time constants (tW Ú 5t), the capacitor has time to fully charge.
As the voltage across the capacitor builds up exponentially, the voltage across the 
resistor decreases exponentially until it reaches zero volts at the time the capacitor 
reaches full charge (+10 V in this case). This decrease in the resistor voltage  occurs 
because the sum of the capacitor voltage and the resistor voltage at any instant 
must be equal to the applied voltage, in compliance with Kirchhoff’s voltage law 
(vC + vR = vin). This part of the response is illustrated in Figure 20–22(c).
Response to Falling Edge When tW # 5T Let’s examine the case in which the 
 capacitor is fully charged at the end of the pulse (tW Ú 5t). Refer to Figure 20–22(d). 
On the falling edge, the input pulse suddenly goes from +10 V back to zero. An 
 instant before the falling edge, the capacitor is charged to 10 V, so point A is +10 V 
and point B is 0 V. The voltage across a capacitor cannot change instantaneously, so 
when point A makes a transition from +10 V to zero on the falling edge, point B must 
also make a 10 V transition from zero to -10 V so that the sum of voltages around 
the closed loop equals zero as required by Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law. This keeps the 
voltage across the capacitor at 10 V for the instant of the falling edge.
The capacitor now begins to discharge exponentially. As a result, the resistor voltage 
goes from -10 V to zero in an exponential curve, as indicated in red in Figure 20–22(d).
Response During Pulse When tW * 5T When the pulse width is less than five time 
constants (tW 6 5t), the capacitor does not have time to fully charge. Its partial 
charge depends on the relation of the time constant and the pulse width.
Because the capacitor does not reach the full +10 V, the resistor voltage will not 
reach zero volts by the end of the pulse. For example, if the capacitor charges to +5 V 
during the pulse interval, the resistor voltage will decrease to +5 V, as illustrated in 
Figure 20–22(e).
Response to Falling Edge When tW * 5T Now, let’s examine the case in which the 
capacitor is only partially charged at the end of the pulse (tW 6 5t). For example, 
if the capacitor charges to +5 V, the resistor voltage at the instant before the falling 
edge is also +5 V because the capacitor voltage plus the resistor voltage must add up 
to +10 V, as illustrated in Figure 20–22(e).
When the falling edge occurs, point A goes from +10 V to zero. As a result, point 
B goes from +5 V to -5 V, as illustrated in Figure 20–22(f). This decrease occurs, of 
course, because the capacitor voltage cannot change at the instant of the falling edge 
and Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law requires that the sum of voltages around the closed 
loop is equal to zero. Immediately after the falling edge, the capacitor begins to dis-
charge to zero. As a result, the resistor voltage goes from -5 V to zero, as shown.
Summary of RC Differentiator Response to a Single Pulse
A good way to summarize this section is to look at the general output waveforms 
of a differentiator as the time constant is varied from one extreme, when 5t is much 
less than the pulse width, to the other extreme, when 5t is much greater than the 
pulse width. These situations are illustrated in Figure 20–23. In part (a) of the figure, 
the output consists of narrow positive and negative “spikes.” In part (e), the output 
 approaches the shape of the input. Various conditions between these extremes are 
 illustrated in parts (b), (c), and (d).
T E C H  T I P
You may have observed a pulse  
that looks similar to Figure 20–23(e) 
when you ac couple a pulse to an  
 oscilloscope. In this case the ca-
pacitor in the oscilloscope coupling 
circuit can act as an unwanted 
differentiating circuit, causing the 
pulse to droop. To avoid this, you 
can dc couple the scope and check 
the probe compensation.

EXAMPLE 20–5
Determine the output voltage waveform for the RC differentiator in Figure 20–26 
with the rheostat set so that the total resistance of R1 and R2 is 2.0 kΩ.
 
Solution 
First, calculate the time constant.
t = RtotC = (2.0 kΩ)(1.0 mF) = 2.0 ms
On the rising edge, the resistor voltage immediately jumps to +25 V. Because the 
pulse width is 5 ms, the capacitor charges for 2.5 time constants and therefore does 
not reach full charge. Thus, you must use the formula for a decreasing exponential in 
order to calculate to what voltage the output decreases by the end of the pulse.
vout = Vie-t/RC = 25 Ve-5ms/2ms = (25 V)(0.0821) = 2.05 V 
where Vi = 25 V and t = 5 ms. This calculation gives the resistor voltage (vout) at 
the end of the 5 ms pulse width interval.
On the falling edge, the resistor voltage immediately jumps from +2.05 V 
down to -22.95 V (a 25 V transition). The resulting waveform of the output

If a periodic pulse waveform is applied to an RC differentiating circuit, two condi-
tions again are possible: tW Ú 5t or tW 6 5t. Figure 20–28 shows the output when 
tW = 5t. As the time constant is reduced, both the positive and the negative portions 
of the output become narrower. Notice that the average value of the output is zero. 
An average value of zero means that the waveform has equal positive and negative 
portions. The average value of a waveform is its dc component. Because a capacitor 
blocks dc, the dc component of the input is prevented from passing through to the 
output, resulting in an average value of zero.

Figure 20–29 shows the steady-state output when tW 6 5t. As the time constant 
is increased, the positively and negatively sloping portions become flatter. For a very 
long time constant, the output approaches the shape of the input, but with an average 
value of zero.
Analysis of a Repetitive Waveform
Like the integrator, the differentiator output takes time (5t) to reach steady state. To il-
lustrate the response, let’s take an example in which the time constant equals the input 
pulse width. At this point, we do not care what the circuit time constant is because 
we know that the resistor voltage will decrease to approximately 37% of its maximum

Let’s assume that the capacitor in Figure 20–30 begins initially uncharged and then

920  ●  Time Response of Reactive Circuits
Figure 20–32 shows an RL integrator. The output waveform is taken across the 
resistor and, under equivalent conditions, is the same shape as that for the RC inte-
grator. Recall that in the RC case, the output was across the capacitor.
First pulse On the rising edge, the output instantaneously jumps to +10 V. Then the 
capacitor partially charges to 63.2% of 10 V, which is 6.32 V. Thus, the output volt-
age must decrease to 3.68 V, as shown in Figure 20–31. On the falling edge, the output 
instantaneously makes a negative-going 10 V transition to -6.32 V (-10 V + 3.68 V 
= -6.32 V).
Between first and second pulses The capacitor discharges to 36.8% of 6.32 V, which 
is 2.33 V. Thus, the resistor voltage, which starts at -6.32 V, must increase to 
-2.33 V. Why? Because at the instant prior to the next pulse, the input voltage is zero. 
Therefore, the sum of vC and vR must be zero (2.33 V - 2.33 V = 0). Remember that 
vC + vR = vin at all times, in accordance with Kirchhoff’s voltage law.
Second pulse On the rising edge, the output makes an instantaneous, positive-going, 10 V  
transition from -2.33 V to 7.68 V. Then by the end of the pulse the capacitor charges 
0.632 * (10 V - 2.33 V) = 4.85 V. Thus, the capacitor voltage increases from 2.33 V 
to 2.33 V + 4.85 V = 7.18 V. The output voltage drops to 0.368 * 7.68 V = 2.82 V.
On the falling edge, the output instantaneously makes a negative-going transition 
from 2.82 V to -7.18 V, as shown in Figure 20–31.
Between second and third pulses The capacitor discharges to 36.8% of 7.18 V, which 
is 2.64 V. Thus, the output voltage starts at -7.18 V and increases to -2.64 V because 
the capacitor voltage and the resistor voltage must add up to zero at the instant prior 
to the third pulse (the input is zero).
Third pulse On the rising edge, the output makes an instantaneous 10 V transition from 
-2.64 V to +7.36 V. Then the capacitor charges 0.632 * (10 V - 2.64 V) = 4.65 V 
to 2.64 V + 4.65 V = 7.29 V. As a result, the output voltage drops to 0.368 * 7.36 V 
= 2.71 V. On the falling edge, the output instantly goes from +2.71 V down to -7.29 V.
After the third pulse, five time constants have elapsed, and the output voltage is 
close to its steady state. Thus, it will continue to vary from a positive maximum of 
about +7.3 V to a negative maximum of about -7.3 V, with an average value of zero.

resPonse of RL integrators to Pulse inPuts
A series RL circuit in which the output voltage is taken across the resistor is 
known as an integrator in terms of the time response. RL integrators are not as 
 common as RC integrators because of cost and inductors are not as close to an 
ideal  response as are capacitors. Although only the response to a single pulse is dis-
cussed, it can be extended to repetitive pulses, as described for the RC integrator.

Response of RL Integrators to Pulse Inputs  ●  921
As you know, each edge of an ideal pulse is considered to be instantaneous. Two basic 
rules for inductor behavior will aid in analyzing RL circuit responses to pulse inputs:
1. The inductor appears as an open to an instantaneous change in current and as a 
short (ideally) to dc.
2. The current in an inductor cannot change instantaneously—it can change only 
exponentially.
Response of the RL Integrator to a Single Pulse
When a pulse generator is connected to the input of the integrator and the voltage 
pulse goes from its low level to its high level, the inductor prevents a sudden change in 
current. As a result, the inductor acts as an open, and all of the input voltage is across 
it at the instant of the rising pulse edge. This situation is indicated in Figure 20–33(a).

922  ●  Time Response of Reactive Circuits
After the rising edge, the current builds up, and the output voltage follows the cur-
rent as it increases exponentially, as shown in Figure 20–33(b). The current can reach 
a maximum of Vp/R if the transient time is shorter than the pulse width (Vp = 10 V in 
this example).
When the pulse goes from its high level to its low level, an induced voltage with re-
versed polarity is created across the coil in an effort to keep the current equal to Vp/R. 
The output voltage begins to decrease exponentially, as shown in Figure 20–33(c).
The exact shape of the output depends on the L/R time constant as summarized 
in Figure 20–34 for various relationships between the time constant and the pulse 
width. You should note that the response of this RL circuit in terms of the shape of 
the output is identical to that of the RC integrator. The relationship of the L/R time 
constant to the input pulse width has the same effect as the RC time constant that was 
shown in Figure 20–4. For example, when tW 6 5t, the output voltage will not reach 
its maximum possible value.

Response of RL Differentiators to Pulse Inputs  ●  925
SECTION 20–6
CHECKUP
1. In an RL integrator, across which component is the output voltage taken?
2. When a pulse is applied to an RL integrator, what condition must exist in order for 
the output voltage to reach the amplitude of the input?
3. Under what condition will the output voltage have the approximate shape of the 
input pulse?
Notice that in this case the pulse width is exactly equal to t. Thus, the volt-
age across the circuit resistance will reach approximately 63% of the full input 
amplitude in 1t. Therefore, the voltage across the circuit’s resistance reaches 
6.32 V at the end of the pulse. This voltage is divided between the source 
resistance and R. Applying the voltage divider rule, the output will reach 
1470 Ω>500 Ω26.32 V = 5.94 V
After the pulse is gone, the inductor discharges back through the 30 Ω source 
resistance and the 470 Ω resistor. The output voltage takes 5T to completely decay 
to zero.
5t = 5(1 ms) = 5 ms
The output voltage is shown in Figure 20–39.
An alternate solution to the problem is to note that the maximum current is 
20 mA (10 V>500  Ω=  20 mA) and solve for the current at 1 ms. At 1 ms, the 
output current is
iout(max) = If(1 - e-t>t) = 20 mA(1 - e-1 ms>1 ms) = 12.6 mA
Applying Ohm’s law, the output current at 1 ms is
v = iR = (12.6 mA)(470 Ω) = 5.94 V

resPonse of RL differentiators to Pulse inPuts
A series RL circuit in which the output voltage is taken across the inductor is 
known as a differentiator in terms of time response. Although only the response 
to a single pulse is discussed, it can be extended to repetitive pulses, as was 
 described for the RC differentiator.

926  ●  Time Response of Reactive Circuits
Response of the RL Differentiator to a Single Pulse
Figure 20–40 shows an RL differentiator with a pulse generator connected to the input.
Initially, before the pulse, there is no current in the circuit. When the input pulse 
goes from its low level to its high level, the inductor prevents a sudden change in 
current. It does so, as you know, with an induced voltage equal and opposite to the 
input. As a result, L looks like an open, and all of the input voltage appears across it 
at the instant of the rising edge, as shown in Figure 20–41(a) with a 10 V pulse.
During the pulse, the current exponentially builds up. As a result, the inductor 
voltage decreases, as shown in Figure 20–41(b). The rate of decrease, as you know, 
depends on the L/R time constant. When the falling edge of the input occurs, the 
inductor reacts to keep the current as is, by creating an induced voltage in a direc-
tion as indicated in Figure 20–41(c). This reaction is seen as a sudden negative-going 
 transition of the inductor voltage, as indicated in Figure 20–41(c) and (d).
Two conditions are possible, as indicated in Figure 20–41(c) and (d). In part (c), 5t is 
greater than the input pulse width, and the output voltage does not have time to decay

930  ●  Time Response of Reactive Circuits
The Integrator
RC Integrator In terms of frequency response, the RC integrator acts as a low-pass 
filter. As you learned, the RC integrator tends to exponentially “round off” the edges 
of the applied pulses. This rounding off occurs to varying degrees, depending on the 
relationship of the time constant to the pulse width and period. The rounding off of 
the edges indicates that the integrator tends to reduce the higher frequency compo-
nents of the pulse waveform, as illustrated in Figure 20–48.
RL Integrator Like the RC integrator, the RL integrator also acts as a basic low-pass 
filter because L is in series between the input and output. The inductive reactance, XL, 
is small for low frequencies and offers little opposition. It increases with frequency, 
so at higher frequencies most of the total voltage is dropped across L and very little 
across R, the output. If the input is dc, L is like a short (XL = 0). At high frequencies, 
L becomes like an open, as illustrated in Figure 20–49.
The Differentiator
RC Differentiator In terms of frequency response, the RC differentiator acts as a 
high-pass filter. As you know, the differentiator tends to introduce tilt to the flat por-
tion of a pulse. That is, it tends to reduce the lower frequency components of a pulse 
waveform. Also, it completely eliminates the dc component of the input and produces 
a zero average-value output. This action is illustrated in Figure 20–50.

Relationship of Time Response to Frequency Response  ●  931
RL Differentiator Again like the RC differentiator, the RL differentiator also acts as a 
basic high-pass filter. Because L is connected across the output, less voltage is developed 
across it at lower frequencies than at higher ones. There are zero volts across the output 
for dc (ignoring winding resistance). For high frequencies, most of the input voltage 
is dropped across the output coil (XL = 0 for dc; XL ≅open  for  high  frequencies). 
Figure 20–51 shows high-pass filter action.
Formulas Relating Time Response to Frequency Response
The fast transitions of a pulse (rise time, tr, and fall time, tf) are related to the highest 
frequency component, fh, in that pulse by the following approximate formula:
 
tr = 0.35
fh
 
Equation 20–1
This formula also applies to fall time, and the fastest transition determines the highest 
frequency in the pulse waveform.
Equation 20–1 can be rearranged to give the highest frequency as follows:
 
fh = 0.35
tr
 
Equation 20–2
also,
 
fh = 0.35
tf
 
Equation 20–3
Equations 20–1 through 20–4 are based on a specific type of low-pass filter 
 response. In some cases, such as high-end digital scopes, the constant is 0.45 rather 
than 0.35. In any case, the formulas should be treated as approximate.
T E C H  T I P
If you want to measure a fast rising 
pulse with an oscilloscope, you 
need to be aware of the bandwidth 
of the instrument or you may be 
measuring the rise time of the 
oscilloscope and probe rather than 
the signal of interest. For example, 
an oscilloscope/probe combination 
with a bandwidth of 100 MHz has 
a rise time of approximately 3.5 ns. 
Ideally, the scope should have a rise 
time that is 4X faster than the rise 
time of the signal to be measured 
or accuracy is sacrificed.

If the capacitor in an RC integrator opens, the output has the same waveshape as 
the input, as shown in Figure 20–52(a). If the capacitor in a differentiator opens, the 
output is zero because it is held at ground through the resistor, as illustrated in

Troubleshooting  ●  933
Leaky Capacitor
If the capacitor in an RC integrator becomes leaky, three things happen: (a) the time 
constant will be effectively reduced by the leakage resistance (when thevenized, look-
ing from C it appears in parallel with R); (b) the waveshape of the output voltage 
(across C) is altered from normal by a shorter charging time; and (c) the amplitude of 
the output is reduced because R and Rleak effectively act as a voltage divider. These 
effects are illustrated in Figure 20–53(a).
If the capacitor in a differentiator becomes leaky, the time constant is reduced, just as 
in the integrator (they are both simply series RC circuits). When the capacitor reaches 
full charge, the output voltage (across R) is set by the effective voltage-divider action of 
R and Rleak, as shown in Figure 20–53(b).

Shorted Capacitor
If the capacitor in an RC integrator shorts, the output is at ground, as shown in 
Figure 20–54(a). If the capacitor in a RC differentiator shorts, the output is the same 
as the input, as shown in part (b).
Open Resistor
If the resistor in an RC integrator opens, the capacitor has no discharge path, and, 
ideally, it will hold its charge. In an actual situation, the charge will gradually leak off 
or the capacitor will discharge slowly through a measuring instrument connected to 
the output. This is illustrated in Figure 20–55(a).

Application Activity  ●  935
If the resistor in a differentiator opens, the output looks like the input except for the 
dc level because the capacitor now must charge and discharge through the  extremely 
high resistance of the oscilloscope, as shown in Figure 20–55(b).
SECTION 20–9 
CHECKUP
1. An RC integrator has a zero output with a square wave input. What are the possible 
causes of this problem?
2. If the capacitor in a differentiator is shorted, what is the output for a square wave input?
Application Activity
In this application  activity, you 
are asked to build and test a 
time-delay circuit that will provide five switch-selectable delay 
times. An RC  integrator is selected for this application. The 
input is a 5 V pulse of long duration, and the output goes to 
a threshold trigger circuit that is used to turn the power on to 
a portion of a system at any of the five selected time intervals 
after the occurrence of the original pulse.
A schematic of the selectable time-delay integrating circuit 
is shown in Figure 20–56. The RC integrator is driven by a 
pulse input; and the output is an exponentially increasing 
voltage that is used to trigger a threshold circuit at the 3.5 V 
level, which then turns power on to part of a system. The 
basic concept is shown in Figure 20–57. In this application, 
the delay time of the integrator is specified to be the time 
from the rising edge of the input pulse to the point where the 
output voltage reaches 3.5 V. The specified delay times are as 
listed in Table 20–1.

948  ●  Three-Phase Systems In Power Applications
The size of the copper wire required to carry current from a generator to a load can 
be reduced when a three-phase rather than a single-phase generator is used. The total 
copper cross section, which is a quantity representing the number of conductors and 
the load carried by each conductor, is also less with three-phase systems. Think of the  
copper cross section as measuring the total amount of copper required to deliver a  
certain amount of power.
Figure 21–1 is a simplified representation of a single-phase generator connected to 
a resistive load. The coil symbol represents the generator winding.
For example, a single-phase sinusoidal voltage is induced in the winding and 
 applied to a 60 Ω load, as indicated in Figure 21–2. The resulting load current is
IRL = 120∠0° V
60∠0° Ω= 2.0∠0° A

The total current that must be delivered by the generator to the load is 2.0∠0° A. This 
means that each of the two conductors carrying current to and from the load must each be 
capable of handling 2.0 A; thus, the total copper cross section is 4.0 A. The total load power is

feed three 180 Ω resistors in parallel, thus creating an effective load resistance of 60 Ω. 
The coils represent the generator windings separated by 120°.
The voltage across RL1 is 120∠0° V, the voltage across RL2 is 120∠120° V, and the 
voltage across RL3 is 120∠-120° V, as indicated in Figure 21–4(a). The current from

Three-phase example.
The total load power is
PL(tot) = I 2
RL1RL1 + I 2
RL2RL2 + I 2
RL3RL3 = 240 W
This is the same total load power as delivered by the single-phase system previously 
discussed.
Notice that four conductors, including the neutral, are required to carry the  
currents to and from the loads. The current in each of the three conductors is 667 mA, 
as indicated in Figure 21–4(a). The current in the neutral conductor is the phasor sum 
of the three load currents and is equal to zero, as shown in the following equation, 
with reference to the phasor diagram in Figure 21–4(b).
IRL1 + IRL2 + IRL3 = 667∠0° mA + 667∠120° mA + 667∠-120° mA
 = 667 mA - 333 mA + j577 mA - 333 mA - j577 mA
 = 667 mA - 667 mA = 0 A
This condition, where all load currents are equal and the neutral current is zero, is 
called a balanced load condition.
The total copper cross section must handle 667 mA + 667 mA + 667 mA + 0 mA
= 2 A. This result shows that considerably less copper is required to deliver the same 
load power with a three-phase system than is required for the single-phase system. 
The amount of copper is an important consideration in power distribution systems.

950  ●  Three-Phase Systems In Power Applications
A second advantage of three-phase systems over a single-phase system is that 
three-phase systems produce a constant amount of power in the load. As shown in 
Figure 21–5, the load power fluctuates as the square of the sinusoidal voltage divided 
by the resistance. It changes from a maximum of V 2
RL(max)/RL to a minimum of zero 
at a frequency equal to twice that of the voltage.
Compare the total copper cross sections in terms of current-carrying capacity  
for single-phase and three-phase 120 V systems with effective load resistances  
of 12 Ω.
Solution 
Single-phase system: The load current is
IRL = 120 V
12 Ω= 10 A
The conductor to the load must carry 10 A, and the return conductor from the 
load must also carry 10 A.
The total copper cross section, therefore, is 2 * 10 A = 20 A.
Three-phase system: For an effective load resistance of 12 Ω, the three-phase gen-
erator feeds three load resistors of 36 Ω each. The current in each load resistor is
IRL = 120 V
36 Ω= 3.33 A
Each of the three conductors feeding the balanced load must carry 3.33 A,  
and the neutral current is zero.
Therefore, the total copper cross section is 3 * 3.33 A ≅10 A. This is half 
the copper cross section of the single-phase system with an equivalent load.
Related Problem* 
Compare the total copper cross sections in terms of current-carrying capacity for 
single-phase and three-phase 240 V systems with effective load resistances of 100 Ω.

means a uniform conversion of mechanical to electrical energy, which is an important 
consideration in many power applications.
In many applications, ac generators are used to drive ac motors for conversion of 
electrical energy to mechanical energy in the form of shaft rotation in the motor. The 
original energy for operation of the generator can come from any of several sources, 
such as hydroelectric and steam. Figure 21–7 illustrates the basic concept.
When a three-phase generator is connected to the motor windings, a magnetic field is 
created within the motor that has a constant flux density and that rotates at the frequency 
of the three-phase sine wave. The motor’s rotor is pulled around at a constant rotational 
velocity by the rotating magnetic field, producing a constant shaft rotation, which is an 
advantage of three-phase systems. The rotating field simplifies the design of motors.
A single-phase system is unsuitable for many applications because it produces a 
magnetic field that fluctuates in flux density and reverses direction during each cycle 
without providing the advantage of constant rotation. Single-phase motors require 
some means to start the motor, whereas three-phase motors do not.

The Y-Connected Generator
A Y-connected system can be either a three-wire or, when the neutral is used, a  
four-wire system, as shown in Figure 21–8, connected to a generalized load, which is 
indicated by the green block. Recall that when the loads are perfectly balanced, the 
neutral current is zero; therefore, the neutral conductor is unnecessary. However, in 
cases where the loads are not equal (unbalanced), a neutral wire is essential to provide 
a return current path because the neutral current has a nonzero value.

The voltages across the generator windings are called phase voltages (Vu), and the 
currents through the windings are called phase currents (Iu). Also, the currents in the 
lines connecting the generator windings to the load are called line currents (IL), and 
the voltages across the lines are called the line voltages (VL). Note that the magnitude 
of each line current is equal to the corresponding phase current in the Y-connected 
circuit because there is no other path for current.
IL = Iu
Equation 21–1
In Figure 21–9, the line terminations of the windings are designated a, b, and c, 
and the neutral point is designated n. These letters are added as subscripts to the 
phase and line currents to indicate the phase with which each is associated. The phase 
voltages are also designated in the same manner. Notice that the phase voltages are 
always positive at the terminal end of the winding and are negative at the neutral 
point. The line voltages are from one winding terminal to another, as indicated by the 
double-letter subscripts. For example, VL(ba) is the line voltage from b to a.
Figure 21–10(a) shows a phasor diagram for the phase voltages. By rotation of 
the phasors, as shown in part (b), Vua is given a reference angle of zero, and the polar 
expressions for the phasor voltages are as follows:
Vua = Vua∠0°
Vub = Vub∠120°
 Vuc = Vuc∠-120°
There are three line voltages: one between a and b, one between a and c, and 
 another between b and c. It can be shown that the magnitude of each line voltage is 
equal to 13 times the magnitude of the phase voltage and that there is a phase angle 
of 30° between each line voltage and the nearest phase voltage.

The 𝚫-Connected Generator
In the Y-connected generator, two voltage magnitudes are available at the terminals in 
the four-wire system: the phase voltage and the line voltage. Also, in the Y-connected 
generator, the line current is equal to the phase current. Keep these characteristics in 
mind as you examine the ∆-connected generator.
The windings of a three-phase generator can be rearranged to form a ∆-connected 
generator, as shown in Figure 21–14. By examination of this diagram, you can see 
that the magnitudes of the line voltages and phase voltages are equal because they 
are  measured across the same two points, but the line currents do not equal the phase 
currents.
Since this is a three-wire system, only a single voltage magnitude is available, 
 expressed as
VL = Vu
Equation 21–3
All of the phase voltages are equal in magnitude; thus, the line voltages are  expressed 
in polar form as follows:

Three-Phase Source/Load Analysis  ●  957
A Y-connected load is shown in Figure 21–19(a), and a ∆-connected load is shown 
in part (b). The blocks Za, Zb, and Zc represent the load impedances, which can be 
resistive, reactive, or both.
The four source/load configurations are:
1. Y-connected source driving a Y-connected load (Y-Y system)
2. Y-connected source driving a ∆-connected load (Y-∆ system)
3. ∆-connected source driving a Y-connected load (∆-Y system)
4. ∆-connected source driving a ∆-connected load (∆-∆ system)
The Y-Y System
Figure 21–20 shows a Y-connected source driving a Y-connected load. The load can 
be a balanced load, such as a three-phase motor where Za = Zb = Zc, or it can be 
three independent single-phase loads where, for example, Za is a lighting circuit, Zb is 
a heater, and Zc is an air-conditioning compressor.
An important feature of a Y-connected source is that two different values of 
 three-phase voltage are available: the phase voltage and the line voltage. For 
 example, in the standard power distribution system, a three-phase transformer can 
be considered a source of three-phase voltage supplying 120 V and 208 V. In order 
to utilize a phase voltage of 120 V, the loads are connected in the Y configuration.  
A ∆- connected load is used for the 208 V line voltages.
Notice in the Y-Y system in Figure 21–20 that the phase current, the line current, 
and the load current are all equal in each phase. Also, each load voltage equals the 
corresponding phase voltage. These relationships are expressed as follows and are 
true for either a balanced or an unbalanced load.

For industrial plants with three-
phase motors and other loads, 
there will normally be a regular 
scheduled preventive maintenance 
(PM) program with a record kept 
of all maintenance performed. The 
purpose of preventive mainte-
nance is to avoid failures that cost 
downtime on equipment. This 
is particularly important in high 
moisture, high temperature, or 
dusty environments that have cool-
ing fans, lubrication requirements, 
air filters, etc. Electrical equipment 
should be inspected regularly; 
this often includes a thermo-
graphic inspection to identify hot 
components before they fail. Some 
industries constantly monitor 
and record certain parameters 
such as node voltages of electrical 
assemblies so that maintenance 
outside of the normal schedule can 
be assessed and addressed.

For a balanced load, all the phase currents are equal, and the neutral current is 
zero. For an unbalanced load, each phase current is different, and the neutral current 
is, therefore, nonzero. Although a small imbalance in loads is common, a large imbal-

The Y-𝚫 System
Figure 21–22 shows a Y-connected source driving a ∆-connected load. An important 
feature of this configuration is that each phase of the load has the full line voltage 
across it.
 
VZ = VL 
Equation 21–7
The line currents equal the corresponding phase currents, and each line current 
divides into two load currents, as indicated. For a balanced load (Za = Zb = Zc), the 
expression for the current in each load is
 
IL = 13IZ 
Equation 21–8
You might wonder about the 23 in Equation 21–8. It occurs with a balanced load 
as a consequence of applying Kirchhoff’s Current Law to any of the three junctions 
on the delta.

The 𝚫-Y System
Figure 21–25 shows a ∆-connected source driving a Y-connected balanced load. By 
examination of the figure, you can see that the line voltages are equal to the corre-
sponding phase voltages of the source. Also, each phase voltage equals the difference 
of the corresponding load voltages, as you can see by the polarities.
Each load current equals the corresponding line current. The sum of the load cur-
rents is zero because the load is balanced; thus, there is no need for a neutral return.

2. In a certain Y-Y system, the source phase currents each have a magnitude of 3.5 A. 
What is the magnitude of each load current for a balanced load condition?
3. In a given Y-∆ system, VL = 220 V. Determine VZ.

5. Determine the magnitude of the load currents in a balanced ∆-∆ system having  
a line current magnitude of 3.2 A.
Each phase of a balanced three-phase load has an equal amount of power. Therefore, 
the total true load power is three times the power in each phase of the load.
 
PL(tot) = 3VZIZ cos u

where VZ and IZ are the voltage and current associated with each phase of the load, 
and cos u is the power factor.
Recall that in a balanced Y-connected system, the line voltage and line current were
VL = 13VZ  and  IL = IZ
and in a balanced ∆-connected system, the line voltage and line current were
VL = VZ  and  IL = 13IZ

Power Measurement
Power is measured in three-phase systems using wattmeters. The wattmeter uses a 
basic electrodynamometer-type movement consisting of two coils. One coil is used to 
measure the current, and the other is used to measure the voltage. Figure 21–29 shows 
a basic wattmeter schematic and the connections for measuring power in a load. The 
resistor in series with the voltage coil limits the current through the coil to a small 
amount proportional to the voltage across the coil.
Three-Wattmeter Method Power can be measured easily in a balanced or unbalanced 
three-phase load of either the Y or the ∆ type by using three wattmeters connected as 
shown in Figure 21–30. This is sometimes known as the three-wattmeter method.

Three-wattmeter method of power measurement.
The power factor is
cos u = cos 30° = 0.866
The total load power is
PL(tot) = 13VLILcos u = 13(250 V)(8.66 A)(0.866) = 3.25 kW
 
Related Problem 
Determine the total load power if VL = 120 V and Z = 100∠30° Ω.

Summary  ●  965
The total power is determined by summing the three wattmeter readings.
 
Ptot = P1 + P2 + P3 
Equation 21–15
If the load is balanced, the total power is simply three times the reading on any one 
wattmeter.
In many three-phase loads, particularly the ∆ configuration, it is difficult to con-
nect a wattmeter such that the voltage coil is across the load or such that the current 
coil is in series with the load because of inaccessibility of points within the load.
Two-Wattmeter Method Another method of three-phase power measurement uses only 
two wattmeters. The connections for this two-wattmeter method are shown in Figure 21–31. 
Notice that the voltage coil of each wattmeter is connected across a line voltage and that 
the current coil has a line current through it. It can be shown that the algebraic sum of the 
two wattmeter readings equals the total power in the Y- or ∆-connected load.
 
Ptot = P1 { P2

Equation 11–5 RMS (Effective) Value of a Sine Wave
The abbreviation “rms” stands for the root mean square process by which this value is 
derived. In the process, we first square the equation of a sinusoidal voltage wave.
v2 = V 2
p sin2u
Next, we obtain the mean or average value of v2 by dividing the area under a half-cycle 
of the curve by p (see Figure B–1). The area is found by integration and trigonometric 
identities.

Equation 11–11 Average Value of a Half-Cycle Sine Wave
The average value of a sine wave is determined for a half-cycle because the average over 
a full cycle is zero.
The equation for a sine wave is
v = Vp sin u
The average value of the half-cycle is the area under the curve divided by the distance 
of the curve along the horizontal axis (see Figure B–2).

Simulate, Prototype, and Test Circuits
Theory, Design, and Prototype
As electronic circuits and systems become more advanced, circuit designers rely on 
computers in the design process. It is essential for engineers and technicians to system-
atically design, simulate, prototype, and lay out the circuit. Students can also use the 
engineering and design process to reinforce concepts and theory in the classroom. The 
three stages of the student design process are illustrated in Figure D–1.

982  ●  Appendix
The National Instruments Electronics Education Platform is an end-to-end 
tool-chain designed to meet student and educator needs. The platform consists of 
NI Multisim simulation software, the NI Educational Laboratory Virtual Instrumen-
tation Suite (NI ELVIS) prototyping workstation, and the NI LabVIEW graphical 
programming environment. NI Multisim provides intuitive schematic capture, SPICE 
simulation, and integration with the NI ELVIS to help students explore circuit theory 
and design circuits to investigate behavior. NI ELVIS is a prototyping platform that 
allows students to quickly and easily create their circuits. With NI LabVIEW, students 
can measure real-world signals and compare simulation results.
1. Investigate Theory Learn the fundamental theory of circuit design through the 
Principles of Electric Circuits textbook and course lectures. Reinforce important con-
cepts in the easy-to-use Multisim environment by downloading the Multisim circuit 
files for the textbook. The Multisim circuit files help build the foundation for an 
 in-depth understanding of circuit behavior. Using the prebuilt circuit files, simulate 
and analyze the circuit behavior of examples and problems in each chapter.
2. Design and Simulate Circuit simulation provides an interactive view into a circuit. 
Build a circuit from scratch and learn about the design performance using built-in circuit 
instruments and probes in an ideal pre-laboratory environment. With the 3D breadboard 
in Multisim, take the leap from circuit diagram to real-world physical implementation.
3. Prototype, Measure, and Compare Hands-on experience building physical cir-
cuitry is essential. Move from the 3D breadboard in Multisim to a real-world bread-
board on NI ELVIS to seamlessly complete the entire design process by prototyping 
the circuit. Within the LabVIEW environment, compare real-world measurements to 
the simulation values to reinforce theory, fully understand circuit behavior, and build 
the foundations of professional engineering analysis.
NI Multisim
Multisim integrates industry standard SPICE simulation with an interactive sche-
matic environment to instantly visualize and analyze electronic circuits behavior. 
Multisim for Education has been developed with educators to enable students 
to easily visualize and understand the behavior of electronics with 30+ intuitive 
 simulated instruments, 20+ easy-to-configure analyses, and interactive compo-
nents that are proven to reinforce theory and prepare students for authentic design 
 challenges.
Using Multisim with Principles of Electric Circuits Create an example from the 
textbook to get familiar with the Multisim environment. First, launch Multisim and 
open a new schematic window (File >> New >> Schematic Capture). Design circuits 
in the circuit window by placing components from the component toolbar. Clicking 
on the component toolbar opens the component browser. Choose the family of com-
ponents and select an individual component to place on the circuit window by double-
clicking on it.
Once you have selected a component, it attaches itself and “ghosts” the mouse cur-
sor. Place the component by clicking again on the desired location in the schematic. 
If you are new to Multisim, you should use the BASIC_VIRTUAL family of compo-
nents, which you can assign any arbitrary value. As an example of a simple Multisim 
circuit, an RLC circuit is shown in Figure D–2. The circuit connects a 1 kΩ resistor, a 
47 mH inductor, and a 10 nF capacitor. All these components are found in the Basic 
Group of the Component Database.
The next step is to wire the components together. Simply left-click on the source 
terminal and left-click on the destination terminal. Multisim automatically chooses 
the best path for the virtual wire between the two terminals. Always be sure you have 

Appendix  ●  983
fully captured your circuit; then you can simulate it. You can use your simulation 
 results as a comparison with the physical circuit.
To analyze the circuit, use a measurement probe to measure the voltages and other 
characteristics from the circuit while the simulation is running. Use the virtual oscil-
loscope to analyze the output signal from our sample RLC circuit.
NI ELVIS
NI ELVIS is a project-based learning solution combining instrumentation, embed-
ded design, and web connectivity for engineering fundamentals and system design. 
Students can design, build, and troubleshoot circuits using the integrated instruments 
and the intuitive interface.
NI ELVIS features a breadboard prototyping environment and build-in instru-
ments including: Oscilloscope, Function and Arbitrary Waveform Generator, Digital 
Multimeter, Variable Power Supply, Bode Analyzer, IV Analyzer, and Logic Analyzer 
and Pattern Generator. The breadboard is detachable, so you can work on your proj-
ects and labs independently of the NI ELVIS unit. NI ELVIS provides software based 
on LabVIEW for interacting with virtual instruments.
Using NI ELVIS with Principles of Electric Circuits Returning to the RLC circuit 
introduced with Multisim as an example, you can continue the prototyping step. With 
prototyping hardware, you can quickly construct a circuit on a standard protoboard 
and test it with the laboratory instruments to complete the design.

Alternatively, you can repeat the simulation step but this time as a prototype 
 using the Virtual 3D NI ELVIS from within Multisim. To construct a 3D NI ELVIS 
prototype, open the 3D breadboard by clicking Tools >> Show Breadboard. Place 
components and wires to build up your circuit. The corresponding connection points 
and symbols on the NI ELVIS schematic turn green, indicating the 3D connections are 
correct. If you create a traditional schematic, you see a standard breadboard.
After constructing the circuit, launch the NI ELVIS Oscilloscope to measure 
the output signal of this circuit. The most important step in the process is to com-
pare the measurement of the prototyped circuit to the simulation. This helps you de-
termine where  potential errors exist in the design. After comparing the measurement 
with the theoretical values, you can revisit your design to improve it or prepare it for 
layout on a PCB board, using software such as NI Ultiboard.

balanced load A condition in a three-phase system where all the 
load currents are equal and the neutral current is zero.
band-pass filter A filter that passes a range of frequencies lying 
between two critical frequencies and rejects frequencies above and 
below that range.
band-stop filter A filter that rejects a range of frequencies lying 
between two critical frequencies and passes frequencies above and 
below that range.
bandwidth The range of frequencies for which the current  
(or output voltage) is equal to or greater than 70.7% of  
its value at the resonant frequency that is considered to  
be passed by a filter.
baseline The normal level of a pulse waveform; the voltage level in 
the absence of a pulse.
battery An energy source that uses a chemical reaction to convert 
chemical energy into electrical energy.
bias The application of a dc voltage to an electronic device to 
produce a desired mode of operation.
bleeder current The current left after the total load current is 
subtracted from the total current into the circuit.
Bode plot A frequency response curve for a filter or circuit. The 
Bode magnitude plot is a graph of the ratio of Vout>Vin in dB 
plotted against frequency, which is plotted on a logarithmic scale. 
The Bode phase plot is the ratio of the output phase to the input 
phase expressed in angular units (typically degrees) plotted against 
frequency.
branch (1) A current path in a parallel circuit (2) A current path 
that connects two nodes.
branch current The actual current in a branch.
branch current method An analysis method that relies on Ohm’s law 
and Kirchhoff’s laws to find unknown currents in a circuit.
capacitance The ability of a capacitor to store electrical charge.
capacitive reactance The opposition of a capacitor to sinusoidal 
current. The unit is ohm (Ω).
capacitive susceptance (BC) The ability of a capacitor to 
permit current; the reciprocal of capacitive reactance. The 
unit is siemens (S).
capacitor An electrical device consisting of two conductive plates 
separated by an insulating material and possessing the property of 
capacitance.
cathode The terminal of a polarized device that electrons flow to. 
For a battery that is supplying current, this is the positive terminal; 
for a diode, it is the negative terminal.

to permit current; the reciprocal of impedance. The unit is 
siemens (S).
alternator An ac generator that converts energy of motion into 
electrical energy.
ammeter An electrical instrument used to measure current.
ampere (A) The unit of electrical current.

mined by multiplying the current (A) times the length of time (h) a 
battery can deliver that current to a load.
ampere-turn The current in a single loop (turn) of wire.
amplitude The maximum value of a voltage or current measured 
from the mean.
angular velocity The rotational rate of a phasor which is related 
to the frequency of the sine wave that the phasor represents.
anode The terminal of a polarized device that electrons flow from.

is the rotor.
atom The smallest particle of an element possessing the unique 
characteristics of that element.
atomic number The number of protons in a nucleus.
attenuation A reduction of the output signal compared to the 
input signal, resulting in a ratio with a value of less than 1 for the 
output voltage to the input voltage of a circuit.
autotransformer A transformer in which the primary and second-
ary are in a single winding.
average value The average of a sine wave over one half-cycle. It is 
0.637 times the peak value.
