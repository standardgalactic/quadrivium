A word to parents
As parents, we use math all the time—as we shop, ﬁgure out how much time 
to allot for errands, and schedule time for cooking, eating, and cleaning. Often,
our children are with us during these tasks. Perhaps they are even helping out.
Why not involve them in the math? 
The ten everyday math activities in this kit build math into the things most 
families already do—ordinary routines such as ﬁguring out ways to save money,
to share fairly, or to get somewhere on time. With these activities, children 
practice adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, and using other important
math skills while doing tasks that are a regular part of life.
As you look through the activities, think about which ones you’d like to try 
with your children. Choose those that ﬁt best with the way you manage your
household and family routines. Think also about what your children like to do.
If they hate cleaning their rooms, you might put off the activity that involves
room cleaning. Then again, if you need that room cleaned up fast, this might 
be an excellent place to start!
Each activity is suitable for children of various ages. Parents often need to deal
with two or more children at once, and these versatile math activities can be
adjusted to challenge older children as well as meet the needs of younger ones.
The variations at the end of each activity suggest ways you might adapt the
ideas to ﬁt your family. Once you start, you’ll ﬁnd yourself making your own
adjustments automatically.
Everyday math activities

Making these activities work for you
Each family’s use of these activities and games will differ. As you begin to work them
into your life, you will draw upon your own knowledge of your children, relying on
familiar techniques for handling family situations. While you experiment to ﬁnd 
what works for you, keep in mind the following general principles:
Try to ﬁnd one time each day when you can do a little math with your child—
maybe during chores, while driving in the car or riding the bus, at bed time or 
bath time, or at the laundromat. The activities take only a few minutes, and 
you can repeat them on many occasions.
Use your judgment in choosing things to do from the books. Most of the activities and
games can be done in any order. Read them through before deciding what you would
like to try ﬁrst.
Let your children lead the way. Honor their interests and their attention spans,
and always stop before boredom or frustration set in. The goal is to spark your 
children’s interest in math and keep the ﬂame going.
Beyond these activities and games, let your children see and hear you doing math
throughout the day. If you clip coupons, talk about what you are using them for and
how much you hope to save. As you look forward to a special event, count aloud the
remaining days on the calendar. By giving your children examples of how you use
math, you’ll be conveying the message that math is important and useful in daily life.
A ﬁnal word
Children need lots of practice in order to become strong mathematical thinkers.
The ideas in this booklet offer many good starting points. We hope you’ll make math 
a regular part of your life. The more you do, the more your children will grow to 
enjoy math.

Age range 5–11
Before you begin
Choose a number that you will call the
“number of the day.” The ﬁrst time you do
this activity, choose a number under 15.
1. Find one way to make the 
number of the day
Ask your children to think up different
ways to make the number of the day,
using equations.
“Let’s all try to come up with different
ways to make 11. Here’s one way:
8 + 2 + 1 = 11. Can you ﬁnd a 
different way?”
2. Collect everyone’s equations
If your children know how to write 
equations, they list their ideas and take
turns reading them.
When you’re in the car, or if younger 
children need help, appoint one person
“record keeper.” As people give their ideas,
the record keeper writes them down in
equation form.
When everyone’s hands are busy making
dinner, folding laundry, or pulling weeds,
just take turns telling each other how you
made the number—no writing is needed.
3. Find more ways to make 
the number 
See how many different ways everyone
can ﬁnd to make the number of the day.
You can offer speciﬁc challenges to give
children practice with something they’re
doing in school, or just for variety.
For ages 5–7, try using …
Addition with three numbers
1 + 3 + 7 = 11
Subtraction
13 - 2 = 11
Addition and subtraction
6 + 6 - 1 = 11
Coin values
2 nickels and 1 penny is 11 cents
For ages 7–9, try using … 
Pairs of the same number
2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11
Multiplication
4 x 5 - 9 = 11
Multiples of 5 and 10
25 + 15 - 30 + 1 = 11
The number 100
100 - (3 x 25) - 14 = 11 
“The number of the day was 6. Sarita made 1 + 2 + 3. I did 24 ÷ 4.
Dad’s was 20 – 15 + 1, and Grandma said 4 x 25 – 80 – 14. She had 
to explain that one!”
You can use this activity to give your children lots of computation
practice. Try it just about anywhere—on the bus, in the kitchen,
or even while folding laundry.

Paper and pencil 
(optional)

Computation
For ages 9–11, try using … 
A fraction or decimal
22 x .5 = 11
All four operations in one equation
(150 ÷ 10) x 3 - 40 + 6 = 11
Only one numeral
(33 - 3) ÷ 3 + (3 ÷ 3) = 11
The year you were born
1991 - 1900 - 80 = 11
Note: When an equation has parentheses,
do the parts in parentheses ﬁrst. To solve
100 - (3 x 25), ﬁrst do 3 x 25, then subtract
the result from 100.
When you repeat this activity
Family members can take turns choosing
the number of the day. If you have young
children, keep the number under 15.
Otherwise, try a variety of numbers,
including large ones (such as 312 and
50,429) and small ones (such as the day 
of the month, a child’s age, or a fraction or
decimal less than 1). Small numbers can
be just as challenging as large ones.
Every now and then, ask children to
explain their thinking: “How did you come
up with 27 - 18 = 9? What was going
through your head?” Be sure to explain
your own thinking sometimes, too.
Talking about thinking is also a good way
to handle mistakes. Children may notice
and correct a mistake as they talk about
how they arrived at the answer. If not, try
to use their explanations as a basis for
helping. For example, suppose a child
says, “7 + 3 = 9 because 7, 8, 9—that’s 3.”
You might respond, “Counting is a good
way to do it. What’s 1 more than 7? … 
OK, 8. What’s 2 more?”
Use a starting number (ages 7–11) 
Everyone’s equations must start with the
same number. For example, suppose the 
number of the day is 57 and you pick 10 as
the starting number. Here are two possible
equations:
10 + 40 + 7 = 57
10 x 5 + 7 = 57
Stories about the number of the day 
(ages 5–11)
Make up story problems with the number of
the day for the answer. For example, for the
number 27: 
“When we went for a walk yesterday, Ebony
found 12 pretty stones. Bryce found 9, and I
found 6. How many stones did we ﬁnd in all?”
“I bought 4 books of postage stamps. Each
one had 10 stamps. I used 13 stamps to 
mail party invitations. How many stamps did 
I have left?”

Before you begin
Choose something your child can count
and put away, such as crayons scattered
on a table or toys on the ﬂoor. When you
can’t be available to help your younger
children count, choose an area with 
limited clutter so that they’ll be able to 
do the counting themselves. (Many 5- and
6-year-olds can count only 10 to 20 items
accurately, even if they can recite the
“counting numbers” much higher.)
1. Estimate how many things there
are to put away
Ask your child to make an estimate—or to
guess the number of items to be picked up.
“About how many things are we looking 
at here—about 10? About 50? Closer to 
100 or 1000?”
Some children’s estimates will be on the
high side. They might say there are a
thousand or even a million things on a
messy ﬂoor. Over time, as they practice
counting and estimating, their ability to
judge amounts will improve.
2. Count the things as they are put
away 
Suggest that your children count each
item that they put away. If you are super-
vising, you can help younger ones count 
as the numbers get larger.
3. Compare the actual count with
the estimate
Part way through cleanup, give your child
a chance to revise the original estimate.
“You predicted that there were about 1000
books on the ﬂoor. So far, you put away 29,
and there are just a few left. Do you still
think there are about 1000? Do you want
to change your prediction?”
When the chore is done, compare the 
actual count to the latest estimate. If 
the estimate was “way off,” assure your
child that an estimate is just a guess, and
that learning to make close estimates can
take a long time.
Materials
Ordinary household 
clutter
How much is on the ﬂoor?
“Oh, Mom! Do I really have to clean up everything?”
Sometimes a little math can make chores more 
interesting. In this activity, children estimate 
how many things are scattered on the ﬂoor 
(or in some other cluttered place) and then 
count the things as they put them away.
Age range 5–9

Estimation and counting
When you repeat this activity
To give children lots of practice judging
amounts, try this activity in different 
situations: when there are small things
like beads or buttons to put away, larger
items like clothing or shoes, or items of 
all different sizes. If you’ve been helping
young children count, see if they can do
more of the counting themselves.
Would that be enough? (ages 5–9) 
Decide on a particular number of things for
your children to put away. Before they begin,
ask them to predict whether that amount is
“enough” to clear all the clutter. Vary the task
for children of different ages.
For ages 5–7: Give the children a total 
number of items. “Look at all these toys on
the ﬂoor! If we put away 15 toys, do you think
we’d get the ﬂoor clean? Or would there still 
be some left on the ﬂoor?”
For ages 7–9: Specify an amount for each of
several people to pick up. “There are three 
of us here to unload the dishwasher. What 
if we each put away 14 things? Would that be
enough to empty the dishwasher? Let’s try 
it and see.”
What’s the most? (ages 5–9) 
Try this when there are different kinds of
things to put away—for instance, when you’re
sorting clean laundry that includes different
kinds of clothes, or when there are different
types of art supplies (markers, crayons, sheets
of paper) on the table. First, make an estimate.
Then count as you sort and put away. 
“Let’s take everything out of the clothes dryer.
Do you think there are more socks, shirts, or
towels in this load of laundry?”
“Who do you think has the most clothes in this
load of clean laundry—you, Tony, Marco, me,
or Mom? Let’s sort the laundry to see!”
How many can you put away in a minute?
(ages 5–9)
This works well when there are lots of little
things scattered around. First, everyone 
estimates how much they can put away in
exactly one minute (or some other amount of
time). Then an older child or adult is the timer
while everyone else picks up and counts.
When the time is up, compare your estimates
with your actual counts.

1. Count to ﬁnd how much food
Put the food to be shared on a plate so
everyone can see it. If there are more than
a few items, ask your children to make an
estimate ﬁrst:
“About how many cherries do you think 
we have? Let’s count and see.”
If necessary, help young children with 
the counting as the numbers get large.
2. Divide the total into equal parts
Remind your children of the number of
items and the number of people to share
them.
“So, there are 17 cherries and 3 of us. How
many cherries should we give each person?”
For ages 5–7
Young children learn about division by
working with actual things. Try asking
them to deal out the food and count how
many each person gets.
For ages 7–11
If your children need help, work with
them in one of these ways.
Add up. “What if we gave everyone 2 
cherries? How many would that be? … 
What if we gave everyone 3 cherries? … 
5 cherries? How many would be left over?”
Subtract. “If everyone gets 1 cherry, how
many are left? … What if everyone gets 
2 cherries? … 5 cherries? Can we give out 
6 cherries to everyone?”
Use multiplication or division facts. “What if
there were 15 cherries, how could you
divide them into 3 equal shares? What’s 
15 ÷ 3? … Yes, everyone would get 5. That
takes care of 15 of the cherries. How many
are left over?”
3. Decide what to do with the
extras (optional)
If there are any extras, discuss what to 
do with them: leave them for someone
else? Break them into pieces and share
the pieces?
If it makes sense to divide the extras into
equal parts, you can do this as a way to
bring up fractions. No one wants to divide
that extra cherry into three equal parts, but
you could easily divide other kinds of foods.
“How can we divide these two brownies up
among the three of us?”
“There are seven pancakes left. How can
we divide them up among the ﬁve of us?”
If your children aren’t sure how to start,
suggest dividing each extra item into
equal parts for everyone. For example, to
share two brownies among three people,
cut each brownie into three equal parts,
or thirds. How many of these thirds are
there? How can they be shared? 
Materials
Between about 5 
and 50 “countable”
foods, like pancakes,
crackers, or 
strawberries
What’s fair?
“Cherries—yum! I want the exact same amount as Tulani!”
When it comes to favorite foods, everyone wants a “fair share.”
When your children ask you to “make it fair,” ask them to ﬁgure out
how to divide up the food so everyone gets the same amount. This
involves using division, as well as counting, adding, subtracting,
and multiplying—and sometimes even working with fractions.
Age range 5–11

4. Distribute the food
(This step won’t be necessary if children
dealt out the food as part of step 2.)
Ask your children to count out the actual
items for each person. This is an ideal 
job for a young child if the numbers are
small. If it’s necessary, help them cut or
break up the extras into equal parts.
Before everyone eats, make sure there’s
agreement that the distribution of food 
is fair. If there’s any disagreement, talk
with them about what they think would
be fair and why.
When you repeat this activity
Try different numbers of food items, and
different numbers of people sharing. For
more challenge, use larger amounts, and
amounts that give you “extras.” Encourage
children to explain how they got their
answers, and to check their work by 
ﬁnding the solution in a different way.
Division and multiplication
Working together (ages 5–11)
If there are two or more children, you can
divide up this activity so each child is doing 
a different part: counting the items to be
shared; checking the count; ﬁguring out how
many each person gets; and then counting 
out the equal shares.
Equal shares for some (ages 5-11) 
Sometimes, people don’t want the exact same
amount. A younger child might not eat quite as
much, or someone might not be very hungry. 
Tell your children how much one or two people
get, and ask them to ﬁgure out how to share
the rest fairly among everyone else. 
“There are 12 pancakes and 5 of us. Malia
eats just one and Dad only wants two. How
many will each of the rest of us get?”
Challenge older children with clues about
uneven sharing.
“We have 10 crackers. Let’s share them so
that I get 2 less than you do. How many does
each of us get?”
“There are 6 strawberries left. What if I get 
half as many as you do? How many will we
each get?”
These problems can be difﬁcult. Try one 
when there are just a small number of things
to share.
Variations

4 
Before you begin
Decide how long turns will be. Here are
some ideas for children of different ages.
For ages 5–7 
take 1- to 3-minute turns, or
take 10-minute turns and start turns on 
a multiple of 10 minutes (10:10 or 7:30).
For ages 7–9 
take turns of any number up to 10 
minutes, or
take turns of any multiple of 5 minutes
(15, 20, 35).
For ages 9–11 
take turns that are not multiples of 5 or
10 minutes. Try turns of 13 minutes, 19
minutes, or 37 minutes.
1. Talk through the turn taking
Make sure your children know
how long each turn is,
what order they’ll take turns in, and
what time turn taking begins
“You all want to use stencils to make your
pictures, but we can only ﬁnd one stencil.
So, each of you gets a 5-minute turn with
it. Let’s go around the table—Malique, you
start. Tania’s next, then Camille. Tania,
keep an eye on the clock. It’s 2:19 now—
let us know when it’s time for your turn!”
2. Figure out when the next turn
begins
If your children need help, work with
them in one of these ways:
Count up the minutes. One minute after
2:19 is 2:20, 2 minutes after is 2:21, … 
5 minutes after is 2:24.
Round to a “familiar” time, then adjust. The
last turn began at 2:19, so you can round
up to 2:20. The next turn would begin 5
minutes later, at 2:25. Since the turn 
really began 1 minute earlier—at 2:19,
the next turn begins 1 minute earlier,
too—at 2:24.
Talk through your own solution. Children
who aren’t sure what to do, but know their
turns are approaching fast, may not be
eager to work out the math themselves.
Explain how you know when the next
turn begins. Even if your children can’t
Taking turns
“When will it be my turn to see that magazine? You said we could 
each take 10-minute turns!”
Taking turns is a big part of family life. Even if there’s only one 
child in the family, adults sometimes need to take turns, too.
As children ﬁgure out when their turn begins, they get lots of 
practice with addition and time sense. They also have something
to do when it’s not their turn. You can do this activity just
about anywhere—in the kitchen, waiting at the doctor’s 
ofﬁce, or on the bus.

understand everything, they’ll appreciate
that you’re doing math to ﬁnd out some-
thing important to them. Next time, try a
turn length that you think will be easier.
You can even make it “too easy,” to give a
feeling of success so children will be ready
to try more challenge another time.
When you repeat this activity
Vary the turn length and starting time.
Try turns of a few minutes and turns of a
half hour or more. Try starting the ﬁrst
turn on the hour, at half-past, and at any
old time. As you learn what your children
can ﬁgure out easily, choose times that
offer just a little challenge.
Addition with time
How long until our turn? (ages 7–11)
Waiting in line can be unpredictable. When
we’re in a check-out line, at the bank, or at 
the post ofﬁce, we don’t know how long each
person’s turn with the cashier or clerk will be.
Try this to pass the time when you’re waiting. 
If you have a watch, time the turns of three or
four people ahead of you and ﬁnd an average.
Or, just estimate the length of an average turn.
Then, use this average to predict how long 
until your turn.
Exploring patterns (ages 5–11)
Write down when each person’s turn will 
start, continuing for at least 12 or 15 turns.
(It’s OK if no one really gets that many turns.)
Then, look for patterns in the numbers.
For example, suppose the starting time is 4:12
and you have 5-minute turns. 
4:12
4:37
5:02
4:17
4:42
5:07
4:22
4:47
5:12
4:27
4:52
5:17
4:32
4:57
Some patterns: the “ones” digits in the 
minutes are all 2 and 7; the “tens” digits
appear twice and then increase by 1.
Here’s another example: the starting time 
is 1:00, with 3-minute turns. 
1:00
1:15
1:30
1:03
1:18
1:33
1:06
1:21
1:36
1:09
1:24
1:39
1:12
1:27
Some patterns: the minutes are multiples of 3;
they alternate even and odd; the “ones” digit
repeats every 10th number.
Variations

1. Talk through the problem
Make sure your children know what time
it is now and the time of the event they’re
waiting for.
Child: “How long until we eat?”
Parent: “It’s 5:18. Dinner’s at 6. How many
minutes until 6?”
For ages 5–7, simplify the problem by
rounding times to the nearest half hour
(5:30 in this example), quarter hour (5:15),
or 10 minutes (5:20).
2. Figure out how much longer
If your children need help, work with
them to solve the problem in one of 
these ways:
Break the problem into parts. For instance,
from 5:18 to 5:20 is 2 minutes, then it’s 
10 more minutes to 5:30, and another 30
to 6:00—42 minutes in all.
Round to a time that’s easier to work with
and then adjust. It’s 45 minutes from 
5:15 to 6:00, so it’s 3 less than that—
42 minutes—from 5:18 to 6:00.
Count up by ten-minute intervals. From 5:18
to 5:28 is 10 minutes. From 5:18 to 5:38 
is 20 minutes, to 5:48 is 30, to 5:58 is 40,
plus 2 minutes takes us to 6:00. So it’s 42
minutes in all.
3. Explain solutions 
If your children solved the problem with-
out help, ask how they got their answers.
If you notice any incorrect calculations,
encourage your children to explain their
thinking further. They may ﬁx their 
mistakes as they talk about how they got
the answer. If they don’t, try to help them
correct their solution methods, rather than
showing a new way to solve the problem.
Materials

How much longer?
“How much longer until the soccer game begins? … How long until 
we eat? … How much longer before the movie starts?”
Next time your children ask you “How much longer?” ask them to do
the math to ﬁnd out for themselves. Figuring out how much longer
(or, as it’s sometimes called, “calculating elapsed time”) is a great
mental math exercise, a practical real-world skill, and a way to 
develop a better sense of time.
Age range 5–11

4. What could you do in the
remaining time? (optional)
To help develop a “real-life” understand-
ing of time, ask about what could be done
in the time that’s left.
“So, you have about 40 minutes left until
dinner. Is that enough time to clean your
desk? Your whole room? Your whole room
and still have some time left to play?”
When you repeat this activity
Try this when “How much longer?” is a
few minutes, close to an hour, or several
hours. Ask your children to explain their
thinking from time to time—both when
they make mistakes and when they arrive
at the right answer. Otherwise, they will
come to think that “How did you get your
answer?” really means, “You’re wrong.”
Addition and time sense
Predict how much longer (ages 5–11)
Sometimes we don’t have an answer for 
“How much longer?” We’re not sure when the
waitress will take our order, or when the food
will arrive. We don’t know how long we’ll be 
in the check-out line, or when we’ll get home 
if we’re stuck in trafﬁc. In situations like these,
ask everyone to predict how much longer, 
and to explain why they think their predictions
are reasonable. Write down (or remember) 
your predictions, and assign someone to 
keep track of the time. Which prediction 
comes closest?
For more challenge, after children make their
predictions, suggest they calculate what time
that will be.
“It’s 3:32, and you guess it will take 45 min-
utes to get home. What time will it be then?”
When the wait is prolonged, ask if anyone
wants to revise their predictions.
“We predicted we’d be through the check-out
line in 5 minutes, but 3 minutes have passed
and the person ahead of us hasn’t unloaded
everything from her cart yet. Do you still think
we’ll be through in 5 minutes, or do you want
to change your predictions?”
When it seems like forever (ages 5–11)
When there’s an exciting event coming up
soon, ask your children to ﬁnd out “how much
longer” in weeks, days, or hours. Younger 
children can use a calendar to count how 
many days (or weeks). Older children can 
calculate how many hours until the event, 
and then explore questions like these:
What is the halfway point? “When will it be
halfway between now and your birthday? 
What will you be doing then?” 
How many minutes? “So, you ﬁgured out 
that it’s 63 hours until your school play. 
Do you think that’s more than 1000 minutes 
from now? More than 10,000? How can you
ﬁnd out?”
How long ago? “The big soccer game is in 
32 hours, and it seems like you have to wait
forever! What were you doing 32 hours ago?
Does it seem like that long ago?”

“What if we left at 7:45—when would we
get there? … Should we leave earlier or
later than that? … How much earlier 
(or later)?”
Keep the focus on the goal. Sometimes
when we get bogged down in calculations,
we lose sight of what we’re trying to ﬁgure
out. Remind children of the basic question
as needed.
“So you ﬁgured out that it will take us
about 35 minutes in all. When should we
leave so that we get there at 8:10?”
Take off the pressure if it’s getting to be
time to go. You can spend a bit of travel
time explaining how you ﬁgured out when
to leave. Next time, ask your children to
ﬁgure out, “When should we leave?” when
the trip is simpler.
Or, combine parts of the trip, so children
have fewer things to keep track of.
“It will take about 35 minutes to get to
school. When should we leave?”
2. Figure out when to leave
If your children get stuck, work with them
in one of these ways:
Calculate how long the trip is, then subtract
the travel time from your intended arrival
time. The trip takes 15 + 20, or 35 
minutes. Thirty-ﬁve minutes before 8:10 
is 7:35.
Work backwards, one step at a time. To get
to school at 8:10, we need to leave Ana’s
house 20 minutes earlier. That’s 7:50.
So, we should leave home 15 minutes
before then—at 7:35.
Pick a time when you might start, and then
adjust. Some children ﬁnd it easier to work
with a speciﬁc starting time.
1. Talk through the trip
Make sure your children know
the time you need to arrive at your 
destination.
the parts of the trip—will you walk 
directly there? Walk to the bus stop,
wait, ride the bus, and then walk 
the rest of the way?
how long each part of the trip takes.
It’s OK to round times to the nearest 
10 or 15 minutes.
“We’re driving Ana to school. It’s a 15-
minute ride to Ana’s house, and then it
takes about 20 minutes to get to school.
We need to be there for the 8:10 bell.
When should we leave?”
For ages 5–7
Ask about trips with just one part.
“It takes half an hour to walk to
Grandma’s house. We need to be there 
at 3:00. When should we leave?”
“Oh no, it’s almost 12:35! We’ll never get to the soccer ﬁeld by 1:00!”
Some days it seems that everyone is rushing off somewhere—
to school, to work, to appointments. As we plan the day, we need to
decide when to leave in order to get places on time—even if we don’t
always quite make it. Deciding when to leave requires lots of math:
adding and subtracting times, using time sense to estimate how
long it takes to go places, and using timetables.
In this activity, as children ﬁgure out when to leave,
they learn about the role math plays in scheduling the
day. Finding when to leave also gives them something to 
do while they’re waiting around to go!

Addition and subtraction with time
When you repeat this activity
Try this with a variety of trips—trips
under half an hour, and trips of 2 hours or
longer; trips involving several stops, bus
changes, or errands; and trips involving
different methods of transportation. For
more challenge, involve your children in
planning ahead for possible trafﬁc or
other delays.
“We have to take two buses. Each ride
could take anywhere from 15 to 30 
minutes, depending on trafﬁc, and we
could wait up to 10 minutes when we
change buses. How much time should we
allow, in case there’s a lot of trafﬁc and a
long wait? What’s the earliest we could 
get there? If we’re early, will there be
enough time to get ice cream on the way?”
Use timetables (ages 7–11)
Sometimes, ﬁguring out when to leave involves
choosing which bus (or train, or ferry) to take.
Work with your child to use a timetable to plan
your trip.
“We have to be at the doctor’s at 4:00. The
bus stops at North Square just around the 
corner from the doctor’s ofﬁce. Let’s look at
the schedule to ﬁnd a bus that gets there by
3:50. OK, the 3:02 from the Oak Street stop
should get us in by 3:43. What time do we
need to leave home to catch the 3:02 bus 
at Oak Street?”
How long did it take? (ages 7–11)
Find a trip that your children take on a regular
basis—perhaps a drive to the grocery store, 
a bus to the library, or a trip by foot and 
subway to Grandma’s house. Each time they
take this same trip (for at least a few trips),
ask them to use a watch or timer to ﬁnd how
long it takes. Provide a notebook or special
paper where they can record how long the trip
took, along with the date and day of the week,
the time of day, the weather, and any circum-
stances they think affected the length of the
trip (such as delays for road construction).
They can use these data to help make deci-
sions about when to leave on future trips.
“How much time should we allow for the trip
when it’s raining? In rush hour? On Sunday
afternoon?”

Before you begin
Alone or with your child, go through 
grocery advertisements and cut out about
20 coupons. If you use coupons, pick ones
you think you’ll use on your next trip to
the store.
1. Talk about grocery coupons and
store savings
If your children are unfamiliar with
coupons, explain how people use them.
Point out the important information on
several coupons—the product, how many
you have to buy, the amount of savings,
and when the offer expires.
Ask your children to make a quick 
prediction about how much your family
generally spends on groceries each 
week, and how much you could save with
coupons. Some children will have no idea
of these amounts. As you repeat this 
activity, they’ll develop a better under-
standing.
2. Find out the savings
Ask your children to ﬁnd the total value 
of all the coupons in the set.
If they need help getting started, ask
them to begin by sorting coupons worth
the same amount into separate piles—
a pile of 25¢ coupons, a pile of 50¢
coupons, and so on. Here are some other
things you can suggest:
Combine coupons to make dollars. Suggest
ﬁnding and grouping coupons that add 
up to $1.00, such as 40¢ + 60¢, or 25¢ +
25¢ + 50¢. Your children can also make
groups that total $2.00, other whole-dollar
amounts, or amounts like 50¢ that are
easy to work with.
Count up to add coupons worth the same
amount. For example, your children could
count a group of 25¢ coupons this way:
25¢, 50¢, 75¢…. If your children need 
help after the ﬁrst few coupons, you can
count along.
Keep track of the coupons already added and
those still left to add. Your children can
make a special place to set aside coupons
after ﬁguring them into the total.
If your children need help ﬁnding the total
of all the coupons, talk through how you
would do it yourself.
3. Explain solutions 
Listen to your children as they explain
how they added the coupon amounts.
Encourage them to check the total by
adding the coupons in a different way—
for example, by regrouping them into 
different “dollar” combinations, or 
adding them up in a different order.
How much do we save?
“Look—here’s a coupon for $1.00 off on juice bars, and here’s one for
60¢ off my favorite brand of chunky peanut butter! There’s a bunch 
of others we can use, too. I wonder how much we’ll save.”
Everyone wants to save money! With coupons, children can learn
about math and about saving. In this activity, as children ﬁgure out
coupon savings, they practice adding, multiplying, and estimating
with dollars and cents. You can do this activity even if you don’t use
coupons when you shop.
Age range 7–11 (for ages 5–7, see Variations)
Materials
•Grocery advertisements
with coupons
•Scissors
•Pencil and paper 
(optional)

When you repeat this activity
Try this with coupons for the pharmacy 
or hardware store, or with coupons your
children choose for their own “pretend”
grocery shopping lists. If you use coupons,
you can make this activity a regular part
of your grocery shopping routine.
For more challenge, if your market 
doubles or triples the value of any
coupons, explain how this works.
Children can ﬁnd the total value of the
coupons with this information in mind.
Addition with money
Use a calculator (ages 7–11)
After your children do this activity with a calcu-
lator, ask them to check their results with a
mental estimate. For example, they can round
coupon values to the nearest 25¢ (round 45¢
to 50¢ or 99¢ to $1.00) and then ﬁgure the
approximate total. Ask children to talk about
times when it makes sense to use a calculator
and times when it’s just as easy or easier to
ﬁnd the total using common sense.
Do we have enough to save $5.00? 
(ages 5–7)
Provide about 10 coupons worth different
amounts. Choose coupons worth 25¢, 50¢, or
whole-dollar amounts. This is the challenge:
Find out if there are enough coupons to save
your family at least $5.00. (If you have a lot of
coupons worth whole-dollar amounts, choose 
a larger total.) Ask your children to explain 
how they found the answer. 
How can you sort the coupons? (ages 5–7)
This activity can help children work on sorting,
logical thinking, and numbers. Provide 20 or
more coupons for your children to sort into
groups. They can decide what the groups will
be. They might form categories like junk food,
healthy food, things you can eat, things only
pets can eat, or things you use to clean with.
When they have ﬁnished sorting, ask number
questions about their coupon groups: 
“Which group has the most coupons? Which
group has the fewest? Which coupon lets us
save the most? The least?”
Variations

8 
Before you begin
Pick a spending limit for your child’s wish
list. The limit need not be realistic, since
this is just a wish list.
For children ages 7–9 try a limit between
about $25 and $50 the ﬁrst time you do
the activity.
1. What would you get?
Provide a catalog or advertising supple-
ment for your child to look through and
suggest making a wish list.
“That easel and paint set would be fun to
have. They’re not in our price range, but
let’s pretend we could get some things from
this catalog. What would you get if you
had $100 to spend?”
Explain that your child can’t go over the
spending limit, although it’s OK to spend
a little less.
2. Make a wish list
Your child can record items and prices, or
use stick-on notes to mark pages that
have items of interest.
If your child needs ideas for getting 
started, suggest one of these ﬁrst steps:
Start with one item. Subtract the cost of
that item from the spending limit. How
much is left to spend?
Start with two items and ﬁnd out how much
they cost together. Are you past the spend-
ing limit yet? If so, exchange at least one
item for a cheaper one. If not, choose
another item.
Round any “dollars and cents” prices to the
nearest dollar. If an item is $5.95, call it $6.
If it’s $5.25, call it $5. Use the whole-
dollar prices to do some quick calculations
or estimates. Once you get close to your
spending limit, ﬁgure out the exact
amounts to make sure you’re not over.
Some children will try several (or many)
combinations of items before they settle
on a list that is within the spending limit.
If some of the calculations are too chal-
lenging, talk through how you would do
them yourself. Next time, choose a lower
spending limit.
3. Discuss everyone’s choices 
Listen to your children tell how they made
their choices. If they don’t mention any
calculations, encourage them to tell you
about this, too.
“You chose some great things! How did 
you keep track of all the prices to make
sure you stayed under your limit? … Did
you come up with any combinations of
things you wanted that were over your
limit? … So, then what did you do?”
If you notice errors in calculating,
encourage your children to explain 
their thinking further.
Materials
•A mail-order catalog 
or advertising 
supplement likely 
to contain items of
interest to your 
child. If your child’s 
school sends home 
book club order 
forms, you can 
use those.
•Pencil and paper
•Stick-on notes 
(optional)
Wish list
“There are so many great things in this catalog. If I had $50 to spend,
what would I buy?”
Mail-order catalogs and advertising supplements can be a 
temptation, a convenience, and an annoyance. They can also be 
an opportunity for lots of math! In this activity, children pretend 
they have a certain amount of money to spend. They use a catalog 
or an advertising supplement to make a “wish list” of items they 
can buy for their spending limit. As they make their choices, they 
practice addition, subtraction, and estimation with dollars and 
cents. They also learn about working within a budget.
This activity can be a great way to keep children occupied—and
doing math—on long trips, at the kitchen table while you’re 
making dinner, or on rainy days.
Age range 7–11

“So, you added 18 and 14, and got 31.
How did you get that?”
Children may notice and correct mistakes
as they talk about how they got their
answers. If not, help them work through
their own approach again. For example,
suppose your child says, “First I added 10 to
18, that’s 28. Then I added 4 more—28, 29,
30, 31.” Let your child know what was suc-
cessful, then talk through the trouble spot.
“That’s a good way to do it—tens ﬁrst, then
ones. So you have 28 and you want to add
4. What’s 28 and 1 more? … OK, 29. What’s
28 and 2 more? … 3 more? … 4 more?”
When you repeat this activity
Use different catalogs and advertising
supplements, and vary the spending 
limits. Ask your children to explain some 
of the calculations they are doing as they
make their wish lists, and encourage 
them to check their work by doing the 
calculations in a different way.
What do we save? (ages 7–11)
Sometimes mail-order companies put out
“sale” catalogs in which some or all of the
items are reduced in price. Usually, both the
original price and the sale price are given. 
Ask your children to decide what they would
buy for a given spending limit, and also to 
calculate how much they would save from 
the original prices.
Addition and subtraction with money
Use a calculator (ages 7–11)
Many adults use calculators when doing 
routine calculations at home and at work, so
it’s important that children have a chance to
learn what calculators can do. As children are
making their choices and checking to see if
they’ve reached the limit, ask them to tell you
how they’re using the calculator.
“So, what did you enter? … Did you add or 
subtract? … That number on the calculator 
display—what’s that the total of?”
Let children know that when they use calcu-
lators, it’s important to make sure they’ve
entered correct calculations. Encourage them
to check their results with a mental estimate.
“So the total for the bicycle, helmet, and
sneakers comes out to $304. Is that about
right? Let’s see—it’s almost $200 for the
bike, about $40 for the helmet, and just over
$50 for the sneakers. Does that come out
close to $300?”

“I thought this tall container would hold everything, but it doesn’t! 
I’ll try this other one—it’s shorter, but much wider.”
Estimating how much can ﬁt in a container, box, or suitcase is a 
practical skill that involves the math of geometry and measurement.
In this activity, children work on this important math as they look
for the container that holds the most water. They learn about
length, width, and height—the three “dimensions” of three-
dimensional shapes. They also learn that it’s important to
consider all three dimensions when you’re trying to ﬁgure
out what’s the biggest.
Try this activity when you have a few extra minutes and
are near a water source (the kitchen tap, the bathtub, an
outdoor hose, or the beach).
Materials
•A variety of plastic 
containers and 
bottles (see “Before
you begin”)
•Large waterproof 
container or mat for 
catching any spills 
when you pour 
water (optional)
•Funnel or pitcher 
for pouring 
(optional)
Before you begin
Gather a few empty plastic containers in
different sizes and shapes. You can use
storage containers, toy bottles or pails, or
containers that once held safe household
products such as dish soap, syrup, or juice.
(Clean them, and if possible, take the
labels off.) Try to include some containers
that hold about the same amount but look
very different.
1. Predict which can hold the most
Ask your children to predict which 
container would hold the most if all the 
containers were full.
“What if we ﬁlled these empty containers
all the way up with water—which one do
you think would hold the most water?”
Some children may look at measures on
container labels (such as “16 ﬂ. oz.” or 
“295 ml”) to ﬁnd which container holds
the most. If this happens, suggest that
just for fun, everyone should try predict-
ing without looking at the labels.
2. Explain the predictions
Ask your children to give reasons for 
their predictions.
“Why do you think this one will hold 
the most?”
If they say, “It just looks bigger,” encour-
age them to think about size and shape.
“Is the one you think will hold the most 
the tallest? Widest? Roundest?”
3. Test the predictions
Start with a container that someone
thinks will hold the most. Fill it with
water. If it’s really the largest, there
should be some extra when you pour the
water into any of the other containers.
Choose another container and pour the
water into it. (A funnel or pitcher can
make the pouring easier.) Is there any
water left over?
Keep trying this with different containers
until you’re sure which one holds the
most.
4. Discuss whether the predictions
matched the results
If your children were surprised about
which held the most, encourage them to
consider size and shape:
“We both predicted that this tall, thin
shaving lotion bottle would hold the most,
but this round shampoo bottle held the
most. I wonder why. Do you think it’s
something about how wide it is?”
Which holds the most?
Age range 5–11

When you repeat this activity
Try some different containers—larger 
or smaller ones, a variety of sizes and
shapes. Encourage younger children to
use more “size and shape” words (such 
as wide, long, tall) as they talk about the
containers. Challenge older children to
ﬁnd containers in the house that hold
about the same amount but are shaped
very differently.
Check with measurements (ages 7–11)
Try this when you’re unpacking groceries,
organizing shelves, cleaning out the 
refrigerator, or searching for a container 
to store leftovers. The containers you use 
can be empty, full, or partly full.
Choose containers that are marked with how
much they hold. Look for this measure on the
labels of liquid products (such as honey, liquid
detergents, and juice). Some plastic storage
containers have this measure on the bottom.
This measure is often given in both ﬂuid
ounces (ﬂ. oz.) and milliliters (ml). You may
also see liters (L), cups (c.), pints (pt.), quarts
(qt.), or gallons (gal.). For this activity, use 
containers marked with the same units.
Ask your children to predict which would hold
the most if they were all full. After children
make their predictions, show them where 
one container is marked with how much it
holds. Help them ﬁnd a similar marking on
each container, and then ask which number 
is largest. 
Geometry and measurement
How many times larger? (ages 7–11)
Gather a variety of empty containers. Include a
small one (such as a spice jar) to “measure”
the others with. Then, make some predictions:
“Let’s say we want to ﬁll up this big syrup bot-
tle with water. We’re going to do it by ﬁlling this
little jar with water. Then, we’ll pour the water
from the little jar into the syrup bottle. How
many times do you think we’d need to do that
in order to ﬁll the syrup bottle all the way up?”
Check predictions by ﬁlling the containers with
the small one you are using to measure with.
Keep track of how many times you pour. If the
containers are marked with how much they
hold, challenge older children to verify their 
predictions with calculations based on these
capacity measurements, too.

Before you begin
Set the stage for the project by sorting
today’s mail and talking about junk mail.
“Let’s sort today’s mail. We’ll put regular
mail in one pile, junk mail in another. How
much mail do you think we throw out
every week without even reading it?”
Encourage your children to make some
predictions.
Decide with your children what will count
as junk mail: Will you count catalogs?
Sweepstakes announcements? Coupons?
Other advertisements? You may not 
be able to make all your decisions in
advance, but it’s important that everyone
generally agrees what to count as “junk.”
1. Count and keep track
Every day for a week, your children help
sort the mail into two piles: junk mail and
regular mail. After counting the number
of pieces in each pile, they record the date,
how much regular mail, how much junk
mail, and the day’s total. When they’re
done, they add the junk mail to the junk
mail pile for the week.
Your children can record their data with 
a chart, graph, tally, or some other way.
They can use something they learned in
school, or they can come up with their own
ways. With young children, it’s ﬁne for you
to help with recording.
2. Investigate the data
Throughout the week, ask questions about
the data your children are collecting. As
the week goes on and the totals get larger,
younger children may need help ﬁnding
some of their answers.
“Is there more junk mail or regular mail
today? How much more?”
“How much junk mail did we get so far
this week? Did we get more junk mail or
regular mail so far?”
“How many pieces of mail did we get in all
today? How many so far this week?”
Additional challenges for ages 7–11 
“If we get the same amount of junk mail
each week, how much will we have in a
month? A year?”
“What fraction of the mail is junk mail? 
Is it more than half?”
Materials

Junk mail (a mini project)
Age range 5–11
“Lots of ads in the mail again—what a waste of paper! I wonder how
much of this junk mail we get in a week? How much do we get in a
whole year?”
Many children are interested in recycling and saving resources. In
this activity, children investigate paper use (and paper waste) while
learning about statistics.
For one week, your children gather data on how much junk mail
comes to the house. As they investigate their data, younger 
children practice counting, adding, and comparing amounts. Older
children calculate and measure in order to estimate just how
much junk mail your household gets in a year—
and what would happen
if it all piled up!

“Measure the height of the pile of junk
mail at the end of the week. If we let it
stack up, how high would our pile of junk
mail be in a month? In a year? Would the
pile be taller than you are? Up to the ceil-
ing? Taller than the building we live in?”
“If every house on our block (or every
apartment in our building) got the same
amount of junk mail as we did this week,
how high would the pile of junk mail be?”
When you repeat this activity
Save the data you collected this week,
then repeat the activity, perhaps at a 
different time of year. Compare your data.
“Do we get more junk mail during holiday
seasons? At the start of the school year? 
Do we get more on certain days of the
week? Why do you think so?”
Keep track of how many pieces you get in 
each category for a week. Then investigate
your data. 
“Who gets the most mail in the house?”
“About how far away does most of our mail
come from—less than 50 miles away?
Between 50 and 100? Between 100 and
1000? Over 1000 miles away?”
“Besides junk mail, what’s the most common
kind of mail we get? What percent of the total
mail is this?”
Statistics and data
More kinds of mail (ages 5–11)
Each day, sort the mail into several categories.
You could try one of these ways:
Name it’s addressed to (family member, 
“occupant” or “resident,” former residents 
of your home)
Where it’s from (country, state, or region 
of the U.S.)
Type of mail (bills, letters, magazines, junk
mail)
