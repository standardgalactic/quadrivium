The Bloodhound speeds 
through its first test run
HIW’sScottDutﬁeldvisitedNewquaytowitnessthejet-powered car in action
WWW.HOWITWORKSDAILY.COM
006  |  How It Works
Showcasing the incredible world we live in
A crowd of around 3,500 spectators 
gathered at Cornwall Airport 
Newquay to witness the ﬁrst test run 
of the car working towards breaking the world 
land speed record. The Bloodhound SSC 
resembles more of a ﬁghter jet than a car; a 
Euroﬁghter Typhoon ﬁghter jet to be precise. A 
Eurojet EJ200 engine provides the Bloodhound 
with 90,000 Newton’s of thrust. The ground 
shook under the immense power of the 
Bloodhound as it raced down the 2.7-kilometre 
runway to reach its 322-kilometre-per-hour 
target. Not only did the Bloodhound meet its 
target, but it ﬂew past it, reaching 338 
kilometres per hour in eight seconds. 
The test run was a familiar experience for 
designated driver Andy Green, having sat in 
the high-speed cockpit of the current 
record-holding car (the Thrust SSC) 20 
years ago. Together they oﬀicially broke 
the sound barrier and achieved a record 
speed of around 1,227.985 kilometres per hour. 
With a successful test run under its belt, the 
Bloodhound is on track to reach 
its goal of reaching (or 
exceeding) 1,000 miles (1,609 
kilometres) per hour. The 
record-breaking run is due to 
take place in 2018 in the 
Hakskeen Pan in South Africa. 
Eurojet EJ200 jet engine
Approximately half of the Bloodhound’s thrust will 
be generated by its EJ200 engine, the same type of 
engine used in Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets. 
While some modifications have been made to 
make sure the engine is compatible for use in the 
car rather than in a plane, the way it produces 
thrust is the same. Air is sucked into the engine and 
compressed, then fuel is added and the mixture 
combusts and expands. 
It is this expansion that forces the exhaust out of 
the rear nozzle, thereby generating thrust. Housed 
in the back of the Bloodhound, the engine weighs in 
at one ton and could suck out the air from an 
average house in just three seconds! In order to 
reach 1,609 kilometres per hour the Bloodhound 
will need around 400 litres of jet fuel and 800 litres 
of rocket oxidiser. 
In addition to the jet engine, a Nammo rocket 
engine will also contribute to generating the 
Bloodhound’s thrust, while a Jaguar supercharged 
V8 engine will provide auxiliary power to drive the 
rocket oxidiser pump. 
Three EJ200 engines have be loaned 
to the Bloodhound Project by the 
UK’s Ministry of Defence

Q&A
How is the event going?
It’s an amazing time for us — this project has been really hard. Britain is a funny place at the moment,
we don’t have much in the way of conﬁdence, but here we are setting out to build a 1,000-mile-per-
hour [1,609-kilometre-per-hour] car. The Bloodhound is running well, and suddenly people are
realising this car has got real value. 
What inspired the project?
When the Americans decided they where going to challenge our supersonic land speed record,
Andy Green and I said that we were going to take them on. We thought about how fast the Americans
would plan to go, probably to 800 miles [1,287 kilometres] per hour, so we are going to go to 1,000 mile
[1,609 kilometres] per hour. It was as simple as that. We were highly ambitious and we had no idea of
the shear scale of what we were taking on, but we now have the car and we have got the research done.
Royal Air Force fighter pilot Andy 
Green drove the car during its test  
run and will also be driving during 
the record attempt in 2018

Circadian rhythm, better known as our 
body clock, is the cycle that keeps us 
ticking. During a 24-hour cycle it helps 
to drive multiple processes in the body, from 
hormone secretion and sleeping patterns to 
metabolism. And researchers at the Medical 
Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular 
Biology in Cambridge have discovered that this 
cycle can aﬀect the healing of wounds such as 
cuts and burns.  
Dr John O’Neill, the senior author of the study, 
said, “This is the ﬁrst time that the circadian 
clock within individual skin cells has been 
shown to determine how eﬀectively they respond 
to injuries.”
The study found that, on average, burns that 
occurred at night took 60 per cent longer to heal 
than burns that happened during the body clock 
daytime cycle. Nighttime burns (sustained 
between 8pm and 8am) healed around 28 days 
later as opposed to that of 17 days if a burn was 
sustained during the day (between 8am and 
8pm). The study drew these conclusions after 
analysing data from 118 patient records from all 
major burns units in England and Wales.
The reasoning behind the diﬀerences in 
healing time is due to how long it takes for skin 
cells to move to the site of the wound and begin 
repairs, a process that occurs more quickly 
during the daytime. This is driven by increased 
activity of the proteins within the cell, in 
particular actin ﬁlaments, which act like a 
muscle within the cell.  
In a statement, Dr Ned Hoyle, the lead author of 
the study, said, “We’ve shown that the daily 
cycles in our body clock control how well cells 
can repair damaged tissue by aﬀecting an 
essential protein called actin. Eﬀicient repair of 
our skin is critical to preventing infection, and 
when healing goes wrong wounds can become 
chronic or excessive scarring can occur. Further 
research into the link between body clocks and 
wound healing may help us to develop drugs that 
prevent defective wound healing or even help us 
to improve surgery outcomes.” 
Researchers have found that our body clocks allow us to repair injuries better in the day

It has been suggested that 
nudibranchs could help

Eating the middle man
Scientists have discovered a new way for predators to catch prey
Known as kleptopredation, researchers 
at the University of Portsmouth have 
found that sea slugs beneﬁt form waiting 
for their meal to ﬁnish its meal.
Nudibranchs are a family of sea slugs that live 
at the bottom of the ocean and prefer polyps that 
have recently ﬁlled up on plankton. These 
ﬁlter-feeding polyps are found on hydroid 
colonies, a distant relative of coral reefs. This 
predator-prey relationship has also been 
suggested to increase the hydroid’s life span. 
“We have some great results here that rewrite 
the text book on the way these creatures forage 
and interact with their environment,” says lead 
researcher Dr Trevor Wills. 
A true antique
A 4-billion-year-old meteorite has sold for a

Sold on the online auction site Catawiki, the 
meteorite went for an impressive £14,436 
(approximately $19,000). This chunk of space 
was discovered in Sweden during the early 20th century 
and was previously held in the world-renowned 
Muonionalusta meteorite collection. The price per gram 
of meteorites has been estimated to be around 40 times 
more than the equivalent price of gold. With a weight of 
26.5 kilograms, this meteorite is a falling gold mine. 
Evidence of the oldest
mammal is discovered
Described as descendants of humans, these fossils 
resemble more mouse than man
Found on the Jurassic Coast in 
Dorset, fossilised teeth have 
been discovered dating back 145 
million years. Lead author Dr Steve 
Sweetman believes the specimens come 
from a small rat-like creature: “The teeth 
are of a type so highly evolved that I 
realised straight away I was looking at 
[the] remains of Early Cretaceous 
mammals that more closely resembled 
those that lived during the latest 
Cretaceous — some 60 million years later 
in geological history.” Scientists have also 
said that these fossils belong to the 
evolutionary line that leads all the way up 
to humankind.
As a shrew-like mammal these 
Cretaceous creatures had sharp 
teeth and were most likely nocturnal

INTERVIEW
How It Works’ Charlie Evans speaks to the renowned 
zoologist about his career
J
ack Ashby has worked as the Grant 
Museum manager since 2011, having 
graduated from Cambridge University 
with a zoology degree and originally joined the 
museum as the learning and access manager. In 
his new book, Animal Kingdom, he compiles a 
selection of 100 natural history specimens, 
telling their 100 stories: from the incredible feats 
of evolution displayed in insect mimicry —
where non-poisonous butterﬂies mimic their 
poisonous counterparts to protect themselves 
from predation — to the mysterious purpose of 
the narwhal’s tusk. 
The book explores 600 million years of natural 
history, with examples from across the animal 
kingdom, including the duck-billed platypus, 
electric eel and brain-controlling parasitic fungi. 
We spoke with him about his love for zoology, 
the museum he manages and his new book. 
What is The Grant Museum of Zoology, and 
what do you do there?
My job is to ﬁnd interesting ways to engage both 
the public and universities with the museum, as 
well as trying to bring universities’ research into 
the museum and engage the public by using 
objects. We house approximately 68,000 
specimens; it’s relatively small, but we have a 
huge amount on display. 
We have more specimens on display than the 
Natural History Museum, at least of animals 
— we don’t have minerals or plants. The 
museum dates back to the 1820s; it’s one of the 
earliest natural history museums in the country. 
It still looks reasonably traditional but that’s 
quite deliberate. It covers the whole of the 
animal kingdom, all the palaeontological time, 
the whole world. What’s nice, what’s diﬀerent, is 
that there are lots of skeletons and skulls in jars 
without too much taxidermy, because it’s more 
of a teaching collection.
Taxidermy isn’t that useful for teaching. It was 
initially set up to teach the ﬁrst courses in 
zoology and comparative anatomy. Robert Grant 
was one of the leading comparative anatomists, 
of the 19th century, and the ﬁrst 10,000 or so 
objects here are his, so [there is] deﬁnitely a 
comparative anatomy focus across the museum.
Which specimen would you say has the  
most educational value? 
That’s a tricky question, because measuring 
educational value is pretty subjective. Our rarest 
specimen is a quagga, an extinct species of a 
not-very-striking zebra that became extinct in 
1883. We have one of only seven skeletons in the 
world and the only one on display in the UK. It’s 
also pretty cool as it was actually missing one of 
its legs, so we CT scanned the surviving leg, 
ﬂipped the data and 3D printed a replacement 
leg. We’ve also got the only ﬂuid-preserved adult 
thylacine [an extinct carnivorous marsupial] in 
the world on display. 
Do you have a favourite specimen from the 
museum that you’ve included in your book? 
I do. My particular interest is the zoology of 
Australian mammals and their ecology and 
evolution, and so platypuses are very much my 
favourite animal. So I have used that as object 
number one, which is completely out of order 
from the rest of the book, just because it’s my 
favourite specimen. 
What do you like about the platypus? 
They are an evolutionary biologist’s dream 
because the platypus often gets inaccurately 
described as a primitive animal. They have 
distinctive features inherited from their 
reptilian ancestors — they famously lay eggs and 
walk with bent elbows and knees, akin to a 
crocodile. But on top of their relatively primitive 
frame they have some of the most bizarre yet 
advanced characteristics of any mammal. 
Did you know they are among the only 
mammals that can detect electricity? A platypus’ 
bill can detect electrical impulses generated by 
the muscular movement of their prey 
underwater, and the male platypus is one of just 
a few venomous mammals. Evolution has taken 
this animal, which has been around for 
approximately 120 million years, and without 
changing much of its ancient features, added 
some of the most advanced characteristics of any 
mammal. They also look pretty weird, huh? 
How are the samples in the  
museum preserved? 
The most common three [methods of 
preservation] are taking the bones out, 
taxidermy skins and ﬂuid preservation, and to 
an extent they stay pretty much the same; 
preparing bones hasn’t changed a great deal. 
The only real thing that has come up in the last 
few decades is how to speed things up a bit 
— large animals traditionally just get buried and 
that still happens today. 
People will still bury whales to prepare the 
whalebones, and there are stories from both 
University College London and the Natural 
History Museum that there were whales buried, 
still buried, in the gardens that people have 
forgotten about. [After being buried] you can use 
warm water or wet sand. These days you can use 
biological washing powder; the enzymes in it 
will speed up the process by chewing on the 
biological bits of soft tissue. You can also use live 
carpet beetles. 
One of the biggest threats to museum 
collections is being eaten by a pest, so these are a 
problem for museums, but actually they’ve now 
been used as helpers by locking them in tanks 

How It Works  |  011
WWW.HOWITWORKSDAILY.COM
with small carcasses, then the beetles will strip 
the ﬂesh from the bone. In terms of ﬂuid 
preservation it is something people are learning 
about because you don’t know if it works until 
maybe decades later. Diﬀerent ﬂuids come in and 
out of fashion. 
How do you preserve a sample in ﬂuid? 
There are two stages to preservation. First you 
have to ﬁx the specimen — this halts the process 
of decomposition by binding the organic 
molecules inside each cell. That’s commonly 
done with formalin, which is dilute 
formaldehyde gas in solution. It’s a really nasty 
carcinogenic [cancer-causing] chemical, so not 
something you want to be around much. Fixing 
is done inside the animal, but the second step is 
preserving, which is basically pickling to 
maintain [the specimen’s] structure in the long 
term. Formalin was used as a preservative and 
can still be used, but now we more commonly 
use industrially methylated spirits.
Have you ever had a problem with your 
specimens that have gone rotten or  
been dropped?
It happens rarely, but if something has been 
there for a very long time and all of the alcohol 
has evaporated, the specimens will start to rot. 
Sometimes what happens — particularly in 
university museums where a collection has kind 
of evolved organically from a lot of people’s 
research specimens — people would have been 
collecting something for their research in the 
1950s and stuck it in a bucket waiting for it to be 
properly preserved. But rather than ﬁxing it they 
might have just put it in a bath of alcohol, and 
then we’ll open it 70 years later and it’s rotten. 
Rarely do disasters happen, but there are 
occasional times where ﬁxatives don’t work. 
You’ll ﬁnd the specimen has rotted away and you 
might be able to salvage a skeleton, but 
otherwise you’ll just have to throw it away.
How did you select just 100 specimens  
from 68,000? 
It was diﬀicult. Every object tells thousands of 
stories. There is some real bias about the animals 
we hear about on TV, in books and museums. We 
mostly hear about the big, dramatic animals, but 
actually most animals are invertebrates. They 
just don’t get a lot of coverage. So the ﬁrst section 
is about diversity. It just goes through most of the 
ways of being an animal, most of the major 
groupings of animals. I didn’t do all of them 
because quite a lot of them are worms, and there 
are not a lot of diﬀerent things to say about the 
really small groups of worms. [Throughout the 
book] I wanted to tell what I found to be the most 
interesting aspects of natural history. So what 
are the weirdest stories in terms of natural 
selection, sexual selection, competition, and 
adaptation. I really thought about which 
animals or specimens would really show those 
big stories, and then to ﬁnish with I wanted to get 
into what makes museums a bit weird. They’re 
not sterile or natural or even necessarily 
scientiﬁc places, but they’re human inventions 
and they’re products of their own history; the 
biases of human nature and human politics, 
which aﬀects how people understand animals.

DID YOU KNOW? 
T
his holiday season, audiences across the
world will be ﬂocking to cinemas to
watch Star Wars: The Last Jedi, the latest
instalment in the hugely popular franchise. But
while Rey, Finn and Luke are making their way
across the galaxy in a fantastical universe, some
more eagle-eyed observers might be wondering
if they’ll obey the laws of physics when they’re
battling the forces of the dark side.
Star Wars is of course space fantasy, but that
doesn’t mean you can’t
throw a bit of science fact
in there too. Space travel,
laser beams and droids
are all things that we’re
getting better at, and
while we haven’t quite reached Star Wars levels
yet, it might not be too long until your very own
protocol droid is helping you around the home.
In the Star Wars galaxy we often see ships
travelling at blistering speeds, covering huge
sectors of space in seemingly no time at all. As
far as we know, it isn’t possible to break the
speed of light, making journeys like those
undertaken by the Millennium Falcon quite
implausible. But we do think it might be possible
to at least approach the speed of light. In fact,
scientists on Earth are already looking at ways
to visit our nearest star — Proxima Centauri —
by doing just that. True, we don’t have any sort of
hyperdrive yet, but who knows, maybe the next
breakthrough is just around the corner.
The vehicles of Star Wars,
while sometimes far-
fetched, also have some
real world similarities. The
shifting wings of the
X-wing look pretty similar
to variable-sweep wings we see on some jets,
and we’ve even made rudimentary speeder
bikes too, albeit with propellers rather than anti-
gravity devices. And then there is mobile phone
technology. You’ve probably got a smartphone
near you right now that is packed with the latest
virtual assistant to help you go about your day. It
might not look as impressive as R2-D2, but it sure
gives you plenty of help, just like the little robot.
Everyone’s favourite, though, is of course the
humble lightsaber. While we can’t quite create
beam swords yet, we’re getting better at
trapping plasma to use in nuclear fusion
reactors. Will our distant descendants ﬁnd a way
to shrink this machinery down to a handheld
device? It seems unlikely, but hey, even a Jedi
has to start somewhere. So strap in with us as we
take a look at how feasible the science and
technology of Star Wars really is.

Ah, the hover bike. Long sought after but not so
easily attained, many eﬀorts have been made to
recreate something like Rey’s speeder. In the
Star Wars universe, Rey’s custom speeder uses a
technology called repulsorlift to hover over the
ground. This anti-gravity technology pushes
against the surface of a world in order to
generate lift.
Of course, that’s pure ﬁction. But that doesn’t
mean there aren’t other ways to make hover
bikes. Using propellers and fans, some inventors
have come up with some pretty novel ideas, and
maybe one day in the future we’ll have
something that looks a bit more similar
to Rey’s speeder.
How close are we to making a vehicle that ﬂoats oﬀ the ground?

Ask someone to tell you anything about Star
Wars, and lightsabers will probably be near top
of the list. Not far behind will be the huge
Death Star, and we reckon blasters might be in
with a shout too. But is there any real science
behind them?
Creating a laser that could destroy a planet, be
it on a Death Star or a Starkiller Base, might be a
bit tricky. You’d need about as much energy as a
supernova produces. Blasters, on the other
hand, might be a bit more manageable. The US
Navy has developed a ship-based laser weapon
system that can destroy targets, although we’re

Could this iconic ship really have graced the skies of the Star Wars universe?
The Millennium Falcon
Perhaps there is no spaceship as memorable as 
the Millennium Falcon in any ﬁlm or TV show. 
Once merely a freighter, it proved its worth by 
helping to destroy two Death Stars, and it could 
even make mincemeat of the Kessel Run.
Although many of the technologies employed 
were a bit far-fetched, some are grounded in 
reality. Its impulse engines for one were 
powered by nuclear fusion, something that 
we’re just getting to grips with in the real world. 
And while this ship could travel faster than the 
speed of light, we do know it’s theoretically 
possible for a spaceship to at least get near 
to light speed.
The ship is powered by ﬁctional exotic 
particles called hypermatter, which you won’t 
ﬁnd in any textbooks. But we do know of plenty 
of other exotic matter. Maybe something out 
there might power our own 
Millennium Falcon  
one day.
Fuel
The ship’s below-light-speed
engines were powered by
radioactive liquid metal
— something we probably
wouldn’t recommend
launching into orbit.
Sublight engines
The nuclear fuel was ignited to start a fusion
reaction to provide thrust. Fusion rocket design
is a purely hypothetical idea, however.
Escape pods
On the ISS, astronauts use
Soyuz capsules as emergency
pods — not too far removed
from what you see here.
Hyperdrive vent
This ejects tachyons
into space,
hypothetical particles
that can travel faster
than light. However,
we’ve never found any.

hypermatter, this drive
enabled the ship to go

is something that’s just
not possible in our
current understanding
of physics.

n dice and card game Star Wars: Destiny, two
players face oﬀ against each other, one 
representing the light side, one the dark side, 
each striving to eliminate the opponent’s 
characters ﬁrst.
The rules are relatively straightforward but 
have a strong deep-strategy element to them as 
well. The base version contains two characters 
on each side: Rey and Poe facing oﬀ against Kylo 
Ren and Captain Phasma. Along with your 
characters you have a deck of cards containing 
support, events and upgrades. You have shields 
to apply, limited resources to use and all-
important damage to inﬂict. The upgrades you 
apply to your characters can be massively 
helpful as they make them both more powerful 
and harder to eliminate, so using them well and 
early is paramount.
It’s important to use a balanced strategy of 
attack and defence, as we found that going on 
all-out attack left us vulnerable to surprise 
events from the opponent’s card deck, and once 
you lose a character (especially when playing 
only two characters per team) the going gets 
extremely tough. However, we also found being
too cagey led to problems when it came to ﬁnally 
trying to damage the enemy. Finding the right 
order of your actions from the start is vital, as 
each turn — especially early on — has a limited 
number of actions. Star Wars: Destiny is fast-
paced, and once you get the hang of the rules 
and basic strategy it has great replay value.

WHAT 
MAKES A
MAMMAL?

How It Works | 029
WWW.HOWITWORKSDAILY.COM
Hooded seal mothers have the fattiest milk, which is around 60 per cent lipid and resembles mayonnaise 
DID YOU KNOW? 
I
t was while my daughter was being breastfed 
— which happened right after I’d spent 
months occasionally getting an ultrasound 
peep at her growing inside a womb — that I 
became interested in my being a mammal. 
I’d known that I was a mammal for as long as I 
could remember, and I had some basic grasp that 
it meant I’d once subsisted solely on milk and 
that I had hair and was warm-blooded. I also 
knew that humans were placental mammals, 
not pouched marsupials or egg-laying mammals 
like the platypus and its closest cousins, and so 
we develop in wombs, nourished there by 
placentas. But beyond these basic facts I wasn’t 
at all sure what deﬁned a mammal or how this 
type of animal had evolved. Suddenly,
consumed with an interest in the
elemental aspects of my biology, I
decided to ﬁnd out more about
what makes me like a fox,
hedgehog and giraﬀe, and unlike
an anaconda, turtle or pigeon.
My approach to this question
was initially pretty 18th century.
Back then people deﬁned groups of plants and
animals not by their being descended from
shared ancestors but according to which unique
features they shared. Shared reproductive
biology and a need to breathe air made Carl
Linnaeus declare in 1758 that whales and
dolphins weren’t ﬁsh but members of a natural
group with furry, warm-blooded land animals.
To name this new group he’d created,
Linnaeus chose — with no explanation — the
mammary gland as the deﬁning shared feature 
they’d be named after, thereby coining the term 
‘mammalia’, which we translate as mammals. 
But a century after mammals were ﬁrst grouped 
together, Charles Darwin published his great 
book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural 
Selection and biologists came to widely accept 
that animals evolved. 
According to Darwin, mammals were a group 
of animals more closely related to one another 
than to any other type of creature, and the 
features they share are owed to them having 
been inherited from a common ancestor. To 
explain where these traits came from one had to 
ﬁrst explain what the advantages were of having 
them conferred on their possessors and also how
they had come to exist from an
ancestor that had not had them.
How, for instance, had a
mammary gland evolved from a
milk-less ancestral state?
Mammals’ closest living
relatives are reptiles, who are
members of a much larger class of
animals called Sauropsida, which also includes
birds. And we know now that the mammalian
and reptilian lineages diverged about 310 million
years ago. Their last shared ancestor looked
decidedly more reptilian than mammalian. And
from that cold-blooded, milk-less and hairless
(not to mention small-brained, sprawling-
limbed and primitively toothed) starting point,
the succession of pre-mammalian ancestors who
morphed into true mammals evolved all the
traits that we associate with mammals today.
The ﬁrst recognisably mammalian creatures
lived about 210 million years ago. Much of what
we know about the evolution of mammals
therefore comes from fossil records. But this
information is also today combined with
conclusions drawn from comparing the bodies
— and DNA — of all the various 5,500 living
mammal species.

Eggs, pouches 
and placentas
Living mammals are divided into egg-laying monotremes, 
marsupials (which are named for their pouches) and 
placental mammals. Eggs of platypuses and their kin 
differ from reptile and bird eggs in growing in the uterus 
by absorbing maternally secreted nutrients, while 
marsupials have very short pregnancies that briefly 
involve placentas. These mammals birth foetal-like 
newborns that must ascend their mothers’ abdomens to 
latch onto a nipple, which they remain constantly 
attached to for weeks or months. Milk powers most of 
the marsupial’s development, whereas the young of 
placental mammals gather much more of their mothers’ 
investments in them via the placenta. This organ 
breathes, eats, and performs many other vital functions 
for the young placental mammal, mediating a dynamic 
relationship between mother and offspring.

MILK
Lactation, that deﬁnitional feature of mammals, 
was central to one of the most extensive attacks 
on Darwin’s theory of natural selection after it 
was ﬁrst published. A scientist named St George 
Mivart could not accept that something as 
complex as an infant obtaining nutrition from a 
specialised gland on its mother’s torso could 
have gradually evolved via many, many small, 
advantageous changes to a once milk-less body. 
Darwin replied by saying that he thought that 
if mammalian ancestry had once lapped at 
sweaty secretions from inside a pouch, say, then 
any change to that sweat-like substance that 
made it more nutritious would have been 
selected for, and the young who more eagerly 
sought it out would live better too. 
Today, it’s roundly agreed that mammary 
glands evolved from sweat glands. However, it’s 
generally thought that milk didn’t evolve from 
something that was a food source. Instead, 
milk’s hypothesised to have arisen from 
modifying a secretion that was released from 
maternal mammals’ abdomens to keep their 
eggs healthier. For milk evolved long before 
mammals developed wombs and live birth.
There is, however, disagreement over how 
exactly this solution aided egg health. One 
theory is that because mammals never evolved 
watertight egg shells (like the calciﬁed ones of 
birds) their eggs were prone to water loss, and 
this would have become an increasing problem 
as mammals’ ancestors became increasingly 
warm-blooded. Therefore, it’s proposed it was 
advantageous for a mother to essentially sweat 
onto her eggs to keep them hydrated. 
The other main theory also views an increase 
in body — and thereby egg — temperature as 
problematic. But in this scenario the problem 
with the surge in thermal energy was that it 
fuelled the growth of parasitic bugs. 
Fascinatingly, if you examine the gene 
sequences of the major nutritious components of 
milk today, many bear striking resemblances to 
molecules used by the innate immune system to 
attack microbes. It’s said, therefore, that milk 
actually evolved from a solution that was ﬁrst a 
sort of egg disinfectant. 
In both cases, the transition to milk was 
driven by hatchlings beneﬁtting from 
consuming the solution that had protected them 
inside their eggs and it then being selected to 
become an ever-better food source. 
HAIR AND WARM BLOOD 
Hair is also a structure for which it’s hard to 
imagine what intermediate stages in its 
evolution would have been good for. A full fur 
coat is a great source of insulation, but what use 
would a few straggly or short hairs have been?
Again, it’s thought that hair and its precursors 
changed function through its evolution. One 
theory suggests that hairs originally developed 
as sensory structures akin to whiskers. It’s much 
easier to imagine that a few small, lever-like 
protrusions would have had advantages for 
tactile sensing as their possessors sniﬀed about 
their environments and that this sense 
improved with longer protrusions. Then, the 
theory goes, mutations would have multiplied 
the number of whiskers until enough were 
present to insulate an animal. 
Another idea is that hairs were originally 
‘wicks’ for getting a sweat-like substance out of 
glands and onto the skin. Today mammalian 
skin is covered in glands and all their hairs are 
lubricated by an oily substance produced at the 
bases of these glands. Originally this substance 
may have helped to waterproof mammal 
ancestors’ skin, and to aid its release the glands 
that made it may have evolved little stick-like 
protrusions along which the substance travelled 
to reach the skin. Here, pre-hairs would have 
covered the body from the get-go but only 
assumed an insulating function once they were 
long enough. 
Although hair is a truly distinctive feature of 
mammals, the real biological story is the fact 
that mammals are warm-blooded. Or to use the 
technical term, mammals are endothermic, 
producing their own (endo) heat (therm), as are 
birds, but to ignore warm-blood because birds 
also independently evolved it would be to omit 
consideration of a central element of 
mammalian biology. 
The challenge of explaining endothermy is to 
say how its advantages outweigh its 
considerable costs — somehow constantly 
maintaining a high body temperature must 
oﬀset a massive hike in energy budget. 
Mammals eat about ten times the amount an 
equivalently sized reptile does. 
Theories include how being warm-blooded 
allowed mammals to be nocturnal, operating in 
the cold of the night when the dinosaurs ruled 
the world by day; that being warm-blooded 
evolved naturally as mammals became smaller 
in those dinosaur days; that endothermy was a 
by-product of becoming able to maintain higher 
levels of aerobic performance for longer 
stretches; and that sustained higher 
temperatures may have made young mammals 
develop faster or met the demands of feeding 
youngsters. Mammals, as well as birds — but not 
most ﬁsh and reptiles — are dedicated parents. 
Whatever the exact reasons for their having 
warm blood, the adaptations of mammals to 
gather enough food and oxygen to fuel the high 
metabolic rate that sustains endothermy 
account for many uniquely mammalian traits.

Back to the water
The last shared ancestor of mammals and reptiles was
a land animal that was still relatively new to this 
terrain. Consequently, many characteristic features of 
mammals are adaptations to terrestrial conditions. Yet
numerous lineages of mammals have, to varying 
degrees, returned to the water. 
Otters, polar bears and water voles, for example, 
are all excellent swimmers, but walruses, sea lions and
seals are even better. But only two mammalian groups
are fully aquatic: the Sirenians (including manatees
and dugongs) and the Cetaceans (including dolphins
and whales). The former group, known as sea cows, 
are mostly vegetarians who live in warm 
waters, whereas whales and dolphins span the globe. 
Like seals, they are kept warm by their fur or blubber 
and either hunt prey or filter feed.

For example, only mammals have a muscular 
sheet (the diaphragm) at the base of their chest 
cavities. The diaphragm expands that cavity 
further to allow the mammal to breathe more 
powerfully. Another key development came 
when mammals’ ancestors stopped laterally 
bending their torsos as they ran — picture a 
lizard running, swinging its body and legs side 
to side. Lateral movements alternately compress 
the left lung then the right, but moving with a 
straight body allows mammals to breathe while 
they run. 
Mammals can also breathe while they eat too. 
Other land vertebrates don’t have separate nasal 
cavities and mouths, but mammals have what’s 
called a secondary palate. It’s essentially a bony 
roof to their mouths that allows air to ﬂow in and 
out through their noses while they eat, so they 
only need to stop breathing when they swallow. 
This is particularly useful given the amount of 
time food spends in a mammal’s mouth. Long 
before mammals existed, teeth evolved for food 
capture and jaws for biting. While mammals’ 
teeth and jaws still do both, their cheek teeth 
have evolved to grind food by going up and 
down. Chewing breaks up food while infusing it 
with saliva’s digestive enzymes, a layering that 
kick-starts digestion, helping to liberate 
nutrients quicker.
During the mammalian overhaul of the mouth 
a unique jaw joint also evolved; a joint located 
between the lower jaw and the cranium that is 
widely considered the key marker for the 
emergence of mammals in the fossil record. This 
joint didn’t only change jaw function, however; it 
also freed two bones that had previously been 
part of the lower jaw. After getting progressively 
smaller throughout evolution, the bones ﬁnally 
left the jaw to begin a remarkable second career 
as part of the mammalian middle ear. 
When sound waves make mammalian 
eardrums vibrate they trigger a series of 
vibrations through a chain of three bones. The 
outer two are the former jawbones and the inner
one — which taps against the inner ear — is a 
former cranial bone. This elegant mechanism 
ampliﬁes sound waves very eﬀiciently to give 
most mammals excellent hearing. 
The inner ear converts vibrations into 
electrical signals that are sent to the brain, an 
organ that in mammals is very large and that is 
also covered in a uniquely mammalian type of 
brain tissue. The large size of the mammalian 
brain is closely linked to endothermy (birds also
have very large brains for their size) as neural 
computations require a lot of energy. Some have 
even suggested higher intelligence was a driving
force behind the evolution of warm blood. 
The unique tissue is the six-layered cerebral 
cortex that is the outermost coating of the brain 
— the crumpled and folded structure covering a 
human brain. Many people believe this type of 
tissue evolved entirely anew in mammals due to
a novel way of making brains, but another 
theory has it that it was instead simply a new 
way of arranging neural circuits that existed in 
the ancestors of reptiles and mammals. 
Whoever is right, the ways in which 
information is processed by this cortex are key to

the way mammals think, making them 
generally smart, and some of them very smart. 
So, what we have when we look at a mammal 
overall is a warm-blooded animal that is ﬁnely 
honed to acquire all the energy it needs to feed 
its high-energy lifestyle, including sharp senses 
and high intelligence. Despite its high fuel bill, 
the mammal way of life is both a highly 
adaptable and very self-suﬀicient way of being. 
That said, to reach that mammalian level of 
self-suﬀiciency requires a great deal of 
parenting. Mammalian mothers (and 
occasionally fathers) play an instrumental role 
in shepherding their oﬀspring through their 
delicate early stages, from the moment they’re 
conceived through to when they’re weaned. 
The marvel that is mammalian biology has 
allowed an incredible range of diﬀerent 
mammals to live in all of the world’s terrains, 
from Arctic foxes and polar bears through to 
badgers and deer, wildebeests and cheetahs to 
camels and desert shrews. Whales swim, horses 
gallop, bats ﬂy, kangaroos leap and monkeys 
climb. And one species can look at all its cousins 
and think how very wonderful they are.

Drink your milk
Milk provides young mammals with a foodstuff
they don’t need to chew, forage or hunt for,
detoxify, or digest much. This infant diet enables
mammals to grow very quickly toward
reproductive age. And although milk is costly for 
a mother to make, she can gather food at one
time of year, store energy as fat and then
dispense milk when her young need it. Such
maternal storage also means if food is in short
supply at any point the young will not suffer.
Milk also helped mammals to evolve
specialised teeth. Most young mammals have
milk teeth then grow a set of adult teeth in a
mature-sized jaw. This enables the teeth to 
match up perfectly top and bottom to make 
them more efficient.

nown as ballistic dispersal, the seeds of 
some plant species are ﬁred from nursery 
pods to optimise the chances of 
spreading. This type of dispersal diﬀers in 
execution for diﬀerent plants. Some ﬁre entire 
capsules full of seeds like the Ecballium 
elaterium, a plant that is better known as the 
squirting cucumber. 
In this case, when the fruit has matured, the 
tissues around the seed start to break down, 
forming a sticky-looking liquid and increasing 
the pressure in the pod. The tension in the pod 
reaches a critical level, causing the pod to break 
away and its seeds to shoot from the capsule.
On the other hand, species 
like gorse (Ulex europaeus) 
gradually lose water from their 
pods as they mature, which 
causes them to become more rigid. 
Seeds are ﬁred when the tension in 
the cells holding the pod together 
increases until the pod splits along 
established lines of weakness, known 
as dehiscence. The spotted touch-me-not 
(Impatiens capensis) also works in a 
similar way, with the pod explosively splitting 
open upon drying or even when lightly touched, 
catapulting its seeds for metres in all directions.

n order to predict the future of our planet we 
must ﬁrst go back in time to unearth the 
hidden secrets of our icy Earth. Each layer of 
ice tells a story, exhibiting diﬀerences in 
chemistry and texture. 
Falling as a fresh blanket of snow each year, 
atmospheric gases and other materials are 
trapped in air bubbles as next year’s blanket is 
laid. Over time every layer of snow is compacted 
and compressed by more snow until it becomes 
hardened ice. Much like the rings through a tree 
trunk, counting the layers throughout the ice 
enables scientists to age it.
The fundamental idea of using ice cores to 
read the Earth’s climate was achieved by Danish 
paleoclimatologist Professor Willi Dansgaard in 
the early 1950s. Extracting ice cores in 
Greenland, he found the ﬁrst tiny air bubbles 
that archived the world’s climate and 
environmental history. 
Those studying the poles today use mass 
spectrometers to isolate the diﬀerent gases in ice 
cores, mainly isotopes of oxygen (16O or 18O). 
These gases can help determine the atmospheric 
composition and temperature at the time the
snow fell. For example, the heavier element 18O
requires more heat than 16O to evaporate into the
atmosphere from the ocean’s surface. 
The ratio of isotopes in ice cores links to the
temperature at the time, so heavier isotopes
mean higher temperatures. By identifying
key patterns in the Earth’s atmospheric 
timeline we can better understand the 
direction our planet is heading.

A laboratory-

First set up in 1993 in Colorado, US, the 
National Ice Core Laboratory is now the central 
hub for ice core storage. This giant of a freezer 
measures around 1,557 cubic metres and 
stores 19,000 metres of ice. The stored 
samples are collected from Antarctica, 
Greenland and other regions of northern 
America. In order to stop the samples from 
melting and releasing the secrets within, this 
main freezer is kept at -36 degrees Celsius. 
Similarly, in the examination room, the ice 
must remain at a cool -24 degrees Celsius 
while it is prepared for future study. Known as 
the ‘core processing line’, 30–35 metres of ice 
core can be cut and processed into samples 
each day.

Discovered in August 2017, a 2.7-million-year-
old ice core has revealed the earliest evidence 
of Earth’s atmosphere. The age of the ice core 
was determined by measuring the amounts of 
the elements argon and potassium, as the 
core’s layers were not distinct. It was extracted 
from a shallow blue ice region of Antarctica 
known as the Allan Hills. The core revealed that 
carbon dioxide levels at this time were below 
300 parts per million (ppm), significantly lower 
than today’s levels of over 400ppm. In their 
next venture, the discovery team hope to find 
a 5-million-year-old sample. It is estimated that 
a core of that age would show us more about 
the effects of the warming global climate.

“T
he ambulance service ring us on our
red phone to say we’ve got a trauma 
coming in,” Dr Gary Cumberbatch 
explains. He is the clinical director for emergency 
services at Poole Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. 
His trauma team receive around 60 calls a year. 
“We have speciﬁc criteria to make a trauma 
call,” he tells us. “If you’re unconscious from a 
head injury, that will trigger it. If you’re breathing 
very fast or very slowly following an accident, that 
will trigger it. If your blood pressure is low, 
suggesting you’ve got internal bleeding, or if 
you’ve got back or neck pain and you’re paralysed, 
that will trigger it.” Dr Cumberbatch’s team are 
reserved for the most serious trauma emergencies. 
Most trauma patients go to a Major Trauma 
Centre. The closest to Poole is at Southampton 
General Hospital. But if they can’t get there within 
45 minutes, or they don’t have 45 minutes to spare,
Dr Cumberbatch’s team step in.
The accident and emergency (A&E) consultant 
takes the lead. “If they’re not in this department 
they get a phone call immediately and are 
expected to arrive within 30 minutes,” Dr 
Cumberbatch says. There are doctors to perform 
procedures, nurses to assist, a radiographer to 
take X-rays and perform a CT scan, and a scribe to 
make notes. “We automatically call the 
anaesthetist out from the intensive care unit, as 
well as the surgeon,” he continues. “Someone to 
put them [the patient] to sleep and someone to do 
an operation to stop them bleeding.” Each team 
member has a pager so they don’t miss the call. 
When the patient arrives, the ﬁrst priority is 
their airway. Easy to remember, Dr Cumberbatch 
tells us, because it begins with an ‘A’. “If you don’t 
open someone’s airway so they can breathe 
through it, you only have three minutes before 
they die. That takes priority.”
The team use suction to remove any blood or 
vomit in the windpipe, making a clear passage to 
the lungs. From then on they need to keep the 
neck still. “We assume they’ve all got an injury to 
the spine,” Dr Cumberbatch says.
 The next step is breathing. “You may clear the 
airway only to ﬁnd that they’re not even
breathing, or they are breathing
shallowly. So we’ll breathe for
them using something called an
Ambu bag.” This is usually 
performed by the anaesthetist,

support: a tube goes in through the voice box and a
machine takes over the work of the lungs. “To do
that we have to give them drugs to make sure that 
they’re deeply unconscious and all their muscles 
are paralysed,” Dr Cumberbatch explains. 
Then they can move on to ‘C’ for circulation. “Tha
means, are they bleeding?” says Dr Cumberbatch.
“If they come in and they’re hosing blood from  
their leg, then you should press on that even before
seeing to the airway. A lot of this experience has 
come from the military.
“If it’s not an obvious wound but their pulse rate 
is high and their blood pressure is low, we’ve got to 
ﬁnd where they’re bleeding from internally,” Dr 
Cumberbatch explains.
“You can bleed in ﬁve places,” he continues. The 
patient might be bleeding onto the ﬂoor from 
wounds on their back. Alternatively, the wound 
could be in the patient’s chest or their abdomen. Or 
it could be that they have broken their pelvis. The 
ﬁfth possibility, explains Dr Cumberbatch, is a 
broken thigh bone.
The team need to stop the bleeding to get the 
patient ready for step ‘D’, which stands for 
disability. “You’re not allowed to move from one 
letter of the alphabet to the next until the ﬁrst one’s 
sorted,” Dr Cumberbatch explains. “We can put a 
probe on their abdomen to see if there’s any blood 
internally. We use a probe on their chest to see if 
there’s a collapsed lung or any blood. Otherwise 
most patients go through the CT scanner. We 
stabilise them and then we take them there.”
The scanner reveals any internal injuries to the 
brain or internal organs. But not everyone can go 
straight away. “If they’re bleeding heavily, they’re 
not getting a scan.” Instead, the surgeons take  
them to the operation theatre and open them up, 
ﬁnd where the bleeding is and stop it. The patient 
can only go to the scanner when they are in a  
stable condition.
Only then can the team move on to ‘E’. “That 
ABCD approach is what we call the primary survey,” 
Dr Cumberbatch explains. “Your assessment is 
purely to work out threat to life immediately. 
Fortunately, most patients don’t have that, so we 
move to the secondary survey, where we look for 
other injuries. That’ll be broken arms and legs, 
missing teeth, internal injuries that aren’t causing 
bleeding, like a perforation of the bowel.” 
The letter ‘E’ stands for ‘exposing’. [We have to] 
“Make sure they don’t get too cold,” Dr Cumberbatch 
warns. “We work methodically down from the top. 
It’s as important to save lives as it is to pick up other 
injuries.” The trauma team work extremely quickly, 
aiming to get their patients stabilised and scanned 
within 20 minutes. 
The work can be intensely stressful, especially 
when the patient is a child. “You can’t aﬀord to be

I can numb your ﬁnger in 30 seconds ﬂat. Within 
ﬁve minutes your ﬁnger is pain free. We take the

The job has obvious challenges, but as Dr

biggest rewards.

When gases such as hydrogen, helium
and other ionised gases combine with
space dust, they form an interstellar
cloud. Known as a nebula, this giant
cloud begins to collapse under its own
mass. Gravity then causes this dust and
gas to be continuously dragged into the
centre of the cloud, making the core very
hot and dense. This forms an object
called a protostar, which will eventually
develop into a new star. Around the
protostar, the collapsing cloud forms a
rotating disc of material. It is from this
‘protoplanetary disc’ that new planets
are born.
As a giant spinning ball of dust circulates
around the gravitational pull of a new star,
the ball begins to flatten and forms a
rotating disc-shaped dust cloud called a
protoplanetary disc. This works in a
similar way to a ball of dough flattening
when it’s tossed and spun in the air to
make a pizza.
In order to form new rocky planets
little bits of dust need to combine to form
clusters. Particles in the disc begin to
clump together and as they continue
orbiting the star they attract the
surrounding material and continue to
grow bigger. Under the force of gravity
these particles continue to collide into
each other to form the beginnings of a
planet, known as planetesimals. Over
time the star-orbiting planetesimals
continue to collide with each other and
grow, eventually becoming planetary
embryos/protoplanets.
A chance collision between the
protoplanets initiates the final stages, and
what often remains are multiple fully
formed smaller, rocky planets.

W
e all know that our mood and 
behaviour is controlled by the brain, 
but are we overlooking another 
important aspect of our neurobiology?
There is an increasing amount of evidence to 
suggest that the activity of bacteria in your gut 
can signiﬁcantly aﬀect your brain. This 
relationship is called the gut-brain axis, and 
while its exact mechanisms and signiﬁcance 
haven’t been fully ﬁgured out, it is thought that 
the microbes colonising your digestive tract are 
responsible for complex interactions between 
your digestive system and the nervous, 
endocrine and immune systems. 
Your intestines are ﬁlled with bacteria. When 
you think of bacteria you probably think of the 
germs that make you sick, but we actually have a 
lot to thank these tiny microorganisms for. We 
rely on ‘good’ bacteria to help break down food, 
produce vital nutrients and defend us against 
harmful bacteria. But this could just be the tip of 
the iceberg. Scientists speculate that gut 
microbes can send signals to the brain via three 
diﬀerent methods. 
The ﬁrst involves bacteria releasing 
neurotransmitters (chemicals that help to
How does the bacteria in your gut act like a ‘second brain’?
The gut-brain axis
transmit nerve impulses) to trigger the neurons 
in your digestive tract, which in turn send 
signals to your brain via the vagus nerve. Some 
studies have shown that certain species of gut 
bacteria can produce serotonin, an important 
neurotransmitter that plays a role in regulating 
your appetite and mood.
A second proposed method is that microbes in 
the gut produce molecules called metabolites as 
by-products when they break down our food. 
These metabolites can stimulate an increase in 
the production of neurotransmitters by cells that 
line the gut (epithelial cells), which activate the 
vagus nerve. For example, a recent study found 
that some gut microbes can produce the fatty 
acids butyrate and tyramine, which promote the 
production of serotonin by certain cells. 
The third hypothesis is that gut bacteria can 
inﬂuence the brain indirectly by triggering the 
immune system. Gut bacteria can stimulate 
immune cells to produce small proteins called 
cytokines, which travel through the 
bloodstream to the brain. It is thought that these 
proteins can inﬂuence the development and 
activity of microglia (the brain’s immune cells), 
which are responsible for removing damaged
cells at an injury site. Researchers believe 
microglia also play a role in the regulation of 
appetite and metabolism. 
Although there are few human studies at the 
moment, animal studies have linked the activity 
of gut bacteria to a variety of conditions, 
including Parkinson’s disease, obesity, 
depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and 
cardiovascular disease, and they may also cause 
certain types of strokes.
While much more research will be needed to 
further investigate these initial ﬁndings, if 
links are conﬁrmed it could 
revolutionise how we treat 
certain neurological 
disorders. Perhaps in 
the future doctors 
will be prescribing 
probiotic diets to 
supplement 
treatments.

Bacterial boost
Two recent studies have shown that patients’ gut 
bacteria can influence how well they respond to 
particular cancer treatments. Both studies, one 
from France and one from the US, collected data 
from patients undergoing immunotherapy, which 
help to combat cancer by enabling the body’s 
immune cells to recognise and attack tumours. 
The French study involved 249 patients 
receiving immunotherapy for kidney, bladder or 
lung cancers, 69 of whom had taken antibiotics for 
routine infections. Antibiotics disrupt the 
microbiome, affecting both ‘good’ and ‘bad’ 
bacteria. On average, patients who took antibiotics 
during treatment were more likely to have relapses 
and did not survive as long as those who didn’t. 
The authors then compared the differences in the 
patients’ microbiomes and found that the 
presence a species called Akkermansia 
muciniphila was linked to the improved 
immunotherapy results.
The US study also compared the different gut 
bacteria present in 112 melanoma patients. 
Patients who responded well to treatment were 
more likely to have more diverse microbiomes and 
higher numbers of certain beneficial species 
including Clostridiales and Faecalibacterium. 
Patients with more of these ‘good’ bacteria were 
found to have more cancer-killing immune cells in 
their tumours. 
The results from both studies hold a lot of 
promise. The hypothesis is that by supporting a 
healthy microbiome, immunotherapy is more likely 
to be effective at shrinking tumours.

Given the potential impacts our gut bacteria 
can have on our overall health, the old adage 
that states ‘you are what you eat’ is becoming 
increasingly appropriate. 
We can promote the growth of good 
bacteria through our diets by incorporating 
probiotics (foods containing live good bacteria) 
and prebiotics (foods containing beneficial 
plant fibres). Probiotics can be found in certain 
yoghurts, cheeses and fermented foods. 
Prebiotics, on the other hand, are used as a 
food source for beneficial bacteria to grow and 
survive in the gut. When they digest the fibre 
we eat from vegetables, nuts and fruits they 
excrete short-chain fatty acids as waste 
products, which are great for nourishing our 
intestines and reducing inflammation. 
Research suggests we need a diverse range 
of bacteria to have a really healthy gut, but 
modern high-fat and high-sugar diets have 
been found to decrease the number of 
different species living in our intestines.

How clever chemistry can help create 
hair colour that reacts to heat
Colour-changing 
hair tech
T
he 1960s saw a creative boom of colourful 
products that led to the invention of 
thermochromic dyes in the 1970s, dyes 
that react to heat and colour. 
We were ﬁrst mesmerised by colour-changing 
mood rings that swirled through a spectrum of 
colours as our body temperature changed, and it 
wasn’t long before there was an explosion in 
thermochromic products. Now companies such 
as The Unseen and Pravana have combined 
science and art to create hair dyes that will 
respond to the temperature of your body or the 
environment and change colour. You could 
step out of the front door, and as the sunlight
warms your hair it will change from platinum
blonde to pink, before a cool breeze catches
your hair and it reverts back to blonde. It
sounds like magic, but behind this advanced
beauty product is some serious chemistry.
The technology relies on carbon-based 
molecules that are able to undergo reversible 
reactions. When the temperature rises above a 
certain point the molecules react and change 
shape, which alters how the molecules absorb 
light. Because diﬀerent wavelengths of
light are absorbed and reﬂected by the
molecules, this alters the colours we see. Since
the reaction is reversible, hair colour will revert
back to normal when cooled.
H
ydrogen peroxide, a type of bleach, has a 
variety of applications in industry, one of 
which is to remove colour from hair. Hair is 
made from a tough protein called keratin, the same 
material that makes up your nails and the outer 
layer of the skin. Hair colour is determined by the 
ratio of the pigments eumelanin (responsible for 
black and brown pigments) and phaeomelanin 
(which produces yellow and red pigments). Without 
either type of melanin, hair becomes grey or white. 
Bleach lightens hair by oxidising the melanin 
molecules. The melanin pigment is still present 
within the hair, but once oxidised it is colourless, 
leaving just the pale yellow tint of the keratin 
protein. Bleach is particularly useful in changing 
darker hair to lighter hair, but if not used properly it 
can lead to damage. If left on for too long, bleach 
will react with the moisture within the shaft of the 
hai

Oxidation
The bleach molecules oxidise the melanin in the
hair, making them transparent. As bleaching
progresses, the hair becomes lighter and
changes in this order: black – brown – red brown
– orange – light yellow – very light yellow.

Melanin molecules within
the hair are responsible
for its natural colour.
Bleaching
When exposed to bleaching agents such as
hydrogen peroxide, the hair cuticles open,
allowing the bleach molecules to enter the
cortex (where natural hair pi ment is found).

T
he existence of gravitational waves was
ﬁrst predicted in 1916 by Albert 
Einstein, who suggested that when two 
massive accelerating objects collide they 
cause ripples to be discharged through space, 
similar to the ripples seen when a pebble is 
thrown into water. Almost 100 years later 
scientists were still struggling to directly 
detect them, something even Einstein himself 
doubted could be done. When a wave passes 
through Earth it is squeezing and stretching 
the fabric of space, but as these diﬀerences are
so tiny most instruments have not been able to 
detect these changes until recently. 
Named LIGO (Laser Interferometer 
Gravitational-Wave Observatory), this laser- 
and mirror-based technology is sensitive to 
the smallest ripples through space-time. This 
pioneering US research facility uses two 
four-kilometre L-shaped detectors located in 
Livingston in Louisiana and Hanford in the 
state of Washington. 
On 14 September 2015 the moment the
scientists had been waiting for came when a
gravitational wave rippled through the Earth
caused by the violent crash of two black holes
over 1 billion years ago. The ﬁrst wave passed
through the Livingston facility before then 
being deteced seven milliseconds later in 
Hanford, 3,000 kilometres away. Not only did
this discovery prove that Einstein’s theory wa
right, but it will revolutionise our very 
understanding of the entire universe.

More than 588 million kilometres from our Earth an
orange-and-yellow banded gas giant orbits the Sun.
Though we have always been close (relatively speaking)
neighbours to Jupiter, it wasn’t until 1610 that we
discovered that this huge planet has multiple moons. It
was the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei that identified
the celestial bodies orbiting Jupiter and named them Io,
Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.
At this time in history people were still struggling to
accept that we were not at the centre of the universe.
Galileo’s landmark discovery changed the way we viewed
our universe and challenged our place within it. We
realised that if some celestial bodies orbited planets that
weren’t us then that meant we are really not that special.

In the mid-1960s astronomers 
Arno Penzias and Robert 
Wilson discovered cosmic 
microwave background 
radiation. This radiation is 
present in tiny quantities 
throughout the entire universe as the residual
radiation left from the birth of the universe. 
Their discovery was of enormous 
cosmological significance, transforming the
(at the time) controversial Big Bang
Theory into the scientifically  
accepted explanation of the  
birth of the universe.
Like many of the best scientific
discoveries, it happened almost 
accidentally. While working 
with a very sensitive radio 
telescope at Bell Labs in New 
Jersey, US, they noticed a 
mysterious hissing sound 
coming from all directions. 
Frustrated by the interference, they
did their best to work out the cause of
the sound, even removing some birds that
had made a nest in the antenna, before 
realising they were onto something big. They 
had discovered the echo of the explosion that 
caused the beginning of the universe.
Edwin Hubble was the first to 
discover other galaxies beyond 
our own Milky Way, but it 
turns out that this discovery 
alone wasn’t impressive enough to get a 
telescope named after him! Hubble actually 
made an even greater contribution to science 
that changed the way we understand the 
origins of our universe. 
In 1929 Hubble discovered that all galaxies 
seemed to be moving away from us and the 
ones furthest away are moving the fastest 
— a relationship now known as Hubble’s Law. 
This was the first evidence indicating the 
universe is expanding. 
Hubble took long-exposure photographs of 
the spectra of faint galaxies using a telescope 
and measured the amount they shifted to 
calculate their speed. He then plotted the 
speed of the galaxies against their distance 
and noticed the interesting relationship 
between the data. This really had scientists 
thinking. If the universe is expanding it must 
have been smaller in the past, so it must have 
started from one small point. This formed the 
basis of the Big Bang Theory.

This breakthrough was the ﬁrst direct and repeated detection 
of the amino acid glycine and suggests that not only could comets be 
responsible for assisting the origins of life on our planet, but they could also be 
responsible for delivering organic molecules to other worlds.

Vera Rubin not only made a huge 
cosmological discovery in the 
1970s, but she also founded an 
entire subject in the process. 
She noticed a diﬀerence 
between the predicted angular 
motion of the galaxies and their 
observed motion by studying 
galactic rotation curves and 
determined that visible matter 
alone wasn’t enough to explain 
the speed at which stars rotate, 
and it wasn’t possible that normal 
matter could generate enough 
gravity to hold galaxies together. 
Rubin proved that most of the 
mass in the universe does not 
emit, reﬂect, or absorb light, and 
she named this dark matter. 
Though it is still a mystery as to 
what exactly dark matter is, we 
know that it isn’t made from 
protons and neutrons like 
‘normal’ matter. It is thought that 
approximately 27 per cent of the 
entire universe is made from this 
mysterious substance, which is 
expected to consist of subatomic 
particles that we have not yet 
been able to detect.

The mathematical concept of 
black holes is one that has been 
around for hundreds of years, but 
it was always impossible to find 
evidence for their existence before 
the Hubble Telescope. 
Designed to take clear pictures of the deepest 
parts of space, this incredible feat of engineering 
was launched into space in 1990 and has 
provided images showing black holes’ immense 
gravity — their ability to pull matter from around 
them. Black holes are thought to form when 
massive stars die, imploding from their own 
weight and have such a strong pull of gravity that 
not even light can escape, which is why we can’t 
directly detect them with conventional methods.
Around 1920 Arthur Eddington, an 
English mathematician, physicist 
and astronomer, proposed that 
stars obtain energy by the nuclear 
fusion of hydrogen to form helium. 
He formulated a theory suggesting 
that heavier elements can also be produced when 
a star runs out of hydrogen.

These planets turned out to be the ﬁrst

star outside of our Solar System. They’re 
diﬀicult to detect because they are not very

ebulas come in all shapes and sizes, often 
appearing as a tenuous cloud of gas. 
However, 815 lightyears away in the 
constellation Vela sits a nebula often said to 
resemble a witch’s broom. However, magical as it 
may appear, this nebula was born in the same 
way as any other. 
When a star grows to a point where it has 
reached its nuclear fusion limit, it ﬁghts a losing 
battle with gravity as gravitational forces struggle 
to balance the outward pressure generated by 
nuclear fusion. Eventually, the star’s core 
collapses and violently explodes in a supernova. 
Around 11,000 years ago, anybody on Earth who 
happened to be gazing toward Vela would have 
been able to spot the star that created the Pencil 
Nebula. All of a sudden, the star became 250-times 
brighter than Venus in the night sky; for a time it 
would have even been visible in the day. 
As a star goes supernova it ejects gaseous debris 
known as the supernova remnant, which 
produces an expanding gas cloud. This debris is 
dispersed into the interstellar medium at 
supersonic speed, where it then collects and 
forms this new cosmic real estate. At the ﬁnal 
boom of a supernova explosion shock waves 
pulsate through space, sweeping through the 
gaseous material already emitted. 
The Pencil Nebula was part of a shock wave 
travelling at millions of kilometres per hour that 
was sent crashing into dense gas regions, causing 
it to form its iconic ﬁlaments and ribbon-like 
appearance.
The energy from the shock wave would have 
heated the dense gases to millions of degrees 
Celsius, and after they cooled down the nebula 
began to glow, making it easier for telescopes such 
as the Hubble to spot it.
Looking more like the doodles on a celestial 
notepad, how did this strange nebula form?

with each of his runs faster than the one before. On 
his last attempt he achieved a whopping 159.49 
kilometres per hour! 
Longest monster truck
Measuring in at an enormous 9.75 metres, Sin City 
Hustler was built as a monster truck limousine by 
Brad and Jen Campbell of Big Toyz Racing. 
Longest ramp jump
The sky’s the limit for the approximately 
4,500-kilogram Bad Habit monster truck. In 
September 2013 in Columbus, Pennsylvania, US, 
driver Joe Sylvester successfully ramp jumped 
across 72.42 metres!
Largest monster truck
The largest ever monster truck was built in 1986 
and is known as Bigfoot 5. Standing at an incredible 
4.7 metres and weighing in at an impressive 17,200 
kilograms making it the world’s heaviest monster 
truck. The three-metre-tall tyres were taken from a

helpful if the donor body has an engine and 
transmission so that some of the parts (including
mounting brackets) can be reused. 
Parts are upgraded with more heavy-duty 
replacements in order to transform the truck 
into a true monster. Often these replacements 
are taken from ex-military vehicles to ruggedise 
the steering axles and rear diﬀerentials. The
suspension is raised an additional 0.9
metres to 2.4 metres to give good 
ground clearance and to 
accommodate the giant wheels. 
An upgraded engine is essential, 
as well as transmission and 
transfer-case components 
suitable for high-impact use. 
This supplies the horsepower 
needed to move such a 
mammoth machine. 
SAFETY
Monster trucks crash, they’re built to,
but this means the safety of the drivers
and their fans requires special equipment.
Perhaps the most important feature is that
monster trucks are equipped with three shut-oﬀ
switches to quickly turn oﬀ the electrics: one
within reach of the driver, another in the rear of
the truck, and a remote ignition interrupter that
allows oﬀicials to shut down the engine using a
handheld device. 
These systems are in place so in the event of a
truck rollover the risk of ﬁre is minimised, but
they can also be used if the brakes fail or the
vehicle appears uncontrollable (and unsafe).
Generally, internal moving parts of the truck are
shielded to prevent injury, and any high-
pressure components are restrained with straps.
Roll bars and safety cages have to be installed
to protect the driver, but drivers are still
required to wear speciﬁed protective equipment
to compete in monster truck competitions,
which include a helmet, ﬁreproof suit and a
ﬁve-point safety harness, as well as head and
neck restraints to prevent head injury. Most
drivers sit in the centre of the cab, which is
shielded with a polycarbonate screen to protect
them from stones, mud or debris from the track.

n late October of 1859 the iron-hulled 
Victorian ship Royal Charter was returning 
from Australia to her home in the UK when 
she found herself dangerously close to the 
shoreline as winds began to pick up speed. The 
captain dropped the anchors and cut the masts 
in an attempt to prevent disaster, but within a 
few hours the ship had been ripped apart and 
submerged, leaving over 450 people dead. 
The tragedy troubled Robert FitzRoy, a 
pioneering meteorologist who believed that he 
could have predicted the storm responsible for 
the tragedy, preventing the ship from heading 
into dangerous waters. In February 1861 the ﬁrst 
shipping forecast was given after he introduced 
a storm warning system using an electric 
telegraph. The system has developed over the 
past century and has remained an integral part 
of keeping people safe at sea. 
Today, the shipping forecast is produced by 
the Met Oﬀice and aired on BBC Radio 4 on 
behalf of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. 
There are dedicated teams of meteorologists 
operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 
every day of the year. They look at data and 
observations, monitor charts and produce 
forecasts every six hours. They provide weather 
forecasts for all the waters around the British 
Isles, stretching from southeast Iceland in the 
north down to Trafalgar in southern Spain. 
These waters are divided into 31 sections 
known as sea areas, providing sailors with 
accurate weather predictions. The forecast is 
always read in the same format and the same 
order, starting with Viking and moving 
clockwise around the Isles.
150 years after its maiden broadcast, the ﬁrst public weather 
forecast system is still responsible for saving lives at sea

or every new generation of children there
seems to be an iconic ﬁlm featuring a robot 
companion. For today’s adults it was the 
brilliant Short Circuit, and for children it’s 
Disney’s excellent Big Hero 6 or the Transformers 
franchise. We’d once watch these movies with a 
sense of longing, quietly wishing we had a robot 
of our own to join us on our adventures. But now 
we must wait no longer, as it’s easier and cheaper 
to construct our own robots than ever before! So 
why don’t we get started? 
There are several companies that oﬀer 
simpliﬁed robotic assembly packages, with the 
focus on introducing young children to robot 
construction. However, to really expand your 
knowledge and skill set and develop a hunger for 
building more complex machines, it’s best to 
build a DIY robot from scratch. For this, the ﬁrst 
thing you’ll need to ﬁnd is a workshop. Ideally 
this would be at your local school or college, but 
if you can get your hands on the essential 
materials and tools then you could work from 
your garage at home.

built, M.A.X measures 30 centimetres tall. You
can control it using voice commands, buttons on
the MeccaBrain or the free Meccano Hub app. 
And you’ll know exactly what it’s thinking based 
on its expressive facial graphics.
Not just a learning tool, this robot loves fun. 
Try playing on M.A.X’s built-in gaming platform, 
test your knowledge in a trivia game or listen to 
some funny jokes! With a multitude of features, 
kids will want to bring their new friend 
everywhere. This robot comes with built-in 
infrared sensors, enabling it to move with agility 
and avoid obstacles in its path. If you know a 
young mind in need of a challenge, introduce 
them to their new friend M.A.X.
Once you’ve got your base of operations, tools 
and safety gear all sorted, then you can begin 
designing your machine. It’s always sensible to 
start simple and work your way up. On the right 
we’ve listed some design features that a 
seasoned builder may wish to consider, but to 
start with your goal should be to get your simple 
robot working. Despite its simplicity, your ﬁrst 
robot may well be the most challenging you ever
create, but it may also be the most rewarding.
By building robots you can improve your skills
in mechanics, electronics and programming, all
while having fun. Plus, as an added bonus, you 
get a robot companion as a reward! So turn over 
the page when you’re ready and you can get 
started on building your very ﬁrst homemade 
robot creation.

young minds, using their 
knowledge of science, 
technology, engineering 
and mathematics
The study of robotics is likely to play  
an increasing role in schools
Locomotion
Wheels will provide extra 
speed on flat ground, but 
for climbing rocky inclines 
a stable quadrupedal may 
be the way to go.
Equipment
Your bot may need to carry 
equipment. One useful 
item could be the 
University of Texas’ 
‘self-healing’ gel.
Size
When it comes to robots, 
bigger isn’t always better. 
Small machines like the 
Robot Cockroach can slip 
through tight gaps.
Complexity
Complex robots may have 
a spectrum of different 
uses, but the more moving 
parts a robot has, the more 
likely it is to break!
Sensors
Some robots have sensors 
for analysing objects. You 
could equip your bot to 
recognise infrared and 
ultraviolet light.
Weapons
Simple but powerful 
flippers and spinning discs 
are devastating, able to 
topple foes and tear 
through thick armour.
Strength
Hydraulic pressure, which 
is the system used by 
cranes to lift extreme 
weight, could make your 
robot a fearsome force.
Intelligence
To program your bot with a 
degree of artificial 
intelligence you’ll need 
sophisticated software and 
a powerful CPU.

Create a platform
Using the accompanying image as a guide, start by drawing
the platform shape on a sheet of A4 paper. Aim to make this
template roughly nine centimetres wide at its widest point and
13 centimetres long at its longest. Once this is done, carefully cut
out your paper template and place it on top of a piece of
cardboard. Next, trace around the template with a marker pen
and cut out the cardboard platform.
3
Connect your wires
Attach the red wire on the battery pack (with the switch
attached) to one of the tabs on the rocker switch, then connect
the two inner tabs of the micro switches using 50 millimetres of
red wire. Next, attach the following with 120 millimetres of red
wire: the outer tab on the left micro switch to the bottom tab of
the right motor; the outer tab on the right micro switch to the
bottom tab of the left motor; the inner tab of the right micro
switch to the other tab on the rocker switch. To finish, solder the
left-hand motor’s top tab to the negative side of the battery pack
and connect the top tabs on the motors using 60 millimetres of
black wire.
2
Arrange the components
Begin this step by carefully using your glue gun to attach the 
rocker switch to the underside of the battery pack. Now it’s time 
to arrange our components on the paper template. Place the two 
drive motors at the narrowest point on the sheet and place the 
battery pack to one side. Above the motors, at the flat edge of 
the template, place the two micro switches, angled inward so 
that they’re slightly facing towards the centre.
4
Bind your components
Add four AA batteries to your battery pack and test the 
motors before continuing, because you’re now ready to start 
assembling your robot! Using the double-sided sticky tape, 
attach the two drive motors to the cardboard platform, making 
sure that they line up nicely along the narrowest segment. Stick 
the two micro switches to the card in the same positions as 
described in step 2 and finish by sticking the battery pack to the 
top of the motors.

How to solder
The best way to ensure that you get an optimal connection
between your wires and components is to use a pre-heated
soldering iron and the ‘tinning’ method. This involves first
soldering the two objects separately, waiting until the solder
has cooled before bringing them together and then heating
the solder with the iron, which will fuse the ‘tinned’ ends
together and give you a strong connection.

Now you’re going to create the bug’s most iconic features 
— the antennas! Fetch your cable ties and make a 45-degree

Top safety tips
Wear 
appropriate 
gear
It’s recommended 
that you wear an 
apron to protect 
your clothes 
against any mess, 
but note that 
certain tools will 
require extra 
protection.
Avoid 
moving parts
As you grow more 
experienced your 
machines will 
become more 
powerful. Make 
sure to keep your 
fingers clear of 
any moving parts 
while the robot 
is active.
Don’t 
work by 
yourself
Always make sure 
someone is close 
by to lend you a 
hand if needed, 
especially when 
you are using a 
new tool or 
technique for the 
first time.
Be patient
Most accidents 
happen when 
users are in a 
rush. Take your 
time when using 
potentially 
dangerous pieces 
of equipment. 
Follow any 
instructions 
carefully.
Cool 
your tools
Make sure you 
switch off your 
soldering iron and 
glue gun as soon 
as you have 
finished using 
them, and give 
them plenty of 
time to cool  
down properly.

ecurity cameras are a great tool in 
protecting your home, but what if they 
could play a more active role in detecting 
and deterring crime? Rather than just watch the 
perpetrators, the Canary ‘all-in-one’ home 
security device notiﬁes the user once it detects 
unusual activity in their home and can stream 
the footage straight to their smartphone. 
The app allows the owner to view real-time 
footage from the Canary device to simply check 
the house or maybe to see what the dog’s doing. 
The security settings on the app are activated 
whenever the device detects someone in the 
house and automatically alerts the owner. With 
the use of passive infrared motion sensors, 
Canary detects changes in heat energy that 
naturally radiate from a human body. The 
sensors then activate the built-in camera, which 
begins recording. Canary then gives the user the 
option to either sound a siren or call the police. 
However, the original Canary model doesn’t 
come without its limitations as it is unable to 
detect movement through window glass and 
cannot be placed outside. To combat this 
limitation the company has developed a 
weatherproof device, the Canary Flex, to brave 
the elements. This can be used completely 
independently of other Canary devices or be 
paired with the master Canary device for 
complete home coverage.

y taking a series of photographs in 
deﬁned intervals, time-lapse 
photography speeds up time so you can 
see an entire day pass by in a video of only a few 
seconds; essentially the opposite of slow-motion. 
The general rule for this technique is the faster 
the scene is moving, the shorter the intervals 
between each image and visa versa. To 
determine the length of the ﬁnal clip a little 
maths is needed. In order to produce a video clip 
of one minute with image intervals of three 
seconds at 25 frames per second, you would need 
to take 1,500 pictures over a period of one hour 
and ﬁfteen minutes. Automated 
‘intervalometers’ snap a new image at the set 
interval, meaning you don’t have to stand there 
clicking every couple of seconds.

umans didn’t evolve to have to 
wear shoes; they change the 
way we walk. We have 
adapted to an unnatural walking 
position as a consequence of wearing 
over-supported, thick, cushioned 
shoes. As a result our feet have 
become lazy and weak. Barefoot 
shoes take us back to basics by 
allowing our toes to spread naturally 
in lightweight, ﬂexible shoes, 
providing greater stability and grip 
and encouraging skilful movement. 
It is hoped that by providing less 
structural support to the ankle and 
arches it may be possible to 
strengthen the muscles in the foot.

HISTORY
I
n an era where humans dominate the land, it 
is rare for us to encounter animals bigger than 
ourselves in our daily lives. However, if we 
had existed during the Cretaceous period, 
Sauropods would have had us running for the 
hills. One particular giant has been hitting the 
headlines this year after ﬁnally getting a name. 
Discovered in 2012, the Patagotitan mayorum was 
a plant-eating, long-necked, stomping giant that 
weighed more than 11 African elephants: it is 
among the largest animals to have ever walked 
the Earth. 
The unearthing of this giant began at the La 
Flecha farm in Patagonia, Argentina, when a 
ranch worker named Aurelio Hernández came 
across one of over 200 fossils of this gigantic 
Titanosaur. The specimens collected from the 
site are believed to have come from at least six 
individual patagotitans to form the most 
complete anatomical reconstruction of a 
Sauropod to date.
DISCOVERING A GIANT
As the heavyweight champion of the 
Titanosaurs, the patagotitan weighed in at 
around 69 tons, making the largest nine-ton 
Tyrannosaurus rex look minuscule. Stretching out 
from head to tail, this titan measures around 37 
metres, the same length as around eight London 
taxis lined up next to each other. 
Determining the weight of the patagotitan is 
diﬀicult, with multiple methods being used 
among palaeontologists. Lead palaeontologist Dr 
Diego Pol and his team used two methods to 
calculate the patagotitan’s body mass. The ﬁrst 
method used an equation requiring the 
circumferences of the main limbs that supported 
its body, the femur and humerus, to estimate the 
weight they could support. An alternative 
method was to 3D scan each of the fossils to form 
a complete reconstruction of the patagotitan and 
estimate the volume of the surrounding soft 
tissue. Researchers believe that these fossilised

water. This occurred at least three ti
site, indicating that the prehistoric giants had
visited this site on at least three separate
occasions. Much like we see in elephants, some 
of the fossil specimens of the patagotitan even 
had marks suggesting living patagotitans had 
stepped on them. It has been speculated that 
due to periods of drought, these beasts may have 
died from dehydration by becoming entrapped 
in the surrounding mud. 
A GARGANTUAN GROUP
Dominating the land when the ﬁrst examples of 
ﬂowering plants began to bloom, these 
behemoths walked among giants. Patagotitan 
fossils have been dated back to around 100
million years ago, but they’re not the only
example of giant dinosaurs; this class of the 
titans includes multiple examples of towering 
dinosaurs. Even the smallest of the Sauropods, 
the Saltasaurs, weighed in at around seven tons. 
Previously believed to have been the largest of 
the group, the argentinosaurus is estimated to 
have weighed around 70 tons. There is a limited 
amount of fossil evidence to completely 
reconstruct a argentinosaurus, so the 
patagotitan is thought to be the largest animal 
ever due to the greater number of preserved 
anatomical fossils found. 
remains are possibly from a specimen that is not 
fully grown, so maybe there are bigger dinosaurs 
to unearth. 
However, it’s not just the size and mass of a 
patagotitan that the fossil specimen can show 
us: it also reveals some of its behaviours and 
movements. Examining the teeth of dinosaurs 
can indicate their diet; a mouth full of grinding 
molars indicates a vegetarian diet, like the 
patagotitan and other Sauropods. 
In the case of the patagotitan, the 
archaeological team found three levels of 
specimens in the same location on a ﬂoodplain, 
where the dinosaur’s remains were covered over 
time by sediment brought over by the ﬂooding

“Patagotitan fossils

million years ago”
How important is this 
discovery for the ﬁeld 
of palaeontology?
Every new fossil ﬁnd is 
important as it helps to 
add a tiny piece to a 
gigantic prehistoric 
jigsaw puzzle. The 
discovery of [the] patagotitan is important in 
furthering our knowledge of gigantic 
dinosaurs and the diversity of the group 
(Titanosauria) it belongs to. The patagotitan is 
one of the most complete giant dinosaurs 
known, which helps to ‘ﬁll in’ the missing 
pieces of what was previously unknown in 
other giant Titanosaurs.
For such a huge giant, how much did it 
need to eat?
In order to maintain it’s huge size — [around] 
70 tons — the patagotitan would need to have 
been eating constantly. Of course, it’s diﬀicult 
to put any accurate estimate for the amount of 
vegetation required, but it would certainly 
have been a huge amount.
What can the evidence of multiple 
patagotitans tell us?
At least six individual patagotitan specimens 
were found in the same quarry, although 
some were found at slightly higher levels, and
it is thought that they perished in three
diﬀerent burial events. Clearly it shows that
some of these individuals of diﬀerent size
must have been living together in herds.
Why is the name of a new dinosaur
species so important?
This is the foundation of palaeontology. The
fossil record is very incomplete, especially
when we consider that only a tiny percentage
of all animals that once lived on the planet
have been found as fossils. So describing new
species and working out where they ﬁt on the
tree of life is important in understanding
their place in the history of life in deep time.

THE FAMILY NAME
Placing species on the ‘tree of life’ takes time — 
four years in the case of the Patagotitan 
mayorum. Previously generalised simply as the 
Titanosaur, the dinosaur’s new name pays 
tribute to the location of its discovery (Patagonia) 
and the Greek work for large (‘titan’). The name 
‘mayorum’, however, honours the name of the 
family that hosted the researchers during their
long excavation. 
To formally classify a new species with a new 
name, its lineage must ﬁrst be identiﬁed. Often 
called the ‘tree of life’, every known species on 
Earth ﬁlters into diﬀerent classiﬁcations. Using 
data collected from fossilised remains, 
palaeontologists can link a species to its 
prehistoric lineage and determine who’s related 
to whom. The Titanosauria is a diverse clade 
(group of evolutionary descendants of a common 
ancestor) of Sauropod dinosaurs that includes 
some of the largest known land animals to have 
ever graced the planet.

t’s been dubbed the most durable building 
material ever, and it was created thousands of 
years ago. Ancient Roman concrete was used 
to create iconic structures such as the Pantheon 
and the Colosseum, but it’s the piers and sea 
walls that scientists are most interested in. 
Many of these marine marvels are still standing 
while modern concrete decays within decades. 
Using a combination of high-powered X-rays, 
Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy, 
scientists from the University of Utah have 
uncovered the chemistry. The Romans used a 
mix of volcanic ash, quicklime (calcium oxide), 
chunks of volcanic rock and seawater, which 
triggers a chemical reaction. This reaction 
produces crystals that continue to grow over 
time, which strengthen the concrete and 
prevent cracks from developing. 
Meanwhile, modern Portland cement uses 
sand and gravel particles as they are intended to 
be chemically unreactive. This means that any
reactions that occur can expand and crack the 
concrete. The process is also responsible for 
approximately ﬁve per cent of global carbon 
dioxide emissions.
It is hoped that by ﬁguring out the Roman’s 
exact formula we could in future replace modern 
concrete with a stronger, more environmentally 
friendly material that will truly stand the test of 
time in the way the Roman’s concrete has.
Scientists want to know why ancient 
structures are still going strong

fter a ten-year siege, Greek soldiers 
seized the city of Troy by hiding inside a 
hollow wooden horse masquerading as a 
peace oﬀering. The Trojans victoriously dragged 
the horse inside the city walls and consequently 
sealed their fate. Or so the story goes.
The earliest recorded mention of the Trojan 
horse was in Homer’s Odyssey, an epic that was 
committed to the page around 750 BCE 
— several hundred years after the 
alleged war. It’s largely considered a 
work of ﬁction, but most scholars agree 
that Troy was indeed a real city. 
Did the Greeks really win the war with a wooden horse?
Trick or Trojan
The horse was the supposed 
symbol of the city of Troy
Believed to be in modern-day Hisarlik in 
southern Turkey, there’s even archaeological 
evidence suggesting that it was burned down. 
The horse, however, is complete ﬁction. 
Modern historians suggest it could have been 
inspired by ancient siege engines — wooden 
battering rams used to break down city walls. 
Attackers would cover them with damp 
horsehides to prevent them being set alight. A 
more speculative theory is that the horse was a 
metaphor for an earthquake, as Poseidon — a 
god associated with horses — was also the god of 
the seas and earthquakes. 
We may never know the truth behind the 
myth, but we can mostly agree that when it 
comes to this unique wooden weapon, Homer 
was likely horsing around.

lthough the modern British Library was
established as recently as 1973, its origins
stretch back as far as the 18th century. Its
original collection was bequeathed to the nation
for the sum of £20,000 by Sir Hans Sloane, a
physician who had collected over 71,000
artefacts including manuscripts, books and
coins during his lifetime. His collection
was opened in 1753 in Montagu
House, Bloomsbury as part of
the British Museum
Library, the present site
of the British Museum.
In 1662 the statute of
Legal Deposit was
passed in England
and Wales, requiring
a copy of every
printed publication
to be given to the
British Museum
Library (and ﬁve other
legal deposit libraries in
the UK). In 1710 this statute
was extended to include the
whole of the UK.
In May 1857 the iconic Reading Room was
opened, allowing members of the public access
to the library’s treasures. However, passes
were soon introduced, admitting only
approved members.
In the latter part of the 19th century the
library’s full catalogue had reached its 2,250th
volume, each one of them
handwritten. This was
transferred into 437 printed parts
over the course of around 25 years. By
this time the full collection counted some
2 million printed titles.
In its new location on Euston Road, the
modern British Library now houses
items in most known languages
and continues to house and
collect not only all print
material produced in
the UK and Ireland but

n Ticket to Ride Europe the aim of the game for
players is to collect and play train cards in 
order to place your pieces on the board, with 
the goal to connect cities on your ticket cards. 
For ﬁlling out these train cards you then get 
all-important points, which decide the winner 
at the end of the game.
The board and instruction manual may look 
complex, bordering on bewildering at ﬁrst, but 
don’t worry, you’ll quickly get your bearings 
— ﬁguratively and literally — as the gameplay is 
very straightforward. Taking turns to play your 
train cards and connect your cities to make
complete routes throughout Europe, this is a 
fast-paced game to play and welcomes players of 
diﬀerent generations to play each other, as luck 
of the draw can often play as big a part as the 
strategic playing of cards.
There are some twists in play, such as higher 
costs for placing pieces on tunnels and the 
requirement for special locomotives to use 
ferries, as well as trading in some of your points 
to use other players’ routes to connect your own, 
but otherwise the gameplay is quite simple. Not 
only that, but playing the game also educates all
players on the cities and train routes of early 
20th-century Europe, especially opening up a 
world of discovery in Eastern Europe and 
Russia. While you can play with just two players, 
we recommend at least four players are involved 
for the best experience.

How do you split
an atom?
David Cartwright
Q  Some unstable nuclei can split spontaneously, 
but this is very rare. Heavy atoms can be induced 
to split by bombarding them with neutrons, a 
process known as nuclear ﬁssion. The easiest 
atoms to split are large radioactive isotopes such 
as uranium-235. When a uranium-235 atom 
absorbs a neutron, the uranium nucleus 
becomes highly unstable and splits into two 
smaller nuclei and three neutrons. These free 
neutrons can break apart other uranium-235 
atoms, resulting in a chain reaction. AC

Q The unpredictability of the UK’s weather is caused 
by its location on Earth and the Earth’s rotation. The UK 
is situated directly beneath the boundary between two 
of the Earth’s climate cells: the cold polar air to the 
north and the warm tropical air to the south. These two 
types of air are constantly battling against each other, 
with the winner of the battle being decided by the jet 
stream, a fast wind blowing ten kilometres above us 
that is a product of the Earth’s spin. It coils around the 
planet at about the UK’s latitude, causing the climate 
cell boundary to move and bring either colder or 
warmer air across the country. This constant shift in 
boundary lines explains our varying weather. JS

Q  Shifting gears on a bike changes the speed 
or force generated by each pedal stroke, 
making it easier for cyclists to go up steep 
hills with minimal force or pick up as much 
speed as possible. When you pedal you turn 
the sprocket, which is connected by the chain 
to the rear sprocket, spinning the back wheel 
and allowing you to move forwards. In a high 
gear, a full rotation of the pedals is translated 
into several times as many rotations of the 
back wheel, generating speed. In a low gear, 
the change in gear ratio allows pedalling to 
generate fewer rotations (and less speed) but 
more force. AC

much light passes through, depending on how
much UV light is hitting them. When you are

Lee Willis
Q Excess calories from carbohydrates are
converted to and stored as a quick-access
carbohydrate called glycogen in the liver and
muscles. An adult can store 100 grams, so once
storage is full any excess sugar is converted into
fatty acids. If unused these become fat cells. LM

QCenturies ago wolves hunted across 
the diﬀerent countries that now make 
up the UK, but their numbers declined 
as humans hunted them to extinction 
and destroyed their habitats through 
deforestation and development. 
Oﬀicially, the last wolf in mainland 
Britain was shot dead in 1680 in 
Scotland. However, there are stories 
that wolves managed to survive in 
remote parts of Scotland for 
approximately another two centuries, 
and it wasn’t until 1786 that the last 
recorded wolf in Ireland was killed. TL
When did wolves 
become extinct in 
the UK?

might still have questions when you turn the

ave you ever watched Star Wars and 
wondered about the history of Coruscant 
or wanted to know more about the aquatic 
creatures from across the galaxy? The movies 
and TV shows don’t always have time to go into 
detail about the history, biology and geography 
of the series, meaning fans have to do their own 
research to ﬁnd out more. But no more, thanks to 
this bulging book of facts.
This encyclopedia is absolutely packed with 
information about every imaginable part of the 
Star Wars universe. Want to know about the 
fresh foodstuﬀs that are eaten by the inhabitants 
of the galaxy or the bizarre musical instruments, 
technology or even luggage designs that are 
used? Well, this book tells you all about them 
— and a lot more besides.
The book includes information from every 
movie and the TV shows, right up to Rogue One: 
A Star Wars Story, meaning there’s a lot of stuﬀ to 
cover. Sadly, the book doesn’t include any details 
from the upcoming movie, Episode VIII: The Last 
Jedi, although this is probably for the best for 
those that want to avoid spoilers. Thankfully, it 
doesn’t have any noticeable eﬀect inside, and 
there is still an astonishing amount of 
information packed into the book.

Are we alone in the universe? It’s a
question we continue to ask. For
now, the answer is ‘as far as we
know’, but with every new planet
that is discovered, the expectation
that the response might change
grows slightly.
As little as we know about these
exoplanets — worlds far outside
our own Solar System — some of
the ﬁndings that are detailed in
this book suggest that they could
be unlike anything we’ve ever
heard of previously. Take the
lava-ﬁlled inferno of 55 Cancri e, or
the binary star system of VV
Cephei. Maybe Tatooine’s two suns
weren’t as far-fetched as we
thought after all.

Which makes it very handy when it

how diﬀerent chemical elements 
are formed via the interaction of 
subatomic particles, in the process 
explaining various phenomena and
live-changing particles. From the 
Big Bang Theory to the Higgs boson,
a wide net is cast over the building

However, even with the aid of the 
wonderful world of Lego, this book 
may prove to be too tricky to 
understand for some — it turns out 
that even the brilliant building 
blocks have their limitations. And 
while author Dr Ben Still’s aim is 
admirable, ultimately the inclusion 
of Lego in this book turns out to be a 
little bit of a gimmick that doesn’t 
really add anything beyond an 
eye-catching sub-heading.
Whenever you pick up a Haynes 
manual you can rest assured that 
the content within it will be both 
rigorously researched and crazily 
compulsive, and once again it 
comes to pass here as the 
renowned publishers mark the 
100th anniversary of the Royal Air 
Force (RAF).
As you would expect, plenty of 
space is devoted to the pivotal role 
the RAF played in defending 
Britain during World War Two, 
detailing the innovations and 
events that helped it turn the tide 
of history. However, this doesn’t 
dominate the book. From its 
establishment immediately 
post-1918 to relatively recent 
additions like Aircrew Equipment 
Assembly and FLIR (Forward 
Looking Infrared), the RAF’s 
continued importance is 
underlined throughout.
Like pretty much every Haynes 
manual, your enjoyment levels 
will largely depend on your 
investment in the subject matter. 
If it’s suitably high in the case of 
the RAF then you can consider this 
book a resounding success story.

cience can sometimes be dry, dull and 
even a bit boring — but we all know that it 
isn’t always like that. In fact, there are tons 
of fun experiments that you can try to test out 
science in the world around you and plenty of 
ways that science can amaze and inspire. The 
Element in the Room proves this like few other 
books can.
Thanks to the witty and clever writing, every 
topic is engaging, fun and in some cases 
laugh-out-loud funny. The conversational tone is 
a real winner, with hilarious footnotes, smart 
references and amusing comments on every 
page that make this more than your average 
science book. Did you know that some scientists 
estimate that one in ten humans alive today 
were conceived in an Ikea bed? Amazing, right? 
The authors here joke about how many people 
have to sneak into Ikea at night in order to test 
the theory, and it’s comments like this that make 
this as much comedy as it is science. 
Then there are the experiments. The selection 
is exceptional — the book starts with simple 
experiments to ﬁnd valves in the veins on your 
arms by pressing them with your ﬁngers. By the 
halfway point you’ll be creating spinning ﬁre 
tornadoes in wastepaper bins, and by the end 
you’ll be making alcoholic (and non-alcoholic) 
cocktails all in the name of science. This is 
certainly a book that aims its experiments at 
adults; the language is mostly suitable for 
younger ages, but the intended audience is 
deﬁnitely older. 
There are too many highlights to mention. The 
Trip Advisor reviews of Earth-like planets 
around the Solar System are good fun, while the 
coﬀee Venn diagram will raise a smile (before 
going on to explain why instant coﬀee tastes so 
bad). The experiment to test the Leidenfrost

1  
Make your fan 
 You’ll need a rectangle of black card around 30 
centimetres long and 25 centimetres wide. You’ll 
also need a piece of paper, some scissors, a long 
pin, two similarly thick books and a small strip of 
card. Once you have these items, cut a square of 
paper ten centimetres wide, then make a cut from 
each corner towards the middle of the square, 
around two-thirds of the way to the centre.
4
Add your fan 
Take a small strip of card and bend it slightly 
to create a C-shaped piece. Stick this to the top of 
your tower on the inside to create a loop that looks 
a little bit like a handle for your cylinder. Then 
push the pin about half way through this strip of 
card and tape your fan on top of the pin so that it 
sits just above the tower’s opening.
2 
Fold it 
Now for the slightly ﬁddly part. Take one 
corner of the paper at a time and fold it in so that it 
touches the centre point of the square. This will 
create a kind of ‘pocket’ in the paper. Do the same 
with the other three corners, ensuring that these 
pockets all face the same direction, like the 
blades of a fan. Glue the folded paper in place at 
the centre of the square.
5 
See your solar power in action 
 Now place your tower near a sunny window 
to see what happens. Black items absorb heat, so 
by using black card you have created a tower that 
warms up the air inside it. What happens at it gets 
hotter? You should see that the fan on top starts to
move as air is pushed up through the tube and 
cooler air is pulled in from the bottom.
3 
Create your tower 
 Next you need to create the solar tower. Take 
your black card and roll it into a cylinder shape 
— this will be the shape of your tower. Now take 
the two books you selected earlier and place them 
a few centimetres apart on a ﬂat surface, then 
place your cylinder over the gap. This will allow 
air to enter the tower from the bottom and 
circulate up through the tube.
Disclaimer: Neither Future Publishing nor its employees can accept liability 
for any adverse effects experienced after carrying out these projects. 
Always take care when handling potentially hazardous equipment or when 
working with electronics and follow the manufacturer’s instructions.
In summary…
When the heat absorbed by the black tube 
is passed onto the air inside the tube, the 
air becomes less dense (lighter) and starts 
to rise. As it moves up through the tower 
and out of the top it makes the fan spin!

heat, so by using black 
card you have created 
a tower that warms 
the air inside it”

Create your shapes 
  To get started you’ll ﬁrst need to cut out 
diﬀerent shapes from thick paper or card. Try to 
cut the shapes in a range of sizes, from around 
two to six centimetres — if you can use diﬀerent 
coloured card for each one it will make it easier to 
tell them apart. When you throw them later, you’ll 
be able to test the diﬀerent shapes to see which 
one works best. You can also write numbers on 
the shapes to help you tell them apart.
2  
Add the weight 
 Next, attach a paper clip to the narrow end of 
each shape. If you look at a real sycamore seed 
you’ll see that the seed itself is found in one end of 
the shape, with the rest of the structure dedicated 
to a fan-like blade that helps the side to ﬂoat and 
ﬂy. By adding weight to the thinner end of the 
shapes you’ve made you’re creating a similar 
structure, which should ﬂy in the same way when 
you test it.

Throw and test 
 You can throw your helicopters into the air or 
drop them from a high place like an upstairs 
window. Which shape is the most eﬀective when 
they drop? Make a note and try to work out why 
diﬀerent shapes workbetterthanothers.For
some of the shapesyou
might need to bendthe
paper slightly to get
the shape to spin 
well as it falls 
— this is just like 
real sycamore 
seeds, which 
have slightly 
curved blades.
In summary…
When a sycamore seed falls from a tree the air pushes up against the blades, bending them 
up. When air pushes upwards on the slanted blades the seed moves sideways, making it spin. 
If there is a big gust of wind the seed can be carried oﬀ to somewhere suitable for it to grow.

Differences
in dolphins
Q Dear HIW,
What is the difference between river
dolphins and normal dolphins?
Jacob Gibson, aged 10
Dolphin species that are categorised
as river dolphins have an affinity to
fresh water. Unlike marine dolphins
swimming in seas and oceans, river
dolphins inhabit rivers of South
America and Asia. These dolphins
have physical differences to their
marine cousins, such as elongated
snouts and rounded foreheads.
Some species of river dolphin can
survive in salt water too, but other
species, such as the Amazon river
dolphin, are only able to survive in
fresh water.
Are black
holes real?
Q Hello HIW,
It has been over two years since I got my
first issue and I have been reading it ever
since. I have been thinking a lot about
black holes recently and was wondering, if
light can’t escape from them, how do we
know that they even exist? Are we even
100 per cent sure that they exist?
Best regards,
Zac Lovat, aged 11
That is a great question Zac! The
answer to this is very complex, but
in short we can predict that black
holes exist because of the influence
they have on objects around them,
such as their gravity and the
radiation they emit.
There are projects such as the
Event Horizon Telescope that are
working to take a picture of the
border of a black hole when it

QDear HIW, 
I’ve been reading your magazines lately and I 
have really enjoyed them. I was just 
wondering if you could answer a question.
Why do some people sneeze when they see 
a bright light?
Many thanks,
Pascal Ahearne, aged 12 
Sneezing when exposed to bright 
light in known as a photic sneezing 
reflex (PSR). It is also known as — and 
this isn’t a joke — ACHOO syndrome 
(Autosomal dominant Compelling 
Helio-Ophthalmic Outburst). 
It’s not exactly clear as to why it 
occurs, but we know the act of 
sneezing itself is a protective reflex 
to clear the nasal passage. There are 
some theories as to why light could 
inspire a sneeze. 
Some scientists have suggested 
that ‘cross-talk’ between the nerves 
that control sneezing and vision leads 
to interference between the different 
impulses and therefore triggers the 
PSR. Though it is unclear as to why 
this occurs, it seems to be hereditary. 
So chances are, if your parents 
sneeze in the sunlight, you are likely 
to as well. Grab a tissue before you 
step outside on bright days!
