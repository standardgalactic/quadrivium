Home Recording For Musicians For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
xvi

Introduction
I
f you’re like most musicians, you’ve been noodling around on your instru-
ment for a while and have finally decided to take the plunge and get seri-
ous about recording your ideas. You may just want to throw a few ideas 
down onto tape (or hard drive) or capture those magic moments that you 
have with your band. Or you may want to compose, record, produce, and 
release the next great platinum album. Either way, you’ll find that having a 
home studio can give you hours of satisfaction.
Well, you’ve chosen a great time to get involved in audio recording. Not long 
ago, you needed to go to a commercial recording studio and spend thou-
sands of dollars if you wanted to make a decent-sounding recording. Now you 
can set up a first-class recording studio in your garage or spare bedroom and 
create CDs that can sound as good as those coming out of top-notch studios 
(that is, if you know how to use the gear).
Home Recording For Musicians For Dummies, 3rd Edition, is a great place to 
start exploring the gear and techniques you need to create great CDs (if I do 
say so myself). This book introduces you to home recording and helps you to 
get your creative ideas out into the world.
About This Book
Home Recording For Musicians For Dummies not only introduces you to the 
technology of home recording but also presents basic multitrack recording 
techniques. In the pages to follow, you find out about the many types of digi-
tal recording systems that are available, including computer-based systems, 
all-in-one recorder/mixer systems (called studio-in-a-box systems), and stand-
alone recorders that require separate mixers and effects processors.
You get acquainted with the basic skills that you need to make high-quality 
recordings. These skills can save you countless hours of experimenting and 
searching through owner’s manuals. Some of these skills are as follows:
 
✓ You discover the ins and outs of using the various pieces of equipment 
in your studio.
 
✓ You explore tried-and-true engineering techniques, such as microphone 
choice and placement.

Home Recording For Musicians For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
 
✓ You discover the concepts of multitracking, mixing, and mastering.
 
✓ You find out how to turn all your music into complete songs and dis-
cover how to assemble and release an album.
Home Recording For Musicians For Dummies puts you on the fast track toward 
creating great-sounding CDs because it concentrates on showing you skills 
that you can use right away and doesn’t bother you with tons of technical 
jargon or useless facts.
Not-So-Foolish Assumptions
I have to admit that when I wrote this book, I made a couple of assumptions 
about you, the reader (and you know what happens when you ASSume any-
thing). First, I assume that you’re interested in recording your music (or 
someone else’s) in your home and not interested in reading about underwa-
ter basket weaving (a fascinating subject, I’m sure, but not appropriate for a 
book entitled Home Recording For Musicians For Dummies).
I assume that you’ll most likely record your music using a digital hard-drive 
recording system because these are the most common types of systems 
available. I also assume that you’re relatively new to the recording game and 
not a seasoned professional. (Although if you were, you would find that this 
book is a great reference for many audio engineering fundamentals.) Oh, and 
I assume that you play a musical instrument or are at least familiar with how 
instruments function and how sound is produced.
Other than these things, I don’t assume that you play a certain type of music 
or that you ever intend to try to “make it” in the music business (or even that 
you want to treat it as a business at all).
How This Book Is Organized
Home Recording For Musicians For Dummies is organized so that you can find 
the information that you want quickly and easily. Each section contains chap-
ters that cover a specific part of the home recording process. In Part I, you 
discover the tools of your auditory craft and get them up and running, while 
Part II introduces you to general recording practices. Part III helps you get 
the best sound that you can from your instruments, and Part IV digs into the 
multitrack recording process. Part V shows you how to turn it all into music 
and helps you share your music with others, and Part VI gives you tips and 
resources to keep your music growing.

 Introduction
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics
Part I introduces you to the basics of home recording. Chapter 1 introduces 
you to the process of home recording and explains the basic gear that you 
need to get started. Chapter 2 opens a huge can of worms and explores the 
many types of digital recording systems available to help you find the best 
system for your needs. This part ends with Chapter 3, which shows you how 
to set up a system so that it is easy to work with and sounds good. You also 
find out how to get your room to work well for you.
Part II: Recording 101
Part II gets into more gear talk — this time giving you a hands-on experience. 
Chapter 4 acquaints you with the role of signal flow in audio recording and 
shows you how this flow works in a variety of different systems. Chapter 5 
demystifies MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) and gives you practi-
cal advice on how to use this powerful communication tool to enhance your 
music. Chapter 6 allows you to get inside the world of microphones. You find 
out what kinds of mics are available, how they work, and which ones work 
best for different situations.
Part III: Getting Ready to Record
Part III helps you dot your Ts and cross your Is (er, you know what I mean) 
when getting your instrument’s sound into your system. Chapter 7 shows you 
how to set the best levels for all your instruments, whether they are plugged 
directly into your system or miked. Chapter 8 introduces you to the art of 
microphone placement and how it relates to the sound you get from your 
instrument, and Chapter 9 gets down and dirty with some suggestions for 
miking a bunch of common instruments.
Part IV: Laying Track: Starting to Record
Part IV gets into the meat of recording music. Chapter 10 explains the pur-
pose of multitrack recording and shows you how to do it to get the best 
sound possible. Chapter 11 helps you start recording audio tracks. This chap-
ter gives you the specifics on every aspect of recording, including doing over-
dubs and replacing missed-notes (or musical) sections using a punch 
procedure. Chapter 12 takes you into the world of MIDI sequencing, where 
you can record MIDI performance data and tweak the sound (and the 

4
Home Recording For Musicians For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
performance later). It also guides you through the process of editing data — 
moving, fixing, deleting, and so on. This process can be done in two ways 
(visually or aurally), and you explore both in this chapter.
Part V: Turning Your Tracks 
into a Finished Song
Part V helps you to take all your individual tracks and blend them together to 
create a finished song. Chapter 13 helps you clean up your tracks with edit-
ing. Both audio and MIDI editing are covered in detail. Chapter 14 shows you 
how to get your tracks to fit and sound good as a unit through the process of 
mixing. Chapter 15 explores how you can use effects, not only to make your 
music sound as natural as possible but also to help you create special effects 
that can add interest for your listeners. Chapter 16 demystifies the mastering 
process. You discover what mastering is and how to use it to make your 
music sound like the CDs at the music store. Chapter 17 helps you break out 
of your cocoon so that you can share your finished music with others by 
showing you how to make copies of your CD, format your music for Internet 
distribution, and promote your music to gain listeners.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
A staple of every For Dummies book, this Part of Tens contains some informa-
tion that you can use every day. From ten great home recording resources 
(Chapter 18) to invaluable home recording tips (Chapter 19), this Part of 
Tens has it all (well, almost).
Icons Used in This Book

Chapter 1
Understanding Home Recording
In This Chapter
▶ Exploring the components of a home studio
▶ Peering into the process of recording
▶ Making sense of mixing and mastering
▶ Finishing up your project
A
udio recording is a fun and exciting activity. Being able to put down 
your musical ideas and craft them into an album is nearly every 
musician’s dream. The only problem is the learning curve that comes with 
being able to record your music at home; most musicians would rather 
spend their time and energy making music.
In this chapter, I help you get a handle on the basics of home recording and 
show you what’s involved in the process. You discover the basic components 
of a recording studio and get some ideas about the gear you need to get 
first. In addition, you explore the multitracking process and find out what’s 
involved in mixing your tracks. You move on to exploring mastering and 
finding out ways to get your music to your listeners.
Examining the Anatomy 
of a Home Studio
Whether it’s a $100 porta-studio or a million-dollar commercial facility, all 
recording studios contain the same basic components. This is an area where 
many people get lost and one about which I receive the most e-mails. As you 
glimpse the recording world, you’ll inevitably think that this will cost way 
too much and be way too complicated. Well, it can be. But it can also be 
pretty simple and cost efficient. In the following sections, I present a list of 
the essentials of audio recording and offer some insight into cost-saving and 
efficient systems that you can find in the market.

10
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 
Exploring the recording essentials
To take the mystery out of recording gear, here are the essentials that you 
need to know:
 
✓ Sound source: The sound source is your voice, your guitar, your 
ukulele, or any other of the many sound makers that are out there. As a 
musician, you probably have at least one of these at your disposal right 
now.
 
✓ Input device: Input devices are what you use to convert your sound into 
an electrical impulse that can then be recorded. Here are the three basic 
types of input devices:
 
• Instruments: Your electric guitar, bass, synthesizer, and drum 
machines are typical instruments that you plug into the mixer. 
These instruments constitute most of the input devices that you 
use in your studio. The synthesizer and drum machine can plug 
directly into your mixer or recorder, whereas your electric guitar 
and bass need a direct box (or its equivalent, such as a Hi-Z input 
in your mixer) to plug into first. A direct box is an intermediary 
device that allows you to plug your guitar directly into the mixer. 
Chapter 7 explores instruments and their connections to your 
system.
 
• Microphone: A microphone (mic) enables you to record the sound 
of a voice or an acoustic instrument that you can’t plug directly 
into the recorder. A microphone converts sound waves into 
electrical energy that can be understood by the recorder. I detail 
several types of microphones in Chapter 6.
 
• Sound module: Sound modules are special kinds of synthesizers 
and/or drum machines. What makes a sound module different from 
a regular synthesizer or drum machine is that a sound module con-
tains no triggers or keys that you can play. Instead, sound modules 
are controlled externally by another synthesizer’s keyboard or by 
a Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) controller (a specialized 
box designed to control MIDI instruments). Sound modules — with 
the exception of soft-synths — have MIDI ports (MIDI jacks) that 
enable you to connect them to other equipment. (Soft-synths are 
software programs that don’t need hardware MIDI connections 
because the sound modules are stored on your computer’s hard 
drive.) Chapter 5 digs into the details about sound modules.
 
 Depending on what your sound source is, it may also be an input device. 
For example, an electric guitar has pickups that allow you to plug it 
directly into a mixer input without having to use a microphone. On the 
other hand, your voice can’t accept a cord, so you need to use a mic to 
turn your singing into an electrical impulse that can be picked up by 
your mixer or equivalent device. You can find out more about input 
devices in Chapter 7.

11
 Chapter 1: Understanding Home Recording
 
✓ Mixer: A mixer is used to get your input device into your recorder and 
to route signals in a variety of ways. Traditionally, a mixer serves the 
following two purposes:
 
• To route your signals into your recorder: This allows you to 
set the proper level for each input device so that it’s recorded 
with the best possible sound. Chapter 4 explores the different 
mixer-type devices for this purpose.
 
• To blend (mix) your individual tracks into a stereo pair (the left 
and right tracks of your stereo mix): This role of the mixer is 
where your vision as a music producer takes center stage and 
where you can turn raw tracks into a polished piece of music. 
Chapter 14 explores this use of a mixer.
 
✓ Recorder: The recorder is where your audio data is stored. For most 
home recordists, this is a digital recorder. You can find out more about 
the different types of recorders in the next section of this chapter.
 
✓ Signal processors: Most of the time, you have to tweak your recorded 
tracks. Signal processors give you the power to do this. Signal 
processors can be divided into the following three basic categories:
 
• Equalizers: Equalizers let you adjust the frequency balance of your 
tracks. This is important for making your instruments sound as 
clear as possible and for getting all your tracks to blend well.
 
• Dynamics processors: Dynamics processors are used to control 
the balance between the softest and loudest parts of your tracks. 
They have many uses in the studio to help you make your tracks 
sit well together and to keep from overloading your system. 
Chapters 7, 15, and 16 explore ways to use dynamics processors in 
your music.
 
• Effects processors: Effects processors allow you to change your 
tracks in a variety of ways, to create either a more realistic sound 
or unusual effects. Typical effects processors include reverb, 
delay, chorus, and pitch shifting. You can find out more about 
these processors in Chapter 15.
 
✓ Monitors: It’s impossible to know the quality of your recording and 
mixing without proper monitors, such as quality headphones or 
speakers. Monitors come in two basic designs:
 
• Passive: Passive monitors are like your stereo speakers in that 
you also need some sort of amplifier to run them. A ton of options 
are available with prices from around $100. Just remember that 
if you go this route, you need to budget in money for an amp. This 
can run a few hundred or more dollars.

12
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 
 
• Active: Active monitors have an integrated amplifier in each 
speaker cabinet. Having a built-in amp has its advantages, 
including just the right amount of power for the speakers and 
short runs of wire from the amp itself to the speakers (this 
is kind of a tweaky area that some people claim produces a better 
sound). You can find quite a few active monitors on the market 
starting at just a couple hundred dollars.
Checking out recording system types
With the long list of equipment that I present in the previous section, you 
may think that you need to spend a ton of money to get everything you need. 
Fortunately, a lot of home-recording systems are available that contain many 
of the components you need without having to buy everything separately. I 
go into detail about these systems in Chapter 2, but here’s a basic overview:
 
✓ Studio-in-a-box (SIAB) systems: These are all-in-one units that have 
everything in them except for the sound source, input device, and 
monitors. For very little money (starting well under $1,000), you get 
almost everything you need to get started recording. These types 
of systems are also easy to get started with and are great for musicians 
that don’t want to spend a ton of energy tweaking their setup.
 
✓ Computer-based systems: These systems use the processing power of 
your computer to record, mix, and process your music. Computer-based 
systems, like the studio-in-a-box system, perform many of the typical 
recording functions at once. When you have one of these systems, you 
only need your sound source, your input devices, and your monitors.
 
✓ Stand-alone systems: These systems are reminiscent of traditional 
recording studios in that all the pieces of gear are separate. The 
downside is that you have to buy all your components separately, 
which can cost you more than buying one of the more inclusive systems 
(for example, the SIAB and computer-based systems). For people who 
already have a bunch of gear, such as a mixer and signal processors, 
this can be a decent option because you’re buying only what you need 
at the time.
Getting a Glimpse into 
the Recording Process
It’s easy to focus on all the gear that’s used in audio recording and think 
that the process must be pretty complicated. Well, it can be if you want it to, 
but it doesn’t need to be. The heart of recording over the last 30 years 

13
 Chapter 1: Understanding Home Recording
or so has been an approach called multitracking. At its core, multitracking 
involves recording all the instruments on separate tracks so that you can 
mix them later almost any way you want. You can multitrack by recording 
everything — or at least most of the instruments — at one time, just like 
a live performance, or you can go to the other extreme and record each 
instrument separately. Either way, you need a bunch of tracks to be able to 
record to, and you need to understand how to get all these separate pieces 
to blend into something musical.
Setting up a song
The first step in recording your music is to set up your system to record. 
Because you’re probably using some sort of digital system, you need 
to configure your song. This usually involves setting the file type, bit depth, 
and sample rate. This process is one that you’ll get very good at in no time. 
To get the lowdown on setting up songs in various systems, check out 
Chapter 10.
Getting a great sound
Getting your sound source to sound great in your system is the most impor-
tant aspect of recording quality music (well, aside from the song and the 
performances). This is also an area where you’ll constantly be growing and 
learning. I’ve been recording professionally for over 20 years, but I still 
discover something new every time I set up a mic or plug in an electronic 
instrument. The great thing here is that any time you spend tweaking your 
mic placement or recording chain setup (configuration and levels) is time 
well spent and is often rewarded with added clarity or at least a more 
interesting sound. To help you get up to speed on all the intricacies of getting 
high-quality source sounds, check out Part III of this book.
Recording
After you have everything set up, the actual process of recording your music 
properly is pretty straightforward: You enable your track and press the 
Record button. This is easier said than done when the clock is ticking and 
you know that every mistake that you make is being documented. Luckily, 
digital recording makes it easy to redo a track without costing you anything 
in audio fidelity. (It will cost you time though, but because you record at 
home, you may have more time to get it right). Check out Chapter 11 for the 
specifics on recording using a variety of digital systems.

14
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 
Overdubbing
With one track recorded, you’re ready to dig into one of the most invigorat-
ing parts of the multitracking process: overdubbing. Overdubbing is the 
process of adding new tracks to your existing ones. This feature allows you 
to be the one-man band or to bring in other musicians to spice up your 
music. Overdubbing is easily done with digital multitrack recorders, and to 
get you going quickly, I cover the details in Chapter 11.
Making Sense of Mixing
For most recordists, the process of mixing is what turns their mish-mash of 
musical tracks into a song. Mixing involves the following steps:
 
✓ Cleaning up your tracks by getting rid of unwanted noise and perfor-
mance glitches
 
✓ Equalizing each track so that it blends well with all the others
 
✓ Adding signal processing to enhance each track
 
✓ Setting levels for each track to tell the story you want to tell with 
your song
The following sections offer an overview of these steps.
Cleaning up tracks, using editing
When you record, you want the best possible sound and performance for 
each instrument that you can get, but try as you might, sometimes you run 
into problems. These can include picking up unwanted sounds, such as chair 
squeaks, coughs, or other instruments, and can include (and often does) 
mistakes on the part of the musician that need to be cut out. In the olden 
days of tape recording, this editing process took time and skill to physically 
cut out the bad parts of the tape with a razor blade. Today, you can do the 
necessary editing by using the editing functions that are available in digital 
systems. This is nice, but it can also tempt you into doing more editing than 
is necessary to your tracks and, as a result, can suck the life out of them. To 
help you understand what you can do with digital recording systems and to 
help keep you on track with your editing, check out Chapter 13.

15
 Chapter 1: Understanding Home Recording
Equalizing your tracks
When you start mixing a bunch of instruments, you often need to adjust 
the frequencies present in each instrument so that they all blend without 
creating mush (a highly technical term). By adjusting the frequencies of 
each instrument in the mix, you can make sure that each can be heard. This 
process is simple, but it can be time consuming. To make it easier for you, 
I cover equalization in detail in Chapter 14.
Processing your signal
In the world of multitracking and small, acoustically untreated recording 
rooms (most home recordists use a spare bedroom or basement to record in 
and don’t have a ton of money to make the room sound great), it is almost 
essential to process the sound with effects or dynamics processors. Doing 
so is usually intended to add some of the live feel of a concert to the 
recording, although many people also use signal processing to create inter-
esting effects. Because the possibilities for processing your track using a 
digital system are almost limitless, this is an area where most beginners 
overdo it. Because this ability to alter your tracks can be used and abused, I 
cover some of the basics of processing in Chapter 15 to help you keep the 
abuse to a minimum.
Blending your tracks
This is also a process in which most new recordists run into problems. 
Properly mixing your tracks means keeping levels from getting out of hand, 
placing things where you want them in the sound field (left to right and front 
to back), adjusting EQ to blend all your instruments in a pleasing way, and 
using signal processors, such as compression and reverb, to make the most 
of each track. This process is a circular one and takes some skill and patience 
to get right. Cutting corners always results in an end product that falls short 
of its potential. To help you make this process easier, I cover mixing in detail 
in Chapters 14 and 15.
Adding the Final Touches
After your songs are recorded and mixed, all that’s left to do is add the 
finishing touches. These include mastering your songs, putting them all on 
CD, and getting them out into the world through promotion.

16
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 
Mastering your mixes
Mastering is an often-misunderstood (and even unknown to many) part of the 
music production process that can make or break a CD (well, not literally). 
Mastering consists of several important steps that are intended to polish 
your songs so that they make up a complete collection on a CD, commonly 
referred to as an album. Here are the steps for mastering your songs:
 
1. Optimize the dynamics.
 
 The goal here is to get the dynamic levels within and between each song 
to their best. It also means making your music smooth (no sharp edge to 
the music) or punchy (a pronounced attack) — or something in between. 
Unfortunately, most people are only concerned with getting their CD as 
loud as possible when performing this part of mastering. This isn’t a 
good idea, as you find out in Chapter 14.
 
2. Adjust the overall tonal balance.
 
 The point of this part of the mastering process is to create some tonal 
continuity among all the songs on your CD. Because you probably 
recorded and mixed all your tunes over a period of months, they each 
can have slightly different tonal characteristics. This part of mastering 
is where you make all your songs consistent so that they sound like 
part of an album and not a bunch of disjointed tunes thrown together 
haphazardly.
 
3. Match the song-to-song volume.
 
 When your listeners play your CD, you don’t want them to have to 
adjust the volume of each song as it plays (unless they absolutely love a 
particular tune and want to turn it up, of course). The goal with this part 
of mastering is to get the volume of all the songs on a CD at pretty much 
the same level. This keeps one song from barely being heard while 
another threatens to blow the speakers.
 
4. Set the song sequence.
 
 How your songs are arranged on your CD helps tell your story. To make 
the most compelling musical statement, give some serious thought 
to the order of each song on your album. This part of the mastering 
process involves not only deciding what order everything should be in 
but also the steps you take to make it happen.
Putting your music on CD
Recording your finished and mastered songs to a CD for distribution and 
sales is one of the most exciting parts of the recording process. At last you 
have a product, a complete musical statement that you can share with 
(or sell to) others. Like at lot of audio recording and production, the act of 

17
 Chapter 1: Understanding Home Recording
making CDs is more involved than simply clicking the Burn button in your CD 
recording program (at least if you want to make more than one copy). You 
can either duplicate or replicate your CDs to make copies to give or sell to 
your fans. Here’s a quick rundown on the differences between these two 
approaches (Chapter 16 explains them in detail):
 
✓ Duplication: Duplication consists of burning multiple CD-Rs from an 
audio file. Duplication requires very little setup, so it doesn’t cost much 
to make smaller quantities, such as 50–200 CDs.
 
✓ Replication: The replication process starts with producing a glass 
master from your finished CD-R. This master CD is then used to create 
CDs using special CD presses, just like the major-label releases. 
Replication costs a bit more for setup, but the cost to create larger 
quantities of CDs is lower than that for duplication. This is good choice 
for quantities of 500 or more.
Promoting your music
The final and most grueling step of recording and putting out a CD is the 
promotion process. This is where you either make it or break it as an 
independent artist. To help you along, I offer some ideas and insights in 
Chapter 17.

Getting the Right Gear
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding your home recording needs
▶ Taking a look at digital recorders
▶ Understanding analog studio equipment
▶ Exploring a few different recording systems
F
or many people, building a home studio is a gradual thing. You may start 
out with a synthesizer and a cassette recorder and add a microphone. 
Then you may decide to buy a multitrack recorder. Then you trade in your 
stereo speakers for real studio monitors. And before you know it, you’ve 
invested thousands of dollars in a first-rate home studio.
When setting up your home studio, you can go a couple of routes. You can 
walk into your local musical instrument store or pro audio shop without any 
forethought, get the pieces of gear that catch your eye, and then figure out 
where you may use them in your studio. (Hey, don’t laugh; I’ve done this.) 
Or, you can determine your goals ahead of time and research each piece of 
equipment before you buy it to make sure that it is the best possible solution 
for you at the best price point. I recommend the latter approach because you 
end up with only the equipment that you need and not a bunch of useless 
gear that may only look good sitting in your studio.
The process of choosing the right equipment doesn’t have to be difficult. 
All it takes is a little self-assessment and some basic knowledge about the 
different equipment options. This chapter helps you discover these things. 
Here, you get a chance to explore a few different system configurations and 
begin to understand what can work for your situation. You also get a chance 
to familiarize yourself with some of the many analog extras that so many 
people who favor digital recording want today.

Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 
 
Digital recording technology is evolving at an incredible rate. As soon as the 
ink dries on this paper, the next best thing in recording gear may surpass 
much of the technology that I write about in this chapter. It’s tempting to 
always look to the next great innovation before you decide on a recording 
system, but I caution you against this wait-and-see attitude. Digital recording 
technology is now at the point that what you can record in your meager home 
studio can sound as fat, as clean, or as (insert your favorite recording adjec-
tive here) as the best recordings that have been released in the last 20 years.
Don’t be afraid to just jump in and start recording. The way to great-sounding 
recordings is through hours of recording experience (not to mention having 
great songs with which to work).
 
Some of the equipment that I describe in this chapter isn’t on the top of the 
list for most home recordists. I discuss this equipment, though, because you’ll 
likely be taken over by a disease that runs rampant in the audio recording 
world. Yes, I’m sorry to inform you that you’re almost assuredly going to get a 
chronic case of GAS (gear acquisition syndrome). Don’t worry; it’s not terminal 
(unless, of course, you don’t run your future purchases by your family first), 
but it can be uncomfortable. Nothing much is worse than having your eye on a 
piece of gear you just can’t afford. “Let’s see, food for a month or that new 
compressor I’ve just gotta have? . . . Oh well, I needed to go on a diet anyway.”
The good news is that you’ll never run out of new equipment to drool over 
and you’ll never be alone in your suffering — everyone who owns a recording 
studio (private or commercial) suffers from GAS to some extent. The best 
way to keep GAS at bay is to decide on a system and buy it. Then stop 
looking at gear and get to work making some music. After all, that’s why you 
bought the stuff in the first place.
Determining Your Home Studio Needs
Home studios can vary tremendously. A home studio can be simple, like a 
cassette deck and an inexpensive microphone set up in the corner of your 
bedroom. Or you can opt for something elaborate, like a multitrack digital 
recorder with thousands of dollars in outboard gear and expensive instru-
ments residing in an acoustically treated addition to your house (whew!).
Whatever your budget, your first step in choosing what type of home record-
ing system to buy is to determine your recording goals. Use the following 
questions to help you uncover what you truly need (and want) in your home 
studio. As you answer these questions, remember that most recording 
studios aren’t built all at once — pieces of equipment are added slowly over 
time (a mic here, a preamp there). When getting your first home studio 
system, start with only those pieces of gear that you really need and then add 
on slowly when you get to know your equipment.

21
 Chapter 2: Getting the Right Gear
 
For most home recordists, the weakest link in their recording system is their 
engineering know-how. A $4,000 mic is useless until you gain an understanding 
of the subtleties of mic placement, for instance. (Check out Chapter 8 for more 
on such subtleties.) I recommend that you wait to buy that next piece of gear 
until you completely outgrow your present piece of equipment.
To get an understanding of what kind of home studio is best for you, ask 
yourself the following questions:
 
✓ How much money can I spend on equipment? For most people, money 
is the ultimate determining factor in choosing their studio components. 
Set a budget and try to stay within it. The sky’s the limit on what you 
can spend on recording equipment for your home studio, but you don’t 
need to spend a ton of money. If you know your goals and do your 
research, you can create top-quality recordings without having the best 
of everything.
 
 In fact, your skill as a recording engineer has a much greater effect on 
the overall quality of your sound than whether you have a $3,000 
preamp. With the techniques that you discover in this book and tricks 
that you uncover as you get to know your equipment, you can make 
recordings good enough to compete in the marketplace.
 
 Digital recording technology has improved tremendously over the last 
few years and will continue to improve in the years to come. Don’t get 
sucked into the belief that you have to have the latest, greatest thing to 
make great music. After all, great albums and #1 hits throughout history 
were recorded on lesser equipment than you can find in most home 
studios today. Focus on the song and the arrangement, practicing solid 
recording techniques, and you can get by with any of the pro or semipro 
recording systems available.
 
✓ Is this studio just for me, or do I intend to hire it out to record others? 
Your answer to this question may help you decide how elaborate a 
system you need. For example, if you eventually want to hire yourself 
and your studio out to record other people, you need to think about 
the compatibility of your system with other commercial studios. Your 
clients need to be able to take the music that they record at your studio 
and mix or master it somewhere else. You also may have to buy specific 
gear that clients want to use, which often means spending more money 
for equipment from sought-after manufacturers that may sound the 
same as lesser-name stuff. If you’re interested in going the commercial 
studio route, check out other commercial studios in your area and find 
out what they use and what type of equipment their clients ask for.
 
 If this studio is just for your use, you can focus on getting the best 
bang for the buck on gear without worrying about compatibility or 
marketability issues.

22
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 
 
✓ Will I be recording everything directly into the mixing board, or will I 
be miking most of the instruments? Your answer to this question is 
going to dictate your choice in how much of your budget goes toward 
equipment and acoustical treatments for your room. If you intend to 
plug your instruments directly into the mixer and you only need a 
microphone for the occasional vocal, you have more money to spend on 
synthesizers or plug-ins for your DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) — or 
you just won’t have to spend as much. (DAWs are covered in detail in 
the section “Computer-Based DAW Systems,” later in this chapter.)
 
 Conversely, if you plan to record a band live, you must allocate enough 
money for those pieces of gear to allow you to do that effectively, such 
as having enough mics and inputs, sound isolation, and available tracks 
of simultaneous recording.
 
✓ How many tracks do I need? The answer to this question is important 
if you’re considering a system that has limited tracks, such as stand-
alone recorder or studio-in-a-box (SIAB) systems that come with 4, 8, 
16, 24 (and sometimes more) available tracks. (For the lowdown on 
these systems, see the section, “Studio-in-a-Box Systems,” later in this 
chapter.) This question is still worth considering even if you end up 
with a computer-based system because, even though many recording 
software programs boast having “unlimited” available tracks, you’re 
still limited by the power of your computer and the number of inputs 
and outputs contained in your audio interface hardware. (For more on 
the capabilities of computer-based systems, check out the section, 
“Computer-Based DAW Systems,” later in this chapter.) 
 
 Having more tracks is not necessarily a better thing. The more tracks 
you have, the more you think that you need to fill them for every song. 
This can make for cluttered arrangements and hard-to-mix songs. No 
matter how many tracks you end up with, use only those that you need 
to make your recording the best that it can be.
 
 With digital recorders, you can create submixes and bounce several 
tracks into one or two without losing sound quality, reducing the need 
for more tracks. (Find out more about bouncing in Chapter 11.) 
Remember that some great albums were made using just 4 or 8 tracks.
 
✓ Will I be sequencing the parts or playing the instruments live? If you 
plan on sequencing all your music (that is, programming your part into a 
computer or sequencer and having it play your part for you), make sure 
that you get a good MIDI controller. You can also consider having less 
capability for audio tracks. But if you plan to play and record all the 
instruments live, make sure that your recorder has enough tracks for 
you to put each instrument on its own track.

23
 Chapter 2: Getting the Right Gear
Detailing Your Digital Options
Even with the fast pace of today’s technology, one thing is for sure in the 
home recording world: Digital is here to stay. Digital recording has become 
the standard for home recordists and most commercial studios. And the 
format of choice is hard drive because it has many advantages over the other 
forms of digital recording. Not only does hard-drive recording create a great 
sound, but it’s also relatively inexpensive, especially compared with an 
equivalent-sounding studio from 10 to 15 years ago.
In the sections that follow, I examine the main types of digital home studios: 
computer-based DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations), the all-in-one SIAB 
(studio-in-a-box) systems (such as the Roland V-Studios), and stand-alone 
recorders (like the TASCAM X-48). Each has its advantages. What’s right for 
one person may not be the best choice for another. (Isn’t it great to have 
choices?)
Regardless of the type of digital recording system that you like, consider the 
following things before buying:
 
✓ Editing capabilities: Some systems allow very fine editing of audio data, 
while others offer less. If you want so much control that you can edit 
down to the waveform — which basically means being able to edit out a 
single note or even just a part of a note — look for a system with that 
capability. If such control is less important to you, take a pass on such 
systems.
 
 Along with the actual editing capabilities, find out how this editing is 
done. Is it on a tiny LCD screen or can it be done on a large computer 
monitor? Of course, if you won’t be doing a lot of editing, this feature 
may not be important to you. If this is the case, you may be able to 
buy a system for less money that sounds as good as the one with full 
editing capability. It doesn’t make sense to pay for something that you 
won’t use.
 
✓ Compatibility: Compatibility between the various parts of your system 
(the recorder and sequencer or the software and sound card, for 
instance) or between your studio and other studios (your friend’s or a 
commercial studio) is an important issue for many people and one that 
may come back to bite you if you don’t consider it before you buy a 
system. For example, some plug-ins don’t work with certain software 
programs. If you just have to have a certain soft-synth (software synthe-
sizer) or amp simulator plug-in, make sure that you buy a system that 
allows you to use it. (Plug-ins are extra sounds, samples, and effects that 
you can “plug in” to your computer-based DAW’s software program to 
increase its capabilities.) Likewise, some sound cards don’t work well 
with certain software programs.

24
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 
 
✓ Number of simultaneous tracks: Even though a recorder may say it has 
16 tracks, it may not be able to actually record that number of tracks at 
one time. Most studio-in-a-box recorders, for example, record fewer 
tracks than they can play back at once. This usually isn’t a problem 
because you will likely record only a few tracks at a time and overdub 
the rest. This would be a problem if you need to record all 16 tracks 
of a 16-track recorder, such as recording a band playing live at a club.
 
✓ Realistic track count: If you end up considering a computer-based 
system, the number of tracks that a computer software program is 
advertised to record and how many tracks you can actually record with 
your computer are often two very different things. Find out beforehand 
what a realistic track count is with the CPU (processor) and RAM 
(memory) that you have so that you’re not disappointed after you’ve 
forked over your hard-earned money. The best way to do this is to go to 
online forums (such as the ones described in Chapter 18) or talk to 
other users in your area to see what their real-world experiences are.
 
✓ Sample rate and bit depth: The sample rate and the bit depth of the 
system determine how good a sound you can get from it. (The bit depth 
is the size of the audio sample in binary digits, and the sample rate is 
how often the sample is taken per second — notated as kHz.) Most 
semipro and pro systems have a 24-bit resolution and the ability to 
record at several bandwidths — 32, 44.1, 48, 88.2, and 96 kHz, for 
instance. The number of tracks may vary depending on what bandwidth 
setting you choose.
 
 Although most pros still record at 44.1 kHz (the standard for CD audio), 
more people now want to record at 96 kHz (the standard for DVD audio) 
or even 192 kHz (the current high end of audio recording). Even with the 
most expensive recorder, you have to live with having about half as 
many tracks at your disposal when recording at 96 kHz instead of 44.1 
kHz because of the additional processing power it takes to record at the 
higher resolution.
 
✓ Expandability: As you learn and grow as a musician and recording 
engineer, your needs can also grow. Knowing this, your best bet is to 
plan ahead and choose a system that can grow with you. Can you add 
more tracks by synching another machine or increasing available RAM? 
Can you easily synchronize the system with other machines? For 
example, if you want to record 24 tracks now and you use a stand-alone 
recorder, can you add another recorder and have it synch properly? 
Or, if you buy an SIAB and you want to add more inputs later, can the 
system you’re looking at do that? Some can and some can’t, so do your 
research and think about your future needs.
 
 You’ll find that almost all the new semipro and pro systems available 
are expandable, but explore these questions carefully if you look at 
purchasing used gear.

 Chapter 2: Getting the Right Gear
Computer-Based DAW Systems
Computer-based digital recording systems are hardware and software 
options that you can connect to your computer. These systems can be pretty 
straightforward, such as simple 2-track recording freeware that you install 
on your home computer using a stock sound card. Or, you can go for a 
sophisticated system, like built-from-the-ground-up computers optimized to 
do one thing and one thing only: record, mix, and play back audio. (Okay, 
that’s three things, but you get my point.)
To set up a computer-based DAW, you need the following things:
 
✓ A computer (preferably with a speedy processor)
 
✓ A bunch of memory and dual hard drives
 
✓ A sound card
 
✓ An audio interface (the interface between the computer and the outside 
world, usually housing the converters and sometimes the preamps)
 
✓ The software
Finding the right computer setup
No matter which computer platform you choose (see the nearby sidebar 
“Mac or PC?”), the stuff that you find inside your computer plays a major role 
Mac or PC?
Whether to buy a Mac or PC is a hotly debated 
topic among home recordists. Most profes-
sional studios used to favor Macintosh comput-
ers for recording audio. PCs were thought to 
have too many bugs to work well for audio. Even 
if this were true in the past, it’s not true any-
more. Your decision between a Mac- or 
PC-based recording system should be based 
more on your personal preferences in computer 
platforms and the particular software that you 
intend to use rather than which one is more 
stable. Either platform may or may not be stable, 
depending on what you’re trying to do.
Choose the software that you want to use, and 
buy the computer that has the best track record 
for running that software. Some programs are 
available only for one platform or another. For 
example, Logic Audio and Digital Performer are 
Mac-only programs, and Nuendo and Sonor are 
only available for Windows PC users. Other pro-
grams, such as Pro Tools, are available for both 
Mac and Windows computers.
If you already have a computer or if you prefer 
one platform over another (PC or Mac), be sure 
to determine whether a program works on that 
platform before you buy it.

26
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 
in determining how smoothly (or how less-than-smoothly) your Digital Audio 
Workstation runs. The following list clues you in on the various pieces of 
hardware that you find in your computer:
 
✓ CPU: The CPU (processor) is the heart of your computer studio. The 
speed of your CPU ultimately dictates how well a program runs on it. As 
a general rule, for audio, get the fastest processor that you can afford. 
For most audio software, you need at least a Pentium IV 1.5 GHz or 
Athlon XP 1500 for the PC or a G5 for the Mac. But honestly, these 
requirements are the absolute minimum that you’ll need to use the soft-
ware programs. If you want a system that can handle the demands of 
recording or mixing many tracks (24 or more) you’ll need to step it up a 
notch or two and get a multi-processor computer for Mac or PC (and 
an Intel-based Mac, if you choose that platform). As well, I also suggest 
getting a computer that you can dedicate for recording audio only 
because running other types of applications (home finance software, 
word processors, or video games) can cause problems with your audio 
applications and reduce the stability of your system.
 
✓ Memory: Computer-based audio programs and all the associated plug-
ins are RAM (random-access memory) hogs. Here’s my advice: Get a lot 
of RAM. Okay, that’s not very specific, but how much you really need 
depends on your recording style. If you record a lot of audio tracks and 
want reverb or some effect on each track, you need more RAM (and a 
faster processor). If you record mainly MIDI tracks with instruments that 
already have the effects that you want, you can get by with less RAM 
(and a slower processor).
 
 For most software programs, the recommended minimum amount of 
RAM is 256MB (256 megabytes), although most programs run much 
more smoothly with 1GB or more. RAM is relatively inexpensive, so get 
as much as you can. I’m currently using 5GB of RAM, and at times I wish 
I had more.
 
 Regardless of the platform that you choose (PC or Mac), keep in mind 
that you can never have a processor that’s too fast or have too much 
memory.
 
✓ Hard drives: To record audio, make sure that you get the right type of 
hard drives. Notice that I said hard drives (plural). Yep, you should get 
more than one if you want to record more than a few tracks of audio. 
You need one hard drive for all the software and the operating system 
and another drive for the audio data. Having this setup greatly increases 
the likelihood that your system remains stable and doesn’t crash, 
especially if you try to run 16 or more tracks.
 
 As for the size of the hard drive, bigger is better, at least for the drive 
where you store your music. For the core system drive, you can get by 
with an 80GB (80-gigabyte) drive; for the audio drive, having even 120GB 

27
 Chapter 2: Getting the Right Gear
is pretty conservative because audio data can take up a ton of space. 
For example, a 5-minute song with 16 tracks recorded at 24 bits and a 
44.1-kHz sample rate takes up about 600MB of hard-drive space (that’s 
about 7.5MB per track minute). If you choose to record at 96 kHz, you 
can double this figure.
 
 Choose your hard drives wisely. For the software hard drive, you can get 
by with a stock drive (usually the one that comes with your computer). 
But for the audio side, you need a drive that can handle the demands of 
transferring audio data. Here are the main things to look for in an audio 
drive:
 
• Spindle speed: Also called rotational speed, this is the rate at 
which the hard drive spins. For the most part, a 7,200-rpm drive 
works well for recording and playing back audio.
 
• Seek time: This is the amount of time that it takes the drive to find 
the data that’s stored on it. You want an average seek time of less 
than 10 milliseconds.
 
• Buffer size: Often called a cache buffer, buffers are memory units 
that store data as it’s being transferred. According to the audio-
recording software manufacturers, you need a buffer size of at 
least 2MB (2 megabytes), but I recommend that you get a drive 
with at least an 8MB buffer.
 
• Interface type: Some audio-recording programs, such as Pro 
Tools, don’t interact well with USB 2.0–interfaced hard drives. I’ve 
also had problems with Logic Pro using a USB 2.0 hard drive, 
so I recommend that you go with either FireWire (400 or 800)- or 
eSATA-interfaced hard drives for best performance.
 
The track count that you get out of your system is directly related to the 
speed of your hard drive — the faster the drive, the more tracks you can 
record and play back at once. (Of course, the type of drive you get determines 
how large a role your processor plays.) My current choices include Fantom 
Drives products or a LaCie 7200-rpm ATA IDE hard drive with an 8-ms seek 
time and a 16MB cache buffer. A 320GB to 500GB drive currently costs 
about $140.
Getting the sound in and out
After you have a computer with enough speed and muscle (see the previous 
section in this chapter), you need the appropriate hardware to get the 
sound into and out of it. This requires a device called an audio interface. 

28
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 
Audio interfaces are available with three types of connection methods: PCI, 
FireWire, and USB. Here’s a quick rundown on the three types (the details 
are spelled out in the following sections):
 
✓ PCI: PCI interfaces are inserted into one of the PCI slots located inside 
your computer’s case.
 
✓ FireWire: FireWire interfaces connect to one of the FireWire ports in 
your computer.
 
✓ USB: USB interfaces connect to your computer — you guessed it — 
through one of the USB ports in your computer.
PCI interfaces
PCI is the old standard for getting audio into and out of a computer and has 
an advantage over the other interface types because of the fast transfer 
speed of PCI technology. This type of interface isn’t without its problems, 
which are as follows:
 
✓ Many computers (for example, laptops and all Macs except the Power 
Mac) don’t have a PCI slot.
 
✓ Because PCI technology is changing, all cards don’t fit in all computers, 
so make sure that the PCI interface that you’re considering can fit into 
your computer.
PCI interfaces come in the following varieties:
 
✓ Separate sound card with no analog inputs and outputs: In this case, 
you need to buy separate preamps, direct boxes, and AD (analog-to-
digital) and DA (digital-to-analog) converters. For most home recordists, 
the separate-sound-card route isn’t the best solution. In fact, even 
for the pros, this isn’t the most popular choice — so much so that 
this option is quickly falling from the marketplace. Figure 2-1 shows 
examples of PCI sound cards.
 
✓ Analog inputs and outputs within the card: Having the analog connec-
tion located in the card used to cause interference with the other 
components in the computer’s housing (such as fans and hard drives), 
which caused low-level hums in the recorded audio. (Not a sound you 
would want, I can assure you.) This is generally no longer the case 
unless you buy a really inexpensive card, but the bad rap led buyers to 
shy away from this approach and it has become uncommon as a result. 
You can find some less expensive audio interfaces configured this way, 
but the higher end of the market has generally abandoned it. Figure 2-2 
shows an example of a PCI card with analog connections.

29

computer.
 

30
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 
 
✓ Analog inputs and outputs housed in a separate box: This box is called 
a breakout box. Because of the low-level hum problems in the early 
interfaces, most manufacturers of PCI-based audio interfaces put their 
analog circuitry in a separate box with a cord attached to the PCI card. 
One advantage to this — besides eliminating the hum in early models — 
is that you can tweak the input and output levels without having to use 
a software menu. The dials for the levels are placed on the breakout box 
within easy reach, as shown in Figure 2-3.
 
If you have a laptop computer but can’t use a PCI-based system and you want 
the high transfer speed of PCI, you can buy an audio-interface card that uses 
the laptop’s PCMCIA card slot or a PCI express port. Of course, this only 
works if you have a laptop that’s equipped with a PCMCIA or PCI Express slot.
 
If you want to go the PCI route, make sure that your computer has PCI slots 
that are compatible with the PCI interface that you’re considering. For 
example, Lynx Studio PCI cards don’t work with the PCI slots that you find in 
the Mac G5 or Mac Intel computers.
Quite a few PCI-based audio interfaces are available, and they cost from a 
couple hundred dollars to a couple thousand dollars.
 
Figure 2-3: 
A PCI inter-
face with 
a breakout 
box for 
the analog 
components

preferred 
form of PCI 
interface.
 
FireWire interfaces
FireWire interfaces connect to the FireWire port in your computer. (Figure 2-4 
shows a typical FireWire interface.) FireWire ports come in two varieties: 
FireWire 400 and FireWire 800 (Chapter 3 has more on the differences 
between these two in terms of transfer speed), are inexpensive and are 
available on laptop computers as well as desktops, which makes FireWire 

31
 Chapter 2: Getting the Right Gear
interfaces more versatile than PCI-based systems. For example, you can 
easily move the interface from computer to computer. If you have a laptop 
and a desktop computer, using a FireWire interface allows you to switch 
between the two computers by simply moving the FireWire cable from one 
computer to the other. If you want to do some location recording, this is a big 
plus because you can take your interface and laptop to a great recording 
room, record the drums, for example, and then bring the audio back home 
for mixing and editing in your studio.
FireWire interfaces generally come with eight to ten inputs and outputs and 
cost from about $500 to $1,500.
 
When using a FireWire interface — and if you want a lot of inputs and/or 
outputs — a problem can arise if you also have a FireWire hard drive to which 
you want to record audio. Basically, having the FireWire interface and the 
FireWire hard drive on the same FireWire bus is asking for trouble, because 
you’re sure to reach the data-transfer limit of FireWire. So make sure that the 
two FireWire devices are on different buses (data channels).
 
Figure 2-4: 
A FireWire 
interface 
connects to 
the FireWire 
port in your 
computer.
 
USB interfaces
USB interfaces come in two varieties: those using USB 1.1 and those using 
USB 2.0. Both (see Figure 2-5) are handy because most computers have at 
least one USB port. These interfaces also represent a low-cost solution for 
people who need only a couple of inputs and outputs. The only problem with 
USB for recording audio is the relatively slow transfer speed when you use 
the USB 1.1 interfaces. This slower speed translates into higher latencies than 
those found with either FireWire or PCI interfaces. The latency is significant 
enough that you’re likely to hear it when you record.

32
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 
 
Figure 2-5: 
A USB 
interface

to your 
computer’s 
USB port.
 
To get around this deficit, most USB-interface manufacturers have incorpo-
rated some sort of “no latency” monitoring option. With such an option, you 
can record without hearing a delay between the tracks that you’ve already 
recorded and the one you’re currently recording. The problem is that with 
such an option, your newly recorded track gets placed out of synch with the 
previously recorded tracks. To correct the synchronization, you must move 
your overdubbed tracks within your song file. Admittedly, this process is 
pretty easy, but it takes time. (I explain how to correct synchronization in 
detail in Chapter 11.)
If you don’t want to deal with the latency in USB 1.1 interface–based systems, 
you should use a PCI, FireWire, or USB 2.0 interface.
USB interfaces can be found for under $200, and USB 2.0 interfaces currently 
cost about $500 or more.
Choosing the right software
When setting up a recording system, I always recommend that you start 
by exploring the software that you want to use. Whatever program you 
decide on will work better on one type of computer compared to another. 

33
 Chapter 2: Getting the Right Gear
By choosing the software first, you can use the software manufacturer’s 
guidelines to help you set up your computer. Most software is written for 
either a Mac or a PC and will have been tested with a variety of hardware 
configurations. Unless you’re very computer savvy, I recommend starting 
with a system that’s been tested to run smoothly with the program that 
you’re interested in.
For the most part, audio-production software falls into the following two 
categories:
 
✓ Audio-recording programs: These programs allow you to record 
numerous tracks (the number depends on the program) and let you edit, 
equalize, and mix those tracks as well as add effects.
 
✓ MIDI-sequencing programs: These programs allow you to record MIDI 
performance data (without the sounds) and edit and mix the data. The 
difference between audio and MIDI recording is covered in detail in 
Chapter 5.
 
Most audio-production programs offer both audio and MIDI recording and 
generally do a good job of both (and they’re getting better all the time), but 
some entry-level programs allow you to either record audio or do MIDI 
sequencing. If your budget is limited and you want to record using both audio 
and MIDI, make sure that your chosen software allows you to do this. That 
said, choose the program based on its features and whether it fits with your 
working style.
Researching a program you’re interested in
If you already own a computer and you want to get some audio-recording or 
sequencing software to go with it, do the following research on the software 
you’re interested in:
 
✓ Find out the product’s compatibility with your system: Visit the soft-
ware manufacturer’s Web site for information about whether your 
system will work with that program as well as what additional hardware 
you may need to get the software up and running.
 
✓ Find out what other users are saying: On the Internet, you can find an 
online discussion board for each of the major audio-recording software 
programs. Before you buy a program, go to the sites of the choices that 
interest you and see what people are saying about the program. Ask 
questions and explore the issues that other people are having with the 
program. Doing so can save you lots of time dealing with bugs in your 
system and allow you to record a lot more music. You can find these 
sites by using the product name as the keyword in your favorite search 
engine or by checking out the Internet forums that I list in Chapter 18.

 One great way to see whether a particular program is right for you is 
to find out what people who play your type of music are using. For 
instance, a lot of people who compose with synthesizers and MIDI use 
Logic Audio because using MIDI and software synthesizers is quick 
and easy in this program. They also don’t need a bunch of hardware 
synthesizers to get the sounds they want, which saves space in their 
studio and saves money because they can bypass the hardware to get 
their synthesizer sounds.
Checking out some popular programs
You can choose from numerous music-production software programs, 
including the ones in the following list:
 
✓ Apple (www.apple.com): Makes Logic Pro Audio and Logic Express. 
These programs run on both PC and Mac systems. Logic Pro Audio has 
been around for a while and is one of the top programs available. The 
downside is that it’s for Macs only. Like all the programs, Logic has its 
way of working — some people like it while others have a hard time 
grasping the way the user interface functions. (I love it.)
 
✓ Cakewalk (www.cakewalk.com): Makes SONAR, and SONAR XL, , 
among other programs. These are designed to run on a PC. SONAR 
is a redesigned version of Cakewalk Pro Audio (some would say a 
completely new program). SONAR does a great job of recording (and 
editing and mixing) both audio and MIDI.
 
✓ Digidesign (www.digidesign.com): Makes Pro Tools, Pro Tools LE 
and Pro Tools M-Powered. These programs work on both Mac and PC 
systems. Digidesign’s Pro Tools TDM systems (the company offers 
several versions) are arguably the standard for digital audio in pro 
studios, although more pro studios are using any one (or more) of the 
other programs that I list in this section.
 
✓ Mark of the Unicorn (www.motu.com): Makes Digital Performer. This 
program requires a Mac to run. Digital Performer is a powerful program 
that does MIDI and audio equally well. One advantage of this program is 
that MOTU makes very good audio interfaces that are designed to work 
well with its software. You end up with a better chance of having a 
system that is stable.
 
✓ Sony Creative Software (www.sonycreativesoftware.com): Makes 
Sound Forge, Vegas Audio, and Acid. These programs only run on 
Windows PCs. Acid is a very popular program that is strong in loop-
based recording. As a result, a lot of hip-hop and techno artists use this 
program.
 
✓ Steinberg (www.steinberg.net): Makes Nuendo, Cubase, WaveLab, 
and Cubasis. These programs run on both Mac and PC platforms. 
Nuendo is Steinberg’s best program, and it is excellent for recording 
audio. Nuendo is not very strong in MIDI sequencing, so if this feature is 

35
 Chapter 2: Getting the Right Gear
important to you, this may not be the best program to use. In that case, 
if you like the Steinberg line, you may want to try Cubase, which is a 
great program that’s on par with SONAR, Logic, and the others and is 
stronger in MIDI sequencing than Nuendo.
Most of these manufacturers offer program demos that you can download 
for free to see whether you like them. These demos work just like the full 
versions except that you generally can’t save or print your work.
 
Some of these manufacturers also make audio-interface/sound-card hardware 
optimized for their systems; this hardware can generally work on other 
systems (check with the manufacturer to make sure). You may find an easy 
and great-sounding solution by choosing a software and hardware setup from 
a single manufacturer. If you do, you are likely to have fewer compatibility 
problems.
Studio-in-a-Box Systems
Integrated mixers/recorders/effects processors have become quite common. 
Cassette porta-studios, first introduced in 1970s, enabled the home recordist 
to compose music at home without spending a fortune on equipment. But it 
wasn’t until the Roland VS-880 came out in 1997 that great-quality recordings 
could be made at home using a single piece of equipment. Okay, you still 
needed an instrument and microphone to plug into it, but everything else fit 
into this one little box, which is now referred to as a studio-in-a-box system.
Taking a look at the benefits
One of the biggest advantages of using a studio-in-a-box (SIAB) system is that 
you don’t need to be computer literate — just turn it on and start to record. 
SIAB systems are also portable — you can take them almost anywhere to 
record, so you’re not limited to just your studio room. (You can get a view of 
an SIAB system in Figure 2-6.) Think about this for a second: If you want a big 
drum sound and all you have is a small converted bedroom for a studio, you 
can load up your SIAB system, a few microphones, and your drummer’s drum 
set (don’t forget the drummer) and go to an empty warehouse, gymnasium, 
or church, for example. (Of course, you can do this with a laptop computer 
system, but it’ll cost you more.) In fact, if you’re inventive, you don’t even 
need to have electricity to do this. Most of these recorders draw very little 
power and can be hooked up to a solar panel or battery. (You have to 
figure out how to do this, but a quick search on the Internet should give you 
some ideas.)

Early versions of SIAB systems were somewhat limited in what they offered 
and weren’t very user-friendly when it came to adding more effects (although 
they’re easy to synch). The new generation of SIAB systems is being designed 
to accept third-party effects — for example, the Roland VS machines (such 
as the VS-2000CD) accept third-party plug-ins — and other options, such as 
an expansion board that lets you use a computer monitor and mouse. They 
can also import and export audio files in formats that you can open on other 
manufacturers’ recorders, freeing you to transfer files between different 
systems.
Examining some popular SIAB systems
Many of the major recording manufacturers make SIAB systems. Check out 
these companies and compare the specifications of each unit:
 
✓ Boss (www.bossus.com): Boss is the entry-level line made by Roland 
(read more about Roland later in this section). Boss makes several basic 
all-in-one recorders, such as the 8-track BR-600 and the 16-track BR-1600, 
which are inexpensive and easy to use. These units record in 16 bits at a 
44.1-kHz sample rate.

37
 Chapter 2: Getting the Right Gear
 
✓ Fostex (www.fostex.com): Fostex has been in the hard-drive recording 
business for a while — although not as long as Akai — and Fostex 
has released several SIAB devices in the last few years. Currently, its 
top-of-the-line SIAB system is the MR16HD/CD 16-track recorder. The 
Fostex units have a lot of features, but they are limited to recording at 
16 bits — a real drawback for serious recording. Still, for their prices, 
these units are a good value.
 
✓ Korg (www.korg.com): Korg has quite a few recorders, from basic units 
such as the D888 8-track unit to the full-featured D3200 32-track 
recorder. The Korg units sound good — they all record in 24 bits — and 
are easy to use.
 
✓ Roland (www.rolandus.com): Roland defined the SIAB recorder with 
its VS-880 in 1997. The company currently offers several SIAB systems, 
including the new flagship VS-2480 24-track recorder. Roland has the 
largest user base of all the SIAB systems, so if user support is important 
to you, you can’t go wrong with one of Roland’s machines. These 
units record at 24 bits but use a compression scheme that reduces the 
file sizes.
 
✓ TASCAM (www.tascam.com): TASCAM has been in the home recording 
market for a long time, first with cassette porta-studios in the 1970s and 
now with digital systems. You can find several units, including the DP-02 
8-track recorder, which records at 16 bits, and the 2488 24-track 
recorder, which records in 24 bits.
 
✓ Yamaha (www.yamaha.com): Yamaha currently has two SIAB systems: 
the AW1600 and the AW2400. Both are 16-track recorders that have 
excellent sound quality. The AW2400 allows you to record up to 16 
tracks at the same time, whereas the AW1600 allows you to record only 
up to 8 tracks at once. Yamaha is the first SIAB system manufacturer to 
develop a third-party card for its expansion slots. Both units record in 
16 or 24 bits.
Stand-alone Recorders
The first affordable stand-alone digital recorder to hit the market was the 
Alesis ADAT (which stands for Alesis Digital Audio Tape) in 1992. This 
machine revolutionized home recording, making it possible for the home 
recordist to make some pretty high-quality recordings without having to 
spend a fortune. Many commercial studios used ADATs as well. In fact, a lot 
of hit records from the mid-to-late 1990’s were recorded on ADATs. The 
ADAT uses digital tape cartridges, which look much like VHS videotapes, and 
they function much like analog tapes. And like analog tapes, the digital tape 
cartridges have limited editing capabilities. (For more details on editing, see 
Chapter 13.)

38
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 
Stand-alone digital recorders are the least common type of home studio 
recorder because they require a separate mixer and other outboard gear, 
such as external effects units or preamps. This makes the cost of this type of 
system higher than a comparable number of tracks that you get in a studio-
in-a-box or computer-based system. The advantage is that you can swap out 
these recorders as newer models come out without having to update your 
whole system. This is one reason why stand-alone recorders are so popular 
in commercial studios. Figure 2-7 shows a typical stand-alone recorder.
The following major manufacturers produce stand-alone hard-drive 
recorders:
 
✓ Alesis (www.alesis.com): Alesis makes the 24-track HD24 and HD24XR 
hard-drive recorders. These units are the company’s follow-up to the 
hugely popular ADAT recorders of the nineties.
 
✓ TASCAM (www.tascam.com): TASCAM makes the DA-98HR 8-track 
recorder and the flagship X-48 48-track workstation. The DA-98HR 
is a basic recorder, but the X-48 is a hybrid that allows you to connect 
the recorder to your computer for all the editing and plug-in power 
contained in computer-based systems.
These stand-alone units cost from about $1,500 to $2,000 or more. You also 
have to buy other necessary gear, such as mixers and signal processors, 
separately, which raises the overall cost of these systems considerably.
 
Because these companies’ product offerings are constantly changing, your 
best bet is to check out each of these manufacturers’ Web sites and compare 
their specifications. The next step would be to try a demo of each product 
that has the features that you want to see whether you like the way that they 
sound. Also, be sure to check out the compatibility of the system with other 
systems, if that’s important to you.

 Chapter 2: Getting the Right Gear
Analyzing Analog
Analog recording has definitely taken a backseat to digital. This is mainly a 
bang-for-the-buck thing. For just slightly more money than you would pay for 
a cassette 4-track recorder, you can get a digital 4-track unit that produces 
a far superior sound. And for a lot less than the cost of a full-blown pro 
analog setup, you can achieve the same-quality product using a digital 
system. (Of course, you still need great songs, top-notch engineering skills, 
and pricey outboard gear.) In spite of this, you may as well know what your 
options are for analog recording.
Open-reel multitracks
The standard for multitrack recording 25 years ago was the open-reel (reel-
to-reel) tape deck. These recorders came in 4-, 8-, 16-, and 24-track configura-
tions. They produced varying levels of sound quality, depending on the 
width of the tape. Semipro recorders used narrower tape (half-inch and 
1-inch for 16 tracks), which have more background noise such as hiss, 
whereas pro recorders used a wider 2-inch tape that, in the hands of a good 
engineer, created a world-class sound.
The semipro reel-to-reel multitrack recorders have mostly been superseded 
by digital hard-drive recorders because the digital recorder is less expensive 
and better sounding. The wide-format (2-inch) reel-to-reel recorders, on the 
other hand, are still in use in many top-notch commercial studios. In fact, 
many great albums are still being recorded using these systems. The down-
side to the wide-format-tape multitrack units is that they’re prohibitively 
expensive to buy and maintain for the home recordist.
If you’re in the market for a used narrow-format multitrack recorder because 
you just gotta have analog (see the nearby sidebar “Oh, how I yearn for that 
analog sound”), know that you not only need to be proficient in good engi-
neering practices, but you also need to be able to maintain the recorder — 
align and clean the heads, for instance, and perform other housecleaning 
chores. If you can’t do this yourself, you need to have the bucks to hire 
someone to do it for you. Also, finding analog tape is getting more difficult. 
In fact, anything but 1/4-inch, 1/2-inch (both for mastering decks), and 2-inch 
tapes are nearly impossible to find new, and even these sizes (1/4-inch, 
1/2-inch, and 2-inch) are getting hard to find.

40
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 
Analog goodies
So you find that you gotta have that analog sound, too, but you don’t want to 
(or can’t) deal with the expense of a complete analog system. Well, you’re in 
luck! Do I have a deal for you! You, too, can add some of the warmth to your 
digital recordings if you’re willing to shell out the green. Yep, come on down 
and I’ll set you up!
Seriously, you can buy some analog extras to help you add a little of that 
analog distortion to your music. Don’t get me wrong; many of these 
products are great and have a place in a home studio. Just don’t get so 
hooked by the need to have warmth in your recordings that you go out 
and buy everything that you can to add mild distortion. This warmth is just 
distortion, after all.
Oh, how I yearn for that analog sound
An interesting trend in digital recording is the 
quest for analog sound. In the marketplace, you 
find new pieces of gear being marketed as 
having warmth or a vintage sound. What exactly 
is this sound?
This sound is . . . (wait for it) . . . distortion. Yep, 
good ol’ noise and distortion. Why would some-
one want to duplicate that now?
When the mild distortion that’s inherent in good 
analog recordings was eliminated in digital 
recordings, we missed it (sigh). In analog 
recording, you find a technique that’s used to 
add something wonderful and beautifully pleas-
ing to a recording: tape saturation. This is 
caused by recording the sound onto a tape 
recorder at a high enough level that the tape 
becomes saturated (hence the term tape satu-
ration), and certain aspects of the sound 
change.
For the most part, tape saturation adds even 
harmonics to the sound. Not to get too techni-
cal, but these are the tones present in the music 
but, for the most part, are hidden behind the 
main tone. Tape saturation brings those tones 
out just a little, and we find them pleasing to 
listen to. Tape saturation also mellows out the 
high frequencies by smearing them together a 
little. Without this sound, many listeners (cer-
tainly not all) find digital recordings somewhat 
harsh or cold. In case you didn’t know, these 
are highly technical terms meaning, “I don’t 
hear that thing I’m used to hearing in an analog 
recording.”
Digital recording can’t duplicate this sound 
exactly. (However, some units, such as the 
Cranesong HEDD converter/processor and the 
PSP Audioware Vintage Warmer plug-in, come 
close. More on these later in this chapter.) If 
you try to use the tape-saturation technique 
with a digital recorder (by overriding the input 
levels), all you get is more harshness and a hor-
rible clipping sound. (The sound is clipped off by 
the digital converters, and you hear crackles 
and clicks.)

41
 Chapter 2: Getting the Right Gear
Most of the time, people use tube gear on their instruments to get them to 
sound warmer. (Sounds like California surfer lingo, dude.) In sound record-
ing, tube gear refers to components that still use the ancient technology of 
vacuum tubes to get them up and running — and up and running with 
all that distortion that some listeners describe as warm. Tube microphones, 
preamps, compressors, and equalizers are only a few of the types of products 
available to add some semblance of the much-sought-after analog sound.
 
If you want to go tubeless, look for special tape-saturation emulators on 
the market to give you that analog edge. See the section “Tape-saturation 
emulators,” later in this chapter, for more info.
The tube stuff
Vacuum-tube microphones, preamps, compressors, and equalizers have been 
around for decades. In fact, before solid-state (transistor) technology was 
developed, everything electronic had vacuum tubes in it — both good-quality 
and bad-quality audio gear. Vacuum-tube equipment definitely had a sound 
to it, and tube technology definitely had its limitations — the main one being 
the coloration that was added to the music. This coloration is highly sought 
after in today’s world of digital recording (see the sidebar “Oh, how I yearn 
for that analog sound,” earlier in this chapter), so the tube stuff has become 
increasingly popular.
 
To get the pleasing analog distortion that’s so popular today, you don’t need 
to buy gear with vacuum-tube circuitry. Some top-quality solid-state gear can 
get you the same sound as the vintage tube stuff. In fact, some of the most 
sought-after vintage preamps, equalizers, and compressors — particularly 
those bearing the “Neve” name — are solid state, and they still have a beauti-
fully colored (distorted) sound. So, when you go in search of the tube sound 
for your studio, remember that you can get the sound you’re after without 
having to buy actual vacuum-tube gear.
 
Not all “tube” gear produces a pleasing sound. Sometimes the distortion that a 
piece of gear adds to your music creates more noise and mud (lack of clarity 
in the sound) than it adds warmth. Be sure to listen to the equipment that 
you’re interested in before you buy it. Make your purchase decision based on 
how you like the way the equipment sounds for your particular music. Do 
your homework before adding any tube gear — or any new equipment that 
you spend your hard-earned money on. Read reviews and specifications, talk 
to people, and above all, listen to the equipment before you buy.

42
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 
 
Many audio-recording retailers allow you a certain amount of time after you 
buy a piece of equipment to return it if you don’t like it. Of course, you have 
to pay for it before you leave the store, but you usually get some time in 
which you can return it. Ask your music retailer to be sure of its return policy 
before you buy.
Tape-saturation emulators
The new great thing in audio recording is the analog tape emulator, also 
known as a tape-saturation emulator. These units are designed to add the 
characteristics that you get from recording high levels onto tape, such as the 
mild distortion that analog aficionados love (see the sidebar “Oh, how I yearn 
for that analog sound,” earlier in this chapter). You can find both stand-alone 
analog emulators and plug-ins for your computer-based system. These can be 
expensive (over $2,000 in some cases), but many pros swear by them. As I 
write this book, this technology is in its infancy, so expect the prices to drop 
dramatically and the choices to expand exponentially over the next few 
years.
Since the second edition of this book was published a few years ago, one 
really decent tape-saturation plug-in for computer-based systems has 
appeared. This emulator, called the Vintage Warmer (www.pspaudioware.
com), can add some pleasing distortion to your tracks for about $150. If you 
use it, be careful not to overdo it. It is easy to use too much saturation and 
ruin an otherwise good track.
Reality check
Do you need any tube or analog emulator gear in your studio? The short 
answer is: No, you don’t. You can make great recordings without any of this 
stuff. All you need is an instrument, a microphone, a mixer, a recorder, and 
some monitors — oh, and some good, solid engineering skills.
What really counts is your music. People who listen to music don’t care 
whether you use (insert gotta-have gear here) to record your masterpiece. All 
they care about is whether they like the music. So don’t make yourself nuts 
(or go broke) over any of this stuff.
Exploring Sample Setups
In the following sections, I help you get some ideas about the best system 
configuration for your needs. Whether you’re an electronic musician who 
only needs a sequencer, some MIDI instruments, and a 2-track recorder 

43
 Chapter 2: Getting the Right Gear
or you’re a purist who wants 16 tracks of simultaneous recording and 
needs dozens of microphones to record your whole band live, I help you 
figure it out.
Because I don’t know what type of recording you want to do, I outline three 
basic systems to give you an idea of what may work for you. You can see a 
system that works well for both live recording and MIDI sequencing, a system 
for MIDI sequencing and the occasional instrument or vocal overdub, and a 
live rig that contains little or no MIDI instrumentation. This is only a starting 
point, but as you shop around for a system, you’ll be able to find a setup that 
best meets your needs.
 
You can configure your home recording system in almost unlimited ways. Part 
of what will influence your decisions is your initial budget and how you like to 
work. Look around and talk to other people who have a home studio. Join an 
Internet forum and discover the different ways that people are recording — 
find out what works for them and what doesn’t. (Check out Chapter 18 for 
some great resources on the Internet.) Then jump in and don’t look back. The 
most important component in your studio is you!
Live and MIDI studio
The live and MIDI studio is your best choice if you want to incorporate both 
MIDI-sequenced parts and live instruments (such as guitar, electric bass, 
and drums). For this type of system, you need a recorder, a mixer, and a 
MIDI controller. You also need a few microphones and any instruments that 
you plan to record — generally at least one synthesizer or sound module, an 
electric guitar and bass, and a drum machine or real drum set. Figure 2-8 
illustrates a setup that’s centered around an SIAB recorder with a computer 
for sequencing. Of course, you could use a stand-alone recorder instead 
(you need a separate mixer), or you can incorporate the whole system into a 
computer if you choose.
You want a system with a fair amount of tracks (at least 8) that allows you to 
record at least 2 tracks of MIDI instruments as well as several tracks of guitar, 
bass, drums, and vocals.

 Chapter 2: Getting the Right Gear
MIDI-intensive studio
Are you a one-man band? Do you prefer to program a performance rather 
than to play it? If so, you may want to have a MIDI-intensive studio. The 
advantage of the MIDI studio is that one person can “play” many instruments 
at the same time. A disadvantage is that the music can sound somewhat stiff. 
(See Chapter 12 for advice on how to overcome this.) And you may lose 
touch with what it feels like to play with other musicians, which is not always 
a bad thing, especially if you’re into that whole reclusive artist thing.
Because MIDI instruments can be programmed to play the part perfectly, 
with all the dynamic variations that you want, you can spend your time work-
ing on the parts (composing, setting levels, and creating effects) without 
actually having to record them. As a result, you can get by with fewer audio 
tracks in your system, but you need to have more MIDI tracks available. An 
advantage to this approach is that MIDI tracks take less CPU power and RAM 
to run compared to the same number of audio tracks. So, you can get by with 
a less expensive computer (or use the one you already have) and save your 
bucks for more synthesizers or plug-ins.
For a MIDI-intensive studio, such as the one shown in Figure 2-9, you need a 
sequencer (a device that allows you to record and play back MIDI perfor-
mance information) and at least one sound source. This can be a keyboard 
synthesizer, sound module, sampler, or a computer equipped with sounds, 
called soft-synths. You also need a drum machine or drum sounds in your 
computer if you intend to make any music other than ambient or classical-
type music. In addition, you need a MIDI controller to, well, control these 
sound sources. This, too, could be part of the computer software, or it 
could be the synthesizer. Check out Chapter 5 for more on MIDI controllers. 
If you end up using a computer-based sequencer, you’ll also need a MIDI 
interface.
In addition to the MIDI stuff, you need some sort of recorder. Again, this can 
be included in your computer setup. If you plan to sequence all the parts 
and don’t want to include any vocals, you could get by with a decent 2-track 
recorder. On the other hand, if you see yourself including vocals or any 
non-MIDI instruments — such as an electric guitar, for example — you need a 
microphone (for the vocals) and the ability to record more tracks.

 Chapter 2: Getting the Right Gear
Live studio
Thirty years ago, when a band wanted to record, the members all went into 
a studio together, set up their gear in one large room (with maybe a few 
dividers between them), and played as if they were at a concert. Then they 
would overdub a guitar solo, backup vocals, and maybe a few percussion 
instruments.
The beauty of this type of recording for a band is that you have a better 
chance of capturing the magic of a live performance. The disadvantage is 
that it takes a little more recording skill to get a good sound. (Of course, you 
discover many of these skills in this book.)
For the live studio, you need a recorder with at least as many available 
simultaneous tracks as you think you need for your band. Eight tracks are 
usually enough for most bands. The tracks would break down as follows:
 
✓ Rhythm guitar: 1 track
 
✓ Bass guitar: 1 track
 
✓ Piano, organ, or synthesizer: 1 or 2 tracks
 
✓ Rough vocals: 1 track
 
 You generally record this track over again after the rest are done to get 
a cleaner track.
 
✓ Drums: 2–4 tracks
 
 The number of tracks varies depending on the type of sound that 
you want. You may need a separate mixer to create a submix of the 
drums if you’re only using 2 tracks. (For more on submixes, check out 
Chapter 14.)
Aside from the simultaneous track count, you probably want some extra 
tracks available to record a guitar solo, some background vocals, and maybe 
some percussion instruments. In this case, a 16-track recorder is a great 
solution. If you want more flexibility in getting your band’s sound, you could 
get a recorder that can record as many as 16 simultaneous tracks.
Figure 2-10 shows a system that can work well for live recording. This setup 
is illustrated using a stand-alone recorder. The reason for this is that most 
stand-alone recorders can record all their available tracks simultaneously. 
With this system, you need a separate mixer and all the cords to connect 
them. (Check out Chapter 3 for more details on cords.)

If you’re one of those many people who like to record 1 or 2 tracks at a time 
but still want to play all the instruments live (with no MIDI sequencing), your 
need for lots of simultaneous tracks is reduced. An SIAB system is probably 
your best solution because it costs less and takes up less space.
You can also use a computer-based system to record all the instruments live. 
Just make sure that you have both the inputs and available tracks that you 
need.
 
If you record all the instruments live (all at once or one at a time), you also 
need to get enough microphones and mic stands. And you have to contend 
with making your room conducive to recording live instruments (I discuss this 
more in Chapter 3).
With the many ways to configure a home recording system, you’ll probably 
lean more toward one type of system than another (computer-based, SIAB, or 
stand-alone). Then it’s just a matter of weeding through the options until you 
find one that resonates with you (and your budget).

O
kay, so you’re ready to turn that spare bedroom or basement into a 
recording studio. You need to unpack all your shiny new gear and get 
it plugged in properly, and you need to get your room to work for you. This 
involves creating an efficient place to work, but above all, it means getting 
your room to sound good. This can be tricky; after all, pro studios spend tons 
of time and money getting their studios to sound great. You’re going to need 
to do the same. You may not need to spend a ton of money (as if you could), 
but you do need to spend some time.
After you decide on a space for your home recording system, the next steps 
involve setting up the system and getting your space to work for you. In 
this chapter, I help you make sense of all those analog or digital connectors 
and help you get them all plugged in properly. You probably have experi-
ence with analog connectors and cords, such as the ones on your stereo 
system. But you may have never come in contact with digital connectors, 
unless you’ve plugged a DVD player into your TV or had a chance to go into a 
recording studio using digital gear.
This chapter also shows you how to find the best way for you to work in your 
environment, with a fair measure of tips and tricks thrown in to make your 
room sound as good as possible.

Understanding Analog Connections
You’ve probably had a chance to see and use a variety of analog connec-
tors. If you play a guitar or keyboard (synthesizer), for example, you’re 
familiar with a 1/4-inch analog plug. Some microphones use an XLR analog 
plug. Keeping all these connectors straight can be a little confusing: Why do 
you have to use one plug for one thing and another for something else? And 
what’s a TRS plug, anyway?
Read on to discover the most common analog connectors: 1/4-inch (mono/TS 
and stereo/TRS), XLR, and RCA.
The 1/4-inch analog plug
The 1/4-inch plug is the most common audio connector and one of the most 
versatile. These plugs come in two varieties: mono/TS and stereo/TRS.
Mono/TS
The plug on a cord that you use for your guitar or synthesizer is an example 
of a mono 1/4-inch plug. The mono part of the name refers to the fact that you 
have only one channel with which to send the signal. This type of plug is also 
referred to as a TS plug (short for Tip/Sleeve). The tip is the end of the plug, 
and the sleeve is the rest of the metal part. A plastic divider separates these 
two sections. Check out Figure 3-1 to see this familiar plug.
 
Figure 3-1: 
A typical 
1/4-inch 
plug used 
for guitar 
and other 
electric 
instruments. 
TS plugs are used for a variety of purposes — to go from your guitar to your 
guitar amp, from your synthesizer to your mixer, from your mixer to your 
power amplifier (amp), and from your power amp to your speakers. You 
would expect that one cord could work for all these applications. After all, a 
TS plug is a TS plug, right? Well, not really. The same plug can be wired dif-
ferently, and it can carry different levels of power. For example, here are the 
differences between instrument and speaker cords:

53
 Chapter 3: Getting Connected: Setting Up Your Studio
 
✓ Instrument cord (the one you use for your synthesizer or guitar): This 
cord contains one wire and a shield — the wire is connected to the 
tip, and the shield is connected to the sleeve. You need the instrument 
cable’s shield to minimize noise. If you use a speaker cord (discussed 
next) for your instrument, you may end up with some noise (that is, you 
may hear a hiss or a buzz — or even a radio station — coming out of 
your amp or coming from where you’ve plugged in your instrument).
 
 Instrument cords are often called unbalanced lines because of the way 
that they’re wired. An unbalanced cord has one wire surrounded by a 
braided shield; the wire is connected to the tip of the TS plug, and the 
shield is connected to the sleeve. The signal is sent through the wire, and 
the shield is used for the ground. (It keeps the noise down.) You can also 
find balanced lines, which I explain in the next section of this chapter.
 
✓ A speaker cord: This cord contains two wires and no shield — one wire 
is connected to the tip and the other to the sleeve. The speaker cord 
carries a lot more current (power) than the instrument cable. This is the 
reason that it doesn’t have a shield. The signal level covers noise that’s 
present in the cord. Because you have much less current present in an 
instrument, you don’t want to use a speaker cord for your instrument.
 
When buying cords with TS plugs, first be sure to look at (or ask about) what 
purpose the cord is designed for. Then, when you get the cord home, be sure 
to make a note of what type it is so that you use it correctly. You can mark your 
cord in a number of ways: You can put colored tape on it (red for speaker or blue 
for instrument, for example), put a tag on it, or — gasp — dot it with nail polish.
 
You generally don’t need to worry about which end of the cord you plug 
into your instrument — the signal can travel equally well in either direction. 
However, you can buy cords that are designed to send the current in one 
direction. (This cord has an arrow on it, designating in which direction the 
signal should flow.) I call these designer cords, and two of the most common 
brands are Monster and Planet Waves. The theory behind these cords is 
that they do a better job of preserving the sound qualities of the instrument 
for which they’re designed. These cords are specifically designed for almost 
every instrument and application known to man.
Stereo/TRS
A stereo/TRS (short for Tip/Ring/Sleeve) 1/4-inch plug looks like a stereo head-
phone plug (take a look at Figure 3-2). The tip is the end of the plug, the ring 
is the small middle section located between the two plastic dividers, and the 
sleeve is the rest of the metal part of the plug. A TRS plug can be used for the 
following three types of cords:
 
✓ Stereo cord: A stereo cord is used for signals that contain two separate 
portions: one for the right channel and the other for the left channel. 
This type of cord is generally wired with the left-channel signal attached 
to the tip, the right-channel signal connected to the ring, and the shield 
wired to the sleeve. This type of cord is typically used for headphones.

54
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 
 
Figure 3-2: 
Use a 
balanced 
(TRS) plug 
to connect 
professional 
audio gear.
 
 
✓ Balanced cord: A balanced cord is used on professional audio gear 
to join the various pieces of equipment (to connect the mixer to the 
recorder, for example). The advantage with a balanced cord is that you 
can have longer cord runs without creating noise.
 
 Why are balanced cords so conveniently noise free? The balanced 
cord has two wires and a shield inside and has the same signal running 
through both wires. One signal is 180 degrees out of phase with the 
other (that is, their waveforms are opposite one another), and when the 
signals get to the mixer (or whatever they’re plugged into), one of the 
signals is flipped and added to the other. When this happens, any noise 
that built up in the signal is canceled out.
 
✓ Y cord: A Y cord consists of a TRS plug on one end and two TS plugs on 
the other, forming — you guessed it — a nice representation of the letter 
Y. This cord allows you to insert an effect processor — a compressor or 
equalizer, for example — in the line of a mixer (more specifically, into 
the insert jack of the mixer). Check out Chapter 4 for details on mixers. 
The TRS plug both sends and receives a signal. This cord is wired so 
that the tip sends the signal and the ring receives it (see Figure 3-3). The 
sleeve is connected to the shield of each cable.

XLR
The XLR connector is used for microphones and some line connections 
between professional gear. This cable has a female and a male end (see 
Figure 3-4). The cord is wired much like a TRS connector and is balanced 
to minimize noise. The XLR microphone cable is also called a low Z cable 
because it carries a low-impedance signal.

RCA
RCA plugs — named for good old RCA and also called phono plugs — are 
common on home stereos and on some semipro audio gear (see Figure 3-5). 
They function much like a TS plug but aren’t very common in professional 
audio equipment. However, you find them on some mixers so that you can 
connect a tape deck. They are also used for digital S/PDIF signals (see the 
next section for more details on these babies).

Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 
Delving into Digital Connections
If you’re going to record using a digital recorder or mixer, you’re going to 
run into digital connectors (plugs and cables/cords). Digital audio equip-
ment is a recent invention, and as such, no one standard has emerged. 
Because of this lack of standardization, a variety of digital connection meth-
ods are on the market, only a few (or one) of which may be on the equip-
ment that you own or intend to purchase. Regardless, knowing about the 
most common types of connectors and their purposes can help you decide 
what equipment is right for you.
MIDI
MIDI, short for Musical Instrument Digital Interface, is a handy communica-
tion protocol that allows musical information to pass from one device to 
another. To allow the free passage of such information, MIDI jacks are located 
on a whole host of electronic instruments. Synthesizers, drum machines, 
sound modules, and even some guitars have MIDI jacks. And, to connect all 
these instruments, you need some MIDI cables. The MIDI connector contains 
five pins (male) that plug into the female MIDI jack (port) on the instrument 
or device (see Figure 3-6).
 
Figure 3-6:

connectors

male ends.

AES/EBU
AES/EBU (Audio Engineering Society/European Broadcasting Union) cables 
are much like S/PDIF cables (described in the next section). The AES/EBU 
standards require these cables to transmit two channels of data at a time. 

57
 Chapter 3: Getting Connected: Setting Up Your Studio
They differ from S/PDIF cables in that they consist of XLR plugs and use bal-
anced cables. (Figure 3-7 shows what the inputs look like on the recording 
equipment.) AES/EBU was developed to be used with professional audio com-
ponents, hence the use of balanced cords — the kinds used in professional-
level equipment.
 
Figure 3-7: 
S/PDIF and 
AES/EBU 
connectors

same as 
analog RCA 
(S/PDIF) and

DIGITAL I/O-A
OUT
S/PDIF
S/PDIF (short for Sony/Phillips Digital Interface Format) cables consist of an 
unbalanced coaxial cable (one wire and a shield) and RCA plugs. (Figure 3-7 
shows what the inputs look like on the machine.) These cables can also be 
made from fiber-optic cable and a Toslink connector. The S/PDIF format can 
transmit two channels of digital data at one time. S/PDIF protocols are similar 
to AES/EBU standards, except that S/PDIF was originally designed for the con-
sumer market — which explains why unbalanced cords are used. In spite of 
being developed for the consumer market, S/PDIF connectors are found on a 
lot of pro recording gear along with (or instead of) AES/EBU.
 
If you want to use cords that are longer than 3–4 feet when using an S/PDIF 
connector — or about 15 feet for AES/EBU connectors — your best bet is to 
use video or digital audio cables. Regular audio cables degrade the sound at 
longer distances because they can’t transmit the type of signal that digital 
produces without affecting the quality of the sound. If you use audio cables 
for longer distances, you lose some of the sound’s definition. Some people 
describe this sound as “grainy.”

58
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 
ADAT Lightpipe
The ADAT (Alesis Digital Audio Tape) Lightpipe format allows eight tracks 
of digital audio to be sent at once. Developed by Alesis, ADAT Lightpipe 
(or simply Lightpipe for short) has become a standard among digital audio 
products. It consists of a fiber-optic cable that uses a special connector 
developed by Alesis.
TDIF
TDIF (Teac Digital Interface Format) is Teac’s return volley to the ADAT 
Lightpipe format. TDIF uses a standard computer cable with a 25-pin connec-
tor. Like the ADAT Lightpipe, TDIF cables can transmit eight channels of digi-
tal data at a time. TDIF isn’t nearly as common as ADAT Lightpipe because 
Alesis made its Lightpipe technology available to other companies to use for 
free. Alesis encouraged these companies to adopt it as a “standard” because 
the Alesis ADAT recorders were so common.
USB
USB, which stands for Universal Serial Bus, is a common component in nearly 
all modern computers. In fact, your computer probably has more than one 
USB port. In case it’s been a while since you’ve had to use your USB connec-
tion, take a look at Figure 3-8. As you can see, USB has the following different 
plugs that fit different jacks:
 
✓ Rectangular connector: This is called the “A” connector and is for any 
receiving device, such as your PC or a USB hub.
 
✓ Square connector: Called the “B” connector, this is used for a sending 
device, such as your USB audio interface or printer.
Aside from having two different types of jacks and plugs, USB also has two 
different standards, as follows:
 
✓ USB 1.1: This, the original, standard can handle a data rate of up to 12 
Mbps (megabits per second).
 
✓ USB 2.0: This standard can handle 40 times the data flow of the earlier 
standard — 480 Mbps.
You’ll still find some USB 1.1 audio interfaces on the market, but most have 
migrated to the faster, 2.0 version. Transfer speeds for USB 2.0 are consider-
ably faster, but not as fast in real-world use as FireWire 400. (Chapter 2 has 
more details on audio interfaces.)

59
 Chapter 3: Getting Connected: Setting Up Your Studio
 
Figure 3-8: 
USB uses 
two types of 
connectors: 
the “A” 
connector 
(left) and 
the “B” 
connector 
(right).
 
FireWire
Developed by Apple Computer, FireWire (also known as IEEE 1394 or iLink) is 
a high-speed connection that is used by many audio interfaces, hard drives, 
digital cameras, and other devices. Even though FireWire was developed by 
Apple, you can find FireWire ports on devices from many manufacturers. 
FireWire cables, unlike USB cables (see the preceding section), have the 
same connector (see Figure 3-9) on both ends.
Like USB, FireWire comes in two flavors, which are described as follows:
 
✓ FireWire 400: This standard supports data-transfer speeds of up to 400 
Mbps. Many audio interfaces currently use FireWire 400 as a way to con-
nect with your computer. These interfaces can handle quite a few inputs 
and outputs.
 
✓ FireWire 800: Yep, you guessed it — this standard can handle data-
transfer rates of 800 Mbps. A couple of FireWire 800 devices are avail-
able now, but you should see many more interfaces supported by 
FireWire 800 soon.

Sampling Some Studio Setups
Everyone’s studio setup is a little different. Because I can’t come into your 
home to help you set yours up, in this section I show you some typical setups 
that you can use to configure your system.
I outline these three systems in the sections that follow:
 
✓ Audio with some MIDI: This system is designed to record audio tracks 
and run MIDI tracks simultaneously using stand-alone components.
 
✓ MIDI-intensive setup: This setup relies heavily on MIDI, using a com-
puter to run audio and MIDI.
 
✓ Live audio: This setup optimizes live-instrument recording with no MIDI 
devices, which consists of a studio-in-a-box (SIAB) system.
 
Whenever you connect or disconnect cables within your system, make sure 
that the power to the equipment is turned off or that the volume on the device 
is turned all the way down.

61
 Chapter 3: Getting Connected: Setting Up Your Studio
Audio with some MIDI
The most common home studio setup includes one or two MIDI devices con-
nected to a digital recorder and one or two microphones plugged in to record 
vocals or an instrument. Figure 3-10 shows this typical setup. Here, the guitar 
and bass may be either miked from the amp or plugged directly into the 
mixer using one of the following three techniques:
 
✓ Use a direct box, a device that changes the impedance level of your 
guitar so that the mixer can process the signal.
 
✓ Plug your guitar into your amp and run a cord from the line output of 
the amp to the mixer’s channel input.
 
✓ Use the Hi Z input of your mixer, if this input is available.
The setup in Figure 3-10 consists of a stand-alone recorder, a separate mixer, 
and a computer running MIDI sequencing software. Here’s how you connect 
the equipment in this scenario:
 
✓ Plug all your instruments into the channel inputs of the mixer. For exam-
ple, insert a TS plug into a 1/4-inch jack and an XLR plug into an XLR jack.
 
✓ To connect the synthesizer to the MIDI controller (computer), run a 
MIDI cable from the MIDI-output jack of the MIDI interface to the MIDI-
input jack of the synthesizer.
 
 The connection between the MIDI interface and computer depends on 
your MIDI interface. This connection is usually made using a USB port, 
but you can find MIDI ports in many audio interfaces. In this case, the 
connection type depends on the type of interface you use. Chapter 2 has 
more details on audio interface connection types.
 
✓ To connect the mixer to the recorder, run 1/4-inch line cords from the 
direct-output jacks of the individual channels to the line (track)–input 
jacks of the recorder.
 
 Figure 3-10 shows only one cord running from the mixer to the recorder 
(and one running from the recorder back to the mixer), but you can 
have as many cords as you have direct-output jacks in your mixer or 
line-input jacks in your recorder. For example, if you have an 8-track 
recorder, you have cords running from channels 1–8 of your mixer into 
the track-input jacks 1–8 of your recorder. Of course, if your system con-
sists of a studio-in-a-box or a computer-based system, you don’t need to 
run these cords because the connections are made within the box (see 
the section “Live audio,” later in this chapter).
 
✓ To monitor the tracks of the recorder, run cords from the individual 
line-output jacks of the recorder back to the mixer. You would gener-
ally plug these cords into channel inputs 9–16. Again, if you have studio-
in-a-box or a computer-based system, you don’t need to do this.

62
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 
 
 If you connect your recorder and mixer as I just outlined, you have 
channels 1–8 on your mixer controlling all the inputs and channels 9–16 
controlling the recorded tracks. If you don’t have that many channels in 
your mixer, you need to jockey some cords around. The routing possi-
bilities are almost endless with a mixer. Check your owner’s manual for 
some recommended setups and routing suggestions.
 
 As an example, suppose that you have a 12-channel mixer and an 8-track 
recorder. If you don’t intend to record more than 4 tracks at a time, you 
can use tracks 1–4 for your channel inputs from your instruments and 
tracks 5–12 for the track inputs from your recorder.
 
 If you need more inputs and don’t want or need to listen to the tracks 
as you record, you can allocate fewer channels for track monitoring and 
more for instrument inputs.
 
✓ Run line cords from the main left- and right-output jacks of the mixer 
to your power amp (or powered speakers).
 
✓ Run speaker cords from the power amp to the speakers. (You obvi-
ously don’t need these if you have powered speakers because the con-
nection is internally wired.)
MIDI-intensive setup
The MIDI-intensive setup has numerous MIDI devices hooked up to a mixer 
and a microphone occasionally plugged in to record vocals. The system 
shown in Figure 3-11 features a computer running audio and sequencing soft-
ware as well as an audio and MIDI interface. The mixer is housed within the 
software program. All your instrument and microphone audio outputs are 
plugged into the audio inputs of the interface, and the MIDI connections are 
made using the MIDI input and output jacks.
MIDI controller (located in the computer) and the instruments, which gives 
you more flexibility with sequencing.
 
Because all routing is done within the computer, you don’t need as many 
cords as you would with a stand-alone system.
Live audio
If you intend to record a live band, you are likely to use this setup. The live 
audio setup requires more microphone connections and rarely has MIDI 
devices running into it. Figure 3-12 shows how you would make the connec-
tions for this type of application.

The setup in Figure 3-12 consists of a studio-in-a-box (SIAB) system (a Roland 
VS-1880, for instance). Because all the routing takes place within the box, 
your setup is simple. All your instruments and microphones plug directly 
into the SIAB (most units even have one Hi-Z input for a guitar or bass). If you 
want to plug both the electric guitar and bass in at the same time, you still 
need one direct box or line output from your amp.
 
If you plan to use more than two microphones at once, make sure that you 
have enough inputs because most SIAB systems only have two XLR jacks. 
If you want to plug in more mics than you have XLR jacks, you have the 
following options:
 
✓ Use a separate analog mixer for plugging in extra mics. Then run an 
instrument cord from the channel output of the mixer to the channel’s 
line input on your SIAB system.
 
✓ Use one or more external preamps to convert the low-impedance mic 
cords to high-impedance TS cords. Just plug your mic into the preamp 
and run an instrument cord from the preamp to the channel’s line input 
of your SIAB system.
 
✓ Use line converters, such as a direct box or an adapter. Plug your mic 
cord into the direct box or adapter and then plug into the channels’ line 
input of your SIAB system’s mixer. (You can find an adapter at Radio 
Shack for about $12 — part no. 910-0913.) This is the least expensive 
option, but it costs you more in terms of sound quality — it doesn’t 
sound as good as the previous two options.
All that’s left is to run line cords from the main outputs of your SIAB system 
to the inputs of your powered speakers. In this case, you use 1/4-inch instru-
ment cords (T/S) rather than speaker cords because the input on your pow-
ered speakers is actually the input to the amplifier and not the speakers. The 
connection from the amp to the speakers is made internally in the speaker 
cabinets.
Working Efficiently
I hope that you’ll spend many hours in your studio creating some great music 
(possibly to the dismay of the rest of your family). One important thing to 
keep in mind is that you need to be comfortable. Get a good chair and set up 
your workstation to be as easy to get around as possible. Figure 3-13 shows a 
classic L setup. Notice how everything that you need is within arm’s reach. If 
you have enough room, you may want to consider a U-shaped setup instead, 
which is shown in Figure 3-14.

67
 Chapter 3: Getting Connected: Setting Up Your Studio
If you use a lot of outboard gear — such as preamps or effects processors — 
and you think that you need to plug and unplug a lot, invest in a good patch 
bay (see Figure 3-15) so that you don’t have to strain to get at the cords that 
are tucked away behind your mixer. A patch bay is a device that has a bunch 
of inputs and outputs in it that allows you to route your gear in (and out) in 
an almost infinite variety of ways. If you’re going to do much plugging and 
unplugging, you’ll quickly find out that a patch bay is an indispensable item. 
It can save your back — and your cords (repeated plugging and unplugging 
wears them out quickly and produces buzzes that can be hard to locate).

 Chapter 3: Getting Connected: Setting Up Your Studio
Taming heat and dust
The number-one enemy of electronic equipment is heat. Dust is a close 
second. Try to set up your studio in a room that you can keep cool and 
fairly dust free. Air conditioning is a must for most studios. Be careful with a 
window air conditioner, though, because it can make a lot of noise, requiring 
you to shut it off when you record. Depending on where you live, this could 
quickly warm your room. Regarding dust, try to cover your equipment when 
you’re not using it, especially your microphones. A plastic bag placed over 
the top of a mic on a stand works well.
 
You could also just put your mics away when you’re not using them. However, 
if you use a particular mic a lot, you’re better off leaving it on a stand rather 
than constantly handling it — some types of mics are pretty fragile. (You can 
find more details on caring for your mics in Chapter 6.)
Monitoring your monitors
If you have a set of near-field monitors (speakers) — the kind that are 
designed to be placed close to you — they should be set up so that they 
are the same distance from each other and from you, forming an equilateral 
triangle (see, high school math has some real-world applications). The moni-
tors should also be placed at about the height of your ears.
Figure 3-16 illustrates the best placement for your monitors. Placing your 
monitors this way ensures that you hear the best possible sound from them 
and that you can accurately hear the stereo field. (For more on the stereo 
field, see Chapter 14.)
Optimizing Your Room
Your studio probably occupies a corner in your living room, a spare bed-
room, or a section of your basement or garage. All of these are less-than-ideal 
recording environments. Even if you intend to record mostly by plugging 
your instrument or sound module directly into the mixer, how your room 
sounds has a big effect on how well your music turns out.
As a home recordist, you probably can’t create a top-notch sound room. 
Professional studios spend serious cash — up to seven figures — to make their 
rooms sound, well, professional. Fortunately, you don’t need to spend near 
that much money to get great-sounding recordings. All it takes is a little under-
standing of the way sound travels, some ingenuity, and a little bit of work.

Isolating sound
One of the concerns that you (and your neighbors) are probably going to have 
when you start recording in your home is the amount of sound that gets into 
and out of your room. Sound waves are nasty little buggers. They get through 
almost any surface, and you can’t do a lot to stop that from happening.
You’ve probably noticed this phenomenon when somebody with a massive 
subwoofer in his car drives by your house blasting some obnoxious music. 
(Ever notice how someone else’s music is obnoxious whereas your music 
never is, no matter how loud you play it?) Your windows rattle, your walls 
shake, and your favorite mug flies off the shelf and breaks into a thousand 
pieces. Well, this is one of the problems with sound.
The best (and classic) way to isolate your studio room from everything 
around it is to build a room within a room or to use sound isolation materials 
to reduce the level of sound passing through your floors, ceilings, or walls. I 
don’t have the space to go into detail here, but you can find some resources 
to get you started by doing a Google search with the keywords “sound isola-
tion.” Here are a couple of places to get you started:
 
✓ Sound Isolation Company (www.soundisolationcompany.com): 
Aside from selling products to help you keep the sound in (or out) of 
your studio, you’ll find some useful information here about the process 
of sound isolation.

71
 Chapter 3: Getting Connected: Setting Up Your Studio
 
✓ Netwell (www.esoundproof.com): Again, this company sells products 
to help control sound, but you’ll also find some good basic information 
here to get you started.
If you don’t have the money or space to build a room within a room or to add 
expensive sound isolation barriers to your recording space, the best thing 
you can do is to try to understand what noises are getting in and getting out 
and deal with those noises. For example, if you live in a house or apartment 
with neighbors close by, don’t record live drums at night. You could also 
consider using a drum machine or electronic drum set instead.
Another idea is to choose a room in your house or apartment that is the far-
thest away from outside noise (an interior room, for instance). Basements 
also work well because they’re underground, and most of the sound gets 
absorbed by the ground. Placing a little fiberglass bat insulation in the 
ceiling — the typical house insulation that you can find at your local 
home center — can isolate you pretty well from your neighbors. Detached 
garages are generally farther away from other buildings, so sound has a 
chance to dissipate before it reaches your neighbors (or before your neigh-
bors’ noise reaches your garage).
Also, keep the following points in mind when trying to isolate your studio:
 
✓ Dead air and mass are your friends. The whole concept of a room 
within a room is to create mass and dead air space so that the sound 
gets trapped. When you work on isolating your room, try to design in 
some space that can trap air (dead air) — such as a suspended ceiling 
or big upholstered furniture — or use double layers of drywall on your 
walls (mass).
 
✓ Don’t expect acoustical foam or carpet to reduce the noise. Using these 
items helps reduce the amount of sound that bounces around inside 
the room, but acoustical foam or carpet does little toward keeping the 
sound in or out of the room.
 
✓ Isolate the instrument instead of the room. Isolating the sound of your 
guitar amp can be much less expensive than trying to soundproof your 
whole room. Most commercial studios have one or more isolation booths 
that they use for recording vocals and other acoustic instruments. You 
can use that concept to create your own mini-isolation booths.
 
One idea for a truly mini–isolation booth is to make an insulated box for your 
guitar (or bass) amp. If you just have to crank your amp to get the sound 
that you want, you can reduce the amount of noise that it makes by placing it 
inside an insulated box. Check out Figure 3-17 to see what I mean.

You can also create an isolated space in a closet by insulating it and clos-
ing the door when you record, or you can put your guitar amp (or drums) in 
another room and run a long cord from there to your recorder. If you do this, 
remember that for long cord runs, you need to use balanced cords; otherwise, 
you may get a bunch of noise and your signal may be too low to record well.
Controlling sound
After you create a room that’s as isolated from the outside world as possible, 
you need to deal with the way sound acts within your room.
Sound travels through the air in the form of waves. These waves bounce 
around the room and cause reflections (reverberations or echoes). One of the 
problems with most home studios is that they’re small. And because sound 
travels very fast (about 1,130 feet per second — the exact speed depends on 
the humidity in the environment), when you sit at your monitors and listen, 

73
 Chapter 3: Getting Connected: Setting Up Your Studio
you hear the reflected sound as well as the original sound that comes out of 
your speakers. With big rooms, you can hear the original sound and reflec-
tions as separate sounds, meaning that the reflections themselves become 
less of a problem. For a good home studio, you need to tame these reflections 
so that they don’t interfere with your ability to clearly hear the speakers.
 
How all these reflections bounce around your room can get pretty compli-
cated. Read up on acoustics (the way sound behaves) to discover more about 
different room modes: axial (one dimension), tangential (two dimensions), and 
oblique (three dimensions). Each relates to the way that sound waves interact 
as they bounce around a room. Knowing your room’s modes can help you 
come up with an acoustical treatment strategy, but very complicated formulas 
are used to figure out your room’s modes, especially those dastardly tangen-
tial and oblique modes.
 
You can find out more on room modes, as well as discover some room mode 
calculators, by using your favorite Internet search engine and searching for 
room modes. I recommend that you research these modes; this topic alone 
could fill an entire book.
At the risk of offending professional acoustical engineers, I’m going to share 
some tricks that I’ve been using in my studios. My main goal has been to 
create a room with a sound I like that gives me some measure of control over 
the reflections within the room. Because I (and most home recordists) both 
record and mix in one room, it’s helpful to be able to make minor adjust-
ments to the acoustics to get the sound I want.
 
The single best source I’ve found for sound control and acoustics informa-
tion is Ethan Winer’s forum at Musicplayer.com. You can check it out at 
http://forums.musicplayer.com/ubbthreads.php/ubb/postlist/
Board/24/page/1.
Sound control plays a major role in two aspects of recording — tracking and 
mixing — and each requires different approaches for you to get the best pos-
sible sound from your recordings. I cover both of these aspects in the sec-
tions that follow.
Sound control during tracking
Tracking is what you’re doing when you’re recording. Two things that can 
make a room a bad environment for tracking are not enough sound reflection 
and too much sound reflection.
When tracking, your goal is to have a room that’s not so dead (in terms of 
sound reflection) that it sucks the life out of your instrument and not so alive 
that it overcolors the sound. The determining factors in how much reflection 
you need in your room are the instrument that you record and the way it 
sounds in the room. If your room is too dead (with not enough sound 

74
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 
reflection), you want to add some reflective surfaces to liven things up (the 
room, that is). If your room is too alive (with too much sound reflection), you 
need to add some absorptive materials to tame those reflections.
You could buy a bunch of foam panels to catch the reflections or install a 
wood floor or attach some paneling to the walls to add some life, but then 
you would be stuck with the room sounding only one way. It may end up 
sounding good for recording drums or an acoustic guitar, but it would prob-
ably be too alive for getting a great vocal sound — which requires a deader 
space. One solution that works well is to get (or make) some portable panels 
that can either absorb or reflect the sound.
 
Figure 3-18 shows an absorber/reflector that I’ve used and have found to work 
well. One side has an absorptive material (dense fiberglass insulation), and 
the other has a reflective surface (wood). They are assembled in an attrac-
tive frame and designed to stack easily. Even with minimal woodworking 
experience, you can crank out a set of them in a weekend for very little money 
(about $50 per panel). I guarantee that if you make them (or hire someone to 
make them for you), you’ll find dozens of uses for them around your studio. (I 
outline a bunch of ways to use them in Chapter 8.)

 Chapter 3: Getting Connected: Setting Up Your Studio
Sound control during mixing
The following sections detail the steps that can help you control the sound of 
your (probably less-than-perfect) room during mixing.
Get a good pair of near-field monitors
Near-field monitors are designed to be listened to up close (hence the near in 
their name) and can lessen the effects that the rest of the room has on your 
ability to accurately hear them and to get a good mix.
Mix at low volumes
I know, mixing at low volumes takes the fun out of it, right? Well, as fun as 
it may be to mix at high volumes, it rarely translates into a great mix. Great 
mixing engineers often listen to their mixers at very low levels. Yes, they 
occasionally use high levels, but only after the mixing is almost done and 
only for short periods of time. After all, if you damage your ears, you’ll end 
up with a short career as a sound engineer (hey, that rhymes!). I don’t want 
to sound like your mother, but try to resist the temptation to crank it up. 
Your ears will last longer and your mixes will sound better.
Use panels to tame sound
Even with these two things (near-field monitors and low mixing levels), you 
still need to do something to your room to make it work better for you. The 
secret to getting a good mixing room is to tame the sound reflections coming 
out of your speakers. Dealing with high and midrange frequencies is pretty 
easy — just put up some foam panels or the absorptive side of the panels 
from Figure 3-18. (See, I told you that you would have a use for those panels.) 
Here’s a rundown on how to place absorption panels in your studio:
 
✓ Start by hanging two panels (or by putting them on a stand or table) 
so that they’re at the level of your speakers on the wall behind you.
 
✓ Put one panel on each side wall, right where the speakers are pointed. 
This positioning, shown in Figure 3-19, gets rid of the higher frequencies 
and eliminates much of the echo.
 
✓ You may need to put some type of panel on the ceiling right above 
your head. This is especially important if you have a low (8-feet-high or 
less) or textured ceiling (you know, one with that popcorny stuff that 
gets sprayed on).
 
 You may not want to mount one of the absorber panels over your 
head because they’re fairly heavy. A couple of 2-×-4-foot dense fiber-
glass panels (the same ones that you used in the absorber/reflectors) 
wrapped with fabric would work perfectly. In fact, you can easily make 
some overhead diffusers like the ones shown in Figure 3-20.

76
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 
 
✓ You can also place a set of fiberglass panels in the corners of your 
room behind the speakers. Just hang the panels at the same height as 
your speakers so that they cut off the corner of the room. If you don’t 
have enough room to fit the panels at an angle in the corner, you can 
eliminate the backing from the fiberglass and bend the fabric-covered 
panel to fit right in the corner. Either approach absorbs sound that may 
bounce around behind the speakers.

Use bass traps to tame standing waves
You also need to consider standing waves when mixing. Standing waves are 
created when bass tones begin reflecting around your room and bounce into 
each other. Standing waves can either overaccentuate the bass from your 
speakers (resulting in mixes that are short on bass) or cancel out some or all 
of the bass coming out of your speakers (resulting in mixes with too much 
bass). One problem with standing waves is that they can really mess up your 
mixes, and you may not know that they are there.
To find out whether you have a problem with standing waves in your studio, 
sit in front of your monitors and carefully listen to one of your favorite CDs. 
Okay, now lean forward and backward a bit. Does the amount of bass that you 
hear change as you move? Next, get up and walk around the room. Listen for 
places within the room where the bass seems to be louder or softer. You may 
find places where the bass drops out almost completely. If either inspection 
proves to be true, you are the proud owner of standing waves. Don’t worry, 
though. You can tame that standing-wave monster with a pair of bass traps.

78
Part I: Home Recording Studio Basics 
Bass traps absorb the energy in the lower frequencies so that they don’t 
bounce all over your room and throw off your mixes. You can buy bass traps 
made of foam from some music stores or (yep, you guessed it) you can make 
your own out of wood and insulation. Check out Figure 3-21 for a look at 
some homemade bass traps.

on the frequencies that you want to trap)
 
The most common placement for bass traps is in the corners behind you 
when you’re sitting at your mixer (see Figure 3-22). Placing a set of bass traps 
in the other corners of the room can help even more.
After you place the bass traps, do the listening test again. If you notice some 
areas where the bass seems to get louder or softer, try moving the bass traps 
around a little. With some trial and error, you can find a place where they 
work best.

79
 Chapter 3: Getting Connected: Setting Up Your Studio
 
Try not to get stressed out about the sound of your room. As important as 
your room’s sound may be, it has a lot less impact on the quality of your 
recordings than good, solid engineering practices. I know, I keep saying 
this, but it’s important to remember. So do what you can and then work 
with what you have.

I
f you’ve ever been to a recording studio and watched a great recording 
engineer create a mix, you’ve probably been entranced by the way that he 
or she interacted with the mixing board: a dance around the mixer, a twist of 
a knob here, a push of a slider there. All this works to the beat of the music. 
It’s like watching a genius painter paint, or a great orchestra conductor con-
duct, or a brilliant surgeon surge . . . er, operate. I’ll even bet that one of the 
reasons that you got interested in home recording is so that you could have 
a chance to play with those knobs and sliders yourself. Go ahead and admit 
it — you’ll feel better.
Well, you get your chance in this chapter. Not only do you discover what all 
those knobs and sliders do, but you also begin to understand all the func-
tions that the mixer fulfills in the studio. You discover what makes up a chan-
nel strip and how it’s used. You get a chance to see how busing and routing 
work and even discover what these terms mean. But first you start by exam-
ining the different types of mixers that are used in home studios.
Meeting the Many Mixers
For the home recordist, mixers come in several varieties: the analog desk, 
the digital mixer or computer control surface with or without sliding faders 
and fader banks, and software mixers controlled by your computer mouse 
and keyboard.

84
Part II: Recording 101 
Your choice of mixer mostly depends on the other equipment that you use 
in your studio and on your budget. Here’s the lowdown for the three basic 
types of recording systems:
 
✓ Studio-in-a-box (SIAB) system: These all-in-one units come with a digital 
mixer — just plug in your instrument or microphone and you’re ready 
to go. Most mixers in these units offer quite a bit of flexibility in routing 
your signal, so you’ll likely be able to do quite a bit with little hassle. 
The features of the mixer in each SIAB system vary, so look at the specs 
of the unit you’re interested in before you buy.
 
✓ Computer-based system: All recording software includes a digital mixer 
that’s controlled by your keyboard and mouse. Most of these programs 
also allow you to connect an external bit of hardware called the com-
puter control surface. This gives you real knobs and sliders to tinker with 
as you work.
 
✓ Stand-alone components: Because everything is separate in this type 
of system, you need to buy a mixer before you can use your recorder. 
Here you can choose between an analog or digital mixer, and you need 
to invest in the cords necessary to make the proper connections (this 
alone can get expensive). The type of mixer you choose will partly be 
based on your budget, but it will mostly be based on your working style 
and whether you prefer analog or digital mixing. I talk more about these 
mixers in the next two sections.
Analog mixer
The analog mixer, shown in Figure 4-1, enables you to route the signals within 
the analog domain. Analog mixers tend to have many knobs, lights, and 
faders — a set for each channel. If you want to change from mixing inputs 
(your instruments) to mixing sounds recorded on the recorder, you need to 
plug and unplug cords, or you need to get a mixer with twice as many chan-
nels as your recorder.
Analog mixers are quickly becoming relics of the past for most home record-
ists. This is because digital mixers offer more functions for the price and gen-
erally sound just as good — if not better — than their analog counterparts. 
That said, many commercial studios still use (and prefer) large analog desks 
for their mixing needs. This is because top-notch analog mixers ($100,000+ to 
over $1 million) have a sound that many pros prefer. They also look impres-
sive, and many engineers are used to the workflow they get with them.

Digital mixer
The digital mixer, shown in Figure 4-2, is a great option for home studio 
owners because it can perform the same functions as a conventional analog 
mixer in a lot less space. Routing — the process of sending your signals to 
various places within the mixer — becomes almost easy using one of these 
mixers. You can switch between input and track channels without having to 
change a single cord.
Digital mixers handle all the busing and routing tasks within the digital 
domain. With no cords to mess with, noise is less likely to enter the system. 
And if noise does enter the system, it’s easier to find and eliminate.

One of the great things about digital mixers is the ability to automate your mix. 
You can set up complex fader and effects changes to run automatically. Some 
digital mixers even have motorized faders, which are really fun to watch!
Software mixer
If you want the flexibility of a digital mixer and don’t have an overpowering 
need to physically touch the faders and knobs, a software mixer (shown in 
Figure 4-3) may work for you. The software mixer is included with any com-
puter audio or MIDI production software. The advantage of a software mixer 
is that after you have the computer and audio software that you want, you 
have nothing else to buy.
Software mixers work much the same way as digital mixers. Because software 
mixers are digital, you have an almost infinite variety of routing choices that 
you can make without having to patch and repatch cables. Still, some people 
may not be too keen on having to use a keyboard and a mouse to get mixing 
work done rather than working with the more traditional knobs or slide faders.
 
For those of you who want the best of both worlds — high-tech computer soft-
ware and tactile stimulation — you can find control surfaces that allow you to 
control the software’s mixer using real faders and knobs, as described in the 
next section.

Computer control surface
If you end up with a computer-based system with a software mixer, you’ll 
have some knobs, buttons, and faders to play around with on the computer 
control surface, as shown in Figure 4-4. Aside from being able to fiddle with 
some knobs, you’ll find that a computer control surface is a handy tool if you 
decide to use a computer-based Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) and want 
(or need) to control the virtual mixer with some hardware.
These controllers send MIDI messages — messages encoded using the 
Musical Instrument Digital Interface communications protocol — to the com-
puter that tells it which parameters to change. These controllers can easily 
be programmed to work like a separate digital mixer.

Understanding Mixer Basics
The mixer is an extremely versatile piece of equipment, allowing you a 
staggering variety of input and output configurations. And digital mixers 
(both hardware and software) are even more flexible than their analog 
counterparts. In fact, many digital mixers can be programmed to do almost 
anything that you can imagine. Regardless of the type of mixer that you use, 
some mixing aspects are universal: the inputs, the channel strip, busing 
(also known as routing), and the outputs. The rest of the chapter explores 
these functions.
 
Think of a mixing board as a sort of air-traffic controller for the audio world. 
Just as the guys (and gals) in the towers near an airport communicate with all 
the planes in the air, making sure that collisions are avoided and that traffic

 Chapter 4: Meet the Mixer
moves quickly and efficiently, the mixer routes all the incoming and outgoing 
signals from the instruments, effects, and recording devices so that the signals 
get to their desired destination without any problems.
Examining Inputs
To move your audio signal around within your mixer, you need to first get 
the signal into the system and then you need to adjust the signal level. You 
perform these steps with the input jacks and the trim control.
Inputs
You find the following three basic types of inputs, which are generally 
located in the back of your system:
 
✓ Microphone: This is the XLR input (the three-pin thingy). It’s used for 
microphones and often also has phantom power as part of its connec-
tion (which generally can be turned off if you want). Phantom power is 
necessary for condenser mics to function. See Chapter 6 for more on 
phantom power.
 
✓ Line/instrument: This is a 1/4-inch jack (generally TS but sometimes 
TRS-balanced) that accepts line-level signals from a synthesizer, a drum 
machine, or the line output from your guitar amp.
 
✓ Hi-Z: This is an input designed for the home recordist. This type of 
input uses a mono 1/4-inch (TS) jack and allows you to plug your elec-
tric guitar (or bass or fiddle — anything with an electronic pickup) 
directly into your system without having to mic it or run it through a 
direct box first.
For more on the different connector types, check out Chapter 3.
 
A direct box (or DI box, short for direct injection) is traditionally used to con-
nect your guitar or bass directly to the mixer without having to run it through 
your amp first. A direct box’s purpose is twofold:
 
✓ To change the guitar’s impedance level so that the mixer can create the 
best sound possible (otherwise, it can sound thin or noisy)
 
✓ To change the cord from unbalanced 1/4-inch to balanced XLR so that 
you can use a long cord without creating noise

90
Part II: Recording 101 
For more on cord types and balanced versus unbalanced signals, see Chapter 3.
 
If you use a computer-based system, the inputs and outputs are located in 
your audio interface — the hardware you use to connect the analog world 
to the computer world. Chapter 2 has more on the various types of available 
interfaces.
Trim control
The Trim control is a knob that’s used to adjust the level of the input signal 
as it enters the mixer. You usually find the Trim control at the top of the front 
panel of your hardware unit. On SIAB systems and analog and digital mixers, 
this control is generally located at the top of the mixer section for each chan-
nel, and on audio interfaces, it’s often found on the front panel. The amount 
that you adjust the Trim control depends on the instrument that you have 
plugged into the channel strip. If the Trim control is set too high, you get 
distortion; if it’s set too low, you get a signal that’s too weak to record. So be 
sure to listen as you make your adjustments.
Most Trim controls have a switch or markings for Line or Mic(rophone) 
signals, with the Line level to the right and the Mic level to the left. Turn the 
knob all the way to the left for line sources or slowly keep turning it to the 
right for microphone sources until you get a nice, clean sound coming into 
the mixer. See Chapter 7 for more on setting input levels.
 
For microphone sources, you use the Trim control to adjust the level for record-
ing. Turning the control up (turning the knob clockwise) activates an internal 
preamp in the mixer, which boosts the level of the signal coming from the mic. 
The internal preamp in pro mixers is usually fairly decent (it can sound pretty 
good). However, many professionals prefer to use an external preamp because it 
can often sound better or have a sound characteristic that they want.
 
If you use an external preamp, check the owner’s manual of your mixer to see 
whether you can bypass the internal preamp. Most professional mixers enable 
you to do this. Sometimes just turning the Trim control all the way down (to 
the Line marking) disengages the preamp from the circuit.
Checking Out the Channel Strip
The mixer is composed of numerous channels through which you route 
your signal when you record or mix. This is called the channel strip. The 
channel strip contains a lot of information, and the visual position of the

 Chapter 4: Meet the Mixer
various functions often doesn’t correspond with the actual flow of the 
signal. In the following sections, I explain both the elements of a typical dig-
ital channel strip and the path of the signal through this part of the mixer.
Viewing the channel strip layout
Figure 4-5 shows the channel strip in a typical analog mixer, and Figure 4-6 
shows the channel strip for a software mixer. Even though the mixer may 
look confusing with all its knobs or buttons, lights, and sliders, you only need 
to understand the basic makeup of one channel to understand them all. The 
channel strip’s job is to take the signal from an instrument or microphone 
and send it where you want it to go.
Because most home recordists use a digital mixer of some sort — whether 
software or hardware — I explain the channel strip in Pro Tools to give you 
an idea of the functions of digital mixers in the channel strip window (as 
shown in Figure 4-6). Your mixer may have some different features (and a 
different layout), but the basic functions are pretty universal. These features 
are as follows:
 
✓ Input: This is where you choose the input that’s assigned to the channel 
strip. In most systems, making the selection is as simple as clicking the 
Input button and choosing from a menu that opens on-screen. You can 
generally choose between a physical input from your hardware interface 
or a bus (an internal signal). For more on routing an input, see the sec-
tion “Recognizing Mixer Routing,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Output: This button controls the output of the track — where the sound 
goes when it leaves the track. This can be a hardware output or any of 
the buses (internal signal paths) that are available in your system.
 
✓ Automation Mode: In digital systems, automation means having certain 
channel strip parameters, such as volume, panning, mute, send level, 
and insert level, adjust dynamically throughout the song. Using this 
button, you can choose among the different automation modes. These 
vary depending on the type of system you have.
 
✓ Panning Slider: Use this slider (or a knob in many systems) to pan your 
track to the left or the right in the stereo field. (For more on panning, see 
Chapter 14.)
 
✓ Panning Display: This display shows your track’s panning position — 
its place to the left, right, or center in the stereo field.
 
✓ Solo and Mute: These buttons either solo or mute the track. Solo means 
that every other track in your song is silenced (muted). Muting means 
that only the selected track is silenced.

✓ Record Enable: Pressing the Record Enable button enables the track for 
recording. When enabled, this button flashes red. In digital mixers, SIAB 
systems, and computer control surfaces, this button is located on the 
physical unit and not on the screen.
 
✓ Voice On/Off: This selector lets you choose between Off, where the 
track does not play, and Auto, where the track plays if data is present. 
This feature is unique to Pro Tools. In its place on some SIAB systems, 
you may find a virtual track selector, where you can choose from a list 
of additional tracks called, logically enough, virtual tracks.
 
✓ Volume Fader: This is the control for setting the volume of the audio 
that’s contained in this track.
 
✓ Velocity/Volume Meter: This display, located to the right of the Volume 
Fader, shows you the volume (Pro Tools calls this velocity) of the track 
as the music plays. If you have a color display, any notes above digital 0 
usually show in red at the top of the display.
 
✓ Group: The little red G is present if this track is grouped with others. 
You can find out which group the track belongs to by clicking and hold-
ing over the icon. This feature is unique to Pro Tools as well.
 
✓ Track Type: This icon shows you the type of track. This is handy with 
systems that can record and play back audio and MIDI tracks.
 
✓ Numerical Volume: This display shows you the volume of the track in 
decibels.

94
Part II: Recording 101 
 
✓ Track name: Many digital mixers allow you to customize the name of 
your tracks to make it easier to remember what you have recorded on 
them. This is the place where the name is listed. You can change the 
name at any time by clicking the name and typing in a new one.
Following the flow of the signal
One of the most important things to understand when recording is how the 
signal moves within your system. This knowledge lets you make the most of 
your tracks and helps you to tailor the sound to match the music you hear in 
your head as you compose, engineer, or produce your masterpiece.
Using the ubiquitous Pro Tools as an example again, here’s how the signal 
flows through the channel strip (shown from top to bottom in Figure 4-7):
 
✓ Source audio or input: This is the signal that is coming from your hard-
ware input or that is recorded to your hard drive. The signal starts here 
and enters the track’s channel strip.
 
✓ Insert: This function lets you insert effects into your track. This function 
is for effects, such as equalizers or dynamics processors, where you 
want to change the sound of the entire signal. Some SIAB systems, such 
as the Roland boxes, have separate EQ sections.
 
✓ Send Prefader: The Send function lets you route part of your signal out 
to an Aux bus, where you can then insert an effect such as reverb. With 
effects such as reverb, you don’t want to use the Insert function — as 
you would with a compressor — because you want to be able to control 
how much of the effect you hear. (Compressors only enable you to affect 
the entire signal, not some portion of it.)
 
 Adjust this slider or knob to send as much or as little of the signal to the 
appropriate auxiliary component (Aux, get it?) for effects processing, 
applying as much or as little of that effect to your final sound. Turning 
the knob to the left produces less effect, and turning it to the right gives 
more effect.
 
 Along with being able to set the Effect Send level at each channel (you 
can send more than one channel’s signal to each effect), you can also 
adjust the level of the affected signal that’s brought back into the mixer 
by using the Aux bus fader (which is described in the next section).
 
 The Aux Send function can often be set to send the track’s signal either 
prefader or postfader. Having this option gives you more flexibility to 
control the affected sound. For example, you can send the dry signal of 
a kick drum to a reverb (with the switch in the Pre position) and then 
boost the bass on the dry signal. Doing this gives you some reverb on 
the higher frequencies without adding it to the lower ones, which would 
create some mud in the final mix.

95
 Chapter 4: Meet the Mixer
 
 The downside to this is that you can’t control the level of the signal 
being sent to the effect using the fader. (You bypassed the fader in the 
Pre position.) In this case, if you raise and lower the channel fader, 
the amount of effect that you hear in relation to the dry signal changes 
as well. For example, when you lower the fader, you hear more effect 
because less dry signal is mixed in, and when you raise the fader, you 
hear less effect because the dry signal is louder and the effect level is 
the same.

✓ Solo and Mute: These buttons let you solo (silence all other tracks) and 
mute (silence) the output of the track.
 
✓ Fader: This function lets you control the level (volume) of your signal 
leaving the track and going to the output(s) you have chosen in the 
Output section of the channel strip.
 
✓ Send Postfader: When you have the Pre button disengaged, your Send 
signal is sent from your track after it passes through the track fader. 
Adjusting the volume of the track also adjusts the level going through 
your Send function.
 
✓ Pan: This control lets you adjust the amount of your signal that goes to 
the left or right channel of your stereo output.
 
✓ Output: This is where your signal goes as it leaves the track’s channel 
strip. This can be the master bus (connected to one of your physical 
outputs) or an aux or a submix bus, where it will later be sent to the 
master bus.
Recognizing Mixer Routing
After you have an instrument plugged into the mixer channel strip, you want 
to send that signal somewhere. This is referred to as routing or busing. (The 
place where the signal ends up is, conveniently enough, referred to as a bus.) 
Most mixers offer numerous busing possibilities, as follows:
 
✓ Master bus: This is where your signal goes before it leaves your system 
and where you mix all your tracks.
 
✓ Submix bus: This is where you can mix several tracks before they go to 
the master bus.
 
✓ Auxiliary bus: This is where you can add an effect to your signal and 
then move it along to the master bus.
In the next few sections, I introduce you to some of the most-used busing 
options and describe some ways to make this process easier.
Master bus
The master bus is where your music gets mixed and where you choose which 
of the physical outputs this stereo mix goes to. The Pan knob setting for each 
channel strip (how far to the left or right) dictates how much signal is sent to 
the left or right channels of the master bus.

97
 Chapter 4: Meet the Mixer
The master bus has a channel strip of its own where you can insert effects 
such as a compressor or EQ. (I’m not a big fan of this, as you find out in 
Chapter 16.) The master bus channel strip looks like a, ahem, stripped-down 
version of a regular channel strip — it doesn’t have some routing options 
such as an input selector, sends, or solo and mute buttons. This is because, 
as the final stage of your signal flow, these functions aren’t necessary.
 
Faders for each channel control how much level is sent to the master bus and 
how the volume of each channel relates to the other. The master fader only 
determines the amount of overall volume of all channels that are routed to it 
(for sending out to your speakers or to the stereo mix level).
Sub (submix) bus
Sometimes you have a group of instruments (such as drums) that you want 
to control as a group independently of the master fader. Sending these tracks 
to another track and submixing them there enables you to adjust the overall 
volume of the drums without affecting the volume of any other instruments 
that aren’t assigned to this channel. This is called a submix, and signals sent 
this way are sent (wait for it . . .) through the submix bus. When your signal 
exits this bus, it goes to the master bus, where it’s blended with the rest of 
your tracks.
 
Software mixers, such as the one in Pro Tools, often don’t have submix buses 
per se. Instead, you can simply route your signal to any of the internal buses, 
where you can adjust the level of all the signals coming to that bus using the 
channel strip fader associated with the bus.
Auxiliary (aux) bus
The aux bus is where you send your signal when you use one of the Send 
functions in your channel strip. This bus often has a channel strip of its own, 
where you can insert the effect you want to use. From this bus, your signal 
goes to the master bus, where it’s mixed with the rest of your tracks.
Opting for Outputs
Most mixers have a bunch of output jacks that are located on the left side of 
the back of your hardware. You often find output jacks for the master bus, 
headphones, and monitors.

98
Part II: Recording 101 
Master Out jack
The Master Out jack goes to the power amp for your speakers or goes 
directly to powered monitors, if you have any. This jack is generally con-
trolled by the master fader and sends the signal that’s routed through the 
master bus.
Phones jack
The Phones jack is for your headphones and is fed by the Phones knob on 
the master console. This jack carries the same signal as the master bus — 
only you get to control the volume separately.
Monitors jack
The Monitors jack generally contains that same signal as the headphones 
and master outs but gives you another place to be able to plug in some 
speakers or headphones. Oftentimes the Monitor Out jack is also used for 
“hardware monitoring” in systems that have it. Hardware monitoring is 
common on computer-based audio interfaces and is designed to allow you 
to monitor directly from the interface without having to wait until the audio 
signal goes into the computer and back out again before it reaches your 
ears. This reduces the latency that is often heard when listening to yourself 
as you record.

M
y first job in a recording studio was in 1985. I can still remember 
the first time I walked into that studio. The owner was sitting, arms 
crossed, in a chair in front of the mixing console (it was called a console in 
those days because the mixer took up nearly the whole room). He looked at 
me and pressed a key on the Macintosh computer sitting next to him. Then, 
all of a sudden, a synthesizer started playing, then another, and yet another. 
This is cool, I thought. But then I heard my nemesis — the drum machine.
Drum machines made me lose my recording gigs as a drummer and drove me 
to expand my career to that of a recording engineer as well. However, I even-
tually came to love that drum machine and the many others to follow (sigh). 
In fact, over the years, I became so captivated by the whole MIDI/drum 
machine thing that I assembled a whole series of electronic drum sets using 
drum machines and samplers — all controlled through MIDI.
In this chapter, you find out how MIDI enables synthesizers and computers to 
communicate with one another — a revolutionary thing for a musician. You 
get your hands dirty in the world of sequencing — the process of recording 
MIDI performance information so that you can play your performance auto-
matically. You also peruse a variety of MIDI-capable instruments and explore 
the ins and outs of controlling your MIDI gear.
 
Like audio recording, MIDI can be a deep subject. You can go nuts trying to 
understand every little nuance of MIDI. (I know some guys who are not quite 
the same after plunging head first into this stuff.) The reality is that to use 
MIDI effectively, you don’t need to know every little thing about it. In this 
chapter, I focus on what you need to know to get started.

100
Part II: Recording 101 
Meeting MIDI
MIDI is a protocol that musical instruments use to communicate with one 
another. They do this through a cabled connection and a language that allows 
each one to understand the other, regardless of the manufacturer or instru-
ment. All that’s required is an instrument equipped with MIDI ports (jacks).
MIDI data is different from an audio recording because it contains no sound 
as such; rather, it’s limited to performance information. This includes infor-
mation about various performance characteristics, including the following:
 
✓ Note-on and note-off: What note is played and when
 
✓ Velocity: How hard someone presses a key
 
✓ After-touch: Whether the key pressure changes after the initial press
 
✓ Vibrato and pitch bend: Whether the pitch changes while a key is 
pressed
This information allows the MIDI musician to potentially create a perfor-
mance that is as rich in texture as those of the world’s finest players.
Digital messages that are sent from one device to another across a cable 
(called the MIDI cable, of course) create MIDI data. The cable connects to 
MIDI ports on each device, and the messages are sent in the form of binary 
digits. Each instrument can understand and respond to these messages.
Perusing MIDI ports
Three types of MIDI ports exist:
 
✓ The out port sends messages.
 
✓ The in port receives incoming messages.
 
✓ You use the thru port when you create a daisy chain to connect more 
than two devices. The thru port sends the messages that one device 
receives directly to the in port of another instrument. Figure 5-1 shows a 
daisy chain setup.
 
MIDI signals travel in only one direction. Data flows from the out port of a 
device to an in port of another device, but not the other way around. Likewise, 
data going through the thru port originates from the first device in the chain 
and not the device whose thru port is being used. The way that data flows 
allows a lot of flexibility in how you can connect different devices. Here are 
some examples:

101
 Chapter 5: MIDI and Electronic Instruments
 
✓ Example 1: In Figure 5-1, three synthesizers are connected in a daisy 
chain lineup. A cable connects device A’s out port to device B’s in port. 
Another cable connects device B’s thru port to device C’s in port. In this 
scenario, device A controls devices B and C. Devices B and C can’t con-
trol any other device, because neither device B nor device C has a con-
nection from its out port.
 
✓ Example 2: Suppose you connect device B to device C by using device 
B’s out port instead of its thru port. In this case, device A sends mes-
sages to device B but not to device C. Device B controls device C. Device 
C has no control over either A or B because neither one is connected to 
device C’s out port.
 
✓ Example 3: Now take a look at Figure 5-2. In this figure, two devices (a 
synthesizer and a computer sequencer) have MIDI cables running from 
the out port of each to the in port of the other. (The MIDI interface in 
this figure is necessary to make MIDI connections in a computer.) This 
allows the communication to go both ways. For example, a master syn-
thesizer and a computer sequencer are frequently connected this way 
so that you can send performance information from the synthesizer to 
the sequencer when you’re recording your part and from the sequencer 
back to the synthesizer when you want to play the part back.
 
A connection to a MIDI device’s in port or through a device’s thru port 
doesn’t allow the device to control another device. A MIDI device can control 
another device only if the cable is connected from its out port to the other 
device’s in port.

Understanding MIDI channels
Okay, so you have a daisy chain of MIDI instruments all hooked together and 
you want to control them from your master keyboard or sequencer program. 
Now you want the drum machine to play the drum part and a sound module 
to play the string part. This is where the MIDI channels come in handy.
The MIDI channels allow you to designate which messages go to a particular 
machine. You can program each machine to receive messages on one or 
more of the 16 MIDI channels. For instance, you can set your drum machine 
to receive messages on channel 10 (the default channel for drum sounds) 
and set the sound module with the string sounds to receive data on chan-
nel 1. (You set the MIDI channels on your instrument by using the System 
Parameters menu. Check your owner’s manual for specific procedures.) After 
you assign your channels, your master keyboard sends the performance 
information for both the drum machine and the sound module playing the 
string sounds across one MIDI cable. Each receiving device responds only to 
the messages directed to the MIDI channel that it’s assigned to receive.
In this scenario, the sound module with the string sounds receives all the 
data from the master keyboard, responds to the messages on channel 1, 
and simultaneously sends the data from the master keyboard to the drum 
machine (via the sound module’s thru port). The drum machine receives 
the same messages from the master keyboard as the sound module but only 
responds to those sent for channel 10.
Having 16 MIDI channels allows you to have up to 16 separate instruments 
playing different parts at the same time. You may use 16 different devices or 
16 different parts from the same device if you have a multitimbral sound gen-
erator. (For details, see the section “Synthesizer,” later in this chapter.)

103
 Chapter 5: MIDI and Electronic Instruments
 
You would think that each MIDI channel would be sent along its own wire in the 
MIDI cable, but this is not the case. Inside the MIDI cable are three wires. Two 
wires are used for data transmission, and one is a shield. MIDI messages are 
sent across the two wires using a channel code, which tells the receiving device 
what channel the data following the code applies to. So a MIDI channel message, 
called a channel voice message, precedes each performance command.
Appreciating MIDI messages
For MIDI instruments to communicate with one another, they need to have a 
common vocabulary. This is where MIDI messages come in. MIDI messages 
contain an array of commands, including the following:
 
✓ Performance data messages: These messages consist of note-on and 
note-off, velocity, after-touch, vibrato, and pitch-bend messages.
 
 MIDI performance data messages each have 128 different values. For 
example, each note that you play on the keyboard has a number associ-
ated with it (middle C is 60, for instance). Likewise, velocity is recorded 
and sent as a number between 0 and 127, 0 being the softest volume (no 
sound) and 127 being the loudest that you can play.
 
✓ Control change messages: These are a type of performance data mes-
sage. These messages contain data about expression, including modula-
tion, volume, and pan.
 
✓ System-common messages: These messages contain data about which 
channel the performance data is sent to and what sound in the sound 
library to play. System common messages also include information 
about timing data, master volume, and effects settings.
 
✓ System-exclusive messages: These messages contain information that is 
exclusive to the system or device. The messages can include data trans-
fers of new sound patches, among other things.
To use MIDI effectively, you don’t need to know all (or many, really) of the 
MIDI messages that a device can recognize. If you hook up your gear and 
play, your MIDI devices generate and respond to the messages for you.
 
Not all MIDI devices recognize all the MIDI commands. For example, a sound 
module generally can’t send performance data messages, such as after-touch 
messages, because a sound module doesn’t have triggering mechanisms that 
produce these commands.
 
Check your instrument’s manual for a MIDI Implementation Chart. All MIDI instru-
ments come with this chart. In it, you can find a list of all the MIDI commands that 
the device can send or receive. The chart also includes information on polyphony, 
which refers to how many notes the instrument can play at once, and multitimbral-
ity, or how many different sounds the instrument can produce at the same time.

104
Part II: Recording 101 
Managing modes
Your synthesizer, drum machine, or other MIDI module has the following four 
operating modes that dictate how your instrument responds to the MIDI mes-
sages it receives:
 
✓ Mode 1 — Omni on/poly: In omni on/poly mode, your instrument 
responds to all the MIDI messages coming across the wires (well, except 
the MIDI channel data). This means that your synthesizer or other 
device tries to play the parts of all the instruments hooked up to your 
MIDI controller. In this mode, your device also plays polyphonically 
(more than one note at a time).
 
 Some older MIDI devices default to omni on/poly mode (mode 1) when 
you turn them on. In this case, you need to reset your instrument if it’s 
one of several in your MIDI setup because if you don’t, the instrument 
responds to any MIDI messages sent from the controller, not just the 
ones directed toward it.
 
✓ Mode 2 — Omni on/mono: Omni on/mono mode allows your device to 
receive messages from all MIDI channels but only lets it play one note at 
time (monophonically). This mode is rarely, if ever, used.
 
✓ Mode 3 — Omni off/poly: In the omni off/poly mode, your device can 
play polyphonically but responds only to MIDI signals on the channels 
that it’s set to. This is the mode you use most often when sequencing.
 
✓ Mode 4 — Omni off/mono: In the omni off/mono mode, your instrument 
responds only to the messages sent on the MIDI channel that it’s set to 
and ignores the rest. Rather than play polyphonically, as in mode 3, your 
instrument plays only one note at a time. This can be advantageous if 
you’re playing a MIDI controller from an instrument that can play only 
one note at a time, such as a saxophone.
Taking a look at General MIDI
If you compose music for other people to play on their MIDI instruments or 
if you want to use music from another composer, General MIDI is invaluable 
to you. General MIDI (GM) is a protocol that enables a MIDI instrument to 
provide a series of sounds and messages that are consistent with other MIDI 
instruments. With General MIDI, you can take a Standard MIDI File (SMF) of a 
song that was created on one sequencer program, transfer the file to another 
program, and use that other program to play the exact performance — 
sounds, timing, program changes, and everything else.
GM instruments contain numerous sound patches that the MIDI community 
has standardized. Not all of these sounds are exactly the same as far as 
sound quality goes, but their sound type and location (acoustic grand piano 
on patch #1, for instance) are the same on all GM-compatible machines.

105
 Chapter 5: MIDI and Electronic Instruments
 
Not all MIDI-capable instruments follow the GM standards. If this feature is 
important to you, be sure to find out whether the instrument that interests 
you is GM compatible before you buy.
GM standards dictate not only the particular sounds of a synthesizer but also 
which drum sounds are located on which keys, how many notes of polyph-
ony the instrument has, and how many different channels the instrument can 
receive and send instructions on. Here are the two levels of GM compatibility:
 
✓ GM level 1 compatibility: Level 1 protocols were developed in 1991 and 
consist of a minimum of 128 instrument patches, 24 notes of polyphony, 
receiving and sending capability for all 16 MIDI channels, 16-part multi-
timbrality, and a host of controller and performance messages.
 
✓ GM level 2 compatibility: Level 2 was implemented in 1999 and includes 
more sounds, polyphony, and features. A GM-compatible device has 32 
notes of polyphony, 16-channel support, up to 16 simultaneous instru-
ment sound patches, and a host of additional sounds (384, to be exact), 
including 2 channels of simultaneous percussion sounds. Also added to 
the GM2 standard are reverb and chorus effects.
Gearing Up for MIDI
Okay, so this MIDI thing sounds kind of interesting to you, and you want to 
know what you’re going to need to buy to do some MIDIing yourself. Well, 
I’m sorry to inform you that you can’t do any of this cool MIDI stuff with 
your vintage Stratocaster guitar or your acoustic drum set (unless you do 
some fancy rigging to your gear). Here’s the equipment that you need to 
have to record using MIDI:
 
✓ Sound generator: This device enables you to hear the music and may be 
a synthesizer, drum machine, sound module, or sampler.
 
✓ MIDI controller: This device controls the MIDI instruments in your studio.
 
✓ Sequencer: This device records and plays the MIDI performances that 
are programmed into it. The sequencer allows you to program your part 
into the synthesizer and have it play back automatically (much like the 
old-time player piano).
 
✓ MIDI interface: This interface enables your computer to send and 
receive MIDI data.
I know this sounds like a lot of stuff, but most of this gear performs more 
than one function in the MIDI studio. For example, nearly all synthesizers 
come with drum sounds, and some synthesizers even include a sequencer. 
In this case, this one synthesizer can do the job of a sound generator, drum 
machine, MIDI controller, and sequencer all in one. Or, you can get a com-

such as Pro Tools, Sonar, or Logic), a couple of software synthesizers (acting 
as your sound modules), and an external MIDI keyboard with its own internal 
interface (you can find many with USB connections that plug right into your 
computer). This setup gets you going with as few components as possible.
In the following sections, I discuss the different types of sound generators. 
Although you may find one piece of equipment that does everything you 
want, in this section, I separate all the features that different equipment may 
have to help you understand the function of each feature and decide how to 
configure your studio.
Sound generators
The sound generator is the core of the MIDI studio. This is what produces the 
sounds that you hear. Without it, you may as well skip the rest of the stuff 
because, of course, you can’t hear any of your work.
Sound generators can come in many different shapes and sizes: You find the 
fully functional keyboard synthesizer, the independent drum machine, the 
stand-alone sound module, samplers, software synthesizers (soft-synths), 
and the computer sound card. Each of these devices has its strengths and 
weaknesses (read on for the details).
Synthesizer
A synthesizer, like the one shown in Figure 5-3, consists of not only sounds 
but also a keyboard on which you can play these sounds. Synthesizers come 
in a variety of sizes and configurations. For example, some keyboards come 
with 61 keys (5 octaves) while others provide as many 88 keys — the size of 
an acoustic piano keyboard.

 Chapter 5: MIDI and Electronic Instruments
If you’re in the market for a synthesizer, you need to consider the following 
things:
 
✓ Polyphony: This is the number of keys that sound at one time. Most 
decent modern synthesizers have at least 16 notes of polyphony, 
although ones with 32 notes are not uncommon.
 
 Each manufacturer treats polyphony differently, and the GM standards 
(discussed in the section “Taking a look at General MIDI,” earlier in this 
chapter) allow some variations on the effective use of this parameter. 
For instance, a synth patch may use more than one sound to create 
the sound that you hear. The synth patch that you love so much may, 
in fact, consist of four different sounds layered on top of one another. 
In this case, you just reduced your polyphony to one-fourth with that 
one patch. If your synthesizer has 16-note polyphony, it’s now down to 
4-note polyphony because each of those 4 notes has four “sounds” asso-
ciated with it. If you use this patch, you can play only 4 notes (a simple 
chord) at a time, not the 16 that you thought you had to work with.
 
 Your best bet is to buy a synthesizer (or sound module) with the highest 
polyphony you can afford, especially if you want to layer one sound on 
top of another or do multitimbral parts with your synth.
 
✓ Multitimbrality: Most decent keyboards allow you to play more than 
one sound patch at a time. This is called multitimbrality, which basically 
allows you to have your keyboard divided into several groups of sounds. 
For example, a multitimbral synth can divide a song’s chords, melody, 
bass part, and drum-set sounds into different groups of sounds and then 
play all those groups at once.
 
 If you do any sequencing, a multitimbral synth is a must-have. 
Otherwise, you would need a separate synthesizer for each type of 
sound that you want to play. Fortunately, with the GM standards, com-
patible synthesizers made in the last ten years have the ability to play 16 
sounds at once.
 
✓ Keyboard feel: Some keyboards have weighted keys and feel like real 
pianos, while other keyboards have a somewhat spongy action. If you’re 
a trained piano player, a spongy keyboard may feel uncomfortable to 
you. On the other hand, if you have no training in piano and don’t need 
weighted keys, you don’t have to pay the extra money for that feature.
 
✓ Sound quality: This is a subjective thing. Choose the synthesizer that 
has the sounds that you think you’ll use. I know this seems kind of obvi-
ous, but buy the synthesizer whose sounds you like even if this means 
waiting and saving some more money before you can buy. If you buy a 
synth that was a good deal but you don’t love the sounds, you are wast-
ing your money because you’ll just end up buying the more expensive 
one later anyway.

108
Part II: Recording 101 
 
✓ Built-in sequencer: Many keyboards contain a built-in sequencer, 
which allows you to program and play back your performance. These 
are usually called keyboard workstations or MIDI workstations because 
they contain everything you need to create a song. If you’re considering 
buying one of these complete workstations, take a good, hard look at the 
sequencer and the user interface to make sure that you like the way it 
works. Each manufacturer treats the process of sequencing a little differ-
ently; you can probably find a sequencer that fits your style of working.
Drum machine
A drum machine contains not only the sounds of the drum set and other more 
exotic drums but also a sequencer to allow you to program rhythms. Figure 
5-4 shows you a typical drum machine.

Most drum machines contain hundreds of drum sounds, numerous preset 
rhythm patches, and the ability to program dozens of songs. All stand-
alone drum machines have pads on which you can play the part. The more 
advanced drum machines can give your rhythms a more human feel. Effects, 
such as reverb and delay, are also fairly common on the more advanced 
drum machines.

109
 Chapter 5: MIDI and Electronic Instruments
Sound module
A sound module is basically a stripped-down version of a synthesizer or drum 
machine. Sound modules don’t contain triggering devices, such as the keys 
for the keyboard or pads for the drum machine. What they do contain is a 
variety of sounds (often hundreds) that a master controller or sequencer 
triggers. The advantage of sound modules is that they take up little space and 
cost considerably less than their fully endowed counterparts, especially in 
the case of software synthesizers (generally called soft-synths).
 
If you already have a master keyboard, adding sound modules can be a cost- 
and space-effective way to add more sounds to your system.
Samplers
A sampler is a sound module that contains short audio samples of real instru-
ments. Most samplers come with sound libraries that contain hundreds of 
different types of sounds, from acoustic pianos to snare drums to sound 
effects. These sounds are often much more realistic than those that come in 
some synthesizers.
The real purpose of a sampler is to allow you to record your own sounds. For 
example, in the ’80s, it was cool to make a drum set out of unusual percussive 
sounds. A snare drum could be the sound of a flushing toilet (don’t laugh; I 
actually did this) or breaking glass. Tom-toms could be grunts set to certain 
pitches. You would be amazed at the strange stuff that people have turned 
into music — all with the help of a sampler.
Another common use of a sampler is for recording short sections of already-
recorded songs. This can be a melodic or rhythmic phrase, a vocal cue, or a 
single drum or synth sound. Sampling other songs is common in electronic 
music, rap, and hip-hop (be careful of copyright issues before doing this, 
however). If you’re into electronic music or hip-hop, you may find a sampler 
a necessary addition to your studio.
Soft-synths
If you’ve chosen a computer-based system to run your home studio on, 
your DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) software enables you to produce 
great sounds by using soft-synth plug-ins. Soft-synths are basically software 
equivalents of stand-alone synthesizers, sound modules, or samplers. As you 
can see in Figure 5-5, a soft-synth’s graphical user interface (GUI) is often 
designed to look just like a piece of regular hardware, complete with buttons 
and knobs.

110
Part II: Recording 101 
 
Figure 5-5: 
Computer-
based DAW 
users can 
choose 
soft-synths 
to create 
their 
synthesizer 
sounds.
 
Of course, soft-synths have advantages and disadvantages, as follows:
 
✓ Advantages: Soft-synths cost less than stand-alone units because no 
hardware is involved.
 
✓ Disadvantages: Unlike regular synthesizers, soft-synths need a computer 
to run and require quite a bit of processing power to work effectively. 
This can slow your computer system and prevent you from recording as 
many audio tracks or applying as many effect patches as you would like.
Countless soft-synth plug-ins are available for most DAW programs. The best 
way to find the soft-synths for your DAW program is to visit an Internet news-
group or message board that covers your software. Then do a search for soft-
synths or ask the other members what software they use.
Sound card
Most sound cards that you can install in your computer (or that come with 
a computer) have General MIDI sounds in them. Depending on the quality of 
your sound card, the sound may be decent or border on the unbearable.
 
To find out whether the GM sounds in your computer’s sound card are any 
good, play a MIDI file on your computer. First, do an Internet search for MIDI 
files (just type MIDI in your favorite search engine). Some sites require you 
to pay to download a song — especially for popular or familiar tunes — but 

111
 Chapter 5: MIDI and Electronic Instruments
many sites allow you to choose a song to listen to without downloading or 
paying a fee. Click a song and it should start playing automatically. You’ll 
immediately know whether you like the sound of your sound card.
 
If you bought a new sound card for your computer to record audio with, you’ll 
generally find that the sounds are pretty good. And with your audio program, 
you have access to soft-synth patches.
MIDI controller
A MIDI controller is a device that can control another MIDI device. MIDI con-
trollers come in many different formats. In fact, a MIDI controller can be any-
thing from a synthesizer to a drum machine or a computer to a xylophone.
When MIDI first came out, your controller choice was limited to a keyboard, 
but now you can choose among keyboards, wind controllers (for saxophones 
or other wind instruments), guitars, and drums. So even if you don’t play 
piano, you can find a controller that resembles an instrument that you know 
how to play. Look around, and you may find one (or more) MIDI controllers 
that allow you to create music your way.
Sequencer
Although you can get stand-alone sequencers and sequencers integrated 
into a synthesizer, you probably want a computer-based sequencer for your 
home studio. The reasons for this are many, but the overriding factor is that 
you can have your MIDI and audio tracks in one place, and a computer-based 
sequencer gives you more-powerful editing capabilities than a sequencer 
that’s contained in a box and that uses a tiny LCD screen.
Of course, if you want to do only a minimal amount of MIDI in your studio, you 
don’t necessarily need all the power of a computer-based sequencer program.
For example, imagine that you have a drum machine and an 8-track recorder 
that has synchronization capabilities (your owner’s manual describes 
whether the recorder can synchronize with other devices) and that you play 
guitar-based music. Being a guitar freak, you want to use six tracks for your 
guitars and two for your singing. With a MIDI connection from your drum 
machine to your recorder, you may be able to synch these two machines 
and wait to record your drum parts until the final mix. This effectively gives 
you a lot more tracks — one for each drum sound that you’re using because 
you can adjust the volume, pan, and sound of each instrument in your drum 
machine. This setup is similar to recording each instrument on a separate 
track in your recorder.

112
Part II: Recording 101 
MIDI interface
The MIDI interface allows you to send and receive MIDI information from a 
computer. Many sound cards have a MIDI port, but if you end up doing a lot 
of MIDI sequencing and use more than one sound module or external control-
ler, you need a separate MIDI interface, such as the one shown in Figure 5-6.

MIDI interfaces come in a staggering variety of configurations, so you need to 
consider several things when you buy a MIDI interface. The following ques-
tions can help you to determine your needs:
 
✓ What type of computer do you own? MIDI interfaces are usually con-
figured to connect to your computer using either a USB port or an 
audio interface, and MIDI interfaces use one of three available options: 
PCI, FireWire, or USB. (Chapter 3 has more details on audio-interface 
connection types.) You determine which option to use by the type of 
port(s) you have in your computer. For example, new Macs only have a 
USB port, although you can add a serial port if you remove the internal 
modem. A PC has either a parallel port or a USB port (and sometimes 
both). PCs also have a joystick port that accepts a special MIDI joystick 
cable (no MIDI interface is needed).
 
✓ How many instruments do you intend to connect? MIDI interfaces 
come with a variety of input and output configurations. Models are avail-
able with two ins and two outs, four ins and four outs, and even eight ins 
and eight outs. You can also buy “thru” boxes, which have one or more 
inputs and several outputs. If you have only one or two instruments, you 
can get by with a smaller interface (in this case, a 2×2 interface — two 
ins and two outs — would work great). If you have many instruments 
that you want to connect, you need a larger box.

Understanding Microphones
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering the various type of microphones
▶ Positioning microphones for the best sound
▶ Exploring a variety of preamps
▶ Understanding how to care for your microphones
A
 microphone’s job is generally to try to capture, as closely as possible, 
the sound of an instrument. But you can also use a microphone to 
infuse a specific sound characteristic into a performance. Likewise, a preamp, 
which boosts the signal of a microphone as the signal travels to the recorder, 
can be used to accurately represent a sound or to add texture and dimen-
sion to it. Microphones and preamps are the center of the sound engineer’s 
palette. Just as a painter has his paints and brushes, you have your micro-
phones and preamps. And just as a painter can create a stunning variety of 
visual textures with his tools, you too can make your creative statement with 
the judicious use of these two pieces of equipment.
In this chapter, I explore the two most versatile tools of your auditory craft. 
You look at the various types of microphones and preamps, and you gain an 
understanding of each one’s role in capturing a performance. You also dis-
cover what types of mics and preamps work for particular situations. To top 
it off, this chapter guides you through purchasing and caring for your pre-
cious new friends (the mics and preamps, that is). You can find out how to 
use your mics in Chapter 8, where I discuss specific mic placement options.
Meeting the Many Microphone Types
When you start looking at microphones, you basically find three different 
types of construction methods (condenser, dynamic, and ribbon) and three 
basic polarity patterns (omnidirectional, cardioid, and figure-8). The follow-
ing sections explore these various constructions and patterns and help you 
make sense out of them.

114
Part II: Recording 101 
Construction types
Whether a microphone is a $10 cheapie that has a cord permanently attached 
to it or a $15,000 pro model with gold-plated fittings, all microphones convert 
sound waves to electrical impulses that the preamp or mixer can read and 
the recorder can store. Each of the three construction types captures this 
auditory signal in a different way, and as such, each adds certain characteris-
tics to the sound. Here’s how the different mics affect sound:
 
✓ Condenser: This type tends to have a well-rounded shape to its fre-
quency response and a fast response, allowing it to often pick up high 
transient material, such as the initial attack of drum, very well. These 
mics can sound more natural, but they can also be somewhat harsh if 
placed too close to a high transient source.
 
✓ Dynamic: Dynamic mics tend to accentuate the middle of the frequency 
spectrum because the thick diaphragms (relatively speaking when com-
pared to a condenser mic) take longer to respond.
 
✓ Ribbon: Because the ribbon mic is relatively slow to respond to an 
auditory signal, it tends to soften the transients (the initial attack of an 
instrument) on instruments such as percussion and piano. The high 
end isn’t as pronounced as with other construction types, so these mics 
tend to have a rounder, richer tone.
I detail these aspects in the following sections. In most cases, the type of con-
struction dictates the general cost category in which the mics fit.
Condenser microphones
The condenser microphone is without a doubt the most popular style of 
microphone used in recording studios (home or commercial). Condenser 
mics are sensitive and accurate, but they can also be expensive. Recently, 
however, condenser mics have come down in cost, and you can buy a decent 
one for about $200. Very good ones start at about $500.
 
The condenser microphone has an extremely thin metal (or metal-coated 
plastic or Mylar) diaphragm (the part that senses the signal). The diaphragm 
is suspended in front of a metal plate (called a backplate). Polarizing voltage 
is applied to both the diaphragm and the backplate, creating a static charge 
in the space between them. When the diaphragm picks up a sound, it vibrates 
into the field between it and the backplate. This produces a small signal that 
can then be amplified. Figure 6-1 shows how a condenser mic is constructed.
 
Condenser mics need a small amount of voltage (from 9 to 48 volts) to func-
tion. If you use a condenser mic, make sure that either it has its own internal 
battery or you have a preamp or mixer equipped with phantom power, which 
is described in the nearby sidebar.

Diaphragm
Here are a few additional decisions you need to make when selecting a con-
denser mic:
 
✓ Tube or solid-state? Condenser mics can be made with either transistors 
(known as solid-state) or vacuum tubes. As with all the tube or solid-state 
gear, base your decision on the sound characteristics that you prefer. For 
the most part, tube condenser mics have a softer high end and a warmer 
overall tone. Solid-state mics, on the other hand, are often more transpar-
ent — the sound is captured by them with less coloration.
 
✓ Large- or small-diaphragm? Condenser mics come in two broad 
categories: small-diaphragm and large-diaphragm (see Figure 6-2). 
Large-diaphragm mics are more popular than their smaller-diaphragm 
counterparts, partly because large-diaphragm condenser mics have a 
more pronounced bottom end (low frequencies). Large-diaphragm mics 
also possess a lower self noise, that is, noise created by the microphone.
Phantom power
Phantom power is a term used to describe the 
small amount of voltage that is applied to a con-
denser microphone. This power enables the mic 
to function properly. In most cases, the phan-
tom power comes from your mixer or preamp 
and is sent to the microphone through one of 
the wires in the XLR cable. (I cover XLR cables 
in Chapter 3.) Some condenser mics have an 
internal battery or separate power supply that 
provides this power.
A switch, which is usually located on the 
preamp or mixer, enables you to turn the phan-
tom power off and on. Even though dynamic 
microphones don’t use phantom power, this 
small amount of voltage doesn’t damage them.

116
Part II: Recording 101 
 
 Before you buy only large-diaphragm mics, consider this: Small-
diaphragm condenser mics often have an even frequency response 
and can more accurately capture instruments with a pronounced high-
frequency component (violins, for instance).
 
Figure 6-2: 
Condenser 
mics can 
have either 
small or 
large 
diaphragms.
 
Dynamic microphones
You’ve probably had the chance to use a dynamic mic. The hugely popular 
Shure SM57 and SM58 often characterize this type of mic. Dynamic micro-
phones have several qualities that make them unique. They can handle a lot 
of volume (technically known as SPL, meaning sound pressure level), which 
makes them perfect for extremely loud signals, such as drums, amplifiers, 
and some rock vocalists. Dynamic mics are also not as transparent (they 
don’t accurately represent high frequencies) as condenser mics, so they 
often impart a “dirty” or gritty” sound to the signal.
 
The dynamic microphone uses a magnetic field to convert the sound impulse 
from the diaphragm into electrical energy, as shown in Figure 6-3. The dia-
phragm is often made of plastic or Mylar and is located in front of a coil of 
wire called a voice coil. The voice coil is suspended between two magnets. 

117
 Chapter 6: Understanding Microphones
When the diaphragm moves (the result of a sound), the voice coil moves as 
well. The interaction between the voice coil’s movement and the magnets 
creates the electrical signal.

Diaphragm
The sound of a dynamic mic can be described as somewhat boxy, meaning 
that these mics don’t represent the highest or lowest frequencies of your 
hearing spectrum accurately (not necessarily a bad thing). They are also 
durable. Rough treatment probably won’t damage them much, aside from the 
diaphragm, and a tough metal screen protects it. Dynamic mics are typically 
used for live shows. These mics are often very inexpensive to buy and main-
tain; you can get a good dynamic mic for about $100.
Ribbon microphones
A ribbon microphone produces its sound in much the same way as a dynamic 
mic. The diaphragm is suspended between two magnets. The ribbon mic dif-
fers from the dynamic mic in that it uses a thin ribbon of aluminum instead 
of plastic or Mylar (see Figure 6-4). Ribbon mics were popular from the 1930s 
through the 1960s but have, for the most part, now taken a backseat to con-
denser mics in today’s studios. This is mainly because ribbon mics are fragile 
and expensive and aren’t as transparent as condenser mics. In fact, a gust of 
wind or a strong breath blown into the diaphragm is all it takes to break an 
aluminum ribbon in one of these mics. (It’s not the end of the world, though; 
ribbons aren’t that expensive to replace — they generally cost $100 to $150.)
Ribbon mics are experiencing a renaissance because of the number of record-
ing engineers who are searching for an old, vintage sound. Ribbon mics have 
a unique sound that is often described as silky or smooth. This essentially 
means that the high frequencies tend to roll off slightly (gradually reduce) 
and the lower frequencies smear together a bit.

118
Part II: Recording 101 
Ribbon mics used to be fairly expensive (at least $1,000), but as interest in 
them has increased from digital recordists, you can now find some decent 
ones for just a few hundred dollars.

Polarity patterns
Microphones pick up sounds in different ways, which are known as polarity 
patterns. Here’s how the various patterns work:
 
✓ Omnidirectional mics can capture sounds all around them.
 
✓ Cardioid (or directional) mics pick up sounds just in front of them.
 
✓ Figure-8 (or bidirectional) mics pick up sounds from both the front 
and back.

119
 Chapter 6: Understanding Microphones
 
The polarity patterns on microphones are represented on a chart that often 
comes with the microphone (or is part of its spec sheet). This chart is often 
called a polar graph, and the graph shows how well the microphone picks up 
various frequencies in front of or behind it.
Omnidirectional
The omnidirectional mic can pick up sounds coming from anywhere around 
it. Omnidirectional mics are useful for situations where you want to capture 
not only the source sound but also the sound of the room that the source 
is coming from. You can find omnidirectional mics used in stereo pairs for 
drum overheads and groups of acoustic instruments, such as orchestras.
Omnidirectional mics are not generally used for close miking — when you 
place the mic less than a foot from the sound source — because they tend 
to catch too much background noise. You can see the pickup pattern of an 
omnidirectional mic in Figure 6-5. The round pattern shows that the mic 
picks up sound from all directions.
Cardioid
Cardioid microphones pick up the sound in front of them and reject sounds 
that come from behind. Cardioid mics are the most common types for live 
bands because you can control the sound that they pick up. If you have a car-
dioid mic on the tom-tom of a drum set, the mic picks up only the sound of 
that drum and not the sound from the other instruments around it.
 
The three types of cardioid microphones are cardioid, super-cardioid, and 
hyper-cardioid. The differences among the types of cardioid patterns of each 
mic aren’t that great. Check out the graphs in Figure 6-6 to see how the polar-
ity patterns of cardioid microphones differ.
Generally, you don’t need to think about the minor polarity-pattern differ-
ences among the types of cardioid mics when you buy or use a microphone. 
You won’t notice the practical differences in the way these three types of 
mics work.
 
Cardioid mics all produce more bass when they are close to the sound source. 
This is called the proximity effect. Essentially, the closer the mic is to its 
source, the more bass the mic picks up. You don’t find the proximity effect in 
omnidirectional or figure-8 mics. Many cardioid condenser mics have a bass 
roll-off switch that allows you to eliminate added bass that may occur from 
having the mic close to the source.

Figure-8
Figure-8 mics (also called bidirectional mics) pick up sound from both the 
front and back, but not all the way around. If you look at the graph in Figure 
6-7, you can see that sound is not effectively picked up from areas on the 
sides of the microphone.

Figure-8 mics are often used to record two instruments simultaneously. For 
example, you can place the microphone between two horn players with the 
side of the mic perpendicular to the players. This allows you to capture both 
instruments while eliminating any sound in front of the musicians.
 
Most figure-8 condenser mics have the same frequency response for both the 
front and back sides, but some ribbon mics produce very different responses, 
depending on whether the sound is coming from the front or the back. For 
instance, a Royer r121 mic picks up more high frequencies from the back side 

122
Part II: Recording 101 
of the mic than the front. You can use this to your advantage when recording 
an instrument. If the sound has too many low frequencies, just turn the mic 
around a little or a lot, depending on how many high frequencies you want to 
add (more on this in Chapter 9).
Multiple-pattern mics
Some condenser microphones can switch among various pickup patterns. 
These are generally large-diaphragm mics. These mics have a switch that 
allows you to choose from cardioid, omnidirectional, or figure-8 (refer to 
the right image in Figure 6-2). These mics can do this because they generally 
contain two sets of diaphragms and backplates, which are positioned back 
to back. You may want to have at least one of these types of microphones 
around to give you more variety in microphone positions.
 
The omnidirectional pattern in a multiple-pattern microphone works (and 
sounds) differently from a true omnidirectional mic. So, for critical applica-
tions (recording an orchestra, for instance), the multiple-pattern mic may not 
be a fair substitute for an exclusively omnidirectional mic.
Assessing Your Microphone Needs
Buying microphones is, without a doubt, one of the most critical decisions 
that you make when setting up your home studio. Using the right microphone 
for the job can mean the difference between recording okay tracks and truly 
spectacular ones.
A decade or so ago, you had to choose between inexpensive dynamic mics 
(what most home recordists could afford) and expensive condenser or ribbon 
mics (what the pro studios had). But, as luck would have it, you’ve entered a 
time in home recording where you have many more options. In fact, a whole 
line of project studio mics has recently emerged. This is relatively a new 
market in the long history of microphones that manufacturers have found 
to be hugely profitable, so the choices are expanding almost daily. In some 
cases, a $500 project studio mic can rival a $2,000-plus pro mic — at least for 
the home recordist’s purposes.
So the question that you’re inevitably going to ask is, “What microphones 
should I get for my home studio?” Good question. And the answer is, “Well, it 
depends on what you need.” So before I go into detail about what mics may 
be best for you, you should spend a minute assessing your needs. The follow-
ing questions may help you in your assessment:
 
✓ What type of music will you record? If you play rock or pop music, you 
should probably start with dynamic mics because they’re inexpensive 
and their limitations in high or low frequencies don’t matter as much as 

123
 Chapter 6: Understanding Microphones
if, for example, you wanted to record your string quartet. In this case, a 
pair of condenser mics would do the trick.
 
✓ What instruments will you record? Loud amps, drums, and screaming 
singers beg to be recorded with dynamic mics, whereas light percus-
sion, vocals, and stand-up basses shine through with large-diaphragm 
condenser mics.
 
✓ How many mics will you use at once? If you need to record your whole 
band at once, budget constraints may dictate your choice between 
dynamic and condenser mics or a condenser or ribbon mic for vocals. If 
you need only a couple of mics to record the occasional vocal or instru-
ment, you can invest more in each mic.
Deciding How Many Microphones 
and What Kind
You will likely build your microphone collection over time rather than buying 
all your mics at once. This is the best way to buy mics, because it gives you 
time to develop an understanding of what you can do with the microphone 
that you have before you plunk down your money for another one. You’re 
better off having a few mics that best fit your situation than having a whole 
bunch of mics that just sorta work for you.
If you’re like most people, your budget dictates how many mics you can buy 
and what kind they may be. In the following sections, I try to help you get 
the best mics for your recording needs and guide you through the process of 
slowly accumulating microphones.
 
Before you buy a ton of mics, know this: Many digital systems have an effect 
called a mic simulator. The mic simulator allows you to use a relatively inex-
pensive mic and get the sound of a much more expensive one. If your system 
has a mic simulator program (you can find out by searching through your 
system’s effects patches), I recommend that you get a basic dynamic mic first. 
You may find that you like the way the mic simulator sounds and discover 
that you don’t need as many mics as you thought.
Getting started
A basic mic setup consists of a couple of dynamic mics for drums, guitar 
amps, or other loud instruments and a decent large-diaphragm condenser 
mic for vocals or other acoustic instruments. The next sections lay out the 
mics that I would consider if I were starting out on a budget.

124
Part II: Recording 101 
Dynamic mics
A Shure SM57 is hands down the best choice for your first dynamic mic. This 
is a great dynamic mic for very little money — about $80. This mic works well 
for miking amps and drums and the occasional gritty vocal. Everyone should 
have at least one of these mics.
Large-diaphragm condenser mics
Your choice here depends on your voice and the acoustic sound that you’re 
looking for. I would check out the following mics:
 
✓ Studio Projects B1: This inexpensive mic is a good choice for your first 
large-diaphragm condenser mic. You can find one for about $80.
 
✓ MXL 990: This mic has a slightly different sound than the Studio 
Projects B1 and costs about the same ($70 to $80). Buy the mic that 
sounds better to you.
 
✓ MXL V63M: This mic is a step up from the MXL 990 — its street price is 
about $100 — and you may like this one better than its less expensive 
brother. Again, only buy the more expensive mic if you think it sounds 
better.
 
✓ Octava (Oktava) MK319: This mic is a little more expensive than the 
previous three — about $125 — but it’s still at the lower end of the price 
spectrum and may work better for your vocals than the others.
 
✓ Audio Technica AT3035: This mic is more expensive than the others I 
list here (about $200), but if you can afford it, check it out. Some people 
prefer the sound of this mic over that of the other mics.
 
A large-diaphragm condenser mic is the first condenser mic for most home 
recordists. These good all-around mics can work well for a lot of applications.
Movin’ on
After you have your basic mics, you can start to add a few more. If you intend 
to record your band, you need to at least mic the drum set (four mics can get 
you around the set). In this case, you can add a couple more dynamic mics 
and perhaps get one or two that are designed for particular applications. For 
instance, mics are made to work best on the kick drum of a drum set. At this 
point, you can also get a second condenser mic — maybe a small-diaphragm 
condenser mic this time or a large-diaphragm tube condenser mic. You may 
want to choose one that sounds different from the one you already have, or if 
you love the one that you have, you can get a second one just like it to use as 
a stereo pair.

125
 Chapter 6: Understanding Microphones
Dynamic mics
For additional dynamic mics, I would add one or two more SM-57s and try 
one of the following:
 
✓ Sennheiser e609: I like Sennheiser mics; these are some of my favor-
ite (and inexpensive) amp or kick drum mics. The e609 has a different 
sound than the venerable SM-57 and doesn’t cost much more — a little 
over $100 — so adding one of these lets you cover some more bases.
 
✓ Audio Technica ATM25: This is a pretty good kick drum mic for not a 
lot of money — about $200 — although it is more costly than some other 
dynamic mics. If you record drums live, this mic is worth trying.
Large-diaphragm tube condenser mics
If you’re on a budget (and who isn’t?), try out the following inexpensive large-
diaphragm tube condenser mics:
 
✓ Rode NTK: This is an awesome mic regardless of price, but for about 
$400, it’s one of the best deals available. This mic is good for vocals 
and acoustic instruments. I’ve even used a pair for the overheads on a 
drum set.
 
✓ Studio Projects T3: This mic has an advantage over the Rode NTK 
because it has a variable polar pattern selector, allowing you to choose 
among cardioid, figure-8, and omnidirectional patterns — and patterns 
in between. The NTK is cardioid only. This variability gives you more 
options when recording and increases the versatility of the mic, making 
this $600 mic worth checking out.
Small-diaphragm condenser mics
Though not sexy to most recordists, small-diaphragm condenser mics can 
come in handy. Here are a few inexpensive ones that are worth checking out:
 
✓ Octava (Oktava) MK012: This mic is a great buy. It’s inexpensive (under 
$100) and sounds good on many types of acoustic instruments — 
guitars, violins, cellos, double basses, drum overheads, and percussion. 
The only drawback to this mic is that quality control has been known to 
be, shall we say, variable. You need to try out each mic carefully before 
you buy it because some just don’t sound good.
 
✓ MXL 993: I don’t like this mic as much as the Octava, but if you can’t 
find the Octava or are squeamish about testing a bunch of mics to find 
a good one, the MXL 993 is worth considering. At about $80, it’s a pretty 
good-sounding mic.

126
Part II: Recording 101 
Going all out
As your mic collection grows, you’ll probably start looking for a vocal mic 
that works best for you. In this case, you may look at large-diaphragm tube 
condenser mics or even a ribbon mic.
 
Choosing a vocal mic is a personal thing. If you’re a singer, audition a bunch of 
mics by using your voice to see what sounds best to you. If you record more 
than one singer and each has a different type of voice (tenor or soprano, for 
instance), you may need to look for more than one vocal mic.
After this, consider buying a stereo pair of small-diaphragm condenser mics 
for drum overheads (mics placed over the drum set) or other multi-instrument 
applications. You may also want to start adding some higher-quality (and 
more expensive) mics to your collection. The following sections detail some 
mics that offer a good bang for the buck.
Dynamic mics
Here are a couple of higher-end dynamic mics that I use:
 
✓ Sennheiser MD421: This is arguably the industry-standard tom mic. It’s 
been used on tons of recordings over the years. If you intend to record 
drums with more than the basic 3- or 4-mic setup (see Chapter 9 for 
more details), having a couple of these tom mics is a necessity. They 
aren’t cheap — at about $350 each — but for their purpose, they are 
worth every penny.
 
✓ EV RE20: This is a common kick drum mic that is also used for amps 
and some vocals. You can get this mic for about $400 to $450.
Large-diaphragm condenser mics
You can find a ton of good large-diaphragm condenser mics, and the sky’s the 
limit on how much you can spend on them. That said, consider the following 
reasonably priced options:
 
✓ Shure KSM-44: I really like this mic. It’s a multipattern mic that offers 
cardioid, figure-8, and omnidirectional configurations. The sound is 
pretty neutral by today’s standards — many manufacturers like to boost 
the top and bottom ends of their mics to make them sound “sexy.” The 
KSM-44 doesn’t have this feature, and as a result, the mic is very versa-
tile. I often use one for drum overheads and other acoustic sources such 
as big percussion instruments (like surdos, congas, and djembes) and 
acoustic string instruments — and even as a room mic for ensembles. 
This mic costs about $650.

127
 Chapter 6: Understanding Microphones
 
✓ AKG C414B: This is another industry-standard mic that sounds great on 
a lot of sources — vocals, acoustic instruments, drums, and others. Like 
the KSM-44, this mic has selectable polar patterns. In this, you have five 
choices: omnidirectional, cardioid, wide-cardioid, hyper-cardioid, and 
figure-8. This mic sells for about $800.
 
✓ Soundelux U195: This is an awesome mic for a lot of sources, including 
many vocalists, percussion, and drums. (I love to use this as a room mic 
placed 6 to 8 feet in front of the kick drum.) This mic isn’t cheap — at 
about $1,200 — but you’ll never need to upgrade it.
Ribbon mics
Ribbon mics used to be very expensive and required a great preamp with lots 
of clean gain (volume) because they don’t produce a very strong signal. This 
is changing. You can now find a ribbon mic for just a few hundred dollars, 
and if you don’t have a high-gain preamp, you can find a mic that produces a 
stronger signal (called an active-ribbon mic). Here are some ribbon mics that I 
recommend:
 
✓ Octava ML19: This is the least expensive ribbon mic available, and it 
sounds pretty good, especially for the price (roughly $400). For the 
budget-minded recordist who needs a ribbon mic, you can’t go wrong 
with this one.
 
✓ AEA R84: This is one sexy mic. It looks gorgeous and sounds great. For 
classic “silky” vocals or to take the edge off instruments such as trum-
pets and other horns, this mic is awesome. Of course, awesome doesn’t 
come cheap — about $1,000 plus a good high-gain preamp. Still, if you 
like the vocals sound you can only get from a ribbon mic or if you record 
a lot of horns, you need to try this mic.
 
✓ Royer Labs 122: This is the first active-ribbon mic. It has electronics 
that boost the mic’s signal, so you don’t need a super high-gain preamp 
to get a good sound. Royer Labs’ ribbon mics are known as great mics, 
and this one costs about $1,500.
Small-diaphragm condenser mics
If your budget allows you to get a pair of great small-diaphragm condenser 
mics, the following two provide good value:
 
✓ Josephson C42: I can’t recommend this mic highly enough, especially 
the matched pair (model no. C42mp). A pair of these mics is great for 
drum overheads and almost every acoustic instrument I’ve tried them 
on. I love to use a single mic on double bass, a pair on piano, and a pair 
on a live ensemble. These mics run about $475 each, but you would be 
hard-pressed to find a mic at double the price that sounds better.

128
Part II: Recording 101 
 
✓ Peluso CEMC6: The CEMC6 mic is a nice unit, especially for under $300 
each. These mics rate almost as highly as the Josephsons. But if you’re 
on a tight budget, try one or a pair of these mics.
 
You won’t find either of these mics at the big music retailers, so if you’re inter-
ested in them, you’ll need to look around a bit. I suggest doing a search on 
Google (www.google.com) to find an Internet retailer. You can find a bunch 
of reputable dealers who carry them.
Finding the Right Mic for the Situation
Certain mics work better than others for particular situations. In this section, 
I present some typical applications to give you an idea of what types of mics 
are traditionally used for various purposes. (You can find more ideas about 
mic usage in Chapter 8, where I discuss specific miking techniques.)
 
When you consider a mic, think about the frequency spectrum that the 
instrument encompasses. If you use a dynamic mic for a symphonic orches-
tra performance, for example, you’ll be disappointed by the results because 
it lacks an accurate high-frequency response. On the other hand, using a 
small-diaphragm condenser mic on the tom-toms of a drum set makes them 
sound thin and is a waste of money because you can get by with a much less 
expensive dynamic mic for this purpose.
 
Microphone choice is fairly subjective. The following list contains some basic 
suggestions based on what is typically used:
 
✓ Vocals: Most people prefer the sound of a large-diaphragm condenser 
mic for vocals. If you have the budget, you may also want to audition 
some ribbon mics for your voice. A dynamic mic is best when you’re 
going for a dirty or raw sound (excellent for some harder rock, blues, or 
punk music) or if your singer insists on screaming into the mic. A small-
diaphragm condenser mic is rarely the first choice for most singers, but 
it’s not out of the question for some vocalists if you don’t mind a bright, 
present (high-frequency) sound.
 
✓ Electric guitar amp: A dynamic mic or a small-diaphragm condenser mic 
works well on an electric guitar amp. Some people use large-diaphragm 
condenser mics on guitar amps and like the added low frequencies that 
can result. A ribbon mic can sound great, but take care in placing the 
mic so that you don’t overload it and blow the ribbon. Move the mic 
back a bit or off to the side and you should be fine.
 
✓ Electric bass amp: Your first choice when miking an amplified elec-
tric bass is either a large-diaphragm condenser mic or a dynamic mic. 
Either one can capture the frequency spectrum that the bass guitar 

129
 Chapter 6: Understanding Microphones
encompasses. Small-diaphragm condenser mics aren’t a good choice 
because of their inherent high-frequency focus. I like ribbon mics for 
electric bass, but you need to take the same care as you would with a 
guitar amp.
 
✓ Acoustic guitar and other stringed instruments: A large- or small-
diaphragm condenser mic or a ribbon mic works well in most instances. 
A dynamic mic has too limited a frequency response to create a natural 
sound (but may create an effect that you like). Choose the large- or 
small-diaphragm type based on the overall frequency spectrum of the 
instrument. For example, to capture the depth of a guitar’s tone, choose 
a large-diaphragm mic, but for an instrument with a higher register, such 
as a violin or mandolin, a small-diaphragm mic works great. I’m partial 
to small-diaphragm condenser mics for these instruments because I can 
get more clarity and I don’t have to fight the low-end bump that often 
occurs with a large-diaphragm condenser mic.
 
✓ Horns: I’m partial to ribbon mics for horns. These types of mics can 
soften the tone slightly and make the horns sound more natural, espe-
cially if you mic closely (within a couple feet or so). My second choice is 
a large-diaphragm condenser mic in a figure-8 or omnidirectional pattern 
placed off to the side of the instrument a bit. For this, you need a large-
diaphragm condenser mic that has multiple patterns, such as the AKG 
C414B or the Shure KSM-44. Some people like a tube condenser mic, so if 
you’re on a budget, the Studio Projects T3 is a good place to start.
 
✓ Piano: Both large- and small-diaphragm condenser mics are generally 
used for piano. Your choice depends on where you place the mics and 
how the room sounds. For example, a great-sounding room begs for 
a pair of omnidirectional small-diaphragm mics placed away from the 
piano a bit. I’m not a fan of ribbon or dynamic mics for this instrument.
 
✓ Drum set: The tom-toms, snare drum, and kick (bass) drum all sound 
good with dynamic mics because they don’t contain high frequencies. 
You can also use large-diaphragm condenser mics, but be careful where 
you place them because if your drummer hits them, they’re toast.
 
✓ Cymbals: For the cymbals of a drum set, a pair of small-diaphragm 
condenser mics works well, although some people prefer to use a large-
diaphragm mic instead. A ribbon mic also sounds pretty good and 
can take some of the harshness of cymbals when recorded digitally. A 
dynamic mic would lack the high-frequency response to make the 
cymbals shine through in a mix.
 
✓ Miscellaneous percussion: Now, here’s a broad category. By miscel-
laneous, I mean shakers, triangles, maracas, and other higher-pitched 
percussion toys. For these instruments, either small- or large-diaphragm 
condenser mics can work well. If it’s a very quiet instrument, a large-
diaphragm mic would be preferable because of the higher self-noise of 
the small-diaphragm mic.

130
Part II: Recording 101 
You may choose a different type of mic, especially if you try to create a cer-
tain effect. For instance, using a ribbon mic on a metallic shaker rather than a 
small-diaphragm condenser mic softens the highest frequencies of the instru-
ment and gives it a mellower sound.
 
If you intend to record loud instruments — drums, amplified guitars, or 
basses, for example — look for a mic with a high SPL (sound pressure level) 
rating. This is a rating of how much volume (listed in decibels) the micro-
phone can handle before distorting. A high SPL is above 130 decibels.
Some professional condenser mics have a pad switch that allows you to 
reduce the sensitivity of the mic, thereby increasing its ability to handle high 
sound pressure levels.
Partnering Mics with Preamps
One of the most important relationships in your home studio is the one 
between your microphones and the preamp — the nice bit of hardware that 
boosts the mic’s signal so that it can be recorded. The greatest microphone in 
the world run through a cheap preamp won’t sound good. By the same token, a 
cheap mic plugged into a great preamp sounds only as good as the bad mic.
 
If your mixer includes XLR inputs (low-impedance microphone inputs), you 
already have internal preamps in the channels with the XLR jacks. For the 
most part, these preamps are of lesser quality than the external variety, but 
they may work for you. For instance, some home recordists swear by the 
internal preamps in the Mackie VLZ-Pro mixers.
Plug in your mic and listen to the sound that you get. If you like it, you may 
not need to buy external preamps right away. If not, you may have to allocate 
some of your gear money for an external preamp.
You can find three types of preamps in the marketplace — solid-state, 
vacuum tube, and hybrid — and each has its own characteristics. In the fol-
lowing sections, I explore some preamp styles and discuss how each relates 
to the sounds that are produced by the types of microphones I discuss ear-
lier in the chapter. This can help you understand the relationship between 
the microphone and preamp in your studio.
Solid-state
Solid-state preamps use transistors to boost the level of the microphone. 
These preamps can be designed to produce as clear and detailed a sound 
as possible (often referred to as “transparent”) or can be designed to add a 

131
 Chapter 6: Understanding Microphones
pleasing level of distortion (warmth) to your music. Solid-state preamps cost 
from a couple hundred to several thousand dollars.
A clean and clear solid-state preamp (such as the Earthworks or GML 
brands) is a great choice if you want as natural a sound as possible on your 
recording of an instrument or if you are using a microphone that has a sound 
quality that you want to hear as clearly as possible. For example, I particu-
larly like the way that a solid-state preamp works in conjunction with a tube 
condenser or ribbon mic. The warmth and smoothness of these types of 
microphones shine through clearly with a clean solid-state preamp.
On the other hand, a more aggressive (warm or pleasingly distorted) solid-
state preamp, such as those modeled after the classic Neve designs, can add 
just a touch of “grit” to certain instruments. These types of preamps are great 
with dynamic, ribbon, or condenser mics, especially when recording drums, 
guitar, and some vocals.
Vacuum tube
These preamps use vacuum tubes to process and amplify the microphone’s 
signal. This generally adds some coloration to the sound of your mic (how 
much and what kind of coloration depends on the particular preamp). As 
you’ve undoubtedly discovered after reading any other chapter in this book, 
digital recording aficionados love the sound of tube gear, especially tube 
preamps. The advantage of a tube preamp is that it can add a warm sound 
to your mics. The disadvantage is that you often can’t get rid of this colored 
sound. Professional recording engineers often have several tube preamps in 
their studios to give them different coloration options.
 
The preamps that are included in your mixer are solid-state. If you find 
that you want the colored sound of a tube preamp, you need to buy an 
external one.
Tube preamps are great for imparting a subtle low-frequency addition to the 
sound of the microphone signal. Tube preamps also seem to slightly soften 
the higher frequencies. If you’re like most people, you’ll like the addition of a 
tube preamp, especially if you intend to record rock, blues, or acoustic jazz 
music. The downside is that all-tube preamps are expensive, with the least 
expensive costing about $1,000 (the Peavey VMP-2) and most running several 
thousand dollars (brands like Manley Labs, for instance).
I prefer to use tube preamps with drums and any “woody” instrument (acous-
tic guitar, for instance). In this case, I often reach for a large-diaphragm 
condenser mic, and in extreme cases, I may even use a large-diaphragm tube 
condenser mic with the tube preamp (for an extra dose of “tubiness”).

132
Part II: Recording 101 
Hybrid
A hybrid preamp contains both solid-state and tube components to boost 
the mic’s signal. Most of the inexpensive (under $1,000) “tube” preamps that 
you find in the marketplace are actually hybrids. An advantage to this design 
approach is that the preamp can often be adjusted to have varying degrees of 
that warm tube sound. The disadvantage is that these relatively inexpensive 
tube preamps don’t have as clear a sound as a great solid-state preamp, and they 
don’t have quite the same pleasing character as an expensive all-tube preamp.
For most home recordists, this type of preamp offers a lot of flexibility 
and can allow you to get either the fairly clear, open sound of a solid-state 
preamp or the warm, colored sound characteristic of a classic tube preamp. 
If you can afford only one external preamp, one of these hybrid versions may 
be right for you.
 
The countless hybrid preamps on the market vary widely in price and sound 
quality. (In fact, most of the hybrid preamps are marketed as tube preamps.) 
Your best bet in choosing a hybrid — or any preamp for that matter — is to 
do some research. Talk to people, read reviews, visit Internet forums, and 
then audition the two or three that stand out to you. Choose the one that you 
think sounds best for your needs.
Considering Compressors
A compressor enables you to alter the dynamic range (that is, the differ-
ence between the softest and loudest sound) of an instrument. Along with 
the microphone and preamp, the compressor is often added to the signal 
chain before it goes to the mixer. The advantage of using a compressor in 
the signal chain before it hits the mixer is that you can control the tran-
sients and have a hotter (higher) signal level going into the converters 
or recorder. This hotter level used to be necessary when recording at 16 
bits, but with 24-bit recording, you don’t need to worry as much about 
getting the highest signal into your system. I discuss setting optimal levels 
in more detail in Chapter 7.
If you record a lot of vocals or real drums, a decent external compressor may 
be a good idea — just go easy with it (again check out Chapter 7). You can 
find some great-sounding compressors for as little as $200. My favorite is the 
FMR Audio RNC-1773 (a really nice unit for the money).
 
As long as you’re looking at preamps and compressors, take a look at some 
channel strip devices, which are integrated preamp, compressor, and equalizer 
combos. For some people (and maybe you), a channel strip device is the way 

133
 Chapter 6: Understanding Microphones
to go. It allows you to have just one unit, reducing the amount of cords, and 
it’s designed to make the three parts function well together. Quite a few great-
sounding channel strip devices are available for under $500.
Analyzing Some Microphone Accessories
Along with your new mics, you’re going to need a few accessories. These 
include mic cords, mic stands, and pop filters.
Microphone cords
Microphone cords can cost from about $10 to several hundred dollars. 
You’re probably asking yourself, “Is there really a difference between a $10 or 
$20 mic cable and one that sells for hundreds of dollars?”
My answer is, “Supposedly — but chances are, you’ll never hear it.” Let me 
qualify this answer a little. Unless you have a very good mixer, recorder, 
microphones, preamps, analog/digital and digital/analog converters, moni-
tors, and ears, you’re wasting your money on expensive microphone cords. I 
know only one sound engineer (not me though — I’ve spent too many years 
behind the drums) who claims that he can hear the difference between an 
average mic cord and one of the expensive ones. And even he says that the 
difference is very subtle. (It would have to be; otherwise, I would hear the dif-
ference, too.)
 
Don’t waste your money on an expensive mic cord (or any cord) until the cord 
is the weakest link in your signal chain. By then, spending a couple hundred 
dollars on a cord will seem trivial because you’ll already have invested tens 
(or hundreds) of thousands of dollars in top-quality gear.
Microphone stands
A sturdy mic stand is essential for your studio. Mic stands are relatively inex-
pensive, so resist the temptation to buy a flimsy one. A good mic stand has a 
sturdy base and can securely hold your mics.
Good mic stands cost about $30 and have either a round cast iron base (great 
for getting into tight spaces) or a tripod base. Either one works well.

Pop filters
A pop filter is a nylon screen that eliminates the “pops” (technically called 
plosives) that singers make when they sing. Plosives are the result of sudden 
bursts of air projected into the mic (from singing words starting with Ps and 
Ts, for example). If you record vocals, a pop filter is a must-have.
 
Pop filters are relatively inexpensive (starting at about $20), but if you want 
to make your own, use a pair of tights or panty hose and a coat hanger. Bend 
the coat hanger into a circle and stretch the nylons or panty hose over it. 
You can attach the coat hanger to the mic stand by using duct tape. Adjust 
the coat hanger so that the pop filter is 4 to 6 inches away from the micro-
phone, and then have the vocalist sing through it. Check out Figure 6-8 to see 
a homemade pop filter.

Caring for Your Microphones
After investing hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in microphones, you 
probably want to know how to take care of them properly. Caring for or stor-
ing your microphones isn’t rocket science. Just follow the general guidelines 
and ideas that follow, and you’ll keep your mics in tip-top shape.

135
 Chapter 6: Understanding Microphones
 
A good microphone lasts a lifetime. Take care of your mics, and they’ll give 
you years of service.
Daily care
The most important thing to keep in mind when using your mics is to resist 
the temptation to blow into them. I know you’ve probably seen someone on 
stage blow into a mic and yell “Test” to see whether it is working. And you 
figure that’s how the pros must check their mics. Well, it isn’t. Blowing into a 
mic is a sure way to literally blow out the diaphragm in some mics, especially 
those expensive ribbon mics. To determine whether a mic is working, just 
speak into it in a normal voice.
 
You don’t need to blow or yell into any mic unless, of course, your singer’s 
style is to yell into the mic and you’re trying to set the input level. In this 
case, offer him or her your trusty dynamic mic and keep that expensive 
ribbon mic hidden.
Another thing to remember when handling your mics is that they can be frag-
ile. Condenser and ribbon mics don’t survive rough handling well. In fact, if you 
drop a condenser or ribbon mic, you may break it (this is another good reason 
to have a sturdy stand). Dynamic mics, on the other hand, are more durable, 
which is why they are often used for live applications and on drums. (It’s not 
uncommon for an overzealous drummer to whack them by accident — as a 
drummer, I know about this firsthand).
Try to keep your mics away from dust and high humidity. Dust is probably 
the number one enemy of a microphone because the dust can settle on the 
diaphragm and reduce the sensitivity of the mic — and even alter its fre-
quency response. Always cover your mics or put them away when you’re not 
using them.
Storage
Most professionals have mic lockers, where they can safely keep their mics 
when they’re not in use. Mic lockers come in several varieties. You can make 
a special locked box fitted with foam padding that has a cutout for each mic, 
or you can keep your mics in their pouches or cases (if the mic came with a 
case) in a closet or cabinet.
Regardless of the type of storage cabinet that your have, try to handle your 
mics as little as possible. In fact, if you have a mic that you use a lot, I recom-
mend leaving it on a secure stand rather than repeatedly dragging it out of its 
case or storage cabinet.

136
Part II: Recording 101 
 
If you do leave your mic out on its stand, cover the mic with a plastic bag and 
close the open end around the mic when it’s not in use (see Figure 6-9). This 
keeps out the dust.
 
Figure 6-9: 
Covering 
your 
microphone

Humidity can also be a problem for microphones. If you live in a humid 
environment, store your mics with a bag of silica gel next to them. (Silica 
gel, which absorbs moisture, is the stuff that comes in the packaging of a lot 
of electronic gear.) You can find silica gel listed as desiccant packets (Desi 
Paks) by the manufacturer. You can order silica gel in quantities of as little as 
ten from the following manufacturer:
Hydrosorbent Products, P.O. Box 437, 25 School Street, Ashley Falls, MA 
01222 (www.dehumidify.com)
You can also do an Internet search by typing “Desi Pak” (include the quota-
tion marks) into your favorite search engine.

instruments that are plugged directly into your

explores the process of setting the best levels for both 
plugged-in and miked instruments. Chapter 8 shows you 
the fundamentals of microphone placement and intro-
duces you to common approaches. Chapter 9 digs into the 
specifics of microphone placement for a variety of common

Getting a Great Source Sound
In This Chapter
▶ Setting levels properly
▶ Making your guitar sound great
▶ Getting the best sound from your keyboards
▶ Keeping your microphones from overloading your system
T
he quality of your recording relies heavily on two things: how your 
instruments sound and how well you get that sound into your computer 
without messing it up. The problem is that anyone can easily mess up the 
sound or at least fall short of getting the best possible sound.
This chapter gives you the knowledge to keep bad sound — or sound that’s 
not as good as it could be — from happening. In this chapter, I describe 
signal flow and the role that it plays in shaping the sound of your instrument. 
I also give you tips on how to get great guitar sounds and killer keyboard 
sounds without hassle. To top it off, I spend a few pages getting you up to 
speed on miking effectively.
Making Sense of the Signal Chain
The signal chain is the path that your sound travels from its creation (your 
guitar, keyboard, or voice) to your recorder. This path often includes several 
steps — and pieces of gear — that need to be optimized so that you don’t 
end up with too much or too little sound going to your system. I cover the 
flow of various signal chains in detail in Chapter 4, but here’s an overview of 
the process. Figure 7-1 shows the straightforward signal chain for a mic going 
into a studio-in-a-box recorder.

In this example, the sound originating from your voice enters the micro-
phone, travels to a preamp-equipped input in your device where it’s ampli-
fied, is converted into digital information within the device, and finally gets 
sent into the recording software section of your recorder and the hard drive, 
where it’s stored.
The key to a good instrument or mic sound is getting each signal in the chain 
set to its optimal level. This particular signal chain involves just two places 
where you can make adjustments to your signal levels, as follows:
 
✓ The source: In the example shown in Figure 7-1, the microphone’s place-
ment has a huge effect on the signal level that goes into your computer. 
Moving the mic just a couple inches can have a significant impact on your 
signal level at the preamp. A good, solid level keeps you from having to 
crank up your preamp too far, which causes noise. If the level is too hot, 
though — hot in the sense of a solid signal between –12dB and –6dB — you 

141
 Chapter 7: Getting a Great Source Sound
risk getting distortion at the mic. This same concept holds true for key-
boards or other electronic instruments, as well as guitars plugged directly 
into your interface.
 
✓ The preamp-equipped input: You adjust this level to get the right level 
in your recorder. I discuss the optimal signal level for different systems 
in the next section.
Setting Optimal Signal Levels
Getting a sound signal to the recorder takes several steps. The path that the 
sound takes from the instrument or microphone to the recorder is called the 
signal chain (see the previous section). You need to be aware of the signal level 
at all of these steps to get the best sound possible. Too much gain at one stage 
forces you to reduce the gain at another. Likewise, too little gain at one point 
may require you to overdrive (bump up the gain) during the next stage.
 
Incorrect gain structuring results in a signal that’s too low, which creates 
noise, or a signal that’s too high, which causes distortion. In fact, with poor 
gain structuring, you can have a signal that is both too quiet and distorted.
How you set the levels that you record to disk has a lot to do with how good 
(or bad) your performance sounds. The key to getting good recording levels 
is to get as hot (high) a signal as you can without going over the maximum 
that the converter or recorder can handle. If you use analog tape, you have 
some leeway in how hot your signal can get, but if you record digitally, you 
don’t have that luxury. Anything over the baseline of 0dB is going to clip — a 
nice recording term that means distort. 0dB, by the way, doesn’t mean “no 
sound.” Instead, it refers to the highest level that a digital system can handle 
without clipping the signal.
How hot is hot enough, you ask? Well, it depends on who you talk to and at 
what bit depth you record. Because you’re reading my book, here’s my take 
on the best levels at which to record:
 
✓ 16-bit systems: By this point in the book (assuming that you’ve read 
other sections on digital recording), you know that I’m not a fan of 16-bit 
recording. This is because to record with enough headroom, you need 
to turn the incoming level down so much that you start to lose sound 
quality; that is, you’re using fewer than 16 bits and lowering the resolu-
tion of your system. In this case, I usually recommend setting your level 
higher in a 16-bit system than in a 24-bit system — usually with peaks no 
higher than –6dB. This allows some room for transients (check out the 
section “Making the Most of Microphones,” later in this chapter) while 
preserving as much resolution as possible.

142
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 
 
✓ 24-bit systems: Because plenty of bits are available, you have more 
wiggle room before your start to lose sound quality. For 24-bit systems, 
I suggest that you record with your peak level at or below –12dB. This 
gives you enough room for transients to sneak through without clipping 
your system.
 
When you set your recording levels (do this by playing a section of your 
song), keep the following points in mind:
 
✓ Keep an eye on the clip light on your preamp/input. Not all inputs 
have a clip light, but if yours does, it’s most likely located next to the 
trim knob. Sending too hot a signal through your preamp/input is the 
first way you can create distortion. Your clip light should illuminate 
only faintly once in a while, if at all. If your clip light is glowing red, your 
signal is way too hot and you may end up with distortion. (Check the 
owner’s manual for your preamp to see when the clip light is set to acti-
vate. Some clip lights are set to go off at –6dB, others illuminate at –3dB, 
and still others light at 0dB.)
 
✓ Use the meters as a guide. Both your mixer and recorder have meters 
that show you the level of the signal going in. Both of these levels are 
important, so keep an eye on them. Make sure that the meters never go 
above 0dB and that they peak out at a maximum of –12dB to –6dB. Also, 
be aware of whether you’re monitoring pre or post levels, which I dis-
cuss in the next section.
 
✓ Trust your ears. Even with the clip light and meters, you still need to 
listen carefully to the signal. Many of the level meters on digital record-
ers are fairly slow to respond and can often miss sudden, extreme tran-
sients. If you hear any clipping or occasional harshness in the sound, 
turn the level down, regardless of what your meters tell you.
 
✓ When in doubt, turn down the level. If you can’t tell whether the sound 
is clean, don’t be afraid to turn the level down a little. Recording at –16dB 
instead of –12dB isn’t going to ruin your track, but a clipped note can.
Understanding Pre and Post Levels
Most digital systems provide several options for monitoring meter levels. 
You can have prefader input levels, postfader input levels, prefader track 
levels, postfader track levels, and master bus levels (see Figure 7-2). Even 
with the same signal, different kinds of levels (prefader, postfader, input, 
track master bus, and so on) may end up showing different readings on 
your meters.

Part III: Getting Ready to Record 
Interpreting the various levels
I try to clear up what all these different levels mean in the following list:
 
✓ Prefader input levels: The prefader input level shows you the level 
of the signal going into the mixer’s channel strip before the signal hits 
the EQ or fader (hence the term prefader). Your sound source and trim 
adjustment (either on the mixer or a separate preamp) control the level 
shown on this meter.
 
 If your signal is too low or too hot and you don’t have a separate 
preamp, adjust the trim knob on your mixer. If you’re using a separate 
preamp, adjust the trim knob on your outboard preamp. You can also 
make adjustments to this level at the sound source. This could be 
either the output level of your instrument or the placement of your 
microphone.
 
✓ Postfader input levels: The postfader input level shows your signal level 
after the signal has traveled through the input channel’s channel strip, 
that is, after the EQ and fader settings.
 
 This level is different from the prefader input level only if your fader 
is somewhere other than unity gain (or 0dB) or if you’ve made some 
adjustments to the EQ. To be specific, if you’ve removed any frequen-
cies with the EQ or set your fader below 0dB, your postfader level is 
lower than the prefader level. Likewise, if you’ve added frequencies 
with the EQ or placed your fader above unity, your level is higher than 
it was going in.
The straight-line rule
Most professional engineers are taught to 
record by using the straight-line rule. This rule 
comes from the old days of analog recording. It 
is thought of as being not only good engineering 
practice but also a courtesy to any other engi-
neer who may handle your tracks.
The straight-line rule basically involves set-
ting up your input levels so that they roughly 
match the levels that you want when you mix 
the song. You do this by setting your channel 
fader at 0dB (also marked as Unity on some 
mixers) and adjusting your input gain (the trim 
knob on your mixer or preamp) until you have 
a clean signal (no distortion) on the recorder’s 
meters. The signal’s level needs to be approxi-
mately the same as the level of the instrument 
in the final mix. For some instruments, such as a 
snare drum, the level peaks close to 0dB, but on 
other instruments, such as the string section, 
the level may be near –10dB. If you follow the 
straight-line rule, when you’re ready to mix your 
tracks, set all your faders at 0dB — and you’ll 
have a rough mix.
The courtesy is that if someone then takes 
your recorded tracks to another system with 
another engineer, that engineer only has to set 
the faders at 0dB and everything is ready for 
final adjustments.

145
 Chapter 7: Getting a Great Source Sound
 
✓ Prefader track levels: This is the most important level of your input 
signal chain (that is, if a most important level exists). This meter shows 
you what is actually recorded to the hard drive of the recorder.
 
 If you’re using an analog mixer and a stand-alone recorder, you see this 
level on the recorder, not the mixer.
 
 This level matches the level of the postfader input channel routed to the 
recorder channel. If you have more than one input channel routed to a 
recorder track, this level is generally higher than each of the individual 
input postfader levels. This is because the signals combine to produce a 
higher overall level (called summing). If this is the case and the prefader 
track level is too high, you need to adjust the levels on all the tracks that 
are routed to this channel to drop the level coming in (the submix fader 
level, if you have these tracks run through the submix bus).
 
✓ Postfader track levels: The postfader track level shows you the level 
after you make adjustments to the track channel’s fader or EQ settings. 
Like the postfader input level, the postfader track level is different from 
the prefader track level if you’ve made adjustments to either the EQ or 
the channel fader settings.
 
✓ Master bus levels: This level shows you the sum of all the levels being 
routed to the master bus. Unless you have only one channel going to the 
master bus, this level is different than any of the individual levels going 
to it because all levels from all the instruments are taken into account 
(summed). This is the level that is most important when you’re mixing 
because this is the level that the 2-track master records.
 
Not all types of systems have all these level-monitoring options. For example, 
if you have an analog mixer, you may not have meters on anything except the 
recorder (prefader track level) and the master bus (master bus level).
Looking at some examples
You can use the various monitoring sources to find out where in your signal 
chain you may be introducing distortion or where you need to boost the 
signal. If you find the source of the signal problem, you don’t have to over-
compensate at a different part of the signal path. For example, perhaps you 
connect a microphone to an external preamp and set the trim on the preamp 
for a good, hot signal. The prefader track level going to the recorder, how-
ever, is too low. In this case, you can check the postfader input level to see 
whether something is squashing your signal. The fader may be set too low, or 
some EQ may be set to reduce some frequencies. To fix the problem, you can 
either raise the fader or adjust your EQ until your level at the prefader track 
meter is where you want it to be.

146
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 
Another scenario is when you have a recorded track that has even levels (as 
seen on the prefader track level) but you’re getting distortion at the master 
bus (master bus level). In this case, check the postfader track level to see 
whether it looks different than the prefader level. It most likely will, and you 
can fix the problem by adjusting either the fader or the EQ until the level 
is tamed. If both the prefader and postfader track levels look the same, the 
combined levels that come from more than one track to the master bus are 
probably causing the distortion. In this case, you need to reduce the levels 
from all the tracks going to the master bus to bring the master bus level 
down a bit.
 
Don’t get too stressed about your levels. Use your ears and trust yourself. If 
you get noticeable digital clipping (distortion), just record the part again. One 
of the great things about digital recording is that you can erase and rerecord a 
performance as many times as you want without compromising sound quality.
Getting a Great Guitar Sound
Do you wanna know how to get the absolute best, most rich, engaging guitar 
sound? Well, I wish I could tell you, but alas, I can’t. This is something you’re 
going to need to figure out by listening as you tweak your gear. That said, you 
can get your sound into your computer in four ways, and each way has its 
plusses and minuses, as I describe in the following list:
 
✓ Directly from your guitar into your instrument input: The instrument 
input in your system could be located in your analog mixer (stand-
alone systems), your recorder (SIAB systems), or your audio interface 
(computer-based systems). This assumes that your instrument input can 
handle a direct connection from a guitar. (Most can, but check to make 
sure that the one you have or want has this capability. If it doesn’t, you 
need to get a direct box to put between your guitar and your instrument 
input. I talk about direct boxes in Chapter 1.) By using this method, the 
sound you get from your guitar is pretty much the same sound you’re 
going to get recorded.
 
 You may not like the sound — in fact, I’ll bet you won’t. The solution to 
this unfortunate state of affairs is to use a plug-in (or more than one) in 
your recording program to get the sound you want. This is a common 
way to get a guitar sound, and tons of good plug-ins can help, including 
plug-ins for providing distortion, delay, chorus, and even special amp 
simulators that are designed to sound like popular guitar amplifiers. 
One advantage to this approach is that you can tweak the sound of your 
guitar as much as you want after it’s recorded. The disadvantage is that 
you can easily become afflicted with indecision disorder and be unable 

147
 Chapter 7: Getting a Great Source Sound
to pick the sound you want. Also, many guitar-tone connoisseurs feel 
that getting the sound this way isn’t as good as miking up an amp with 
the sound you want.
 
✓ From your guitar to an amp simulator and from the amp simulator into 
your instrument input: Amp simulators are like the plug-ins that you 
can get for your software, only they’re stand-alone units that already 
have the various sounds in them. A bunch of stand-alone amp simula-
tors are available on the market, and most offer decent simulations of 
the most popular guitar amps. This can be a good solution for many 
people, but the disadvantage of doing this — instead of adding your 
effects in the computer — is that after you record your sound through 
an amp simulator, you’re stuck with that sound. Of course, if you often 
get hit with indecision disorder, this may be a good solution for you.
 
✓ From your guitar into your amp and from your amp’s line output to 
your instrument input: Recording a guitar this way is great for people 
who have an amp that they like the sound of but who don’t want to 
mic a speaker. When you follow this approach, you have three volume 
controls to adjust to get your level into your recorder — your guitar, 
your amp, and your interface. You may have to take some time tweaking 
these settings to get the best possible sound.
 
✓ From your guitar into your amp with a mic picking up the speaker’s 
sound: This is the old standby approach because you get to record 
the actual sound you’re used to hearing coming out of your amp. 
With this method, having the right mic and mic placement makes all 
the difference in the world. I offer some specific guitar-amping mic 
techniques in Chapter 9.
 
There is no single way to get a great guitar sound. Don’t be afraid to experi-
ment. You may just come up with a sound that really moves you.
Creating a Killer Keyboard Sound
They key to getting a killer keyboard sound is making sure that you get the 
sound into your system without messing it up (no pressure here). Depending 
on your gear, keyboard sounds can be brought into your system in one of the 
following ways:
 
✓ Using the analog outputs in your keyboard: For an external keyboard 
that contains the sounds you want to record, plug an instrument cord 
from the main outputs of your keyboard to the corresponding number of 
inputs in your system. Turn your keyboard volume up between 1/2 and 3/4 
or until you get a decent signal to register in your recorder. If your instru-
ment input has a volume (gain) control, adjust it and the volume of your 
keyboard until you get a solid sound without distortion.

148
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 
 
 Follow the guidelines that I list in the section “Setting Optimal Signal 
Levels,” earlier in this chapter, to get your best signal levels.
 
✓ Recording MIDI data and adding the sound later: If you have a MIDI-
capable keyboard and a MIDI sequencer, you can record your musical 
performance as MIDI data and assign the sound later. In this case, con-
nect your keyboard to your MIDI sequencer. This can be done using a 
MIDI cable connected to MIDI ports in each device, or it can be done 
with a USB connection if you have a USB-equipped keyboard and MIDI 
sequencer (such as a software program in a computer). Chapter 5 
explains how to make the connections for this.
 
 Because you’re recording MIDI data instead of an audio signal, you don’t 
need to worry about setting the record level. Chapter 12 explains the 
process of recording MIDI sequences in detail.
Making the Most of Microphones
Finding a great sound from a mic is key to getting a great-sounding record-
ing. To do this, you need to use the best mic for the application and place it 
where it can sound its best. This requires not only knowledge of the different 
types of mics that are available (see Chapter 6) but also an understanding of 
how these mics are used for a variety of instruments (see Chapter 9). In the 
following sections, I give you a quick tutorial on setting optimal levels of your 
microphones to help you get the most out of the mics and techniques I pres-
ent in the other miking chapters.
The most difficult part of getting a good sound by using a microphone is 
dealing with sudden, extreme increases in the sound signal. These blips are 
called transients, and they regularly happen when a drum is first struck, when 
a vocalist sings certain syllables (for example, those that begin with a P), and 
when a guitar player picks certain notes. In fact, because you can’t always 
control the amount of force that you apply to an instrument, transients 
can happen at any time, with any instrument, and without warning. (Highly 
trained musicians produce fewer extreme transients because they have a 
greater mastery over their muscular movements.)
 
In digital recording, all it takes is one slight, unexpected note to cause clipping 
and distortion, ruining what may otherwise be a perfect musical performance. 
Believe me, nothing is so heart-wrenching as listening to the perfect take 
(recorded performance) and hearing the unmistakable sound of digital distor-
tion. Although you can’t eliminate transients (they are part of an instrument’s 
character), you can tame extreme transients that often cause clipping (distor-
tion). You can do this in the following three ways:

149
 Chapter 7: Getting a Great Source Sound
 
✓ Set your levels with enough headroom to handle these transients. I 
cover this step in the section “Setting Optimal Signal Levels,” earlier in 
this chapter.
 
✓ Minimize transients with proper mic placement. I explain this process 
in the next section.
 
✓ Run the signal through a compressor when recording. The section 
“Compressing carefully,” later in this chapter, gives you the lowdown on 
this process.
Placing mics properly
A microphone that’s placed too close to a loud sound source or pointed too 
directly toward the point of attack can easily pick up extreme transients. In 
most cases, you just need to pull the mic away from the instrument a little or 
turn it ever so slightly to avoid a signal that’s too high. I don’t go into detail 
here because I cover mic placement thoroughly in Chapter 9.
 
The main thing to keep in mind when placing your microphones is to experi-
ment. Don’t be afraid to spend time making small adjustments. After all, the 
track you save could be your own.
Compressing carefully
Compressors are processors that allow you to control the dynamics of a 
signal — and boy, are they ever versatile. You can use compressors on the 
front end while tracking (recording) instruments to make sure that you don’t 
have stray transients. You can use them to level off an erratic performance. 
And you can use compressors to raise the overall apparent level of a mixed 
song. In the following sections, I discuss the first use of compression: the 
control of transients. (You can find out about the other ways to use compres-
sion in Chapters 14 and 15.)
 
If you have an SIAB (studio-in-a-box) system or a computer-based system, you 
probably have a compressor included with the effects in the unit. Although 
you can use this compressor to track with, your signal has to go through the 
A/D converter first. (The A/D converter changes your signal from analog to 
digital form.) Because these systems are digital, the A/D converter is the first 
in line after the preamp. This often defeats the purpose of using a compressor 
to control transients because the A/D converter is where you often get your 
first dose of distortion. If you’re serious about using compression on the front 
end to tame transients, you may want to insert an external preamp into the 
signal chain before the A/D converter.

150
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 
Getting to know compressor parameters
Compressors have a series of dials that allow you to adjust several param-
eters. They are as follows:
 
✓ Threshold: The threshold setting dictates the level that the compressor 
starts to act on the signal. This is listed in decibels (dB). For the most 
part, you should set the threshold level so that the compressor acts 
only on the highest peaks of the signal.
 
✓ Ratio: The ratio is the amount that the compressor affects the signal. 
The ratio — such as 2:1, for instance — means that for every decibel 
that the signal goes over the threshold setting, it is reduced by two deci-
bels. In other words, if a signal goes 1dB over the threshold setting, its 
output from the compressor will only be 1/2 dB louder. The ratio is the 
one parameter that varies considerably from instrument to instrument 
because the level of the transient varies.
 
✓ Attack: The attack knob controls how soon the compressor starts, 
well, compressing. The attack is defined in milliseconds (ms), and 
the lower the number, the faster the attack. For the most part, you’re 
trying to control transients, and they happen at the beginning of a note. 
Therefore, you should set the attack to act quickly.
 
✓ Release: The release parameter controls how long the compressor 
continues affecting the note after the note starts. Like the attack, the 
release is defined in milliseconds. Because transients don’t last for 
very long, you usually use a short release time when using compres-
sion on the front end.
 
✓ Gain: The gain knob allows you to adjust the level of the signal coming 
out of the compressor. This is listed in decibels. Because adding com-
pression generally reduces the overall level of the sound, you use this 
control to raise the level back to where it was going in.
 
✓ Hard knee or soft knee: Most compressors give you the option of 
choosing between a hard knee and a soft knee (or they do it for you 
based on the setting that you’ve chosen). Hard knee and soft knee each 
refer to how the compressor behaves as the input signal passes the 
threshold. More detailed descriptions are as follows:
 
• Hard knee applies the compression at an even rate, regardless 
of the level present over the threshold. So if you choose a com-
pression setting of 4:1, the compressor applies this ratio for any 
signal over the threshold limit. Hard knee compression is used 
for instruments like drums, where you need to quickly clamp 
down on transients.
 
• Soft knee applies the compression at a varying rate depending on 
the amount the signal is over the threshold setting. The compres-
sor gradually increases the ratio of the compression as the signal 

151
 Chapter 7: Getting a Great Source Sound
crosses the threshold until it hits the level that you set. Soft knee 
compression is used on vocals and other instruments where the 
signal doesn’t have fast peaks.
Creating compressor settings
When you use a compressor to keep transients at bay, you only want to 
compress the highest transient levels — the ones that would overload your 
system or eat up your headroom — and you want to do this so that you don’t 
hear the compressor kicking in. Even though every instrument contains dif-
ferent levels of transient signals and each person who plays an instrument 
creates different amounts of extreme transients when he or she plays, here 
are some things to keep in mind as you create your settings:
 
✓ Keep the threshold high. With a high threshold setting, your compres-
sor only kicks in as the signal gets close to distorting. For most instru-
ments, I would use a setting of about –6dB. Some instruments with very 
high transients, such as percussion and drums, can handle a setting like 
–10dB. Set your threshold so that when the extreme transient happens, 
it only triggers the compressor a couple of decibels, and the nontran-
sient material (the main sound of the instrument) doesn’t trigger the 
compressor.
 
✓ Adjust the ratio to the material. For high-transient material (such as 
drums and percussion), choose a higher ratio, and for lower-transient 
material (like strummed or bowed string instruments), choose a lower 
ratio setting. Try to use a ratio that relates to the level of the transient 
over the nontransient signal. Because percussion instruments have ini-
tial signal peaks (transients) that are much stronger than the body of the 
instrument’s sound, you can compress this peak without affecting the 
main sound of the instrument. By matching the ratio to the degree of the 
transient this way, you can create a more even level without changing the 
sound characteristics of the instrument.
 
✓ Use a short attack. Transients happen at the initial attack of the instru-
ment. This means that if you want to compress the transient, the com-
pressor must kick in right away when this signal happens. A setting of 1 
millisecond or less is optimal.
 
✓ Use a short release. Transients happen quickly, and they last a very 
short amount of time. When you try to control these signals during 
tracking, you only want to catch the transient itself — and no other 
part of the instrument’s sound. Setting a short release time — start with 
about 10 milliseconds — ensures that your compressor doesn’t linger on 
to affect the body of the instrument.
 
✓ Don’t mess with the gain. Because you’re only catching the highest 
transient signals and you’re only compressing them a tiny bit, you don’t 
need to add or reduce any of the signal that’s going through the com-
pressor. Leave the gain control at 0dB.

152
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 
 
When using a compressor during tracking, keep the following two points in mind:
 
✓ You can always add compression to a recorded track, but you can 
never take it away. If you’re not sure how much compression to apply 
to a particular situation, you’re much better off erring on the side of too 
little because you can always run the sound through another compres-
sor later.
 
✓ If you can hear a change in the sound of your signal, you probably 
have the compressor set too high. The reason that you use a compres-
sor on the front end is to eliminate extreme transients, which you can’t 
hear when you play. If your compression setting changes the sound, you 
should slightly reduce the compression setting (unless you’re going for 
that effect).

T
o record acoustic instruments — that is, any instrument that doesn’t 
have an electronic output — you need to use a microphone. The sound 
that you ultimately get can vary considerably based on where you place the 
mic in relation to the instrument and the room that you record in. I spend 
quite a bit of time — three chapters, in fact — talking about microphones 
because they’re so important to the quality of your final recordings. See 
Chapters 6 and 9 for more miking details.
In this chapter, I take a look at some of the most common microphone tech-
niques that are used in professional recording. You get a chance to see, up 
close, how spot miking works. You also get a broad view of distant miking 
and take a look at the big picture on ambient miking. As well, this chapter 
explores some common stereo miking techniques and explains what to look 
for when combining these various approaches.
Regardless of the style of microphone that you use or the type of instrument 
that you record, you can use one or more of the following mic-placement 
techniques to capture the sound that you want:
 
✓ Spot (or close) miking: Put your microphone within inches of the 
sound source.
 
✓ Distant miking: Pull your mic back a few feet from the sound.
 
✓ Ambient miking: Place your mic way back in a room.

154
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 
 
✓ Stereo miking: Set up two mics at various distances from one another.
 
✓ Combined miking: Use a combination of the four traditional placement 
strategies listed here.
This chapter introduces you to the four traditional mic-placement strategies 
that are used in recording. You discover the characteristics and purposes of 
each of these four methods and gain an understanding of how each relates 
to a particular tonal or sound quality. I also discuss how you can combine 
these strategies.
Singling Out Spot Miking
Spot miking (also called close miking) involves placing your microphone 
within a couple of feet of the sound source. Home recordists use this tech-
nique most often because it adds little of the room (the reverb and delay) to 
the recorded sound. Figure 8-1 shows the close miking placement.

155
 Chapter 8: Taking a Look at Microphone Techniques
Spot miking tends to create a less natural sound and can compromise the qual-
ity of your recordings if you’re not careful. It can also offer you some advan-
tages if you record multiple instruments in one pass or if your room doesn’t 
sound good. Here are some things to consider when using spot miking:
 
✓ Transients are more extreme. Distance from a sound source tames 
the initial attack of an instrument. Spot miking picks up more transient 
material, which can make the sound of the instrument seem harsh and 
can overload your mic, preamp, or converter without your seeing it on 
your level meters. You need to listen closely to your recorded sound to 
make sure that you don’t have distortion. A solution to this problem is 
to move the mic back a bit or point it slightly away from the instrument.
 
✓ The room isn’t part of the recording. This can be good or bad depending 
on the sound of your room:
 
• On the plus side, it can keep a bad-sounding room from ruining the 
sound of your track by putting it so far in the background of the 
recording that it isn’t really heard on your tracks.
 
• On the downside, you lose the natural ambience of an instrument 
that gives it its character, so if you have a nice-sounding room, this 
technique may not be the best choice (depending on how many 
instruments are playing at once — see the next bullet).
 
✓ You can isolate each instrument. Spot miking can help you keep mul-
tiple instruments separated in your tracks, so if you record your band 
live, you can create some isolation among instruments. (This assumes 
that you use a microphone with a cardioid polar pattern. Chapter 6 has 
more details on this). This makes mixing a lot easier. Because of the 
downside that I list in the previous bullet, I’m a big fan of using room 
mics (using the ambient technique described in the section “Assessing 
Ambient Miking,” later in this chapter) in conjunction with spot mics to 
create a more realistic sound.
 
✓ Even minor adjustments in mic placement can have a huge impact on 
your recorded sound. Because the mic is so close to the sound source, 
small adjustments to the mic’s placement make a noticeable difference, 
and the mic may not capture the complete sound of the instrument. 
Finding the spot that sounds the best may take you a while.
 
✓ The closer you put your mic, the more bass you record. I mention this in 
Chapter 6, but it bears repeating here. As you move a mic with a cardioid 
polar pattern in close to the sound source, the mic picks up more bass 
energy. This is called the proximity effect. It can be an advantage for some 
applications — rounding out the sound of a vocal, for instance — but it 
can also cause problems with some instruments such as acoustic strings, 
where you don’t want the extra bass muddying the sound. To counter this 
effect, use an omnidirectional or figure-8 mic or move the cardioid-pattern 
mic away from the sound source until the bass is more manageable. (See 
Chapter 6 for a rundown of the different types of mics.)

156
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 
Detailing Distant Miking
When you use distant miking, you place mics about 3 or 4 feet away from the 
sound source, as shown in Figure 8-2. Distant miking enables you to capture 
some of the sound of the room along with the instrument. An example of a 
distant-miking technique is the overhead drum mic. With it, you can pick up 
the whole drum set to some extent. Coupling the distant mic with a few select 
spot mics, you can record a natural sound.
 
Figure 8-2: 
The 
microphone 
is placed 
3 to 4 feet 
from the 
instrument 
in the 
distant-
miking 
technique.
 
Distant miking has its plusses and minuses. Here are some things to remem-
ber if you use this technique:
 
✓ You can get a more natural sound. By moving the mic back a few feet from 
its source, you give the instrument a chance to breathe a bit and allow the 
sound to blend a little with the room in which it’s played. You also eliminate 
the impact of the proximity effect (see the previous section) and correct 
the balance between the body of the instrument’s sound and the transient 
from the initial attack. This often creates a more pleasing, natural sound.
 
✓ Other instruments may bleed into your track. If you record more than 
one instrument at the same time, distant miking increases the bleed 
of other instruments into the track of the instrument that you want to 
record. The solution to this is to use the spot-miking technique instead, 
move the instruments farther apart, adjust the mics so that the blind spot 
of the mic is facing the instrument you don’t want to record, or place 
gobos (acoustic baffles, as discussed Chapter 3) between the instruments.
 
✓ The sound of the room is important. With the mic farther away from 
the instrument, more of the room sound is picked up in relation to the 
instrument. As a result, you hear more of the room in your tracks. This 
can be nice if your room sounds good, but it can get in the way if your 
room doesn’t.

157
 Chapter 8: Taking a Look at Microphone Techniques
 
✓ Multiple mics can cause phase problems. Whenever you use more than 
one mic on a source such as a band or drum set, the relationship of these 
mics to the source and to one another plays a significant role in the sound 
you get. If the mics are not placed properly, some frequencies may drop 
out. Called phase cancellation, this is the result of the recorded wave-
forms reaching each mic at slightly different times. The sidebar “Problems 
with stereo miking” and the section “Creating Miking Combinations,” later 
in this chapter, explain this phenomenon in more detail.
Assessing Ambient Miking
Ambient miking is simply placing the mic far enough away from the sound 
source so that you capture more of the room sound (the reverb and delay) 
than the sound of the actual instrument (see Figure 8-3). You may place the 
mic a couple of feet away from the source but pointed in the opposite direc-
tion, or you may place it across the room. You can even put the mic in an 
adjacent room, although I admit this is an unorthodox technique. The dis-
tance that you choose varies from instrument to instrument.
Ambient miking definitely has its place, but using this technique requires 
some forethought. Consider the following items when you use this technique:
 
✓ You lose the attack of the instrument. Because the mic is so far from 
the sound source, it picks up more of the ambience of the room than the 
attack of the instrument (hence the name of the technique). To counter 
this effect, use distant or spot mics for the instruments that you want to 
have a more pronounced presence and blend these mics with the ambi-
ent mic when you mix.
 
✓ You need a good room. Ambient miking relies on the sound of the room 
to create a pleasing ambience. If your room doesn’t sound great, you’re 
better off using a closer miking technique instead. On the other hand, if 
you can find a great room in which to record — a church or auditorium, 
for instance — setting up a mic in the middle of the room (you must 
listen for the best placement by walking around the room as the music 
plays) can give your tracks that extra something that can set them apart 
from the run-of-the-mill home recordings.
 
✓ Placement is key. Just as each instrument has a sweet spot, each room 
has a place that sounds best. Take your time finding this location and 
put your ambient mic there.
 
✓ Watch for phase problems. Because an ambient mic is typically used in 
conjunction with another mic or two (or more), you must keep the rela-
tionship among the mics correct; otherwise, you’ll have problems with 
the phase of the recorded waveforms.

158
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 
 
Ambient mic placement works well in those places where the room adds 
to the sound of the instrument. The sound that you record is ambient 
(hence the name). If you mix an ambient mic with a spot mic, you can end 
up with a natural reverb. So if your room doesn’t add to the sound of the 
instrument, you’re better off not using an ambient mic. You can always 
add a room sound by using effects in the mixing process (see Chapter 15 
for more details).

 Chapter 8: Taking a Look at Microphone Techniques
Selecting Stereo Miking
Stereo miking involves using two mics to capture the stereo field of the 
instrument. You find a variety of stereo-miking techniques and some pretty 
complicated ways of using two mics to record. The three most common 
approaches are X-Y (coincident) pairs, the Blumlein technique, and spaced 
pairs. You can also find stereo mics that do a good job of capturing the 
stereo field of an instrument.
Stereo miking has the advantage of capturing a fairly natural stereo image, 
though not as good as what your ears capture. When you listen to perfor-
mances that were recorded with well-placed stereo miking, you can hear 
exactly where each instrument performed on the stage. Of course, such 
wonderful stereo miking is an art. You can’t just set up a couple of mics in a 
room and automatically get a good stereo sound. Capturing a stereo image 
with two mics requires some careful planning.
X-Y pairs
X-Y (coincident) stereo miking consists of using two mics that are placed 
right next to each other so that the diaphragms are as close together as pos-
sible without touching one another. X-Y stereo miking is the most common 
type of stereo mic setup and the one that you’ll likely use if you do stereo 
miking. Figure 8-4 shows a basic X-Y setup. Notice how the mics in this figure 
are attached to a special mounting bracket. This bracket makes positioning 
the mics easy.

phones

160
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 
When you record using the X-Y technique, keep these points in mind:
 
✓ The stereo image (the placement of the instruments in the sonic envi-
ronment) isn’t as wide or realistic as it is in real life. The X-Y tech-
nique is easy to set up and get a decent sound, so like all things in life, 
you have to deal with the compromise this ease creates. No solution 
to this exists, so if a wide stereo image is important to you, consider 
using a different stereo technique, such as the spaced pair or perhaps 
a Jecklin disk. 
 
✓ Don’t use two mics when one is enough. After you get a pair of nice 
mics to do some X-Y miking, you’ll want to use them on everything. 
A stereo-mic approach to a classical guitar composition is nice, but 
honestly, recording the acoustic guitar in a rock ballad with five other 
instruments playing isn’t necessary and just makes life more com-
plicated when you mix the song (see the section “Creating Miking 
Combinations,” later in this chapter).
 
✓ Keep some distance between the mics and the sound source. The X-Y 
technique has no benefit over a single mic if you place your mics within 
a couple feet of the sound source. You simply don’t have enough space 
for a stereo image to develop until you’re at least 6 feet from the instru-
ment or group of instruments. In fact, I would be at least 10 feet from the 
sound source before I use this approach.
Blumlein technique
The Blumlein technique is named after Alan Dower Blumlein, who patented 
this approach in 1931. Blumlein stereo miking involves placing two figure-8 
mics in much the same way as the X-Y pattern (at right angles to one 
another with the diaphragms as close together as possible). The two mics 
are mounted on separate stands, one above the other. Figure 8-5 shows this 
technique.
The advantage of this technique is that the figure-8 mics pick up signals from 
both the front and back. This produces a natural sound. You also don’t have 
to contend with proximity effects (enhanced bass response due to being 
close to the sound source) because figure-8 mics don’t produce these effects. 
Here are some suggestions for when you should use this technique:
 
✓ The room sound is important. Because the Blumlein technique uses 
figure-8 mics that can pick up the sound on the other side of the mics 
than your instruments, you end up recording quite a bit of room sound 

161
 Chapter 8: Taking a Look at Microphone Techniques
with your instruments. This is one of the reasons that this technique 
sounds as good as it does, but your room must add to the quality of 
your sound, not hinder it.
 
✓ Find the best place in the room. Take some time to find the best place 
to put the mics. The placement may not be in the center of the room 
or the front of the band. Instead, it may be off to one side or closer to 
the back or front. This advice holds true for all miking, but with the 
Blumlein technique (or when using omnidirectional mics with the other 
techniques), correct mic placement can make the difference between a 
decent recording and a truly awesome one.
 
✓ Get a sturdy stand that can handle both mics. Using two stands to 
hold both mics makes moving them around (to find the sweet spot 
in the room) a real pain in the you-know-what. You can easily find 
mic-stand adapters that hold both mics. These can be an invaluable 
investment.

Part III: Getting Ready to Record 
Spaced pairs
Spaced-pair stereo miking involves placing two mics at a distance in front 
of the instrument(s) that you want to record and at a distance from one 
another. This approach can work well if you record an ensemble that takes 
up a lot of room. Figure 8-6 shows a top view of a typical spaced-pair stereo 
mic setup.
Keep the following things in mind when using the spaced-pair stereo-miking 
technique:
Problems with stereo miking
When you do stereo miking, watch out for 
phase cancellation and poor stereo imaging. I 
describe these thorny issues in the following 
paragraphs.
Phase cancellation happens when the two 
microphones are placed so that they each 
receive the sound at slightly different times. 
When this occurs, you don’t hear the bass as 
well because the low frequencies drop off. 
Improper mic placement or two mics that are 
out of phase with one another can cause phase 
cancellation.
Most digital recorders have a phase switch that 
allows you to reverse the phase of the signal 
(even after it’s recorded). To test whether two 
mics are out of phase, just reverse the phase 
on one mic (don’t do both) and listen to see 
whether the low frequencies become more 
apparent:
 ✓ If they do, you’ve corrected the problem 
and you’re good to go.
 ✓ If this doesn’t correct the problem, try 
changing cords on one of the mics because 
some mic cords are wired differently than 
others. If this doesn’t work either, you need 
to adjust the relationship between the two 
mics. Just move one mic around a little and 
listen for changes in the bass response. 
When the missing bass appears, you know 
you’ve solved the problem.
Poor stereo imaging occurs when you can’t 
tell where things fall from left to right (or right 
to left, if that’s the way you think) or when you 
can’t hear a clear center point in the sound. 
Poor stereo imaging is a little more difficult to 
correct than phase cancellation, but you can 
fix it.
The solution depends on the stereo-miking tech-
nique that you use. If you use the X-Y technique, 
you’ve probably placed your mics too close to 
the sound source. If you use the spaced-pair 
technique, you’ve probably placed the mics too 
close to one another in relation to the distance 
from the instruments. In either case, adjusting 
the placement of your mics should clear up the 
problem.

163
 Chapter 8: Taking a Look at Microphone Techniques
 
✓ Follow the rule. One of the most important things to consider when 
stereo miking with spaced pairs is that you will experience phase prob-
lems if you don’t space the mics properly. Fortunately, experienced 
recordists have discovered a basic guideline that makes it easier to 
place the mics. Called the 3:1 rule, this guideline says that you should 
place the mics three times farther apart than they are from the sound 
source. Doing so minimizes potential phase problems.
 
✓ Break the rule if necessary. As handy as the 3:1 rule is, it isn’t fool-
proof. At times, this rule doesn’t produce the best sound. In the next 
chapter, I offer one of these instances for placing drum overheads in 
a three-mic technique. Use the rule as a guide, but trust your ears to 
determine the best place to put a spaced pair of mics (or a single mic, 
pair, or group of mics).
Stereo microphones
If you want to record an instrument in stereo and don’t want the hassle of 
learning how to set up stereo pairs, you can use a stereo mic. Stereo mics 
have two diaphragms in them and use a special cord that allows you to 
record the output from each diaphragm on a separate track. An inexpensive 
stereo condenser mic is shown in Figure 8-7. This type of microphone acts 
like an X-Y pair, so follow the guidelines and suggestions that I offer in the 
section “X-Y pairs,” earlier in this chapter, when using one of these.

Creating Miking Combinations
Many times, you’ll want to use more than one mic. The possible combina-
tions are almost limitless: You can use several spot mics on one instrument, 
you can use a spot mic and an ambient mic, you can have a distant mic and a 
spot mic, or . . . well, you get my point. As exciting as these possibilities can 
be, keep the following points in mind to get the best sound when you com-
bine multiple mics:
 
✓ Be aware of phase relationships. Each mic interacts with all the other 
ones when you record, and you need to take the time to set up each 
mic so that it doesn’t interfere with any others. This means honoring 
the 3:1 rule for stereo mics (see the section “Spaced pairs,” earlier in 
this chapter). The only way to ensure that your phase is good is to 
record a snippet of a song (or a whole song if you want) and then listen 
to your tracks.
 
 Listen to each mic individually and then together to see whether any 
frequencies drop out. If frequencies drop out, finding the problem mics 
will take some detective work. You need to play pairs of mics that you 

165
 Chapter 8: Taking a Look at Microphone Techniques
recorded and until you find the problem; then you need to adjust each 
mic until the problem goes away. If you do this enough, you’ll get pretty 
good at placing mics and making phase relationships work.
 
✓ Be aware of bleed between mics. This is mainly for bands that want 
to play together while still maintaining as much isolation as possible. 
A string quartet rarely needs isolation because all the instruments 
blend well together live; this blending is integral to the overall sound. 
However, a rock band with miked amps usually needs enough isolation 
so that you can do some tweaking to each instrument when you mix.
 
 As well, a band that plays well together and can nail the performances 
can have more bleed, whereas a band with a marginal player or two (you 
know whether you have one in your band) that needs to perform addi-
tional takes or punch-ins to fix a weak performance requires much more 
isolation. Doing a punch-in of your bass player (for instance, someone 
who flubbed a few notes into a live bleed-filled performance) can sound 
wrong in the mix.
 
✓ Use only as many mics as you need. Every additional mic that you add 
to your setup complicates your recording process considerably. To 
keep things simple, use as few mics as possible to get the sound that 
you want.
 
If you’re using a digital recorder, it probably has a phase switch that enables 
you to fix the phase problems later if you missed them as you recorded. This 
isn’t as optimal as recording without this problem, but it may allow you to 
save an otherwise good set of tracks.

T
he location of a microphone in relation to your instrument or a singer 
has a huge impact on the sound of your recording. In fact, just a move-
ment of an inch or two or even a slight turn of the mic can bring out differ-
ent characteristics in the sound. The art of placing mics is one that you will 
undoubtedly spend a lifetime discovering.
In this chapter, you discover the fundamentals of using microphones to get 
a good source sound. You explore tried-and-true miking methods along with 
some practical miking tips and tricks that you can use right away. You also 
examine the use of compression and mic placement to control and eliminate 
transients — the usual peaks in the instrument’s sound.
 
In Chapter 7, I present ways to get the best sound from your mics and to keep 
extreme transients from ruining an otherwise nice recording by overloading 
your inputs and clipping your audio, so check it out if you haven’t done so yet.
Just remember, you don’t need to use a compressor when tracking — simply 
keep your levels low enough to leave room for these unexpected signals. 
If you do decide to use a compressor during tracking, keep the attack and 
release times short (Chapter 7 has more on this). You only want to catch 
the initial signal and not mess with the rest of the instrument’s sound. If you 
want to use a compressor to sculpt the sound of your instruments, you can 
do that easily during the mixing stage of producing your song. I cover this 
approach in detail in Chapter 15, where I offer a bunch of sample settings to 
get you started.

Regardless of the type of home studio you have or the style of music that 
you record, you’ll probably record vocals at some point. And unfortunately, 
vocals are one of the most challenging sounds to do well. You have to find 
the right mic for the person who’s singing, and then you need to try differ-
ent approaches to get the best sound out of him or her. Fortunately, you’re 
in luck. In the following sections, I lead you through the (sometimes compli-
cated) process of getting good lead vocal sounds.
Making the most of the room
To get the best possible recording of vocals, you need a dead room, which is 
another way of saying a room that has no reverberation. (Chapter 3 has some 
tips on how to deaden your room.) Recording vocals in a dead room gives a 
sense of “presence” and allows you to add compression to the vocals without 
making them sound distant (this is because the compressor raises the level 
of the background noise, particularly the reverberation from a live room).
 
The easiest way to deaden your room for vocal recording is to hang curtains, 
carpet, or blankets around the room or to use the absorbent side of the reflec-
tor/absorber panels that I discuss in Chapter 3. Try to get the front and both 
sides of the vocal area covered with absorbent materials. If you use the reflec-
tor/absorber panels that I describe in Chapter 3, you need to use the stands, 
because the panels are only 4 feet tall.
Choosing the best mic
You have a lot of options for miking vocals. The type of mic that you use dic-
tates where you place it.
Dynamic mic
Dynamic mics sound best when you place them close to the singer’s mouth. 
The effect that you get is gritty. Huh? Okay, by gritty I mean dirty. That’s no 
help either? Let me see . . .
Sound: Dynamic mics produce a midrange sound (the high frequencies 
aren’t reproduced well). When someone sings with the mic right in front of 
her mouth, the sound lacks even more high frequencies due to the proximity 
effect (an enhanced low-frequency response at close range). What you get is 
a deep, bass-heavy sound that’s often described as gritty or dirty. This type 
of sound can be great for some styles of rock and blues music.

169
 Chapter 9: Miking Your Instruments
Setup: To set up a dynamic mic for this purpose, just put it on a stand so that 
the singer can get his mouth right up against the windscreen.
Large-diaphragm condenser mic
Large-diaphragm condenser mics are the most common types of mics for vocals.
Sound: These mics can clearly reproduce the entire audible frequency spec-
trum and slightly accentuate the low-mid frequencies (200–500Hz) at the 
same time. What you get is a nice, warm, full-bodied sound (that sounds like 
I’m describing a wine). The proximity effect (how close the singer is to the 
mic) determines how nice and warm-bodied the sound is. The closer the 
singer, the deeper and richer the tone.
Setup: When you set up a large-diaphragm condenser mic for vocals, you 
need to place the mic so that nasty sibilances (the sound from singing s and 
t sounds) and pesky plosives (pops from singing p syllables) don’t mess up 
your recordings. To deal with plosives and sibilance, you can either use a 
pop filter (see Chapter 6) or have the singer sing past the mic. If you want the 
singer to sing past the mic, you can do one of the following things:
 
✓ Place the mic above the singer and set it at an angle pointing away from 
him (Figure 9-1, left).
 
✓ Set up the mic below the singer and angle it away from him (Figure 9-1, 
right).
 
✓ Put the mic off to the side and face it toward the singer (Figure 9-1, center).

Small-diaphragm condenser mic
The small-diaphragm mic won’t be your first choice in a vocal mic, unless 
you are recording a female vocalist with a soprano voice and you want to 
catch the more ethereal quality of her higher frequencies.

170
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 
Sound: The small-diaphragm condenser mic creates a much more bright or 
airy sound than the large-diaphragm mic. This means that it doesn’t contain 
the low-mid (200–500 Hz) warmth of its larger-diaphragm counterpart.
Setup: You set up the small-diaphragm mic in the same way that you set up 
the large-diaphragm mic.
Ribbon mic
The ribbon mic is a good choice if you’re looking for a crooner-type sound 
(think Frank Sinatra).
Sound: The ribbon mic is thought to add a silky sound to the singer’s voice. 
By silky, I’m referring to a slight drop-off in the high frequencies (not as 
severe as a dynamic mic, though). To my drum-abused ears, ribbon mics 
have a kind of softness that the large-diaphragm condenser mics don’t have. 
The sound is more even, without the pronounced low-mid effect.
Setup: If you use a ribbon mic, you can set it up in the same way that you set up 
a condenser mic. Just be more careful about singing directly into a ribbon mic 
because the ribbon can break if you sing, speak, or breathe too hard into it.
 
Many digital studios (the SIAB and computer-based systems, especially) con-
tain mic simulator programs as part of their effects packages. Mic simulators 
allow you to use a relatively inexpensive mic (a Shure SM57, for instance) 
and make it sound like a much more expensive vocal mic. The mic simulator 
doesn’t match the sound of a great mic perfectly, but it does give you more 
options, especially if you don’t have the bucks to buy a handful of top-notch 
vocal mics.
One of the great things about using a mic simulator is that you can choose 
the exact sound you want after you’ve recorded the vocal part. This way, you 
can spend less time trying to choose the perfect mic and get down to the 
business of recording before your singer gets worn out.
Getting Good Backup Vocals
To record backup vocals, you can either track each part separately by using 
the same mic-placement techniques that I describe earlier or you can have all 
the backup singers sing at once into one or two mics. If you do the latter, you 
can either use a stereo pair of mics, a figure-8 mic, or an omnidirectional mic.
If you use a stereo pair of mics, I recommend setting them up in a coincident 
X-Y pattern. Have the vocalists stand next to each other facing the mics at 3 
or 4 feet away. Either large- or small-diaphragm mics work best for this setup. 
Check out Figure 9-2 for a neat top view of this arrangement.

If you choose to use a figure-8 mic, the singers can stand on opposite sides of 
the mic (Figure 9-3). The advantage of this setup is that the singers can look 
at each other while they sing.

An omnidirectional mic can also work well for backup vocals. In this case, the 
singers stand in a circle around the mic, as shown in Figure 9-4.

Examining Electric Guitar Miking
Miking your electric guitar is a personal thing. It seems to me that every 
guitar player spends a lot of time getting his or her “sound” (although I don’t 
play guitar, so what do I know?). If you’re a real guitar player, you undoubt-
edly take great pride in getting your sound exactly right on tape, er, disk. You 
likely spend countless hours tweaking your amp and adjusting the mic to get 
the sound just right. On the other hand, if you’re not a real guitar player, you 
may just want to record the part and get it over with. Either way, you can 
start looking for that perfect guitar sound by placing your mics in one (or 
more) of the ways that I outline later in this chapter.
Using the room
Whether you play through a small jazz chorus amp or power-chord your 
way through a six-foot-tall Marshall stack, the room that you play in has less 
impact on your sound than if you play drums or sing. For the most part, look 
for a room that is fairly dead — a room without natural reverberation. You 
can always add effects later.
Guitar miking involves mostly spot mics, so your only consideration when 
recording a guitar using an amp is how your neighbors feel about noise, er, 
your most-excellent guitar playing.

173
 Chapter 9: Miking Your Instruments
Getting the most out of the mics
The type of mic that you choose largely depends on the type of sound 
you’re looking for. For example, if you’re looking for a distorted rock guitar 
sound with effects, you can get by just fine with a dynamic mic. If you favor 
a clean sound, a small-diaphragm condenser mic may work better for you. 
If you’re going for a warm, full-bodied sound, try using a large-diaphragm 
condenser mic.
No matter which type of mic you use, you get the best sound from your amp 
speakers by putting a mic about 2 to 12 inches from the cabinet, with the mic 
pointing directly at the cone of one of the amp speakers (the cone is located 
in the center of the speaker). You can see this positioning in Figure 9-5.
 
Figure 9-5: 
Start by 
placing a 
mic near the 
cone of a 
speaker in 
your amp.
 
You may want to experiment with how far the mic is from the amp and the 
angle at which you point it. Sometimes just a slight movement in or out, left 
or right, can make all the difference in the world. You can even try pointing 
the mic at different speakers if your amp has more than one, because each 
speaker has a slightly different sound.

174
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 
 
I know some engineers who disconnect all but one speaker in the cabinet 
(assuming that you have more than one speaker) to lower the volume and still 
have an intense, distorted sound. This can be especially beneficial if you have 
one of those amp stacks with a volume knob that goes to 11, and you need to 
crank the amp to get your “tone” (come on, rockers, you know who you are). 
This way you don’t overdrive the mic — creating distortion — and you can 
still get that nasty sound that you’re looking for.
If you can’t quite get the sound that you want from your amp with the one 
mic pointed at the speaker cone, you may want to add a second mic 3 or 4 
feet away. You also point this mic directly at the speaker cabinet for a more 
ambient sound. This may also give your sound more life, especially if you 
have a room with natural reverberation. If you add a second mic, remember 
to watch for phase differences between the mics and make adjustments 
accordingly. (I discuss phase cancellation in Chapter 8.)
 
Are you sick of the same old sound coming out of your amp? Do you wanna 
really shake things up (and I mean this literally)? Well, put your guitar amp 
in a tiled bathroom and crank it up. You can put a mic in the bathroom with 
your amp (a couple of feet away) and maybe another one just outside the door 
(experiment by how much you close or open the door). The effect is, well . . . 
try it and find out for yourself.
 
On most digital recording systems, you can use an effect called an amp simu-
lator to give your guitar a variety of sounds. The amp simulator can make 
your guitar sound like it was played through any number of popular amplifier 
setups. This can save you the hassle of trying to mic your guitar amp and keep 
your neighbors happy. Just plug your guitar into the Hi-Z jack in your mixer. If 
you don’t have a Hi-Z jack, you can use a direct box or the line-out jack of your 
amp (more on this in Chapter 4).
Exploring Electric Bass Miking
When you mic an electric bass, getting a good sound can be a real bear. 
Your two adversaries are muddiness (lack of definition) and thinness (a pro-
nounced midrange tone). These seem like almost polar opposite characteris-
tics, but they can both exist at the same time. I outline the best way to avoid 
these problems in the following sections.
 
Running your bass guitar directly into the board — via a direct box, your 
amp’s line-out jack, or a Hi-Z jack on the mixer — gives the guitar a punchier 
sound. Some recorders have amp-simulator programs for bass guitar as well 
as guitar. So don’t be afraid to skip the amp and go directly into the mixer.

175
 Chapter 9: Miking Your Instruments
Managing the room
The sound of an electric bass guitar can quickly get muddy. Your best bet is 
to choose a room that doesn’t have a lot of reflective surfaces (for example, 
paneled walls and wooden floors that the sound can bounce off of). A dead 
room is easier to work with. Don’t make your room too dead, however, or it 
just sucks the life out of your amp’s tone. If you can get your amp to sound 
good in your room, placing the mic properly is easy.
 
Don’t be afraid to be creative and to try recording your bass in different 
rooms. Look for a room with a warm sound to it. One thing though — the 
bathroom amp trick doesn’t work well on bass guitar (but it can be fun to 
try anyway).
Getting the most from the mic
Because the bass guitar produces low frequencies, a dynamic mic or a large-
diaphragm condenser mic works well. I avoid small-diaphragm condensers 
and ribbon mics for the electric bass, but try them if you want. Who knows — 
you may end up with an awesome bass track.
Mic placement for the electric bass is similar to the guitar: You place a single 
mic 2 to 12 inches away from one of the speakers. Sometimes with bass, 
if you angle the mic and let the speaker’s sound kind of drift past the dia-
phragm, you can get a great sound. For a bass, skip the distant mic, which 
generally just adds muddiness to the sound.
Miking Acoustic Guitars 
and Similar Instruments
At the risk of offending banjo, dobro, harp, or ukulele players, I’m lumping 
all strummed or picked string instruments together. I know, they all sound 
and play differently, but the microphone-placement techniques for all these 
instruments are similar. Allow me to explain.
Because all these instruments have a resonating chamber, you can pretty 
much use the same mic placement for any of them. You use different types of 
mics for different instruments, and I get to that in a minute.

176
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 
Making the most of the room
Because these are acoustic instruments, the room plays a role in the sound 
that you end up recording. Unless you have a great-sounding room, you 
want to minimize its impact on your instrument’s sound. You can do this by 
recording with spot mics or by placing absorber/reflectors in strategic places 
around your room. Put the absorber side out if the room is too live or the 
reflector side out if the room is too dead.
For example, if your home studio resides in a spare bedroom with carpeting 
and that awful popcorn stuff on the ceiling, you can put a couple of the reflec-
tor panels around your guitar player and the mic. This adds some reverbera-
tion to your guitar. Any unwanted reflections from the ceiling or walls are 
shielded from the mics, because the absorber sides of the panels are facing 
the rest of the room.
Using your mics
I often prefer to use condenser mics when recording acoustic instruments. 
The type of condenser mic you use depends on the overall tonal quality that 
you want to capture or accentuate. For example, if a guitar has a nice woody 
sound that you want to bring out in the recording, a large-diaphragm con-
denser mic is a good choice. On the other hand, if you’re trying to capture 
the brightness of a banjo, a small-diaphragm mic is a better choice.
You can position your microphone in a variety of ways, and each accents 
certain aspects of the instrument’s sound. Even a slight adjustment to the 
mic can have a significant impact on the sound. You may have to experiment 
quite a bit to figure out exactly where to put a mic.
To help with your experimentation, listen to the instrument carefully and move 
the mic around (in and out, left and right) until you find a spot that sounds par-
ticularly good. You need to get your ears close to the instrument to do this.
Here are some suggestions to get you started:
 
✓ Put the mic 6 to 18 inches away from and 3 to 4 inches below the 
point where the neck meets the body of the instrument. Then make 
minor adjustments to the direction in which the mic points. Pointing it 
toward the sound hole(s) often gives you a richer, deeper tone. (This 
can translate to muddiness on some instruments.) Turning the mic more 
toward the neck brings out the instrument’s brighter qualities. See the 
image on the left in Figure 9-6.

177
 Chapter 9: Miking Your Instruments
 
✓ Place the mic about 3 feet away from the instrument and point it directly 
at the sound hole. At this distance, you capture the rich sound from the 
sound hole and the attack of the strings. See the center image in Figure 9-6.
 
✓ Put the mic about 6 inches out from the bridge of the instrument. Try 
pointing the mic in different directions (slight movements of an inch or 
less can make a huge difference) until you find the spot that sounds best 
to you. See the image on the right in Figure 9-6.
 
✓ Set up the mic at about the same distance and angle from the instru-
ment as the player’s ears. Point the mic down toward the instrument so 
that the mic is a couple of inches away from either side of the musician’s 
head. This is an unorthodox approach that I like because the player 
adjusts his playing style and intonation to correspond to what she is 
hearing when she plays. With this technique, you’re trying to capture 
exactly what the musician hears.

Getting a Handle on Miking Horns
There’s nothing like the sound of a horn played by a skilled player. Sure, you 
can use a synthesizer or sampler to play horns, but it’s not quite the same. 
Luckily, horns, such as trumpets, trombones, and saxophones, use similar 
miking techniques, so if you want to mic some horns, you don’t have to 
understand a ton of different techniques.
Understanding the role of the room
Because of the high volume levels of most horns and the fact that you mic 
them fairly closely, you don’t get a ton of impact from the acoustics of the 
room. Unless your room sounds really bad (for example, a small spare bed-
room with carpeting and a low ceiling), you can deal with any room sound 
that bleeds into the mic.

178
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 
If you have a small room that adds an unwanted sound to the instrument, sur-
round the horn player with acoustic panels, similar to what I describe in the 
section “Getting a Great Lead Vocal Sound,” earlier in this chapter. You can 
experiment with using either the reflective or absorptive side of the panels 
to get the sound that you want. Generally speaking, err to the side of a more 
dead room — you can always add some reverb later.
Making the most of the mics
For most horns, a decent condenser mic — large- or small-diaphragm — 
works well. If you want a richer tone, a ribbon mic is the way to go. In fact, 
whenever I mic horns, I pull out a ribbon mic first, and it usually stays out 
until the session is over.
You can place the mic from 3 inches to a foot or more from the instrument, 
depending on the instrument and the sound you’re looking for. For example, 
a trumpet, because of its high sound pressure levels (SPLs, or volume), 
would sound best with the mic a little farther away than the placement for a 
tenor sax. This is especially true with ribbon mics, where too much pressure 
can blow the ribbon.
Most horns generally sound better if the mic is placed just to the side of the 
bell (the part where the sound comes out). This keeps the SPL that the mic 
picks up low enough to avoid distortion and not blow your precious ribbon. 
For some of the louder instruments, choose a condenser mic with a high 
SPL rating and/or a pad switch, or move the mic away from the instrument 
a bit. (A pad switch reduces the amount of sound — usually by 10–20dB — 
that the mic’s internal circuits process, allowing you to have a louder signal 
without distortion.)
If you want to record more than one horn instrument at a time (a couple of 
trombones, for instance), you can use a figure-8 condenser mic and have 
each horn player positioned on either side of the mic. As an alternative, use 
one or more mics a couple of feet away from the players.
Placing Mics for a Piano
If you’re lucky enough to have a real piano to record, you’ll probably want to 
record it live rather than use some piano patch on a synthesizer. The follow-
ing sections give you some suggestions on how to effectively mic a piano.

179
 Chapter 9: Miking Your Instruments
Harnessing the sound of the room
Pianos can be tough to record if your room doesn’t sound great. Because 
of the size of the instrument — especially if it’s a grand or a baby grand 
piano — you need a large room with a high ceiling to get the best sound. 
If you have an upright piano in a living room, for example, you may find it 
easier to just record a piano patch (sound) on a decent synthesizer.
If your room doesn’t add to the sound of the piano, use a closer mic place-
ment than you would if your room sounds great.
Managing the mics
Condenser mics are a must for recording piano. Either small- or large-diaphragm 
mics work well. Your mic placement depends largely on the sound you’re going 
after. Here are a few examples:
 
✓ Funky rock or ragtime sound: Place your mic close in toward the ham-
mers. In this case, I would use two mics — one over the higher register 
and one over the lower, 6 to 12 inches away from the hammers.
 
✓ Natural classical-type sound: Move the mics out from the instrument — 2 
to 6 feet is usually good, depending on how much room sound you want in 
the mix. The farther you move the mics outside of the lid, the higher you 
should place the mics because the sound moves up as it goes out. A good 
reference is to use the lid as guide.
 
The farther outside the instrument you put the mics, the more room sound 
you pick up.
 
If you don’t want to use a traditional condenser mic or if you want to try 
another approach to piano miking, you can use a boundary mic. A bound-
ary mic is an omnidirectional mic that attaches to the instrument. You can 
find a decent-sounding boundary mic for about $50 from Radio Shack (Cat. 
#33-3022) or for a few more dollars from most other microphone manu-
facturers. Just mount the boundary mic to the underside of the piano’s 
lid (consult your mic’s manual for details on mounting it) to get the best 
sound. You can also use two boundary mics — one over the lower register 
and one over the higher one.

180
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 
Setting Up Mics for Strings
Stringed instruments — violin and fiddle, viola, cello, and acoustic bass — can 
be a lot of fun to mic. They have a rich tone and produce an almost unlim-
ited variety of textures. Each instrument has a different tonal spectrum, but 
because they all have the same basic shape and design (f-holes, strings, bows, 
and so on), they can all be thought of similarly. You can try any of the tech-
niques that I describe for one of these instruments on the rest of them. For 
example, try the mic technique from the cello on the fiddle and see what you 
think. Your options are many, so experiment and use what you like.
Making the most of the room
As with any other acoustic instrument, the room can have profound impacts 
on the sound that you capture. Unless you have a really nice-sounding room, 
try to isolate the instrument from the room’s sound. In this case, spot miking 
is the best choice. On the other hand, if you have access to a great-sounding 
room or concert hall in which to record, by all means add some room mics or 
use a stereo-miking technique.
Making sense of the mics
My favorite type of mic for classical string instruments is a small-diaphragm 
condenser unit, although on occasion I reach for a large-diaphragm condenser 
mic. A dynamic mic may produce an interesting effect, but it doesn’t capture 
the most natural sound.
You can place the mic for each of the string instruments as follows:
 
✓ Violin, fiddle, and viola: These all sound great with a mic placed 1 to 
2 feet above and behind the instrument and facing down at the instru-
ment’s body.
 
✓ Cello and double bass: For these instruments, place the mic several feet 
away from the instrument (between 4 and 8 feet) and point it toward 
the f-hole in the instrument. This allows you to capture the sound of the 
entire instrument. The only drawback is that you also get a fair amount 
of the sound of the room. If you don’t want the effects of your room 
recorded, you can place acoustic panels on either side of the mic.

181
 Chapter 9: Miking Your Instruments
 
✓ Ensembles: Ensembles sound best when miked with a stereo pair placed 
between 8 and 20 feet away. You can use any of the stereo-miking tech-
niques that I describe earlier in this chapter. If you are miking soloists, 
you may also need to add a spot mic or two for their instruments. If so, 
follow the recommendations that I provide earlier in this list and watch 
for phase problems.
Digging into Drum-Set Miking
If you’re like most musicians, getting great-sounding drums seems like one 
of the world’s great mysteries (you know, along the lines of how the pyra-
mids were built or how to cure cancer). You can hear big, fat drums on great 
albums but when you try to record your drums, they always end up sounding 
more like cardboard boxes than drums. Fret not, for I have solutions for you.
First things first: Tuning your drums
The most important part of getting killer drum sounds is to make sure that 
your drums are tuned properly and that they have good heads on them 
(okay, those are two important things). Seriously, if you spend some time 
getting the drums to sound good in your room, you’re halfway to the drum 
sound of your dreams. I don’t go into detail here, but if you want specific 
drum-tuning guidance, you can do an Internet search or check out my book 
Drums For Dummies, 2nd Edition (published by Wiley).
 
You’re looking for a clear, open tone on your drums. Resist the temptation to 
apply duct tape or other dampeners to the drumheads. Drums that are dead-
ened and don’t ring clearly definitely sound like cardboard boxes when you 
record them.
After you get your drums tuned as well as you can, the next step is to take 
care of rattles that may be coming from the stands or mounting hardware. 
Tighten any loose hardware and move any stands that may be touching one 
another. You may need to make some small adjustments to the pitches of 
your drums if they are causing hardware to rattle.
If you still have some ringing or unwanted overtones, you can damp them 
slightly. Cotton gauze taped lightly on the edge of the head (away from the 
drummer) is often enough. If you want a real dry sound on your snare drum, 
you can use the wallet trick: Have the drummer place his wallet on the head — 
the drumhead, that is. (Use the drummer’s wallet because it probably doesn’t 
have any money in it.)

182
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 
When your drums have been tuned perfectly, you’re ready to start placing 
some microphones. You can choose from an unlimited number of miking con-
figurations, only a few of which I can cover here (it would take a whole book 
to cover them all).
Using the room to your benefit
The room influences the drums’ sound more than it influences that of other 
instruments. If you’re looking for a big drum sound, you need a fairly live 
room (one with lots of reflection).
What type of drum set?
If you want to buy a drum set for your home 
studio, here are some guidelines that have 
worked for me:
 ✓ Smaller drums can sound bigger. At one 
point, I had two top-notch Gretsch drum 
sets in my studio. One was a rock kit that 
had a 24-inch kick; 13-, 14-, and 18-inch 
tom-toms; and a 61/2-inch-deep metal snare 
drum. The other was a small jazz kit con-
sisting of an 18-inch kick, 10- and 14-inch 
tom-toms, and a 5-inch deep-wood snare. 
Guess what? Even for the hardest rock 
music, the small kit sounded much bigger. 
You can tune the small drums down a bit 
and they just sing!
 ✓ Choose your heads wisely. Not all heads 
are equal. Some sound great on stage 
while others are better suited for the studio. 
Because the heads that come with a kit are 
most likely not the ones that sound the best 
on a recording, invest some money in test-
ing different drumheads on your kit. I prefer 
either Remo pinstripes (great for rock and 
R&B) or coated Ambassadors (great for 
jazz) on the top and either clear or coated 
Ambassadors (I choose based on aesthet-
ics) on the bottom of the drum.
 ✓ Use cymbals with a fast decay. Cymbals 
that sound great on stage are different from 
those that sound great in the studio. Stage 
cymbals often have long decays and slow 
attacks. This causes bleeding, especially 
through the tom-tom mics, and correcting 
the problem can be a headache. If you buy 
cymbals for your studio, choose those that 
have a very fast attack and a short decay.
 ✓ More expensive isn’t always better. For 
recording, my favorite drum sets are used 
kits from the late ’60s and early ’70s. My 
all-time favorite recording set is a late-’60s 
Gretsch jazz drum set with an 18-inch kick 
drum, a 10-inch mounted tom-tom, and a 
14-inch floor tom. For a snare, I love old 
5-inch wooden snare drums (for example, 
Gretsch, Ludwig, or Slingerland). The last 
one of these sets that I bought cost $350, 
including all the mounting hardware and 
the snare drum. It wasn’t pretty, but it sure 
sounded great.

 Chapter 9: Miking Your Instruments
I know, you’re thinking, “But I just have a bedroom for a studio, and it’s car-
peted.” No worries, you can work with that. Remember, you have a home 
studio, so you potentially have your whole home to work with. Here are a 
couple of ideas to spark your imagination:
 
✓ Buy three or four 4-x-8-foot sheets of plywood and lean them against the 
walls of your room. Also, place one sheet on the floor just in front of the 
kick drum. This adds some reflective surfaces to the room.
 
✓ Put the drums in your garage (or living room, or any other room with a 
reverberating sound) and run long mic cords to your mixer. If you have 
a studio-in-a-box or laptop-computer–based system, you can just throw 
it under your arm and move everything into your garage or, better yet, 
take all this stuff to a really great-sounding room and record.
 
✓ Set up your drums in a nice-sounding room and place an additional mic 
just outside the door to catch an additional ambient sound. You can 
then mix this with the other drum tracks to add a different quality of 
reverberation to the drums.
Picking up the kick (bass) drum
When recording a kick drum, most recording engineers choose a dynamic 
mic. In fact, you can find some large-diaphragm dynamic mics specifically 
designed to record kick drums.
No matter where you place the mic, you can reduce the amount of boomi-
ness that you get from the drum by placing a pillow or blanket inside the 
drum. Some people choose to let the pillow or blanket touch the inside head. 
I prefer to keep it a couple of inches away from the inside head, but I find it 
can be beneficial to let it touch the outside head.
That said, you can place your mic in several ways: 
 
✓ Near the inside head (see Figure 9-7, left): If you take off the outside 
head or cut a hole in it, you can put the mic inside the drum. Place the 
mic 2 to 3 inches away from the inside head and a couple of inches off 
center. This is the standard way to mic a kick drum if you have the out-
side head off or if a hole is cut in it. This placement gives you a sharp 
attack from the beater hitting the head.
 
✓ Halfway inside the drum: You can modify the preceding miking tech-
nique by moving the mic back so that it’s about halfway inside the drum. 
In this case, place the mic right in the middle, pointing where the beater 
strikes the drum. This placement gives you less of the attack of the 
beater striking the head and more of the body of the drum’s sound.

184
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 
 
✓ Near the outside head (see Figure 9-7, right): If you have both heads on 
the drum, you can place the mic a few inches from the outside head. If 
you want a more open, boomy sound (and you have the drum’s pitch set 
fairly high), point the mic directly at the center of the head. If you want 
less boom, offset the mic a little and point it about two-thirds of the way 
toward the center.
 
Figure 9-7: 
You can 
place a mic 
in several 
places to 
get a good

sound.
 
 
If your drum sounds thin after trying these mic-placement approaches, you 
can try these two things:
 
✓ Tune the drum slightly up. In your quest for a deep bass tone, you may 
have tuned the drum too low. (This is especially common if you have a 
large bass drum.) In this case, the drum’s fundamental tone may be too 
low to be heard clearly. Raising the pitch a bit usually solves the problem.
 
✓ Create a tunnel with acoustic panels. Putting the mic in the tunnel often 
helps if you have a room that’s too dead. Place two of the panels on 
their sides (reflective surfaces facing in) with one end of each panel near 
the outside of the drum. Angle the panels out so that, where they are far-
thest from the drum set, the distance between them is just under 4 feet. 
Then lay the other two panels (reflective surface facing down) across 
the side panels to create a tunnel. You can also place a piece of plywood 
on the floor under these panels to further increase the resonance. Place 
the mic halfway into the tunnel, facing the center of the drum.
Setting up the snare drum
The snare drum is probably the most important drum in popular music. The 
bass guitar can cover the kick drum’s rhythm, and the rest of the drums aren’t 
part of the main groove. A good, punchy snare drum can make a track, whereas 
a weak, thin one can eliminate the drive that most popular music needs.
Because the snare drum is located so close to the other drums, especially 
the hi-hats, a cardioid-pattern mic is a must. The most common mic for a 
snare drum is the trusty Shure SM57. The mic is generally placed between 

185
 Chapter 9: Miking Your Instruments
the hi-hats and the small tom-tom about 1 or 2 inches from the snare drum 
head (see Figure 9-8). Point the diaphragm directly at the head. You may 
need to make some minor adjustments to eliminate bleed from the hi-hats. 
This position gives you a nice punchy sound.
 
Figure 9-8: 
The proper 
placement 
for the 
snare drum 
mic.
 
If you want a crisper tone, you can add a second mic under the drum. Place 
this mic about an inch or two from the head with the diaphragm pointing at 
the snares. Make minor adjustments to minimize leakage from the hi-hats.
If you have the available tracks, record each snare mic to a separate track 
and blend the two later during mixdown. If you don’t have the available 
tracks, blend them until you have the sound that you want.
Tackling the tom-toms
The tom-toms sound best when using a dynamic mic. For the mounted toms 
(the ones above the kick drum), you can use one or two mics. If you use one 
mic, place it between the two drums about 4 to 6 inches away from the heads 
(Figure 9-9 shows this placement option). If you use two mics, place one 
above each drum 1 to 3 inches above the head.

186
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 
 
Figure 9-9: 
Miking the 
mounted 
tom-toms 
with one 
mic.
 
If you want a boomy sound with less attack, you can place a mic inside the 
shell with the bottom head off the drum.
Floor toms are miked the same way as the mounted tom-toms. Use the follow-
ing setup:
 
✓ Place a single mic a couple of inches away from the head near the rim.
 
✓ If you have more than one floor tom, you can place one mic between 
them or mic them individually.
If you want to apply compression to the tom-toms, you can start with the set-
tings that I listed for the snare drum in the preceding section.
Handling the hi-hats
The hi-hats are generally part of the main groove, and as such, you want to 
spend time getting a good sound. You may have problems with a few other 
mics on the drum set picking up the hi-hats, particularly the snare drum 
mic and overhead mics. Some people don’t bother miking the hi-hats for 
this reason.

187
 Chapter 9: Miking Your Instruments
I like to mic hi-hats because, to me, these cymbals often sound too trashy 
through the snare drum mic. If you mic hi-hats, make sure that the snare 
drum mic is picking up as little of the hi-hats as possible by placing the 
mic properly and/or using a noise gate (a dynamic processor used to filter 
unwanted noise).
You can use either a dynamic mic or, better yet, a small-diaphragm con-
denser mic for the hi-hats. The dynamic mic gives you a trashier sound, and 
the small-diaphragm condenser mic produces a bright sound. You can work 
with either by adjusting the EQ. I usually add just a little bit (4dB or so) of a 
shelf EQ set at 10 kHz to add a little sheen to the hi-hats.
Place the mic 3 to 4 inches above the hi-hats and point it downward. The 
exact placement of the mic is less important than the placement of the other 
instrument mics because of the hi-hats’ tone. Just make sure that your mic 
isn’t so close that you hit it.
Creating the best cymbal sound
You want to know one secret to the huge drum sound of Led Zeppelin’s 
drummer, John Bonham? Finesse. He understood that the drums sound 
louder and bigger in a mix if the cymbals are quieter in comparison (I’m 
guessing this is true, because I never really talked to him about this). So he 
played his cymbals softly and hit the drums pretty hard. This allowed the 
engineer to raise the levels of the drums without having the cymbals drown 
everything else out. Absolutely brilliant.
Because having the drums bleed into the overhead mics is inevitable and the 
overhead mics are responsible for providing much of the drums’ presence 
in a mix, playing the cymbals softly allows you to get more of the drums in 
these mics. This helps the drums sound bigger.
 
Ask (no, demand) that your drummer play the cymbals quieter. Also, use 
smaller cymbals with a fast attack and a short decay. Doing these things cre-
ates a better balance between the drums and cymbals and makes the drums 
stand out more in comparison.
Small-diaphragm condenser mics capture the cymbals’ high frequencies well, 
though many digital recordists like the way a ribbon mic mellows the cym-
bals. You can mic the cymbals by placing mics 12 to 18 inches above each 
cymbal or by using overhead mics set 1 to 3 feet above the cymbals (see the 
next section).

188
Part III: Getting Ready to Record 
Miking the whole kit
Most of the time, you want to have at least one (but preferably two) ambi-
ent mics on the drums, if for no other reason than to pick up the cymbals. 
Assuming that you use two mics, they are called overhead mics, and as the 
name implies, they are placed above the drum set. The most common types 
of mics to use for overheads are large- and small-diaphragm condenser mics 
because they pick up the high frequencies in the cymbals and give the drum 
set’s sound a nice sheen (brightness). You may also want to try a pair of 
ribbon mics to pick up a nice, sweet sound on the overheads.
To mic the drum set with overhead mics, you can use either the X-Y coinci-
dent technique or spaced stereo pairs. Place them 1 to 2 feet above the cym-
bals, just forward of the drummer’s head. Place X-Y mics in the center, and 
set up spaced stereo pairs so that they follow the 3:1 rule (for example, the 
mics should be set 3 to 6 feet apart if they are 1 to 2 feet above the cymbals). 
This counters any phase problems. Point the mic down toward the drums, 
and you’re ready to record. Figure 9-10 shows both of these setups.

Getting Your Hands on Hand Drums
Hand drums can be anything from the familiar conga to unusual drums, such as 
the North African tar. Because you may encounter many types of hand drums, 
this section gives you some general guidelines when recording any hand drum.
Your selection in mics depends on the type of drum and its tonal characteris-
tics. For example, conga drums occupy the middle of the frequency spectrum 
and produce a loud sound that a large-diaphragm condenser mic can capture 
well. Or, if you want a tighter, drier sound, you can use a dynamic mic. If you 
choose the dynamic mic, the mic colors the sound of your recording.

189
 Chapter 9: Miking Your Instruments
If you want to record any of the smaller, higher-pitched hand drums, use 
either a large- or small-diaphragm condenser mic and skip the dynamic mic 
altogether.
Mic placement also varies considerably among the various hand drums. 
Listen to the sound of the drum, and find a place where you like what you 
hear. For the most part, placing the mic from 1 to 3 feet from the drum cre-
ates the fullest sound. If you want a lot of attack, you can place the mic 
closer. You lose some of the drum’s depth, however, when you place the mic 
closer than a foot.
Perfecting Percussion Miking
Miscellaneous percussion instruments, such as shakers and triangles, are 
nice additions to many styles of music. These instruments sound best with a 
good condenser mic. I choose a large- or small-diaphragm mic, depending on 
the characteristics that I want to pick up. For instance, a shaker can sound 
great with a large-diaphragm mic because this mic slightly brings out the 
lower frequencies of the instrument and softens the overall sound a bit.
Exploring the impact of the room
Most of the time, the room doesn’t have a huge impact on percussion instru-
ments because you mic them closely. If your room does get in the way, use 
the acoustic panels in much the same way that I suggest for vocals earlier in 
this chapter in the “Getting a Great Lead Vocal Sound” section (partially sur-
round the mic and musician with baffles).
Choosing and using the mics
Both large- and small-diaphragm mics work well for percussion. When 
recording percussion instruments, the main thing to remember is that they 
can have a high SPL (sound pressure level, or just plain volume), so you may 
need to pad the mic, move it back, or turn it sideways from the sound source.
I like to put a single mic from 6 to 36 inches away from percussion instru-
ments, depending on the size of the instrument and on how much room I 
want in the sound. For example, because maracas are loud, I put the mic back 
a bit (18 inches), whereas with an egg shaker, I find that 6 to 8 inches often 
sounds best. But when I record an agogo bell or an Afuche, I like to have a 
little room in the mix to give the instrument more depth. In this case, I mic 
from a couple feet away.

Chapter 10 explores the role of multitrack recording 
in modern music making and helps you get a song set up 
in your system. Chapter 11 walks you through the process 
of recording audio tracks, from the first track to overdubs,

terms mean). Chapter 12 gives you the lowdown on

this often-misunderstood technology.

Chapter 10
Multitrack Recording
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding multitrack recording
▶ Setting up a song to record
▶ Monitoring your mix
▶ Saving and sharing files
A
s recently as the 1960s, when someone wanted to record a song, he or 
she had to assemble a band, rehearse, and then perform the song live. 
If one of the musicians made a mistake, the whole band had to start over 
and record the song again. Not so anymore. You’re lucky enough to have 
gotten into recording in an age where you can not only write the song but 
also record it yourself and play all the instruments. If you like, you can make 
lush, layered music without involving anyone else. In other words, you can 
multitrack.
In this chapter, I introduce you to the basics of multitrack recording, a pro-
cess that enables you to assemble a song by recording one part at a time. 
You discover how to set up a new song in a variety of systems, and you 
find out how to set up the monitoring source and sound to help you inspire 
a great performance. This chapter also walks you through the process of 
saving files and transferring data between systems.
Understanding Multitracking
Multitrack recording is the process of recording each instrument (or group 
of instruments) individually and keeping those performances separate until 
a later date. Consider the CD or cassette player that you have at home or in 
your car. All the instruments are contained on a pair of stereo tracks. You 
can adjust the volume or equalization of these tracks, but you can’t adjust 
the sound qualities of the individual instruments contained on these two 
tracks. The multitrack recorder, on the other hand, allows you to keep all 
these instruments separate (see Figure 10-1). Multitrack recording lets you 
do the following things:

194
Part IV: Laying Track: Starting to Record 
 
✓ Make adjustments to the sound of the instrument on each track
 
✓ Adjust the levels (volume) of the instruments in relation to one another
 
✓ Assemble a “performance” that never happened

Getting Ready to Record
Before you can press the Record button on your system, you need to set up a 
few things. First, you need to find and choose the instrument or sound that you 
want to record, then you need to set the optimum volume level going to the 
recorder, and last, you need to decide what you want to hear while recording 
your performance. These steps are covered in detail in the following sections.
Setting up a song
If you’re using a digital recording system, you need to open a new song file. 
When you do this, you may be asked (or prompted) to choose the sampling rate 
and resolution of this new song. (Some systems have you provide this informa-
tion when you choose a track to record to rather than when opening a song file.)

195
 Chapter 10: Multitrack Recording
You generally have the option to choose a sampling rate, which is the number 
of times every second that the digital recorder or converter takes a snap-
shot of the sound (check out Chapter 2 for details on sampling rates). Your 
options may include 32, 44.1, 48, 88.2, 96, 176.4, or 192 kHz. Some digital 
recorders don’t allow you to make a CD if you record with anything but a 
44.1-kHz sampling rate. Check your owner’s manual if you intend to eventu-
ally put your music on a CD.
Some systems may also let you choose the bit depth — the size, in binary 
digits, of the sample that the converter or recorder takes — that you want to 
record in. For this parameter, I usually choose the highest bit depth available 
to capture the best sound possible. If you choose 20 or 24 bits, you need to 
convert the final mix to 16-bit if you want to put your music on a CD, but the 
advantages you gain from recording at a higher bit depth far outweigh the 
conversion factor. (Go to Chapter 2 for more on bit depth.)
Finally, name your file, and you’re ready to select a source signal to record.
Selecting a sound source
When you select a sound source, you simply set up your instrument or 
microphone so that it records to the track of your choice. Here’s how to 
select a sound source:
 
1. Turn the input trim knob and fader on the channel strip of your mixer 
all the way down to avoid hearing an unpleasant noise.
 
2. Plug your instrument or microphone into the appropriate input jack of 
your system.
 
 For a microphone, this may be a separate preamp or the internal 
preamp in your mixer, SIAB system, or audio interface. For an electric 
guitar or bass, use the Hi-Z input or a direct box, and for a keyboard 
or other electronic instruments (such as a drum machine or sound 
module), use any of the instrument inputs.
 
3. Choose the track that you want to record the signal to.
 
 This procedure varies from system to system. Here’s how to route the 
signal in the following systems:
 
 Studio-in-a-box (SIAB) systems: You can route the signal from any mixer 
input to any recorder track by pressing a button. For example, on the 
Roland VS-1880, just press and hold the Status button for the track that you 
want to record to. When the routing screen appears, continue holding the 
track’s Status button and press the Select button for the input channel that 
you want to route to that track. Release the Status button, and you’re all set.

196
Part IV: Laying Track: Starting to Record 
 
 Computer-based systems: You need to open the Input window to choose 
your input source. This process is pretty simple and is similar for most 
programs. Here’s how you do it in Pro Tools:
 
i. Choose Display➪Edit Window Shows➪I/O View.
 
 The I/O section of the Edit window appears, showing the inputs 
and outputs for each of your tracks.
 
ii. Click and hold your mouse button on the Input selector until the 
Input menu pops up.
 
iii. While still holding down your mouse button, move the mouse 
over the Input menu until it rests on the input listing you want.
 
iv. Release the mouse button to select the input listing.
 
 This menu closes, and the input you’ve selected appears in the 
Input selector.
 
 Stand-alone systems: If you have a stand-alone recorder with a separate 
analog mixer, you need to connect a cord from the input channel that 
your instrument is plugged into to the track that you want to record to 
(use the direct line outputs from the input channel).
 
4. Arm the track that you want to record to (that is, set it to the Record 
mode).
 
 This procedure also varies from system to system. Here’s how to arm 
the track on the following systems: 
 
 Studio-in-a-box systems: A Selector button glows various colors, 
depending on the mode that the channel is in. Press the button on the 
track number that you’re recording to until you see a red glow. This 
means that the track is ready to record.
 
 If you are using an SIAB system and want to record to a different track 
number than the input channel you’re plugged into, make sure that 
you arm the track that you want to record to and not the track associ-
ated with the input channel. If you don’t do this, you either record your 
music to the wrong track (and possibly erase something else) or you 
don’t record anything, depending on the routing of your system.
 
 Computer-based systems: Arm the track within the software by clicking 
the Record Enable button in the main window of your program. In Pro 
Tools, for example, this button is located in both the Edit window and 
the mix window for each track.
 
 Stand-alone systems: Press the Track Selector button located near the 
Track Level meter on the front of the machine until the button blinks red.

197
 Chapter 10: Multitrack Recording
Setting levels
Getting a sound signal to the recorder takes several steps. The path that the 
sound takes from the instrument or microphone to the recorder is called the 
signal chain (or the gain structure). For example, if you want to record your 
voice, you first capture your voice with a microphone and then you feed that 
signal to a preamp. From the preamp, you send the signal to the channel strip 
of your mixer, which sends the signal to the analog/digital (A/D) converter 
and then to the recorder. (Chapter 7 has more on this.) The signal chain may 
have all or just a couple of these steps, however. For example, a synthesizer 
is connected to the mixer, which is in turn connected to the recorder.
You need to be aware of the signal level at all of these steps to get the best 
sound possible. Too much gain at one stage forces you to reduce the gain at 
another. Likewise, too little gain at one point may require you to overdrive 
(bump up the gain) during the next stage. See Chapter 7 for more on setting 
optimal signal levels.
Getting the sound you want
After your levels are set, you can concentrate on fine-tuning the sound of the 
instrument before you record it. Here you can either adjust the EQ or apply 
effects to your sound.
EQ
I reserve EQ at this point for getting rid of any seriously unwanted frequen-
cies that I’m picking up in a mic. For example, I generally cut some low 
midrange frequencies on the bass guitar and kick drum because I know that 
these frequencies will be a problem later. Otherwise, I pretty much leave the 
EQ alone when tracking.
Don’t get too anal about getting the EQ of a recorded instrument just right at 
this point. All you want is a good, clean sound that approximates what you 
want in the final mix. You have another chance to make adjustments to the 
sound of your recorded instrument in the mixing phase.
 
Check the levels going to the recorder after you’ve made adjustments to the 
EQ because the levels may change.

198
Part IV: Laying Track: Starting to Record 
Effects
The question of whether to record effects — reverb, delay, chorus, and so 
on — along with an instrument is a long-debated topic. Professional recording 
engineers caution you against recording your instruments wet (with effects) 
because this limits your options when you mix the song. On the other hand, by 
recording an instrument with an effect, you can use that effect processor on 
another instrument during the mixing process. Ultimately, you have to decide 
whether adding an effect to an instrument on the front end (before recording) 
is the way to go. (I describe effects in greater detail in Chapter 15.)
 
If you record using a computer-based system, adding an effect during track-
ing may stress your computer’s processor to the point where it affects your 
recording. This can cause audio dropouts, pops, clicks, or other unwanted 
interruptions or corruptions to your audio data. If you have a slower com-
puter or if you record a lot of tracks at once, you may find that you can’t 
record with effects. In this case, your headphone mix while you track has no 
effect added to the sound, but you can still add effects during the mixing pro-
cess (as described in Chapter 14).
If you’re sure about the sound you want, you can add the effect on the front 
end. If you’re not sure, you’re probably better off waiting until later. You can 
always print (record) the effect during a bounce procedure, a neat trick where 
you rerecord one or more tracks to another track. Bouncing is a common 
procedure if you don’t have enough tracks in your system to record each of 
your instruments to its own track. I cover the bounce process in Chapter 11.
If you decide that you want to record your instrument with effects, you need to 
route the instrument through the effect processor and route the effect to the 
recorder. If you have an SIAB system, this is pretty easy. For example, to do 
this in a Roland VS-1880, follow these steps (most SIAB systems are similar):
 
1. Select the input channel that your instrument is plugged into and 
route the channel to the track that you want to record to.
 
 If you have a computer-based system, you need to use the Input menu 
on your screen to do this. On an SIAB system, your manual spells out 
the specific routing procedure.
 
2. Arm the recorder’s track (press the recorder’s Status button until the 
button blinks red).
 
3. Select the effect that you want to use and assign it to one of your 
effects buses.
 
 Go to the Effect A menu by pressing Shift+F3. Choose Effect 1 from the 
menu. Next, scroll through the Effects list and highlight the effect that 
you want to use. Press the Select button. Your chosen effect is now 
assigned to Aux Bus 1.

199
 Chapter 10: Multitrack Recording
 
4. Choose prefader or postfader on your Aux Send and turn the knob until 
you have the right amount of the instrument’s signal sent to the effect.
 
 You do this by going to the channel mixer settings menu on your screen.
 
5. Route the effect return to the track channel that you want to record to.
 
 Press and hold the Status button for your track until the Routing menu 
pops up (this takes about 3 seconds). Next, while still pressing the Status 
button, press the Effect button for the effect number (1, 2, 3, or 4) that you 
want to use. Note: This step may not be necessary on some systems.
 
6. Start recording.
 
 See Chapter 11 for the lowdown on recording.
 
On some systems, if you want to hear your recorded track, you may have to 
“unroute” the effect from that track. Your owner’s manual spells this out for you.
Adding an effect in a computer-based system, such as Logic Pro, involves 
these steps:
 
1. Select one of the buses from the Send selector in each track’s channel 
strip that you want to route to the effect.
 
 You can view a track’s channel strip in the Environment window 
(choose Windows➪Environment if the window isn’t open) or in the 
Arrange window. To open a track’s channel strip in the Arrange window, 
click the track name in the Arrange window to highlight it. The channel 
strip appears on the left.
 
 When you release your mouse button after selecting the bus, the bus is 
listed, and a trim pot (knob) appears next to the bus number.
 
2. Adjust the trim pot to a moderate level.
 
 I usually start with about –15dB.
 
3. Double-click the bus number.
 
 You’re taken to the Bus Channel strip in the Environment window, 
where you can choose the effect to insert into the bus.
 
4. By using the Insert selector pop-up menu in the Bus Channel strip, select 
the effects plug-in that you want to use from the Inserts pop-up menu.
 
 The Effect Plug-In window opens. Here you set your parameters, such as 
predelay, reverb time, and room type (for a reverb plug-in, for example).
 
5. Play your track by clicking the Play button in the Transport window. 
Your session plays, and you hear the effect of your plug-in on your track. 
You can then tweak the plug-in parameters or the send level for your 
track as your song plays to get the sound that you want.

Part IV: Laying Track: Starting to Record 
To record an effect with an analog mixer and a stand-alone recorder, you 
have to route things differently. You can do this one of two ways: by run-
ning cables from the master output of your mixer to the track input of your 
recorder or by creating a submix and connecting the recorder’s track input 
to the submix output on your mixer. Your owner’s manual should clearly 
explain these procedures.
Choosing a monitoring source
To record effectively, you need to hear what you’re doing. This requires you 
to set up your monitoring source so that you can hear what you want to hear. 
You want to monitor the sound that’s going through the recorder. This way, 
you can hear any distortion that may be present. Here’s how monitoring 
works on the following systems:
 
✓ Computer-based systems: Set the output for your track(s) to the output 
that you have your monitor speakers plugged into. If you use the main 
outputs in your interface, these are usually assigned to outputs 1 and 2 
in your system. (You can assign them however you want — check your 
manual for the specifics on doing this.) Set your outputs to channels 1 
and 2 and turn on your monitors.
 
✓ Studio-in-a-box (SIAB) systems: Because SIAB systems have fader banks, 
make sure that you designate the track channel to monitor rather than 
the input channel. After you’ve chosen the track channel that you want 
to listen to, bring up the fader to a level that allows you to hear what’s 
going to disk.
 
✓ Stand-alone systems with an analog mixer: You need to have the 
track output from the recorder connected to an input channel of your 
mixer. Check out your owner’s manual or go to Chapter 4 to find out 
how to do this.
Saving Your Work
After you record a track that you want to keep, you can save the song. Stand-
alone recorders automatically save a track after you record it (much like a 
tape recorder). If you use an SIAB system or a computer-based system, how-
ever, you need to save the file just as you save a file when you’re working in 
a computer program. And like other files in other computer programs, it’s 
a good idea to save your work often so that you don’t lose any of the music 
that you worked so hard to record. Check your owner’s manual for your sys-
tem’s procedures.

201
 Chapter 10: Multitrack Recording
 
In addition to basic file-saving commands, most digital systems (computer-
based and SIAB) allow you to save individual “scenes” or “snapshots” within 
each song that contain things such as mixer and effects settings.
Sharing Files with Others
Because your music is stored on a hard drive, you can transfer the data to 
other systems. The advantages of file sharing are far-reaching. You can col-
laborate with other people without ever being in the same room together. 
In fact, I’m working on several projects where I’ve never sat down with the 
other musicians. One such musician is even across the country from me. We 
just create CDs with our parts on them and send the CDs back and forth.
This disadvantage of file sharing is that there isn’t yet a single standard for 
saving data. Some recorders use proprietary file formats that only a system 
from the same manufacturer can open.
If you’re concerned about being able to transfer data from one system to 
another, look for a system that can import and export WAV or AIFF files. 
Nearly all computer-based programs and stand-alone systems are compatible 
with these file types. SIAB systems may or may not have this capability.
All is not lost if you have a system that has a proprietary file format. All digi-
tal recorders have jacks in them that enable you to transfer the data from 
one system to another. This means that you can send your file from your 
system to a computer and then use software to convert the file into a format 
that another person’s recorder can read. (The software that you choose 
varies depending on the systems that you want to transfer the files to and 
from.) If you’re doing a lot of transferring, this can be time consuming, but for 
the occasional transfer, it’s no big deal.
If you work with a system that can save files in the WAV or AIFF format, you 
don’t have this problem, and you can easily transfer your stuff from one 
machine to another. Also, if you’re transferring songs from one system to 
another system of the same type (a Roland VS-890 to a Roland VS-1880, for 
instance), you don’t have to worry about file conversion either.

In This Chapter
▶ Recording your first track
▶ Punching in and out
▶ Exploring overdubbing
▶ Recording a submix
▶ Using a bounce to consolidate tracks
▶ Keeping your tracks organized
O
kay, you’ve plugged in your instrument, set up your routing the way you 
want it, gotten the levels just so, and chosen what you want to hear while 
you play. Congratulations, you’re ready to record. Now the fun begins. . . .
In this chapter, I walk you through the process of recording some tracks for 
your song. You start with your first take, move on to some overdubbing by 
adding more tracks, and do some punching in and out to redo some parts. 
You also explore the process of submixing to record multiple instruments 
into just a couple of tracks.
Performing Your First Take
Your palms are sweaty, your pulse rate is up, and your hands are shaking 
as you get ready to press the Record button. I know the feeling; I’ve been 
recording for over 20 years and still get a little tense when the tape, er, disk 
starts to roll. There’s something about knowing that what you’re about to 
play is for keeps (or at least could be).
Relax. Take a deep breath and remember that you’re both the artist and 
the producer. You can take as many “takes” as it takes you to get a good 
“take.” (Sorry, I couldn’t help myself. A take, by the way, is an attempt at a 
performance.) Anyway, it’s normal to get a little nervous when you know the 
recorder is capturing every sound that you make.

204
Part IV: Laying Track: Starting to Record 
To do your first take, follow these steps:
 
1. Cue the beginning of the song.
 
 Press 0 (zero) on a Roland VS-1680 or press the Stop button twice in 
Logic or Cubase, for example.
 
2. Arm your track by pressing the Record Enable button or, in the case 
of a Roland SIAB system, the Status button until it blinks red. Next, 
arm the recorder by pressing the Record button until it flashes red, 
and then press the Play button.
 
 Presto, you’re recording.
 
3. When you’re done, press the Stop button and then press 0 or the Stop 
button again to rewind.
 
4. To listen to your recorded track, you need to disarm the track that 
you recorded to and set it to play. You accomplish this by pressing the 
Track Status button until it turns green (or by deselecting the track — 
just click the track bar).
 
 Now you’re in playback mode.
 
5. Now, just adjust your channel fader on the track channel that you 
recorded to and press the Play button.
Well, how does it sound? Good? Then you’re ready to record a different track. 
If you don’t like the sound, you can record the part over again by rewinding, 
rearming the track (press the Status button until you get the red blinking 
light again), and pressing the Record button followed by the Play button. If 
you’re like I am and make lots of mistakes, you’ll figure out how to do this 
procedure at lightning speed.
 
Depending on your system and the recording settings you have selected, you 
may be able to keep each take and decide later which one to use for your final 
song. This may be in the form of virtual tracks (as in the case of the Roland 
SIABs) or regions list (in the case of Pro Tools). I recommend checking your 
manual for the specifics on how to do this in your system.
Punching In and Out
Punching in and out refers to being able to overdub a section of a performance 
(that guitar lick you keep missing, for example) while keeping the part of the 
performance that you like. Punching in and out can be pretty simple: Play the 
track and press the Record button when you want to start. Then press the 
Stop button when you’re done. At least that’s how it used to be done.

205
 Chapter 11: Recording Audio
With a digital recorder, you can set up the system to punch in and out a 
number of ways. You can punch in and out manually either by using a nimble 
finger to punch buttons or by using a foot switch. You can also program the 
recorder to punch in and out automatically. If you go the automatic route, 
you usually set up your system to punch in and out once, but in some cases, 
you may want to rerecord over the same part of the song a certain number of 
times — a process known as loop recording.
Manual punching
Manual punching in and out is exactly what it sounds like: You manually 
press the Record button when it’s time to start the punch, and you manu-
ally press the Stop button when you’re done. This is the type of punch you 
do if you have enough time between when you press the Record button and 
when you need to start playing as well as when you stop playing the part 
and when you can get to the Stop button. You may also do manual punch-
ing if you’re acting as the engineer and someone else plays the instrument.
Punching with a foot switch
On most recorders, you can use a foot switch to punch in and out. This frees 
your hands so that you can play your instrument while you do the actual 
punching in and out.
Automatic punching
Automatic punching in and out is one of the many gifts from the digital 
recording gods. This process allows you to fully concentrate on getting your 
part right without having to worry about getting the punch right. With auto-
matic punching, you can replace very small passages or get into really tight 
places with your punch.
For example, suppose you have one bad snare drum hit (I’ve been there 
many times) that you want to replace. With automatic punch in/out, you can 
set it to start recording right before that bad note and stop immediately after 
it, leaving the rest of the notes untouched.
Even though each recorder is a little different in its autopunch procedure, all 
recorders follow these basic steps:
 
1. Select the track you want to punch in and out of.
 
2. Arm the track by pressing the Select button until you get the red 
blinking light.

206
Part IV: Laying Track: Starting to Record 
 
3. Locate the punch-in point on your recorder.
 
 You do this either by playing the song until you get to the point that 
you want to punch in or by keying in the numbers for that section of 
the song.
 
4. Press the In Point (punch in) button on your recorder.
 
5. Locate the punch-out point on your recorder.
 
 You do this either by playing the song until you get to the point that you 
want to punch out or by keying in the numbers for that section of the 
song.
 
6. Press the Out Point (punch out) button on your recorder.
 
7. Press the Auto-Punch button on your recorder.
 
8. Rewind the recorder to just before the punch-in point.
 
9. Press the Record button followed by the Play button (some recorders 
don’t require you to press the Record button first).
 
10. Play your part.
When you’re done, your newly recorded part is neatly placed in the song.
Repeated punching (looping)
If you have a tricky part to record and you know it will take you a few tries 
to get it right, you can use the repeated punching (also called loop record-
ing) function. During the repeated punching procedure, the recorder keeps 
repeating the section within the loop until you press the Stop key, so you can 
try recording your part as many times as you want without having to set up 
the punch in and out procedure again.
This procedure uses the same basic steps as the automatic punch in and out 
procedure, except that you also need to choose the section of the song that 
the recorder plays before and after the actual punch times (called the loop start 
and loop end points). For some systems, you can do this the following way:
 
1. Locate the place where you want to start the loop on your recorder.
 
2. Press the Locator button.
 
 This stores the locate point you chose in Step 1.
 
3. Locate the place where you want the loop to end.
 
4. Press another Locator button to store this value.
 
5. Press and hold the Loop button.

207
 Chapter 11: Recording Audio
 
6. While still holding the Loop button, press the Locator button that you 
used to store the loop start point (Step 2).
 
7. While still holding the Loop button, press the Locator button that you 
used to store the loop end point (Step 4).
 
8. Follow the steps for the automatic punch in and out that I list in the 
previous section of this chapter.
Exploring Overdubbing
After you record one usable track, you can move to the next step: overdub-
bing. Overdubbing is simply adding another track to an already-recorded 
one. Overdubbing is the heart of the multitrack recording process for most 
home recordists and is a technique that you will undoubtedly use and occa-
sionally abuse.
The overdubbing process is pretty straightforward. You simply follow the 
procedures for recording a take while making sure that you’re monitoring the 
recorded tracks that you’ve already made.
 
When you record an overdub, hearing certain parts that you recorded earlier 
may throw you off. If this becomes a problem, you can turn down certain parts 
in a mix and only listen to those parts that help you to perform the overdub. 
For example, if you’re overdubbing the lead vocal and a dobro part breaks 
your concentration on your lines or on hitting a note correctly, just slide the 
fader for the dobro’s channel down a little (or a lot).
Multitrack abuse
You have a recording system with 16 or more 
audio tracks, a couple dozen MIDI tracks, and 
countless virtual tracks (additional tracks in a 
digital system that are hidden behind the main 
tracks for recording variations of a part). What 
do you do? Well, you do what anyone else in 
your shoes would do — you try to fill all your 
available tracks with instruments. After all, 
that’s how you get really lush recordings, 
right?
Yeah, sometimes, but this could also be a recipe 
for a bunch of mud. In fact, you can end up with 
a super-lush recording by using just a handful 
of tracks. Lushness is a product of the song’s 
arrangement (how all the parts fit together) 
rather than just the number of tracks.
One of the most difficult things about multitrack 
recording is knowing how to use your tracks 
most effectively and having the discipline to quit 
when the song is done, regardless of whether 
you’ve used all your tracks. So, remember that 
just because you have the tracks available to 
you, you don’t need to use them all.

208
Part IV: Laying Track: Starting to Record 
Submixing
At times, you may want to record a bunch of instruments, such as the 
drums of a drum set, to one or two tracks. In this case, you need to create a 
submix of the inputs before you commit them to disk.
Submixing is essential if you have a recorder with fewer tracks than you have 
instruments. The advantage of creating submixes is that you can get by with 
fewer tracks. The disadvantage is that you can’t make many changes to the 
sound or volume of the individual instruments after you record them.
Recording by using submixes presents challenges that overdubbing doesn’t. 
Here are some points to keep in mind:
 
✓ Make sure that each instrument sounds the way that you want it to 
sound on the final mix. You can make minor adjustments to EQ and 
effects, but only to the entire submix group.
 
✓ Before you record, make sure that each instrument’s volume is where 
you want it to be relative to the volume of the other instruments.
 
✓ Decide where in the stereo field you want each instrument. This is called 
panning, and it determines how far left or right each instrument can be 
heard. Panning is discussed in more detail in Chapter 14.
This can take time to set up, but if you’re limited on available tracks, you can 
record a lot of instruments on few tracks.
 
If you’re not sure exactly how you want the final submix to sound, you can 
record more than one version onto separate tracks and use a bounce proce-
dure (see the following section) after you’ve recorded. This gives you more 
time to experiment with alternate versions of your submix.
Bouncing
Bouncing is like submixing, but you do bouncing after you record the tracks. 
For instance, you can record all your drum mics onto separate tracks initially 
and then bounce (or combine) all those tracks onto one or two tracks later. 
In most cases, you want to bounce to two tracks rather than one so that you 
can maintain panning information in your final mix.

209
 Chapter 11: Recording Audio
Bouncing has some advantages over submixing. You can take your time 
getting each instrument to sound right before you group them together. 
On the downside, you may not have this option if you are recording live 
and can only put the drums on two tracks initially. In this case, you need 
to create a submix.
If you have the space to record the instruments to separate tracks initially, 
here’s how you bounce the tracks down to two:
 
1. Decide which tracks you want to bounce, and route these tracks to the 
tracks that you want to bounce to.
 
2. Adjust the EQ of each instrument to get the sound you want.
 
3. Adjust the panning of each instrument — use the panning knob 
located above your mixer’s channel fader — so that the instrument is 
where you want it in the stereo field.
 
 Remember that you need to be bouncing to two tracks for panning to work.
 
4. Set the levels of each instrument relative to one another.
 
5. Add any effects that you want to record with the instruments.
 
6. Press the Record button.
You can use virtual tracks (see the next section) to record several dif-
ferent versions of your bounce. This gives you some options later when 
you’re mixing. For example, set the track levels differently for each 
bounce — raise the snare drum in one, change the EQ of the hi-hats in 
another, and so on.
Keeping Track of Your Tracks
One of the great things about digital recording systems is the number of 
tracks that are often available. Computer-based systems, for example, often 
have unlimited numbers of tracks (or obscenely high numbers), and many 
SIAB systems offer virtual tracks. Virtual tracks are additional tracks that are 
hidden behind the basic tracks of the system. They allow you to record vari-
ous takes of a performance on separate tracks, but only one virtual track can 
be played at a time. Virtual tracks are great when you’re not sure whether 
you like a particular take and it’s not bad enough to record over.

210
Part IV: Laying Track: Starting to Record 
Having all these tracks is great except it can be daunting to keep (ahem) 
track of all of them. My recommendation: Use track sheets to document all 
your tracks. Track sheets are forms where you enter basic information for 
each of your recorded tracks, such as what instrument, take, and perfor-
mance section are included. This gives you a visual representation of your 
song’s components and makes it easier to choose which performances to 
include in your final mix. Here are some Internet resources to get you started:
 
✓ Ultimate Track Sheet (www.ultimatetracksheet.com): This page 
offers free track sheets for 8- to 48-track sessions.
 
✓ VS-Planet “User Track Sheet” Collection (www.vsplanet.com/

The VS-Planet, which is a site dedicated to Roland VS-series record-
ers. Scroll down the page until you get to The VS-Planet User Track 
Sheet Collection. You can also find studio-organizing forms on this page 
(located just below the track sheet downloads).

▶ Synchronizing MIDI devices
▶ Recording your performance
▶ Editing MIDI data
▶ Saving your work
▶ Transferring MIDI data between systems
R
ecording and editing MIDI tracks are similar to the process you under-
take with audio. The main difference is that MIDI tracks contain per-
formance data instead of sound. This offers the advantage of being able to 
choose the sound or instrument you want to “play” your data on later, after 
you’ve finished recording. Of course, this also provides the temptation not to 
make a decision on your sound.
In this chapter, I get you started recording MIDI by walking you through the 
process of synchronizing a variety of MIDI devices. Then I give you the low-
down on recording your tracks, adding to them with overdubs, and editing it 
all in some of the many ways that most sequencers allow you to. To top it off, 
I offer a little advice about saving and transferring MIDI data.
Synchronizing Your Devices
To create any kind of music with MIDI, you need to synchronize your devices 
to one another. The first thing you have to do is decide which device is 
going to send the MIDI commands (called the master) and which devices 
are to receive them (called the slaves). The process for synchronizing MIDI 
devices varies slightly from configuration to configuration. You can get a 
glimpse into a few possibilities in the following sections.

212
Part IV: Laying Track: Starting to Record 
Synchronizing two (or more) synthesizers
In this first scenario, you synchronize a synthesizer and a sound module 
(or another synthesizer). In this case, your keyboard is the master because 
this is the instrument that you actually play. Start by attaching the MIDI 
cable to the out port of the keyboard and to the in port of the sound module. 
Figure 12-1 shows the setup for two synthesizers. If you have more than two 
devices, you can run a cable from the thru port of the second device to the in 
port of the next one, and so on. You can connect up to 16 devices this way.

Synch-
ronizing two

cables as 
shown.

The next steps involve configuring each device in the chain so that each 
device recognizes its place and responds only to those messages that you 
assign to it. Keep in mind that all devices operate differently, so I can’t walk 
you through the exact steps for your instruments. Be sure to read your own-
er’s manual for your device’s specific procedures. The following steps give 
you a general idea of the process involved in synchronizing two synthesizers:
 
1. Go into your master keyboard’s system parameters and choose Master.
 
 This is generally a dialog box located within the software of your device.
 
2. Choose Slave for each of your other devices.
 
 You usually do this by going into the MIDI synchronization menu in your 
software.
 
3. Make sure that each device in your chain is set to mode 3 or 4, 
depending on whether you want polyphony.

213
 Chapter 12: Recording and Editing MIDI Data
 
4. Assign a MIDI channel for each device that’s down line (connected to 
the out port) from the master.
 
 You can find channel assignments within your device’s system param-
eters. For example, in a ddrum4 sound module, you press the System 
button until the light next to the word MIDI illuminates. You then use the 
dial to choose the MIDI channel that you want to use.
 
 You can choose from 16 channels (1–16), but if you have a drum 
machine, set it to channel 10 because this is the default drum channel 
for GM (General MIDI) devices.
 
5. Play the master keyboard.
 
 This makes your other MIDI devices play the appropriate sounds (hope-
fully). If you don’t hear anything, make sure that you have the appropri-
ate MIDI channel selected.
Synchronizing a computer sequencer 
and a synthesizer
If you’re using a computer or sequencer and want to synchronize it to a 
sound module or synthesizer, you need to go through some additional steps. 
These are as follows:
 
1. Connect your synthesizer to the MIDI interface, and connect the MIDI 
interface to your computer.
 
 Run the appropriate cable from the MIDI interface to the appropriate 
jack of your computer. For example, this can be a USB cable if you have 
a USB computer and USB MIDI interface.
 
2. Connect the MIDI interface to your synthesizer.
 
 You do this by connecting a cable from the MIDI out port of your syn-
thesizer to the MIDI in port of the interface. Then connect another 
cable from the MIDI out port of the interface to the MIDI in port of the 
synthesizer. This allows the MIDI communication to go both ways, as 
shown in Figure 12-2.
 
3. If you’re using a synthesizer to play your MIDI sequences from your 
computer, you need to set your synthesizer to local off mode. Then 
enable the thru function in your sequencer program so that the MIDI 
information that you send from the keyboard to the sequencer is sent 
back to the keyboard.

214
Part IV: Laying Track: Starting to Record 
 
 Local off mode disables the keys from the sounds and makes the 
sequencing process go much smoother. Enabling the thru function in 
your sequencer program enables you to hear what you’re playing while 
you record your part.
 
 If you don’t set your synthesizer on local off, you create a feedback loop. 
In a feedback loop, both your synthesizer’s keys and the sequencer are 
sending the same messages to the sound generator in your synthesizer 
and causing it to play each note twice. The best that can happen is that 
you trigger each note twice and use up your polyphony faster. The 
worst that can happen is echoed or stuck notes and possibly jammed 
messages, which may cause your system to lock.
 
4. After you connect all the cables, be sure to choose the MIDI channel 
that you want the track recorded to and set both the sequencer and 
instrument to that channel.
 
 You can find the MIDI channel selector within your device’s software. 
Sometimes it is a combination of key commands (such as repeatedly 
pressing the System button in a ddrum4 sound module). Other times, 
it is a pull-down menu that you access from the top of your computer 
screen. In Cubase, the channel selector for the sequencer is located just 
to the right of the track name.

After you have your channel setup and your local off business out of the way,

 Chapter 12: Recording and Editing MIDI Data
Synchronizing a sequencer 
and an audio recorder
If your system does the sequencing inside the computer and your audio 
tracks are recorded on either a stand-alone recorder or an SIAB (studio-in-a-
box) system, like the Roland VS-1880, you need to synchronize them. In this 
case, your devices use timing data rather than communicating/responding 
with the help of performance data.
You need to get both your sequencer and your recorder to recognize the 
same timing data. You start this process by determining which device is the 
master and which one is the slave.
 
The process that I describe in this section also works if you’re connecting a 
synthesizer to a drum machine. Select the sequencer as the master device and 
the drum machine as the slave.
You can choose either device to be the master. In this example, I outline set-
ting up your system with the SIAB system as the master and the sequencer as 
the slave, as shown in Figure 12-3. You may be able to set up your system the 
other way around (particularly if you have a stand-alone recorder connected 
to a sequencer), but I chose this way because doing so allows you to use the 
faders and transport functions (play, record, stop, and so on) in your SIAB 
system. With some systems, you may be able to use your sequencer’s trans-
port and automation functions with this setup as well, which I discuss in the 
section “Sequencing,” later in this chapter.

Part IV: Laying Track: Starting to Record 
After you’ve chosen which device is the master and which is the slave, you 
can start synchronizing your systems. These steps help you get going:
 
1. Choose Internal Synch in your master device’s Synchronization 
dialog box.
 
 Each device has a different procedure for this, so read your device’s 
manual to find out how to choose the synchronization mode. In a 
Roland VS-1680, press Shift+F5. Then press Synch (F6). A dialog box 
appears. Use the dial to choose Internal Synch. Click the Exit button to 
return to the main menu.
 
2. Choose External Synch in your slave device.
 
 This can be a dialog box within the MIDI synchronization menu. For 
example, in Cubase, choose Options➪Synchronization from the main 
menu on the top of your screen. The external or internal synch choice is 
in the upper-left corner of the dialog box.
 
3. Choose either MIDI Time Code (MTC) or MIDI Clock for the timing 
method.
 
 In Cubase, for example, this option appears directly below the external 
or internal synch option.
 
 You ultimately want to choose the timing method that you prefer and the 
one that works best for your gear. You can find out about these timing 
methods in the nearby sidebar “MIDI Time Code, MIDI Clock, huh?”
 
4. If you chose the MTC mode, you need to choose a frame rate to go 
with it.
 
 For this example, set your frame rate at 24 fps (frames per second). You 
should be synchronized at this point.
 
5. If you chose MIDI Clock in Step 3, you need to choose between tempo

 Chapter 12: Recording and Editing MIDI Data
MIDI Time Code, MIDI Clock, huh?
When you try to synchronize two devices using 
MIDI timing messages, you’re met with several 
choices. One is between MIDI Time Code (MTC) 
and MIDI Clock. The other is frame rates and 
tempo map or synch track. This can be confus-
ing, so this sidebar contains a brief overview of 
these options.
MIDI Time Code uses absolute time in its mes-
sages (the actual time on the clock from the 
beginning of the song or reference point in 
hours, minutes, seconds, frames, and sub-
frames). This data can then be translated into 
SMPTE messages (the kind of synchronization 
data used in film and television). If you choose 
MTC, you also have to decide the frame rate for 
the time code. Several frame rates are avail-
able, and each is associated with certain medi-
ums. They are as follows:
 ✓ 24 fps (frames per second): This rate is 
mainly used for films.
 ✓ 25 fps: This is for audio, video, and film 
equipment used in Europe and other places 
that use the SECAM or PAL formats.
 ✓ 29.97 fps: This is for color televisions used in 
the United States, Japan, and other places 
that use the NTSC format.
 ✓ 30 fps: This rate is used for black-and-white 
television in the United States (Europe’s 
black-and-white TVs use the 25-fps rate).
If this isn’t confusing enough, both the 29.97- 
and 30-fps rates also have either drop frame or 
nondrop frame formats. This gets pretty tech-
nical, but drop frame formats basically drop 
two frames every minute, except for the tenth 
minute, so that the timing data matches the 
clock exactly. These are generally used for live 
video feeds.
MIDI Clock is different from MTC in that it tracks 
the time of a song in beats and measures rather 
than in minutes and seconds. MIDI Clock mes-
sages are generally sent every 1/24 of a beat, but 
you can set most sequencer programs to much 
higher resolutions than that. Cubase VST ver-
sion 5 can be set as high as, get this, 1,920 PPQ 
(pulses per quarter note).
When you choose MIDI Clock, you need to 
choose between using tempo map or synch 
track, as follows:
 ✓ Tempo map: This is basically a layout of the 
tempos and time signatures used in a song. 
To use a tempo map to synchronize your 
SIAB system and sequencer, you need to 
create the map itself. Every system is a little 
different in this procedure, so I don’t go into 
detail here.
 ✓ Synch track: A synch track is a track (at 
least was a track on analog recorders) that 
follows along with the tempo and measures 
of a song. To use a synch track, you need 
to first record one. If you have a digital 
recorder, you most likely don’t need to take 
up an actual track to do this.
So which do you choose? Unfortunately, that 
question doesn’t have a clear answer. The 
equipment that you have dictates part of your 
answer. (For instance, the Roland VS-1680 SIAB 
system can send MIDI Clock and MTC mes-
sages, but it doesn’t always effectively respond 
to those messages.) The goals you have for your 
music dictate the other part. If you’re compos-
ing music for film or TV, your choice is clear (24 
fps and 29.97 fps, respectively).
If your equipment and musical goals don’t limit 
your choice, choose what you like. Just make 
sure that both machines have the same settings.

Part IV: Laying Track: Starting to Record 
Using the transport function from one 
device to control another
 
Another aspect of synchronization can enable you to use the transport func-
tion (play, stop, record, and so on) from each device to control the other. This 
is the MIDI Machine Control (MMC) function. The MMC function is located 
within the Synchronization menu of your device’s software. (You can find this 
in the same place as the MTC synch in most systems.) MMC allows you to 
send machine control messages from the slave device to the master device. 
For example, in the setup shown in Figure 12-3, you can set the sequencer to 
send MMC messages and the SIAB system to receive them. Your sequencer 
must be set as follows:
 
✓ MTC slave–External synch
 
✓ 24 fps
 
✓ MMC master
Your SIAB system in turn must be set as follows:
 
✓ MTC master–Internal synch
 
✓ 24 fps
 
✓ MMC slave
These settings enable you to use either device’s transport functions to con-
trol the other. The MTC master sends the timing data, but each device sends 
control messages to the other. Check your system’s manuals to see whether 
you can do this with your gear.
Sequencing
Sequencing is the heart of most home recordists’ MIDI studios because 
sequencing allows you to actually record your instrument’s part and play it 
back. If you’re like most people, the sequencing part of MIDI is what excites 
you the most. With sequencing, you can play as many instruments as your 
room can handle (or more, if you have long cords).
Sequencing is not unlike audio recording: You have the same transport 
functions (start, stop, record, rewind, and so on), and you have the ability 
to record each instrument on a separate track. This is where the similari-
ties between audio tracks and MIDI tracks end, however. As I’ve mentioned 
before, MIDI sequencing deals with performance commands and not audio 
waveforms. This opens a few doors that can come in mighty handy in the fol-
lowing situations:

219
 Chapter 12: Recording and Editing MIDI Data
 
✓ If you aren’t the greatest player in the world
 
✓ If you’re not sure what key you want the song to be in
 
✓ If you don’t know (or haven’t decided) what sounds you want to use
With MIDI sequencing, you can make a whole host of changes to your per-
formance after you’ve recorded it. You can change the placement or volume 
of individual notes, you can change the song’s key, and you can change the 
instrumentation (for example, you can have a brass ensemble play a part that 
you originally wrote for the strings). One of the other great things about MIDI 
sequencing is that you can capture a performance that you don’t have the 
chops (skills) to pull off live.
Recording MIDI data
You can record a MIDI track in one of the following ways:
 
✓ Real-time recording: Play the part as you would for a regular audio 
recording.
 
✓ Step-time sequencing: Manually input the music one note at a time. 
Step-time sequencing is a great tool if you don’t have the skills to per-
form that part in real time.
The MIDI tracks in most sequencer software programs look virtually the same 
as the audio tracks except for a small icon. Logic, for instance, has an M icon, 
and in Cubase, you find a small musical note. Each icon is located to the left 
of the track name. You generally engage the track that you want to record to 
by clicking it once.
Preparing to record
Before you start to record a MIDI track, you need to make the following 
adjustments to your setup:
 
✓ Make sure that your MIDI gear is synchronized. For details on how to 
do this, check out the section “Synchronizing Your Devices,” earlier in 
this chapter.
 
✓ Set your levels and the patch (sound) that you want to hear. Setting 
levels simply means setting the volume that you hear through your mon-
itors at a comfortable level.
 
 To choose the sound that you want to hear, you can select the sound 
in your synthesizer, in which case the sequencer recognizes this set-
ting, or choose the sound within the sequencer program. This process 
is done differently for each type of sequencer, but most of them have 
a track menu located to the left of the screen that applies to the track 
you have engaged.

220
Part IV: Laying Track: Starting to Record 
 
 Figure 12-4 shows a basic track menu setup in a sequencer program. In 
this figure, the patch is set for program 58, bank 0 (short for Sound #58 
in one of the sound module’s banks of sounds). Most sound modules 
also give you the patch name, such as “program 1, bank 0, acoustic 
grand piano.” (My ddrum4 doesn’t show the patch name, so it’s not 
included in the figure).

track menu

the settings 
for that

✓ Set your metronome to the tempo that you want to record to. You do 
this by opening the Metronome Settings menu (which is often located on 
the Options menu). Choose the tempo and time signature for your song, 
and you’re set to go.
 
 Within the Metronome Settings menu, you can also choose the MIDI note 
that the metronome sounds on, whether you have a count in before the 
song actually starts (called a preroll), and more.
 
You don’t need to set the tempo for a song ahead of time. You can always 
adjust this later. In fact, you can set the tempo slower than the final version 
so that you can play the part slower and get the notes right. This can be espe-
cially beneficial if the part is difficult or if you’re not the greatest player in the 
world. Just be sure to set the tempo to its final speed before you start record-
ing audio tracks because you can’t change the tempo of the audio tracks later 
like you can with MIDI tracks.

221
 Chapter 12: Recording and Editing MIDI Data
Real-time recording
If you’re recording in real time, just press the Record button and start play-
ing. You can find the Record button on the Transport Bar if you use a com-
puter-based software program (this can be found on the Windows menu in 
Logic, for example). On a Roland VS-1680, it’s the red button on the lower left 
of the device. (Don’t forget to wait until the preroll is finished if you have that 
function engaged.)
If your recorded performance is the way you want it, you can move on to 
another instrument’s part. Just set up a new track to record the sound that 
you want on the MIDI channel that you prefer. If you don’t like your perfor-
mance, you have the following options:
 
✓ Rerecord your part from the beginning.
 
✓ Rerecord only those sections that don’t sound right. Rerecording parts 
of a performance is generally referred to as punching in and out. This 
involves setting your recorder to just record a section of your perfor-
mance, as I describe in Chapter 11.
 
✓ Edit the performance. I discuss the details of editing in the section 
“Editing your data,” later in this chapter.
Step-time sequencing
Step-time recording involves entering your part one note at a time. This can 
take a long time to do, especially if it’s a difficult part (one with lots of notes). 
But step-time recording may be your only option if you don’t have the skills 
to play the part live.
Most sequencer programs include a step-time recording mode. Select this 
mode and then click the Record button. You enter your part by selecting 
the note value (eighth note or sixteenth note, for example) for the first note 
or chord. Then when you play the note on your keyboard, it is entered into 
the sequencer. Choose your next note, press the key(s) you want to record, 
and so on.
 
Some sequencers allow you to go into a score window and enter your notes 
that way. If you can read music, this can be much easier and faster than the 
traditional step-time mode. Just choose the note’s duration from the menu bar 
and click the place where you want that note to be. After you get the hang of 
this method, step timing can be pretty quick. Check your sequencer program’s 
manual for details.

222
Part IV: Laying Track: Starting to Record 
Overdubbing
After you record some MIDI performances, you can easily add to or change 
them. The time-honored name for this kind of recording is overdubbing. 
Overdubbing MIDI performance data is similar to overdubbing your audio 
data. Most programs allow you to overdub in several ways: manually punch-
ing in and out, punching automatically, and loop punching. In addition, 
because MIDI is strictly performance information with no actual sound, most 
recording programs allow you to either replace or merge existing MIDI data 
when you overdub.
Using MIDI Merge/Replace
When you overdub to a MIDI track, many MIDI recording programs offer you 
the option to either replace existing material or add new data to it. For exam-
ple, in Pro Tools, you make this selection by clicking the MIDI Merge/Replace 
button. This button is located in the Transport window, as shown in Figure 
12-5. Here’s how it works:
 
✓ When the Merge/Replace button is engaged (MIDI Merge mode), new 
material is merged with existing MIDI data on the record-enabled 
track(s).
 
✓ When the Merge/Replace button is disengaged (MIDI Replace mode), 
new MIDI data replaces existing information on the record-enabled 
track(s).
 
Figure 12-5:

data in a

there. 
To engage MIDI Merge in Pro Tools, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the MIDI controls section of the Transport window by choosing 
Display➪Transport Window Shows➪MIDI Controls.
 
 The Transport window expands to include the MIDI controls section.
 
2. Click the MIDI Merge button.
 
 The button becomes highlighted.

223
 Chapter 12: Recording and Editing MIDI Data
Most MIDI sequencers have a similar function, but by default, any overdubs 
you do are placed in a new sequence — leaving the original intact.
Punching in and out
If you like some of your initial take and want to record over only part of it, 
you can set points at which to start and stop recording within the session. 
This is called punching in and out.
As is the case with audio tracks, most programs allow you to punch into MIDI 
tracks in several ways. These include punching in and out manually, automati-
cally, and repeatedly (looping). With the exception of being able to choose 
to merge your punched data with your original performance or being able to 
replace it, punching into and out of MIDI tracks is the same as punching into 
and out of audio tracks. I detail the exact procedures for performing these 
punches in Chapter 11.
Editing your data
The editing capabilities for MIDI tracks are quite extensive. Not only can you per-
form the typical cut, copy, and paste functions, but you can also quantize (adjust 
the timing of a note) and transpose (adjust the pitch of a note), which I cover in 
the sections that follow. Heck, you can even fix a single bad note if you want to.
In most newer sequencer programs, you have the following three ways of 
performing edits:
 
✓ Piano-roll graphic window: This is the most common way to edit MIDI 
performances. Look at Figure 12-6. In this window, the horizontal bars 
in the center are the MIDI notes recorded on the track. Each of these 
notes can be lengthened, shortened, and moved. Also, just above the 
note grid, a bar tells you the note’s start time and length, pitch, velocity 
(volume — both on and off), and MIDI channel. Each of the parameters 
can be adjusted by typing a value. The top of this window contains navi-
gation tools, more editing options, and quantization values (the note 
value used to adjust the timing of a performance). Just select the note 
and you can do any of these editing functions.
 
✓ Score window: If you read music, the score window may be your choice 
for editing. This window looks just like a piece of sheet music. Within 
this window, you can move notes around in much the same way as the 
piano-roll window. The only difference is that you get to see the musical 
score as you edit your performance. Some sequencers allow you to print 
the score as well. This can be handy if you’re composing music that you 
want other people to play.
 
✓ Events list: If you’re a real computer geek (you know who you are), you 
may prefer the data-filled look and feel of the Events list editing menu. 
This menu shows you the list of MIDI events that make up your track. 

224
Part IV: Laying Track: Starting to Record 
Look at Figure 12-7. This menu shows all the performance and MIDI 
commands for that track. The only thing you may not find in this menu, 
depending on the sequencer program that you have, is the actual note 
that you played, so you may not be able to change that data. But you 
can edit every other part of your performance.

225
 Chapter 12: Recording and Editing MIDI Data
Quantization
Quantization is simply allowing the sequencer to fix your rhythmic timing. 
Say you recorded a drum pattern, and because you played it on your key-
board, the timing kinda stinks. The bass drum missed the downbeat, and the 
snare drum is inconsistent. Don’t worry — you don’t need to rerecord your 
part. You can just move all those notes into their proper places — and you 
don’t even have to touch each of those notes to do it. Just choose the quanti-
zation value and click a button.
The quantization value determines the subdivision to which the quantiza-
tion feature moves the notes. For example, if you choose a quantization 
value of 16, all your notes are moved to the nearest sixteenth note. With 
most sequencers, you can choose a number of quantization values, including 
eighth notes, sixteenth notes, and thirty-second notes.
Most new quantizers also allow you to assign a percentage to the quanti-
zation value. For example, a setting of 50 percent moves the note halfway 
between where you played it and the next quantization point designated 
by your quantization value. The higher the number, the closer to the actual 
quantization point your note will go. This feature is essential in keeping quan-
tized music from sounding stiff.
 
Double-check your track after you’ve quantized it because it may have moved 
a misplaced note in the wrong direction. This happens if your note is farther 
away from where you want it to be than it was to another quantization point. 
If a note has moved in the wrong direction, select that note and move it to 
where you want it.
Transposing
Imagine that you write a song that you plan to sing, but then you meet some-
one with a great voice who wants to sing it. The only problem is that you 
already recorded all the parts and this great singer’s voice is in a completely 
different range than yours. The song would sound so much better if it were 
raised a couple of keys. Well, if your recorded tracks are MIDI, you simply 
go to the Options menu, choose Transpose, and type in the change of key. 
Presto, your whole song has changed key, and you didn’t have to rerecord a 
single part! Try doing that with your audio tracks.

226
Part IV: Laying Track: Starting to Record 
Saving Your Data
For the most part, saving data in your sequencer program is like saving data 
in any computer program. Yep, you need to click the Save button (or press 
Ô-S if you have a Mac). Don’t forget to save your work regularly, lest your 
computer crashes and you lose several hours’ work.
The main thing to know about saving data in a sequencer program is that 
most programs have their own proprietary file format. You generally can’t 
take a saved file from your program and play it on another one.
If you want to play your MIDI tracks on another sequencer program or make 
it available on the Internet for other people to play, make sure that you save 
your music as an SMF (Standard MIDI Format) file. Nearly all sequencer pro-
grams allow you to save in this format. Some even do this by default. Check 
your owner’s manual to see how to do this. Then you can give your MIDI 
tracks to anyone who can play an SMF file, and if you recorded your stuff by 
using a GM standard, it sounds just how you intended it to sound, regardless 
of the listener’s gear.
Transferring Data Using MIDI
Another great thing about MIDI is that you can use the cable and ports to 
send more than just MIDI performance information. Many manufacturers 
allow you to send sound patches through the MIDI connection by using 
system-exclusive messages. This can be a great tool. In fact, I own an elec-
tronic drum set whose sounds can be changed and updated by connecting a 
MIDI cable between the sound module (brain) and my computer. I can store 
gazillions of sounds on my computer without cluttering up (or overloading) 
my drum set’s brain. But wait, it gets even better. This manufacturer makes 
new sounds available on its Web site to download for free! Yep, I can add new 
sounds to my drum set without having to buy anything. You gotta love it!
Performing a data transfer via your MIDI connection is easy. Just connect 
your device to the MIDI interface on your computer, open the data-transfer 
software provided by the manufacturer, and follow the directions.

▶ Editing aurally
▶ Editing visually
▶ Correcting flaws in your performance
▶ Combining your best performances from several virtual tracks
E
ven after you put in all the time needed to get the best sound and per-
formance, you most likely will want to make changes to your tracks. You 
may want to get rid of some noise or maybe clean up a few bad notes. Well, 
you can do this with editing. And if you have a digital hard-drive system, you 
can edit to your heart’s content without sacrificing sound quality and without 
losing your original tracks.
In this chapter, you discover the joys of fixing a performance with editing. 
I cover the basics and try to help you find out whether your editing style is 
visual or auditory. You also explore the ways that you can use the editing 
capabilities of your digital system to create a performance that never hap-
pened by creating loops, assembling song sections, and making composites 
from virtual tracks.
 
The way you edit your tracks depends on your digital recording system. Some 
systems, such as computer-based DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations), use 
tools similar to those in word processing programs. Other systems, such as 
stand-alone systems and SIAB (studio-in-a-box) systems, base their editing 
methods on traditional audio approaches. I can’t possibly cover all the vari-
ables that exist in the many types of systems, but what I can do is show you 
the basics so that you understand what possibilities exist. Hopefully you get 
enough of a glimpse into the world of audio editing that you can then apply 
these skills to the system that you own.
 
Some people never do any editing of a recorded performance except to get rid 
of unwanted noise. What gets to disk is what they use. I rarely do any editing 
except for making the occasional loop and/or getting rid of a stray bad note. 
You may be like I am and have little use for the amazing tools available in most 

230
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
digital systems’ editing menus. That’s okay; don’t feel like you have to use 
every capability of your system. On the other hand, if editing fits your style, 
don’t be afraid to pull out all the stops and get creative.
Understanding Digital Editing
In the old days of analog tape, you needed to break out the razor blade and 
adhesive tape to do audio editing. Cutting out a performance was exactly 
that — physically cutting the performance from the tape that contained the 
audio. The problem was that after you finished the cut and taped the open 
ends back together, you couldn’t reassemble the original performance. (Well, 
I suppose you could try to peel that tape off the new joint and tape the part 
you cut out back in again.)
And it got even worse. If you wanted to edit a single track, you had to cut 
a little window in the tape where that part was, only in the track you were 
working on. You were left with a hole in the tape.
And then consider this: While you were cutting and taping the tape, you were 
touching it with your fingers and getting oils all over your precious tracks. 
The result: sound degradation. In all, analog tape editing was messy work 
that introduced unneeded stress on the tape (and perhaps the recordist) and 
degraded the sound of the music.
Lucky for you, there’s a better way — digital editing. You can edit digitally by 
using your hard-drive recording system. Digital hard-drive recording allows 
you to do a staggering variety of things to your recorded tracks. You can cut, 
copy, delete, erase, insert, move, and paste your music, among other things. 
And the best part is that you can do any of these procedures and still change 
your mind when you’re done.
This aspect of digital editing is called nondestructive editing, which means 
that your original recording is kept intact (the recorder often makes a copy of 
the original data before it makes the edits or it simply points to the data to be 
played and ignores the data you chose not to have play). On the other hand, 
the no-returns policy of analog editing is referred to as destructive editing, and 
after it’s done, you’re committed to the results, regardless of whether you 
like them.
Editing can be done in a variety of ways, and almost every recording system 
does it a little differently. In the following sections, I list many of the basic 
editing functions that a digital hard-drive system can perform.

231
 Chapter 13: Editing Your Performance
Copy
The Copy command is universal in digital audio and does exactly what you 
think — it makes a copy of a selected performance. Here’s how the different 
systems generally work:
 
✓ Computer-based systems: Copy can work much like the Copy function of 
your computer’s word processing program. A copy of your selection is 
made and put into a clipboard section of your system. You can then take 
that copy and paste it somewhere else in the song.
 
✓ Stand-alone or SIAB systems: These systems don’t necessarily place 
copied material on a clipboard. Instead, you’re prompted to choose a 
place to paste your work before you make the copy.
Many systems also allow you to choose how many times you want to copy 
the part and choose whether you want to override the existing material 
where you copy it or insert the new material into that section instead. If you 
insert the copy, the existing material moves over and makes room for the 
copied section.
Cut/Delete/Erase
The Cut, Erase, and Delete commands all do the same thing to the selected 
section — it goes away. The difference is what happens to that material 
after it disappears and what happens to the remaining material on the 
track; Figure 13-1 illustrates these differences. Here’s the lowdown on the 
commands:
 
✓ Cut: Lifts the selected audio section and puts it on a clipboard so that 
you can place it somewhere else. On some systems, such as the Cubase 
VST, the rest of the audio track stays put, leaving an empty space where 
the cut section was. On other systems (Logic Audio, for example), the 
existing material is brought forward to fill the space left by the cut 
material, similar to the way that your word processing software deals 
with the Cut command. Some systems, such as Cakewalk, allow you to 
choose whether the existing material moves forward.
 
✓ Delete: Eliminates the selected material, keeping you from placing it 
anywhere else. Delete acts like an analog audio cut-and-tape procedure: 
The material following the deleted section is brought forward to fill 
the empty space. The Delete command is common among stand-alone 
recorders like the Akai DR-16Pro and among SIAB systems such as the 
Roland VS-1880.

232
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
 
 Most computer-based systems, such as Pro Tools and Logic, have a 
Snap option that can treat existing material the same way as Delete, 
depending on how you have set your preferences. In this case, the Snap 
option snaps existing material back to fill any space left by a cut section.
 
✓ Erase: Like Delete, Erase gets rid of the selected section and doesn’t 
allow you to put the section anywhere else. Unlike Delete, Erase leaves a 
hole in the audio where the selected section used to be. The remaining 
audio stays put.
 
 Most computer-based systems have a Silence procedure that acts just 
like Erase. When material is “silenced,” an empty space is left where the 
material used to be.

Insert
The Insert function is common among stand-alone and SIAB systems. It 
allows you to place a selected piece of music in a track (or multiple tracks) 
and moves the music that exists after the insert point so that there’s room 
for the inserted material (see Figure 13-2). This is a handy feature that lets 
you add to a section without losing data.

For example, say you have a bridge section of a song that you wrote and 
recorded to be 8 bars long, but after you’ve finished the song, you want to 
add a guitar solo to the bridge and 8 bars just isn’t long enough (you guitar 
monster, you!). You want the bridge to be 16 bars long instead. Well, rather 
than having to rerecord the entire song with the new bridge section, you can 
copy the 8 new bars that you have for the bridge and insert them at the end of 
the existing bridge section, making the bridge 16 bars long. This only takes a 
second to do, and you don’t have to plug in any mics or play any instruments.
 
If you have a computer-based system that doesn’t have an Insert function, just 
select all the music immediately after the current bridge section and move it 
over 8 bars by using your mouse. This leaves an 8-bar space that you can then 
fill using the procedure I described previously.
 
If you have a song with a lot of tempo changes and you use a tempo map (a 
function that allows you to set the tempo and time signature for each section 
of the song), make sure that you double-check your tempo map after you’ve 
made your edits because the tempo map won’t adjust automatically. For 
example, if you add 8 bars to the bridge (like I describe in the earlier example), 
you need to add 8 bars to that section of the tempo map to make sure that the 
rest of the song remains accurate.
Paste
As obvious as this may sound, pasting is just placing your selected music 
somewhere. Like the Cut and Copy functions, this function is a staple for 
computer-based systems, but it isn’t common among stand-alone or SIAB sys-
tems. In many cases, Paste overwrites the existing material where you put it, 
as shown in Figure 13-3, unless you have an Insert option and you use it. Some 
computer-based systems treat Paste like a word processing program does — 
the existing material moves over and makes room for the pasted section.

ing material.
 
After paste
Before edit
Like all computer Paste functions, whatever you put on the clipboard stays 
there until you replace it with something else. So you can paste the same 
selection as many times as you like.
Move
Nearly all digital recording systems have some sort of Move function. In 
most cases, you can just choose the audio section that you want to move 
and choose a destination for it. If you don’t have a Move function key, your 
system probably has the Cut, Copy, and Paste options that you can use the 
same way. Cut and Paste can move your music just as effectively as the Move 
function.
Moving audio data can be performed several ways depending on the system, 
but you probably move data by using a Move menu or by clicking and drag-
ging. On the Move menu, you designate the section to be moved and where 
you want to move it to. This can be within a particular track or from one 
track to another. Within this menu, you may have the choice between over-
writing the material at the destination point with your selection and moving 
the existing material to make space for the stuff that you moved. The latter is 
sometimes called a Move/Insert procedure.
If you have a system that uses a large video monitor, a mouse, and a key-
board, you may have the option to just click and drag the selection where 
you want it. In most cases, your moved selection overwrites the existing 
material in its new place, effectively erasing it (although it may still be hidden 
underneath — but you can’t hear it when you play back the track). In other 
systems, the moved material is inserted in its new place, moving existing 
material in the process. Your system’s owner’s manual should spell out how 
this procedure is treated.

 Chapter 13: Editing Your Performance
Export/Import
Exporting and importing involve moving music from one song file to another. 
Some systems enable you to import a single track from another song, 
whereas on other systems, you have to import everything in a song file.
 
If you can import only a whole song file but you just want a single track, just 
make a copy of the song that you want to import and erase everything you 
don’t need from that song. Then when you import the song file, you import 
only the stuff that you want. Doing it this way rather than importing the whole 
song file and then erasing the unwanted stuff afterward is quicker because the 
computer doesn’t have to import more than you need.
Undo
Undo is the most important key/function that you have in your digital system. 
It allows you to, well, undo what you just did. Without it, you may as well be 
trying to edit with analog tape, a razor blade, and adhesive tape.
How much you can undo depends on your system. Most systems give you 
at least 99 levels of undo — that is, you can make 99 consecutive edits and 
reverse them all (or just some of them). Some systems even go as far as 
giving you 999 undos. How’s that for insurance? So edit at will, because you 
can always change your mind later.
On the other hand, some systems, such as older versions of Logic Audio, have 
only one level of undo. This isn’t a deficit, however, because this program 
gives you the option of saving your selection before you make the edit. If you 
choose to do this before each edit, you are essentially allowed as many undos 
as you want, as long as you have the hard drive space to store all those copies 
of your audio track.
 
Some systems, such as the Roland V-Studios, have a Song Optimize function. 
Song Optimize enables you to save the song and throw away junk that you 
don’t think you need, thus reducing the size of the song file. This is a nice 
feature except, after you optimize your song, you lose the ability to undo any-
thing you did before you optimized. So, if you think that you may want to undo 
something you’ve done, don’t click that Optimization button!
 
As you can see by all the different ways that various programs use and define 
editing procedures, you need to read your owner’s manual and be familiar 
with your program to use these functions properly.

Finding the Section You Want to Edit
To use an editing function, you need to find the section of music that you 
want to change. It can be the whole song from one track, a short musical 
phrase from several tracks, or even a single note. The following sections deal 
with the two basic ways that you can find the beginning and end of the sec-
tion that you want to edit. These are editing aurally and editing visually.
Each method has its advantages, and you’ll probably prefer one method over 
the other for your working style. I’m from the old school and much prefer 
editing by listening to the section I work with. I trust my ears much more 
than my eyes. You may find that the opposite is true for you. But chances are 
that you’ll use a little bit of both approaches for your music.
Editing aurally
The traditional way to perform an edit is to play the song on the tape deck 
until you reach the general area of the music that you want to edit. You then 
stop the tape and manually rock it back and forth against the play head to 
find the precise place to make the cut. You mark the back of the tape with a 
wax pencil and go looking for the next edit point. This process requires care-
ful listening, and finding the exact spot to edit often takes quite a while.
For predigital people, such as myself, the manufacturers of digital systems 
make this process similar to editing analog tape (yeah). Finding an edit 
point aurally is often a two-step process: First you need to find and mark the 
general section that you want to edit using a marker (also called an anchor 
point), and then you need to identify the exact spot for your beginning and 
end points. You do this with the Scrub function, as detailed in the following 
steps:
 
1. Listen to the song and place a marker (sometimes called an anchor 
point) on the fly as the section you want to edit passes.
 
 Do this by clicking the appropriate Marker button (the Tap key on a 
Roland VS-1880, for instance). Mark both the beginning and end points 
as accurately as you can. Your markers will be a little off, but don’t 
worry about that now. Your next step involves honing those points 
using the Scrub function.
 
2. Use the Scrub function that’s associated with your system to zero in on 
the spot you need.
 
 The Scrub function works much like analog tape where you can “rock” 
the music back and forth (this is called scrubbing, hence the name) to 
find the precise spot that you’re looking for. In some systems, such as 

237
 Chapter 13: Editing Your Performance
the Akai DR-16, you can use the Jog wheel to scrub with. Start from the 
marker points that you set on the fly and dial the wheel back and forth 
until you find the exact spot to edit. This may take a while, so be patient. 
Do this for both the beginning and end points for your edit.
 
 Other systems, such as the Roland VS-1880, don’t allow you to scrub 
like analog tape. Instead, the Scrub function uses a short loop — from 
25 to 100 milliseconds — that you scrub with. The overall process of 
scrubbing is the same, except you have a couple more steps to follow. 
The Scrub feature on most digital recorders works pretty well; each just 
works a little differently and one approach may work better for you.
 
Not all digital recorders have a Scrub feature that works as well as the old 
analog tape rocking technique. So if being able to scrub is important to you, 
be sure to test this feature on the systems you’re looking at before you buy.
 
If you have a computer-based system, you may find a scrub-type feature on the 
Tool palette. In Cubase, for instance, the Scrub tool uses an icon that looks like 
a small speaker. Look at your system to see whether you have this function.
Editing visually
Digital recording systems, especially those that use large video monitors, 
enable you to edit your music visually. This can be a great asset when you 
want to edit sounds down to the waveform level or if you don’t want to 
hassle with aural searching.
In visual editing, you choose your edit points by viewing the audio waveform 
of a track on-screen. The audio waveform shows the amplitude (volume) of 
the sound that’s recorded to disk. Check out Figure 13-4 for an example.
 
Figure 13-4: 
The wave-
form editor 
lets you see 
the music, 
making 
editing 
pretty easy.
 

238
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
You can use the waveform as a guide to show you where a particular sound 
is located. For example, if you pull up the waveform of a drum rhythm and 
set the track to play, you can see where the various sounds of the drum set 
(snare drum, kick drum, and so on) are located. Then just put a marker on 
the fly or stop the playback roughly where you want to be. As you get used 
to hearing the music and seeing the waveform pass by on your computer 
screen, you’ll be able to tell by looking at a waveform where a sound starts 
and stops.
Take a look a Figure 13-4 again and find the cursor that’s located just before 
the third large waveform. This is a snare drum note. You can select that sec-
tion in the following ways (some systems offer you several ways, while others 
just have one):
 
✓ Click and drag to create a box around the section you want to edit. 
This is generally the easiest way to choose a section of audio.
 
✓ Choose the numerical location points. On SIAB systems, which typically 
don’t have a cursor or mouse to work with, you can do this quickly by 
finding the point in the waveform and clicking a button (called the Now 
button in the Roland SIAB systems). The data is entered into the box, 
and you don’t have to type the numbers.
 
✓ Type the beginning and ending edit points in the appropriate dialog 
box. This is an option if you have a computer-based system. If you have 
a keyboard and you’re a fast typist, this may be the most efficient way 
for you to choose edit points.
On most systems, you can zoom in or out on the waveform graphic for a 
better look. You can often increase both the height (amplitude) and width 
(time frame) of the image of the waveform that you see.
 
With most instruments that have slow attacks — a slow initial sound, as 
with vocals or guitars — you can see the start of the sound by looking at the 
waveform. The beginning in the rise of the waves matches the beginning of 
the sound. But on drums and other instruments with very fast attacks, the 
attack of the instrument happens before the rise in amplitude. In fact, if you 
look again at Figure 13-4, you can see a vertical dotted line just to the left of 
the snare drum’s part in the waveform. This is where the attack starts for that 
drum sound. If you were to rely only on your eyes and choose the waveform 
part that you see, you would miss the initial point of the stick hitting the drum 
(and all the character that it contains). What you would hear is a mushy-
sounding snare drum.
Many computer-based programs have a function that allows you to find the 
start point of your audio with a simple keystroke. In Pro Tools, this is called 
“Tab to Transient.” In this case, all you need to do is enable this function, 
move your cursor to a point just before the section you want to find, and 
press Tab. The cursor moves to the beginning of the audio data. This feature 

239
 Chapter 13: Editing Your Performance
is handy for making edits quickly and accurately. If this type of function is 
important to you, be sure to look closely at the computer program before 
buying to see whether it can do this.
 
Even though you use the waveform screen to do editing, you still need to find 
the beginning of that sound by using the Scrub function (described in the pre-
ceding section). Just search the space before your drum note until you hear 
where the attack starts. It’s usually about 40 to 50 milliseconds before the 
waveform jumps up.
Editing to Improve the Sound 
of a Performance
If you’re going to be editing your music, you need to know a couple of useful 
skills. These include being able to edit individual notes and phrases, finding 
and replacing notes that are too loud or too soft, getting rid of noise and dis-
tortion, and correcting pitch problems.
Replacing a bad note
Replacing a bad note is one editing procedure that I use frequently. Here’s an 
example: A few weeks ago, I played the drum part of a new song for the band 
I’m currently recording with. I really got into the groove — the feel was right, 
I made all the changes, and I even did some really cool fills and stuff. When I 
listened to the part after I finished recording, it sounded fine, so I went on to 
record some other parts. But when I listened to it again a week later, I heard 
one snare drum hit in which I caught the rim, and it sticks out in the mix 
like the proverbial sore thumb. I could just punch in a new snare drum note, 
but I’m lazy. Besides, I had already put away my mics, and there’s no way I 
could set them up the way I did the day I recorded the drums, not to mention 
tuning the drums exactly the same way I had them that day.
Well, here’s a time when I’m thanking my lucky stars that I have a digital 
system that allows me to make minute edits (just try slicing a single snare 
drum note out of an analog tape). Hopefully you won’t have to do this proce-
dure, but if you do, follow these steps:
 
1. Copy the track that you want to fix to another track in your system.
 
 This way, you can reference the original track.
 
2. Place the copy on a track or virtual track that allows you to hear both 
the original and the copy at the same time.

240
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
 
3. Listen for a snare drum hit that you especially like and select it by 
using one of the techniques that I describe in the section “Editing 
aurally,” earlier in this chapter.
 
4. Make a copy of the selection.
 
5. Find and mark the bad note.
 
6. Place the copy of the good note right where the bad note is.
 
 The procedure for this varies depending on your system.
 
 Make sure that the Insert function is turned off. Otherwise, you add an 
extra note and move the bad note over, along with the rest of the music 
from that track.
 
7. After you have the good note in the place of the bad one, turn up the 
volume of both versions of your track and listen to them again.
 
 You should hear an exact copy of the track, except for that one note. 
Listen carefully at the place of the replaced note for any timing prob-
lems. The two tracks should match perfectly. If they don’t, just use the 
Undo function and try again. Also, check the rest of the song after that 
note to make sure that you didn’t accidentally insert the note rather 
than replace it.
 
If your system doesn’t allow you to make such a fine edit or if you can’t suc-
cessfully select a single note, you can replace a whole measure instead of just 
the single note. Just follow the same steps and use a larger phrase instead of 
the one note.
Evening out a performance
Evening out a performance means making adjustments to the levels of a note 
or phrase within the song. Sometimes it can also mean changing the empha-
sis of certain notes to change the meaning or “feel” of a part. This section 
covers these areas using two functions called Normalize and Quieten. It’s not 
uncommon for a track to contain a stray note that is either much louder or 
much softer than the rest of the notes around it. In this case, you don’t need 
to cut it out and replace it with another note, like I did in the example in the 
preceding section. Instead you can just make a change to the volume (or 
level) of that note, as follows:
 
✓ To raise the volume of a note: Select the note that you want to change 
and choose Edit➪Normalize. In most cases, Normalize allows you to 
choose the maximum dynamic level (in dB) that you want the section 
to be, the amount below clipping (0dB) that you want, or the minimum 
headroom that you want to have left (also in dB). These last two options 
are essentially the same thing.

241
 Chapter 13: Editing Your Performance
 
✓ To lower the volume of a note: Select the note that you want to change 
and choose Edit➪Quieten. This lowers the amplitude of the selected sec-
tion by a predetermined amount. On some systems, you can choose this 
amount.
If you know where your levels are in decibels (dB), you can also choose 
Edit➪Normalize to reduce the level of a note. In the dialog box that appears, 
choose a value that’s lower than the peak of your selected note. For example, 
if you have a drumbeat that is too loud — right at 0dB — and the surround-
ing notes are at –6dB, you can then choose 6dB for either the minimum head-
room you want to have left or the amount below clipping. This drops your 
signal by 6dB — the level of the rest of the notes. If you don’t know where 
your levels are in dB, you can experiment until you get the level where you 
want it. Using the Normalize function to reduce the volume of a note may 
be better than using the Quieten function if you want to control exactly how 
much quieter you want the note to be and your system doesn’t allow you to 
set the value used by the Quieten function.
 
You’re not limited to making adjustments to single notes. You can also use 
Quieten or Normalize to adjust the levels of short phrases or an entire track.
 
Normalize and Quieten only adjust the levels of the section that you choose 
to work with. So when you use these functions, be aware of how your edits 
relate to the music in and around your edits. For example, if you normalize or 
quieten a section of the waveform, the softest notes increase in volume only 
by the level that the highest note increases. For example, Figure 13-5 shows a 
saxophone line before and after normalizing to maximum dB. The view on the 
left shows the levels before normalization. The one on the right is after the 
normalization procedure. The notes were raised a bit, and the overall dynamic 
range remains the same.
 
Figure 13-5: 
Normalizing 
keeps the 
dynamic 
range of the 
original 
section.
 
Next, take a look at Figure 13-6. This shows what happens when you choose 
the quietest section to normalize. As you can see, the relationship between 
the various notes has changed dramatically. Played back, this passage now 
sounds unnatural, and the original performance is altered beyond recognition.

242
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
 
Figure 13-6: 
Choosing a 
quiet sec-
tion of a 
song and

dynamic 
range of the 
music.
 
 
You can use normalization to change the emotional content of a piece of 
music — even its meaning — by changing where the emphasized (accented) 
notes are located. For example, take the phrase “I love your music” (a phrase 
that I hope you hear a lot). Depending on which word of the phrase is empha-
sized, you get a slightly different meaning:
I love your music.
I love your music.
I love your music.
I love your music.
These are slight variations but ones that can alter how the listener perceives 
something. In the same way, by changing the level of a note or phrase, you 
can change the emotion of the performance.
Getting rid of distortion
In Chapter 10, I am adamant about getting your levels set so that you don’t 
get digital distortion. Even if you follow my advice and are extremely diligent 
in making sure that you didn’t get any digital clipping, one note may have 
snuck through anyway. Well, it may not be the end of the world.
If you have a system that allows you to adjust the individual waves of a wave-
form, just reduce the level of the single clipped note. You do this by zooming 
in as close as you can to the distorted note and choosing only that one note 
to quieten. (Your system’s manual should clearly explain this procedure.) 
If you can’t adjust the waveform, you need to replace that note with a good, 
undistorted one (if you can find one) or reduce the level of that note until the 
distortion is hidden.

243
 Chapter 13: Editing Your Performance
If this is the lead vocal, you probably don’t have the option to reduce the 
level, and replacing a bad note in a vocal part generally sounds unnatural. If 
you can replace the section with another phrase from the song, this is your 
best bet. If you don’t have that option and you can’t rerecord the part, you 
can mask the distortion by adding a little distortion as an effect to the entire 
vocal track — a procedure that’s performed more often than you may expect.
 
If the performance is top-notch and if messing with it will take away some of the 
magic, you can always leave well enough alone and leave in the clipped note 
(distortion). After all, the performance is the most important part of any song.
Getting rid of noise
No matter what you do when recording, you’re going to end up with extra 
noise, such as a chair squeak, a cough, or too much breath from the singer. 
To get rid of the noise, just select the noise and follow your system’s proce-
dures for erasing or silencing a selection. When you do this, be sure that you 
don’t have a Snap function engaged; you don’t want the material following 
the erasure to move.
Correcting pitch problems
It used to be that if you sang or played an out-of-tune note, you had to record 
it over again. If your singing is mediocre (like mine on a good day), you could 
spend hours trying to get every note just right. And after all these hours of 
fixing out-of-tune notes, you’re often left with a performance that lacks “feel” 
(emotional impact). Well, those days are behind you. You can now edit your 
sour notes using a pitch-correction program. You can find pitch correction 
on nearly all digital recording systems that have effects processors included 
in them (computer-based and SIAB systems in particular).
To correct pitch, choose the note or notes that you want to correct and then 
choose the pitch-correction option on your editing menu. In the dialog box 
that appears, choose the amount of change that you want. You may need to 
experiment a little to find just the right pitch.
Some devices, such as Antares Autotune, make the correction for you auto-
matically. (Antares Autotune is available as both a stand-alone processor and 
as a plug-in for a computer-based system. You can find these components 
at most major musical instrument retailers.) And some pitch-correction 
programs, such as the one in Logic Audio, allow you to adjust not only the 
change in fundamental pitch but also the pitch change of that note’s harmon-
ics. This can produce a much more natural sound.

244
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
 
Unless you’re going for a particular effect, be judicious in your use of pitch 
correction because it can suck the life out of a performance. Sometimes the 
slightly out-of-tune notes are what give a performance its character.
Pitch correction is often part of the system’s editing functions, but it can be 
used as an effect as well. Check out Chapter 15 to find some ways that you 
can use pitch shifting to add depth to your music.
Creating a Performance That 
Never Happened
Editing can be much more than just fixing a bad note or phrase — editing 
can consist of assembling a performance that never really happened. In the 
following sections, I walk you through the often-timesaving process of put-
ting together a song from small parts: one- or two-measure loops, single sec-
tions such as verses and choruses, and parts of separate performances from 
virtual tracks (called a composite take). Doing these procedures has some 
advantages for you as a recording engineer. For example:
 
✓ By creating loops, you don’t have to play the same 1- or 2-bar phrase 
over and over again for the duration of the song.
 
✓ By assembling song parts, you can alter the song’s structure any way 
that you want.
 
✓ By making composite takes, you can create a performance that you 
could never play in one pass.
Creating loops
Loops are repeated phrases within a song. Looping has been around since the 
beginning of multitrack recording. You used to have to make an actual loop of 
tape containing the music that you wanted to repeat — thus the name loop — 
and load the loop into an analog tape deck to play repeatedly. This tape deck 
was then connected to the multitrack deck, and the looped performance was 
recorded onto that deck.
Now all that looping can be done digitally. You can make loops of any instru-
ment, but the most common ones involve drum rhythms. For example, each 
section of a song usually contains a short 1- or 2-bar rhythm that repeats 
many times. By using loops, you can just play the drum part once and make 
copies of it for the rest of the measures in that section. This saves you from 
having to play for the whole song. Looping can be a great feature if you play 
an instrument live and if keeping the part steady is fairly difficult.

245
 Chapter 13: Editing Your Performance
Making loops is easy: Just select the section that you want and copy it to the 
end of your existing rhythm for as many times as necessary. Keep the follow-
ing points in mind when looping, however:
 
✓ Make sure that your beginning and end points are accurate. If you 
choose beat 1 of the measure, choose beat 1 of the next measure (that 
is, if you want a 1-bar loop). If you’re off just a little bit, this affects the 
feel and timing of the rhythm.
 
✓ Choose a point in the rhythm with a sharp attack. An example is the 
downbeat with the kick drum or the snare drum backbeat on beat 2. 
This helps you find the exact beginning and ending points for your loop.
 
✓ When you record the part, set a metronome (click track) in your 
system and play along to it. This creates a clear point from which you 
can find your edit points.
 
✓ Give your looped music a more human feel. To do this, overdub fills 
and embellishments onto another track (Chapter 11 covers overdubbing 
in detail). Then either adjust the mix so that you mute the main groove 
when the fill happens or place your fill directly into the groove track 
(Chapter 14 has details on mixing). Some songs and styles of music can 
work well if you let the fills and the groove happen at the same time, so 
experiment and use the approach that you prefer.
Assembling a song
Okay, you’ve recorded all the parts for your new song and have the arrange-
ment and structure the way that you thought you wanted it. But suddenly (or 
maybe not so suddenly), you wonder what the song would sound like if you 
started with the chorus instead of the first verse. (I know this isn’t common, 
but go along with me here.) All you have to do is choose the chorus from all 
the tracks in the song and copy or move the tracks to the place where you 
want them to be.
Today, many musicians play just a portion of a song and assemble the song 
from there. For instance, except for the lead vocal, you can just record one 
verse and one chorus on each instrument. You then go into your editor 
palette and put the song together. This lets you alter the song’s structure 
quickly and easily.
This procedure is pretty simple: Just choose your musical section and then 
cut, copy, or paste it to where you want it to be. If your system doesn’t 
have the Cut and Paste functions, you can use the Copy and Move functions 
instead. (All of these functions are described earlier in the chapter.)

246
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
Making composites of your tracks
If you used your digital system to record several versions or takes of a part 
onto different tracks (also known as virtual tracks in some systems — tracks 
hidden behind a main track), you can use the editing function of your system 
to blend the best parts of each performance into one perfect track. Take, for 
example, a lead guitar part that may be used throughout the song to act as a 
counterpoint to the lead vocal. Now assume that you weren’t sure when you 
recorded the part what you wanted to do for each phrase. In this case, you 
would have recorded several versions of this guitar part onto different tracks 
in your system (or onto several virtual tracks of one track). I explain this pro-
cedure in Chapter 15.
To make a composite track of the best parts of your various lead guitar takes, 
choose the parts that you want to use and move them all onto one more 
track (assuming that you have another empty track or virtual track to put 
them on). Keep in mind that you need to move each of the good parts one at 
a time because they’re each on separate virtual tracks.
You can move your guitar parts in one of the following ways:
 
✓ Click and drag your selection to the new virtual track.
 
✓ Use the Move function in your recorder to simply move the part from 
one virtual track to another.
 
✓ Use the Cut and Paste functions to cut the part from one virtual track 
and paste it to another.
When you’re done assembling all the parts of one track, such as the lead 
guitar track, you can make adjustments to volume differences between 
the various assembled pieces using the Normalize or Quieten functions 
(described earlier in the chapter in the section “Evening out a performance”).
Discovering Other Ways to Use Editing
Aside from being able to fix problems in your tracks or to make changes to 
the structure of a song, you can use editing to make some of your other work 
easier. The following sections cover a couple of ways that the editing capa-
bilities of your digital system can be used outside the box, so to speak.

247
 Chapter 13: Editing Your Performance
Making adjustments to the 
length of a performance
Time compression and expansion allow you to make small adjustments to the 
length of a section of music. This can be useful if you’re trying to match your 
music to a video or if you want to change the feel of a vocal performance. For 
example, you can slow the last word in a phrase to give it a more crooner-
type sound, or you can match certain words to rhythmic accents in the 
music. You can also fix a poorly performed drum fill (one that speeds up or 
slows down).
To compress or expand a section, you use a function called — at least on 
some systems — Time Machine. To use it, select the music that you want 
to edit and fill in the parameters in the Time Stretch dialog box. You see the 
Time Machine dialog box from Logic in Figure 13-7.

Reversing a phrase
Being able to change the waveforms of your music can open a lot of pos-
sibilities for experimentation. I’m sure you’ve listened to a recording and 
been told that a subliminal message was hidden within the music. Of course, 
The Beatles were famous for putting reversed vocals in the back of the mix, 
and you can do this easily as well. Just record a vocal phrase like “Buy Jeff 

248
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
Strong’s CDs,” select it, and then choose Edit➪Reverse. Presto, you have a 
subliminal message (sit back and watch my CD sales go through the roof!).
Reversing a musical phrase can be used in many more ways than to peddle 
my sorry music, however. For example, you can add a reversed drumbeat or 
cymbal crash to add anticipation. This was overused in the ’80s, but I think it 
can still be effective, depending on the style of music that you play.
To do this procedure, follow these steps:
 
1. Select a drumbeat (be sure to get the initial attack) and copy it to an 
empty track.
 
2. Place the end of your selection where the drumbeat that you want to 
anticipate begins.
 
3. Choose Edit➪Reverse to reverse the phrase.
 
 If you play both tracks, you hear a reversed snare go right into a regular 
snare hit. Both attacks should happen at the same time. If they aren’t 
exact, just move the reversed one over until the attacks are the same.

A
fter you have all your tracks recorded, edited, and cleaned up as much 
as possible, it’s time to turn all those individual parts into music. This 
is the act of mixing. Mixing involves setting levels, setting EQ (equalization, or 
adjusting the frequency response of your tracks), using stereo panning (plac-
ing your instruments from left to right in your mix), and adding effects so 
that your song tells the story that you want it to tell. How you mix your song 
has as much impact on the way it sounds as each of the individual parts that 
you’ve recorded — more so, in fact. Even minor adjustments in the relation-
ship among the various instruments in your song can have dramatic impacts 
on how the song affects your listeners.
In this chapter, I introduce you to the process of mixing your music. You get a 
chance to take advantage of neat tools like the aforementioned EQ, effects, and 
stereo panning to make all your instruments fit in the mix. You discover how to 
reference your music to other people’s recordings and how to train your ears 
so that your mix “translates” to different types of playback systems.
 
Mixing music is a subjective thing. How you have one instrument relate to 
another can be done in an almost infinite variety of ways. You may find that 
several mixes work equally well for your song. Allow yourself to experiment, 
and don’t be afraid to record several different mixes.

Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
Understanding Mixing
Think about all the time it took you to record all the tracks for your song. 
You spent countless hours setting up mics; getting good, “hot” (high, but 
not distorting) levels on your instruments; and making sure that each per-
formance was as good as you could get it. You would think that most of your 
work is done. Well, on the one hand, it is — you no longer have to set up and 
play each instrument. On the other hand, you still have to make all the parts 
that you recorded fit together. This process can take as long as it took you to 
record all the tracks in the first place.
Your main tool during the mixing process is the mixer. Figure 14-1 shows 
a basic mixer setup in a software mixer program. The screen shot on the 
left shows the main mixer menu — with faders for each of your tracks. The 
screen shot on the right shows the channel strip section of the mixer. (For 
details on how the mixer functions, check out Chapter 4.)
Mixing involves making sure that each instrument can be heard in the mix — 
the recorded whole that’s the result of blending all your recorded parts — 
without covering up something else or sounding out of place. You do this in 
the following ways:
 
✓ Choose the recorded parts that add to the emotional impact of the 
music and build intensity throughout the song. Also, don’t use parts that 
are unnecessary or that clash with parts that have a greater impact.
 
✓ Set the levels (volume) of each of the instruments relative to one another 
so that nothing is buried so far back in the mix that you can’t hear it and 
no instrument is so loud that it overpowers the other instruments.
 
✓ Adjust the equalization (EQ — frequency response) of each instrument 
so that each leaves room for the other instruments in the mix. This 
means getting rid of any frequencies of an instrument that clash with 
another or adding certain frequencies that define the sound of that 
instrument so that it can be heard clearly in the mix.
 
✓ Take advantage of stereo panning to put each instrument in its proper 
place in the stereo field — left or right — where it can either sound as 
natural as possible or can produce an effect that you want. Also, stereo 
panning allows you to make room for each instrument in the mix, espe-
cially those that have similar frequency ranges.
 
✓ Add effects, such as reverb or delay, to the instruments in the mix to 
either place them in front or in back relative to other instruments or to 
create a desired sound.

The mixing process is where you can get really creative in crafting your song. 
The stress of capturing great performances is over — you now have to mas-
sage all the parts of your song into a cohesive whole. Don’t be afraid to try 
new things. Experiment with different EQ, panning, and effect settings. Take 
your time and have fun. The great thing about mixing is that you can make as 
many versions as you want, and you can always go back and try again.
Getting Started Mixing Your Song
Before I start to mix a song, I do a few things to prepare myself for the pro-
cess. My goal before I mix is to get in the headspace of mixing. This often 
means taking a step back from the song and approaching it as a listener 
rather than as the musician who recorded the tracks. Start the mixing pro-
cess by following these steps:
 
1. Determine the overall quality that you want from the song.
 
 This can be defined as a musical style or a feeling. You probably don’t 
need to think about this too hard because, when you started recording, 
you probably had a definite sound in mind. In fact, most composers hear 
a song in their heads before they even start recording.

252
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
 
2. Listen to a song or two from a CD that has a similar sound or feel as 
the song you’re trying to mix.
 
 Listen on your studio monitors if you can, and try to get a sense of the 
tonal and textural quality of these songs. Listen to them at fairly low 
volume and be careful not to tire your ears. All you’re trying to do at 
this point is to get your ears familiar with the sound that you’re trying to 
produce in your music.
 
3. Set up a rough mix using no EQ or effects and listen through it once.
 
 For this listening session, don’t think like a producer; rather, try to put 
yourself in the mind-set of the average listener. Listen to the various 
parts that you’ve recorded and see whether anything sticks out as being 
particularly good or bad. You’re not listening for production quality. 
You’re trying to determine whether some instruments, musical phrases, 
licks, melodies, or harmonies grab you as a listener.
 
4. Get a piece of paper and a pen to jot down ideas as you work.
 
 As you listen through the song, take notes on where certain instruments 
should be in the mix. For example, you may want the licks you played 
on the lead guitar throughout the song to be muted during the first 
verse. Or maybe you decide that the third rhythm-guitar part that you 
recorded would be best put way to the right side of the mix while the 
other two rhythm-guitar parts may be closer to the center. Write these 
ideas down so that you can try them later. You’re likely to have a lot of 
ideas as you listen through the first few times.
After you follow these steps, go through the song and adjust the EQ, panning, 
and effect settings until you get all the instruments to fit nicely together. I 
outline these procedures in the following sections.
Exploring Equalization
The most useful tool that you have for mixing is equalization (EQ). Equalizers 
allow you to adjust the various frequencies of your instruments so that you 
have enough room for each of them in your stereo tracks. Four types of 
equalizers are used in a recording studio — graphic, shelf, filter, and paramet-
ric. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, which I outline in the following 
sections.

253
 Chapter 14: Mixing Your Music
Graphic
The graphic EQ has a prescribed number of frequencies that you can adjust. 
Graphic EQs generally have between 5 and 31 frequency bands, each affect-
ing a small range of frequencies. (The manufacturer determines the range, 
which can’t be adjusted.) Graphic EQs are useful for eliminating an offending 
frequency from the signal or for making other adjustments to the tonal qual-
ity of the source signal. You probably won’t use a graphic EQ much in the 
mixing process because the parametric EQ can do what the graphic EQ can 
do — and a whole lot more.
High- and low-shelf
A shelf equalizer affects a range of frequencies above (high-shelf) or below 
(low-shelf) the target frequency. Shelf EQs are generally used to roll off the 
top or bottom end of the frequency spectrum. For example, you can set a 
shelf EQ to roll off the frequencies below 250 hertz (Hz) to reduce the amount 
of rumble (low-frequency noise) in a recording. You generally use the shelf 
EQ for the lowest and highest frequencies and the parametric EQ for any in-
between frequencies when you mix.
High- and low-pass filters
Sometimes your track just sounds better if you eliminate a few carefully 
chosen frequencies. You just need to know which ones to target. That’s 
where another type of EQ can help with the needed audio acrobatics: low-
pass (ducking the high frequencies that you don’t want) and high-pass (jump-
ing over the low frequencies that you don’t want).
 
 This type of EQ is called a filter because, um, it filters out frequencies either 
higher (low-pass) or lower (high-pass) than the target frequency. A low-pass 
filter eliminates unwanted high frequencies, and a high-pass filter gets rid 
of unwanted low frequencies. In Pro Tools, the low- and high-pass filters are 
designated with the icons seen here in the margin. The low-pass filter is the 
downward slope (top), and the high-pass filter is the upward slope (bottom) 
art in the margin.

254
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
Parametric
The parametric equalizer allows you to choose the frequency that you want 
to change as well as the range of frequencies around that frequency. With a 
parametric EQ, you dial in the frequency that you want to change and then 
you set the range (referred to as the Q) you want to affect.
 
The Q is a number that signifies the number of octaves that the EQ affects. 
Generally, you can adjust the Q setting to affect frequencies between 1/2 and 
2 octaves wide. Not all parametric EQs use the same reference numbers for 
their Q settings. Some have ranges from 0.7 (2 octaves) to 2.8 (1/2 octave), 
while others, such as Pro Tools, use numbers from 0.33 to 12 without indicat-
ing what the numbers relate to in terms of octaves. The one constant among 
parametric EQs is that lower numbers affect larger ranges of frequencies than 
the higher numbers do.
 
The fact that each brand of parametric EQ uses slightly different numbers to 
reference its Q settings shouldn’t matter much to you, because you choose 
your Q setting based on what you hear in the mix. Just as you can experiment 
with different frequencies to adjust in the mix, you can also try different Q set-
tings to find the best possible frequency range to use.
The beauty of a parametric EQ is that you can take a small band (range) of 
frequencies and boost (increase) or cut (decrease) them. This capability 
enables you to get the various instruments in a mix to fit in with one another. 
(This technique is called carving out frequencies.) When you’re mixing, the 
parametric EQ is the most useful equalizer because you can adjust the fre-
quency response of each instrument so that the other instruments can be 
heard clearly in the mix. One downside to parametric EQs is that some sys-
tems don’t offer you many bands (sometimes just one with the addition of 
a couple of shelf EQs), so you have to make your EQ decisions based on the 
type and number of EQs you have to choose from. Another downside is that 
parametric EQs need processing power to run. If you have a lot of EQing to 
do, you may end up stressing your system pretty hard.
Equalizing Your Tracks
Only so many frequencies are available for all the instruments in a mix, and 
if more than one instrument occupies a particular frequency range, they can 
get in each other’s way and make the mix sound muddy. Your goals when 
equalizing (EQing) during the mixing process are to reduce those frequencies 
that add clutter and/or to enhance those that define an instrument’s sound. 
To do this, make a little space for each instrument within the same general 
frequency range. You do this by EQing the individual tracks as you mix. The 
following sections explore this process in detail.

255
 Chapter 14: Mixing Your Music
Dialing in EQ
Before you start EQing your tracks, you need to know how to find the fre-
quencies you intend to adjust and how to make those adjustments. Figure 
14-2 shows an EQ plug-in for Logic Audio. Although each EQ will look a little 
different, they all end up performing the same basic function. In this section, I 
walk you through Logic’s Channel EQ.
 
Figure 14-2: 
The EQ 
section of 
a mixer’s 
channel 
strip allows 
you to 
adjust the 
frequen-
cies of your 
track.
 
Logic’s Channel EQ is an 8-band EQ with four parametric bands, one high-
shelf EQ, one low-shelf EQ, one high-pass filter, and one low-pass filter. As 
you can see in Figure 14-2, the EQ types are listed at the top of the graph, but 
the adjustments for these bands are located under the main graph.
 
Logic’s EQ has a really great feature where you can see the frequency 
response of your track. This function is engaged by clicking the Analyzer 
button on the left side of the plug-in window. This is handy because, with the 
Analyzer button engaged, you can actually see the changes you’re making to 
your track as you make them. This is also a potential problem because many 
people rely on their eyes instead of their ears. Be careful not to let what you 
see affect what you hear.
Using parametric EQ
To use the parametric EQ, click the Peak EQ button (it looks like a circle with 
a line coming from the left and right sides) in the EQ plug-in window you have 
open. You have three settings to adjust:
 
✓ Gain: This is the amount of boost (increase) or cut (decrease) that you 
apply to the signal. In Logic and Pro Tools, to get your boost (gain) 
amount, either you can point your mouse over the parameter and click 
and drag up or down, or you can click in the EQ graph above the param-
eter controls and drag up or down. In Pro Tools, you can also type in the 
amount in the text box next.

256
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
 
✓ Freq: This frequency is the center of the EQ. You select the range of fre-
quencies above and below this point by using the Q setting (see the next 
bullet). In Pro Tools, you can either type the frequency in the text box 
on the left or use the slider to make your adjustment. In Logic, to get the 
desired frequency, either you can point your mouse over the parameter 
and click and drag up or down, or you can click in the EQ graph above 
the parameter controls and drag left or right.
 
✓ Q: This is the range of frequencies that your EQ will affect. The higher 
the number, the narrower the range that gets EQed. In Pro Tools, you 
adjust this setting either by moving the knob or by clicking in the text 
box and typing a value between 0.33 and 12. In Logic, you can point your 
mouse over the parameter and click and drag up or down to get the Q 
value you want. Your settings can be anywhere from 0.10 to 100.
Using low-shelf/high-shelf EQ
To use low-shelf/high-shelf EQ, click the Low Shelf and High Shelf buttons in 
the EQ plug-in window. These buttons look like sideways tuning forks located 
second from the left and second from the right above the EQ graph in Figure 
14-2. When you use low-shelf/high-shelf EQ, you have three parameters to 
adjust in both Pro Tools and Logic:
 
✓ Gain: This is the amount of boost or cut that you apply to the signal. 
In Pro Tools, you can either type in the amount in the text box next to 
the shelf button or use the knob to the right. In Logic, to set the boost 
(gain), either you can point your mouse over the parameter and click 
and drag up or down, or you can click in the EQ graph above the param-
eter controls and drag up or down.
 
✓ Freq: This is the starting frequency for the shelf. In Pro Tools, you can 
either type in the frequency in the text box or use the knob to make your 
adjustment. In Logic, to set your desired frequency, you can either point 
your mouse over the parameter and click and drag up or down or you 
can click in the EQ graph above the parameter controls and drag left or 
right.
 
✓ Q: This is the steepness of the shelf of your EQ. The higher the number, 
the steeper the shelf that’s applied — meaning that the range of frequen-
cies that are affected to get the gain change of the shelf is narrower. 
To adjust this parameter in Logic, you can point your mouse over the 
parameter and click and drag up or down to get the Q value you want. 
Your settings can be anywhere from .10 to 2. In Pro Tools, you adjust 
this setting either by moving the knob or by clicking in the box and 
typing a value between .1 and 2.

257
 Chapter 14: Mixing Your Music
Using low-pass/high-pass EQ
Here’s where you tell your plug-in which frequencies to avoid in the course 
of adjusting the EQ. The low- and high-pass buttons are located at the far left 
and far right above the EQ graph in Figure 14-2.
To use the low- or high-pass filter, click the appropriate button in the EQ 
window. In Pro Tools, you have two options: Freq and Q. The Freq setting is 
the frequency that the filter begins filtering. Any frequency below (high-pass) 
or above (low-pass) the setting is removed from the track. You can either 
type the frequency in the text box or use the knob to make your adjustment. 
The Q is the range of frequencies that your EQ will affect. With these filters, 
you can select among 6, 12, 18, and 24 decibels (dB) per octave. The higher 
the number, the more severe the filter. In Logic, you have the same three 
settings — frequency, gain/slope, and Q — as the rest of the EQ types. And as 
with the other EQ types, you adjust the settings by pointing your mouse over 
the column of the setting and clicking and dragging the parameter that you 
want to adjust. With the high-pass and low-pass EQ (filters), the gain/slope 
parameter adjusts the slope of the filter — how quickly it totally cuts off the 
frequency.
Deciding which frequencies to boost or cut
 
Here’s a good trick to use when initially trying to decide which frequencies to 
boost or cut:
 
1. Solo the track(s) you’re working on by clicking the Solo button in the 
track’s channel strip and set your parametric EQ to a narrow Q setting 
(a high number).
 
2. Turn the boost all the way up (turn the EQ knob all the way to the 
right) and sweep the frequency setting as you listen (to sweep, just 
turn the EQ knob’s frequency dial to the left and right).
 
3. Notice those areas where the annoying or pleasing sounds are located.
 
 This can help you better understand the frequencies that your instru-
ment produces.
 
4. After you find a frequency to adjust, experiment with the Q setting 
to find the range that produces the best sound and then adjust the 
amount of boost or cut to where it has the effect that you want.
 
After you determine the frequencies that you want to work with, do your 
EQing to the individual track while the instrument is in the mix (not soloed). 
You’re trying to make that instrument fit as well as possible with the rest 
of the instruments, and to do this, you need to know how your instrument 
sounds in relation to all the stuff (music) going on around it.

258
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
 
When making adjustments in EQ, your goal is to make all the tracks blend 
as well as possible. In some instances, this means making some radical EQ 
moves. Don’t be afraid to do whatever it takes to make your mix sound good, 
even if this means having cuts or boosts as great as 12dB.
General guidelines
Although some instruments call for specific EQ guidelines, you should con-
sider some general issues when EQing, regardless of the instrument involved. 
When it comes to the audible frequency spectrum (which is generally about 
20 Hz to 20 kHz), certain frequencies always have certain characteristics. 
Table 14-1 describes these frequencies.
Table 14-1 
EQ Frequency Sound Characteristics

2–5 kHz

5–8 kHz

You’re generally better off cutting a frequency than boosting one. This think-
ing goes back to the early days of analog EQs, which often added noise when 
boosting a signal. This can still be a factor with some digital EQs, but it is 
much less of an issue. I still try to cut frequencies before I boost them just out 
of habit, and I recommend that you do the same (not out of habit, of course, 
but because if a noise difference exists between cutting and boosting, you may 
as well avoid it).
 
The exact frequencies that you end up cutting or boosting depend on the 
sound you’re after, the tonal characteristic of the instrument, and the relation-
ship between all the instruments in the song. In the following sections, I list a 
variety of frequencies to cut or boost for each instrument; Table 14-2 shows 
an overview. You may not want to follow all the suggestions. Just choose the 
ones that help you meet your goals.

Vocals
For most popular music, the vocals are the most important instrument in the 
song. You need to hear them clearly, and they should contain the character 
of the singer’s voice and style. One of the most common mistakes in mixing 
vocals is to make them too loud. The next most common mistake is to make 
them too quiet. (This is especially true if you’re the singer and are even 
slightly self-conscious of your vocals skills.) You want the lead vocals to shine 
through, but you don’t want them to overpower the other instruments. The 
best way to do this is to EQ the vocal tracks so that they can sit nicely in the 
mix and still be heard clearly. The following guidelines can help you do this.

261
 Chapter 14: Mixing Your Music
Lead
You can use several techniques with the lead vocal, depending on the singer 
and the style of music. For the most part, I tend to cut a little around 200 Hz 
and add a couple dB at 3 kHz and again at 10 kHz. In general, try following 
these guidelines:
 
✓ To add fullness, try adding a few dB at 150 Hz.
 
✓ To get rid of muddiness, cut a few dB at 200–250 Hz.
 
✓ To add clarity, boost a little at 3 kHz.
 
✓ For more presence, add at 5 kHz.
 
✓ To add air or to brighten, boost at 10 kHz.
 
✓ To get rid of sibilance, cut a little between 7.5 and 10 kHz.
Backup
To keep backup vocals from competing with lead vocals, cut the backup 
vocals a little in the low end (below 250 Hz) and at the 2.5–3.5-kHz range. To 
add clarity, you can boost a little around 10 kHz without getting in the way of 
the lead vocal.
Guitar
For the most part, when it comes to guitars, you want to avoid getting a 
muddy sound, and you want to make sure that the attack comes through in 
the mix.
Electric
Electric guitars can often use a little cutting below 100 Hz to get rid of muddi-
ness. A boost between 120 and 250 Hz adds warmth. A boost in the 2.5–4-kHz 
range brings out the attack of the guitar, and a boost at 5 kHz can add some 
bite to the guitar.
Acoustic
Acoustic guitars often do well with a little cut below 80 Hz and again around 
800 Hz to 1 kHz. If you want a warmer tone and more body, you can try boost-
ing a little at 150–250 Hz. Also try adding a few dB around 3–5 kHz if you want 
more attack or punch. A few dB added at 7 kHz can add a little more bright-
ness to the instrument.

262
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
Bass
This instrument can get muddy pretty fast. The mud generally happens in 
the 200–300-Hz range, so I either leave that alone or cut just a little if the 
bass lacks definition. I rarely add frequencies below 100 Hz but boost some 
between 100 and 200 Hz if the instrument sounds flat or thin. Adding a little 
between 500 Hz and 1 kHz can increase the punch, and a boost between 2.5 
and 5 kHz accentuates the attack, adding a little brightness to the bass.
 
With the bass guitar, one of the most important things is to make sure that it 
and the kick drum can both be heard. You need to adjust the frequencies of 
these two instruments to make room for both. For the most part, try cutting 
frequencies from the bass that you may add to the kick.
Drums
The guidelines for EQing the drums depend on whether you use live acoustic 
drums or a drum machine. (The drum machine probably requires less EQ 
because the sounds were already EQed when they were created.) Also, the 
type and placement of your mic or mics also affect how you EQ the drums. 
(You can find out more about mic placement in Chapters 8 and 9.)
Kick
You want the kick drum to blend in with the bass guitar. To do this, reduce 
the frequencies that the bass guitar takes up. For example, if I boost a few 
dB between 100 and 200 Hz for the bass guitar, I generally cut them in the 
kick drum (and maybe as high as 250 Hz). To bring out the bottom end of the 
kick, I sometimes add a couple of dB between 80 and 100 Hz. The kick drum 
can get boxy sounding (you know, like a cardboard box), so I often cut a little 
between 400 and 600 Hz as well to get rid of this boxiness. To bring out the 
click from the beater hitting the head, try adding a little between 2.5 and 5 
kHz. This increases the attack of the drum and gives it more presence.
Snare
The snare drum drives the music, making it the most important drum in 
popular music. As such, it needs to really cut through the rest of the instru-
ments. Although the adjustments that you make depend on the pitch and size 
of the drum and whether you used one mic or two during recording, you can 
usually boost a little at 100–150 Hz for added warmth. You can also try boost-
ing at 250 Hz to add some depth and cutting at 800 Hz to 1 kHz if the drum 
sounds too boxy. A little boost at around 3 to 5 kHz increases the attack, and 
an increase in the 8–10-kHz range can add a crispness to the drum.

263
 Chapter 14: Mixing Your Music
If you used two mics during recording, consider dropping a few dB on the top 
mic in both the 800-Hz to 1-kHz range and the 8- to 10-kHz range. Allow the 
bottom mic to create the crispness. I generally roll off the bottom end of the 
bottom mic below, say, 250 to 300 Hz. Depending on the music (R&B and pop, 
for instance), I may add a little sizzle to the bottom mic by boosting frequen-
cies above 10 kHz with a shelf EQ.
 
For many recording engineers/producers, the snare drum sound is almost 
a signature. If you listen to different artists’ songs from the same producer, 
you’ll likely hear similarities in the songs’ snare drum sound. Don’t be afraid 
to take your time getting the snare drum to sound just right. After all, if you 
become a famous producer, you’ll want people to recognize your snare drum 
sound too.
Tom-toms
Tom-toms come in a large range of sizes and pitches, but for mounted toms, 
you can boost a little around 200 to 250 Hz to add depth to the drum. A boost 
in the 3–5-kHz range can add more of the sticks’ attack, and for some addi-
tional presence, try adding a little in the 5–8-kHz range. If the drums sound 
too boxy, try cutting a little in the 600-Hz to 1-kHz range.
For floor toms, you can try boosting the frequency range 40 to 125 Hz to add 
some richness and fullness. You may also find that cutting 400–800 Hz can 
get rid of any boxy sound that the drum may have. To add more attack, boost 
the 2.5- to 5-kHz range.
Hi-hats
Most of the time, the hi-hats are pretty well represented in the rest of the 
mics in the drum set, but depending on which mics are picking up the hi-hats, 
you can use the hi-hat mic to bring out their sheen or brightness. To do this, 
try boosting the frequencies above 10 kHz with a shelf EQ. You may also find 
that cutting frequencies below 200 Hz eliminates any rumble created by other 
drums that the hi-hat mic picked up.
Cymbals
With the cymbals, I usually cut anything below 150–200 Hz with a shelf EQ to 
get rid of rumbling that these mics may pick up. I also drop a few dB at 1–2 
kHz if the cymbals sound kind of trashy or clanky. Adding a shelf EQ above 10 
kHz can add a nice sheen to the mix.
Overhead mics
If you used overhead mics to pick up both the drums and the cymbals, be 
careful about cutting too much low end — this can just suck the life out of 

264
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
your drums. Also, if the drums coming through the overhead mics sound 
boxy or muddy, work with the 100–200-Hz frequencies for the muddiness and 
400-Hz to 1-kHz frequencies for the boxiness.
Percussion
High-pitched percussion instruments, such as shakers, sound good when the 
higher frequencies are boosted a little bit — over 10 kHz, for instance. This 
adds some brightness and softness to their sound. You can also roll off many 
of the lower frequencies, below 500 Hz, to eliminate any boxiness that may be 
present from miking too closely (see Chapter 8 for more on mic placement).
Lower-pitched percussion instruments, such as maracas, can also have 
the lower frequencies cut a little — use 250 Hz and lower. Try boosting fre-
quencies between 2.5 and 5 kHz to add more of the instrument’s attack. To 
brighten them up, add a little bit in the 8–10-kHz range.
Piano
For pianos, you often want to make sure that the instrument has a nice attack 
as well as a warm-bodied tone. You can add attack in the 2.5–5-kHz range, and 
warmth can be added in the 80–150-Hz range. If your piano sounds boomy or 
muddy, try cutting a little between 200 and 400 Hz.
Horns
You find a variety of horns, from tubas to soprano saxophones, so to offer 
blanket recommendations for all of them would be ridiculous (although I’m 
no stranger to ridiculous). So with this thought in mind, I often start the EQ 
process for these instruments by looking at the 100–200-Hz range to add 
warmth to thin-sounding instruments. Next, I approach the 400–800-Hz range 
to get rid of any muddiness that occurs unless it’s a really low horn like a 
tuba. In this case, I often look for the muddiness a little lower — say, in the 
200–400-Hz range. To add some more attack to a horn, you can tweak the 
2.5–5-kHz range a bit, and to add some of the breath of the instrument, look 
toward the 7–9-kHz range.

265
 Chapter 14: Mixing Your Music
Using the Stereo Field
When you’re at a live concert and you close your eyes, you can hear where 
each instrument is coming from onstage. You can hear that certain instru-
ments are on the left side of the stage, others are on the right, and still others 
seem to come from the center. You can also generally discern whether 
an instrument is at the front or the back of the stage. Put all these sounds 
together, and you have a stereo field.
The stereo field consists of placement from left to right and front to back. 
When you mix a song, you can set your instruments wherever you want them 
on the “stage” that’s created by your listeners’ speakers. You can do this 
with panning, which sets your instruments from left to right, and you can 
use effects, such as reverb and delay, to place your instruments from front to 
back in your mix. When you mix your song, try to visualize where on-stage 
each instrument may be placed.
Some people choose to set the panning and depth of their instruments to 
sound as natural as possible, while others use these settings to create other-
worldly sounds. There is no right or wrong setting when panning and adding 
effects to simulate depth — just what works for your goals. Don’t be afraid to 
get creative and try unusual things.
Left or right
You adjust each instrument’s position from left to right in a mix with the pan-
ning knob. The panning knob is generally located just above each channel’s 
fader. This can either be a knob that you turn left or right or it can be a slider 
that you move to the left or right. Panning for most songs is pretty straight-
forward, and I outline some settings in the following list:
 
✓ Lead vocals: Lead vocals are usually panned directly in the center.
 
✓ Backup vocals: Because backup vocals are often recorded in stereo, 
they are panned hard left and hard right. If you recorded only one track 
of backup vocals, you can make a duplicate of the track and pan one to 
each side, just as you can with stereo tracks.
 
 In addition to tracks panned to each side, some mixing engineers also 
have a third backup vocal track that’s panned in the center to add more 
depth. Your choice of doing this depends on how you recorded your 
backup vocals and how many tracks you have available for them.

266
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
 
✓ Guitar: Lead guitar is often panned to the center (or just slightly off-center 
if the sound in the center of the stereo field is too cluttered). Rhythm 
guitar, on the other hand, is generally placed somewhere just off-center. 
It doesn’t matter which side you place it, but it’s usually the opposite side 
from other background instruments, such as an additional rhythm guitar, 
synthesizers, organs, or pianos.
 
✓ Bass: Most of the time, the bass guitar is panned in the center, but it’s 
not uncommon for mixing engineers to create a second track for the 
bass and pan one to the far left and the other to the far right. This gives 
the bass a sense of spaciousness and allows more room for both the 
bass guitar and kick drum in the mix.
 
✓ Drums: As a general rule, I (and most other people) pan the drums so 
that they appear in the stereo field much like they would onstage (but 
this doesn’t mean you have to, too). The snare drum and kick drum are 
typically panned right up the center, and the tom-toms are panned from 
right to left slightly. Hi-hat cymbals often go just to the right of center, 
the ride cymbal just left of center, and crash cymbals sit from left to 
right, much like the tom-toms.
 
✓ Percussion: Percussion instruments tend to be panned just off to the left 
or right of center. If I have a shaker or triangle part that plays through-
out the song, for instance, I pan it to the right an equal distance from 
center as the hi-hat is to the left. This way, you hear the hi-hat and per-
cussion parts playing off one another in the mix.
 
✓ Piano/synthesizers/organs: These instruments are usually placed just 
off-center. If your song has rhythm guitar parts, the piano or organ usu-
ally goes to the opposite side. Synthesizers can be panned all over the 
place. In fact, it’s not uncommon for the synths to be actively panned 
throughout the song (that is, they move from place to place).
 
Some mixing engineers like to keep their instruments toward the center of the 
mix, while other engineers prefer spreading things way out with instruments 
on either end of the spectrum. There’s no right or wrong way to pan instru-
ments. In fact, no one says that you have to leave any of your instruments in 
the same place throughout the entire song.
Front or back
As you probably discovered when you were placing your mics to record an 
instrument, the quality of sound changes when you place a mic closer to or 
farther away from the instrument. The closer you place a mic to the instru-
ment, the less room ambience you pick up, thus making the instrument 
sound close to you, or “in your face.” In contrast, the farther from the instru-
ment you place your mic, the more room sound you hear. As a result, your 
instrument sounds far away.

267
 Chapter 14: Mixing Your Music
If you’ve ever stood in a large room and talked to someone, you have seen 
(well, heard, actually) how this relationship works. When your friend stands 
close to you, you can hear him clearly. You hear very little of the reflections 
of his voice from around the room. As he moves farther away from you, the 
room’s reflections play an increasing role in the way that you hear him. By 
the time your friend is at the other side of the room, you hear not only his 
voice but also the room in which you are talking with him. In fact, if the room 
is large enough, your friend probably sounds as if he were a mile away from 
you, and all the reflections from his voice bouncing around the room may 
make it difficult to understand what he says.
You can easily simulate this effect by using your reverb or delay effects pro-
cessors. In fact, this is often the purpose of reverb and delay in the mixing 
process. With them, you can effectively place your instruments almost any-
where that you want them, from front to back, in your mix.
 
The less reverb or delay that you use in conjunction with your instrument, 
the closer it appears on the recording, whereas the more effect you add to an 
instrument, the farther away it seems from you.
The type of reverb or delay setting that you use has an impact on how close 
or far away a sound appears as well. For example, a longer reverb decay or 
delay sounds farther away than a shorter one. In Chapter 15, I go into detail 
about the various effects processors to help you understand how best to 
use them. I also present settings that you can use to create natural-sounding 
reverb and delay on your tracks, as well as some unusual settings that you 
can use for special effects.
Adjusting Levels: Enhancing 
the Emotion of the Song
After you have a rough mix and have your EQ and panning settings where 
you want them, your next step is to determine which parts of which tracks 
are used when — and sometimes, whether a part or track is used at all. If 
you’re like most musician/producers, you try to get all the wonderful instru-
mental and vocal parts you recorded as loud as possible in the mix so that 
each can be heard clearly all the time. After all, you didn’t go through all the 
time and effort to record all those great tracks just to hide them in the mix — 
or worse yet, mute them — right?
Well, I feel your pain. But when you get to the mixing point of a song, it’s time 
to take off your musician’s hat and put on the one that says producer. A pro-
ducer’s job is to weed through all the parts of a song, choose those that add 

268
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
to its impact, and dump those that are superfluous or just add clutter. Your 
goal is to assemble the tracks that tell the story that you want to tell and that 
carry the greatest emotional impact for the listener.
 
This can be the toughest part of mixing your own songs because you aren’t 
likely to be totally objective when it comes to determining what to use. Try 
not to get stressed out. You aren’t erasing any of your tracks, so you can 
always do another mix later if you just have to hear the part that you muted 
before.
One of the great joys when listening to music (for me, anyway) is hearing a 
song that carries me away and pulls me into the emotional journey that the 
songwriter had in mind. If the song is done well, I’m sucked right into the 
song, and by the end, all I want to do is rewind it and listen to it again.
What is it about certain songs that can draw you in and get you to feel the 
emotion of the performers? Well, aside from a good melody and some great 
performances, it’s the way that the arrangement builds throughout the song 
to create tension, release that tension, and build it again. A good song builds 
intensity so that the listener feels pulled into the emotions of the song.
Generally, a song starts out quietly, becomes a little louder during the first 
chorus, and then drops in level for the second verse (not as quiet as the first, 
though). The second chorus is often louder and fuller than the first chorus, 
and is often followed by a bridge section that is even fuller yet (or at least dif-
ferent in arrangement than the second chorus). The loud bridge section may 
be followed by a third verse, where the volume drops a little. Then a super-
heated chorus generally follows the last verse and keeps building intensity 
until the song ends.
You have two tools at your disposal when crafting your song to build and release 
intensity. They are dynamics and instrumental content (the arrangement).
Dynamics
Dynamics are simply how loud or soft something is. Listen to a classic blues 
tune (or even some classical music), and you can hear sections where the 
song is almost deafeningly silent and other sections where you think the 
band is going to step out of the speakers and into your room. This is an effec-
tive and powerful use of dynamics. The problem is that this seems to be a 
lost art, at least in popular music.
It used to be that a song could have very quiet parts and really loud ones. 
Unfortunately, a lot of modern CDs have only one level — loud. This often isn’t 
the fault of the musicians or even the band’s producer. The radio stations and 

269
 Chapter 14: Mixing Your Music
record-company bean counters have fueled this trend because they want to 
make sure that a band’s music is as loud as (or louder than) other CDs on the 
market. (You can read more about this trend in Chapter 16.)
 
Try recording a song with a lot of dynamic changes. I know this bucks the 
trend, but who knows, you may end up with a song that carries a ton of emo-
tional impact. Also, as you mix your song, incorporate dynamic variation by 
dropping the levels of background instruments during the verses and bringing 
them up during the chorus and bridge sections of the song. You can always 
eliminate your dynamic variation by squashing your mix with compression 
during the mastering process.
 
The biggest mistake that most people make when they mix their own music is 
to try to get their song to be as loud as commercial CDs. This is the mastering 
engineer’s job, however, not yours, so don’t worry about it. Get your song to 
sound good with a balance between high and low frequencies and loud and 
soft sections. Let the mastering engineer make your music as loud as it can be. 
He or she definitely has gear that is better designed to raise the volume of a 
recording without making it sound squashed or harsh.
The arrangement
Building intensity with the arrangement involves varying the amount of 
sound in each section. A verse with just lead vocal, drums, bass, and an 
instrument playing the basic chords of the song is going to have less inten-
sity (not to mention volume) than a chorus with a wash of guitars, backup 
vocals, drums, percussion, organ, and so on. Most songs that build intensity 
effectively start with fewer instruments than they end with.
When you mix your song, think about how you can use the instruments to 
add to the emotional content of your lyrics. For example, if you have a guitar 
lick that you played at every break in the vocal line, think about using it less 
to leave space for lower levels at certain points in your song. If you do this, 
each lick can provide more impact for the listener and bring more to the 
song’s emotion.
Automation, or Riding the Faders
When you have the levels of each instrument set so that you can hear each of 
them when the song plays, you would think that you can pretty much leave 
the levels that way during the whole song. Well, you can, but that often limits 
the amount of dynamics that you get in your mix.

270
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
Rarely do you set the levels of each instrument at the beginning of the song 
and not move the various instrument levels up and down throughout the 
song. For example, you may find that you want the rhythm guitar parts 
louder during the chorus, or maybe you have a short guitar lick in the second 
verse that you want to bring up a little in the mix.
To adjust levels during the song, you used to need several hands (or at least 
one more person to help), and you jumped from one fader to another and 
constantly made changes to the effect settings while you recorded the final 
mix. One mistake and you had to start recording over again. This is no longer 
the case for most digital recorders because most of them have an automix 
feature. Automix enables you to record the fader moves and effects changes 
that happen throughout the mix so that you don’t have to actually move the 
faders when you record to two tracks.
Depending on your system, you have one of two types of automation features 
(or both): real-time automation and scene or snapshot automation.
Real-time automation
Real-time automation is also referred to as dynamic automated mixing. This 
feature allows you to record the fader, panning, effects settings, and other 
things in real time to each track as the song plays. The advantage of this type 
of automation is that you can seamlessly get volume changes, and you can 
record these changes while the song plays. The disadvantage of real-time 
automation is that it takes you a while to do, especially if you have a lot of 
tracks to automate. Real-time automation can also take up a lot of hard-drive 
space and can tax your processor if you have a complicated mix with lots of 
tracks, effects, and mixer-setting changes.
Snapshot automation
Snapshot automation involves saving the mixer data at intervals rather than 
throughout the entire song. To do snapshot automation, just set your mixer 
(levels, EQ, effects, and so on) the way you want it for a particular section in 
your song (the verse, for instance) and take a “snapshot” of it. Whenever you 
make a mixer move, you take another snapshot, and so on. Snapshot automa-
tion can be useful if you have a song without a ton of complex mixer changes. 
The advantage of snapshot automation is that it takes up a lot less hard-drive 
space and requires less processor power. The disadvantage is that it can take 

271
 Chapter 14: Mixing Your Music
much longer to automate the song (you have to program each instance into 
the mixer), and any complex mixer moves, such as fade-ins and fade-outs, 
may not sound as smooth.
 
If you’re going to mix your music and have more than eight tracks, get a 
system that enables you to do automated mixing (I say eight tracks because, 
for the most part, you can handle mixing up to eight tracks the old-fashioned 
way). Research the automation features of the system that interests you 
before you buy it. For example, a given system may offer real-time automa-
tion, but it may tax the system’s processor and add to your song’s file size so 
quickly that using it becomes more hassle than it’s worth. Likewise, some sys-
tems (the Roland VS-1680, for example) don’t allow you to change the effects 
patch during automation. The more you know about your mixing needs, the 
better you can tell what automation approach will work for you.
Tuning Your Ears
To create a mix that sounds good, the most critical tools you need are your 
ears, because your ability to hear the music clearly and accurately is essen-
tial. To maximize this ability, you need a decent set of studio monitors and 
a good idea of how other people’s music sounds on your speakers. You also 
need to make sure that you don’t mix when your ears are tired. The following 
sections explore these areas.
Listening critically
One of the best ways to find out how to mix music is to listen to music that 
you like and listen for the way that it’s mixed. Put on a CD of something simi-
lar to your music (or music that has a sound that you like) and ask yourself 
the following questions:
 
✓ What is the overall tonal quality or texture of the song? Notice how 
the frequencies of all the instruments cover the hearing spectrum. Does 
the song sound smooth or harsh, full or thin? Try to determine what you 
like about the overall production.
 
✓ How does the song’s arrangement contribute to its overall feel? Listen 
for licks or phrases that add to the arrangement. Notice whether the 
song seems to get fuller as it goes on.

272
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
 
✓ Where are the instruments in the stereo field? Notice where each 
instrument is, from left to right and front to back, in the mix. Listen to 
see whether the instruments stay in one place throughout the song or 
whether they move around.
 
✓ What effects are being used on each instrument? Listen for reverb and 
delay lengths as well as the effect level compared to the dry (unaffected) 
signal.
 
✓ What tonal quality does each instrument have? Try to determine the 
frequencies from each instrument that seem dominant. Pay particular 
attention to the way the drums sound, especially the snare drum.
Even if you’re not mixing one of your songs, it’s a good idea to occasionally 
sit down and listen to music on your monitors to get used to listening to 
music critically. Also, the more good music you hear on your monitors, the 
easier it is for you to know when your music sounds good on them, too.
 
A good mix should sound good on a variety of systems, not just through the 
speakers in your studio. Before you decide that a mix is done, copy it to a CD 
and play it in your car, your friend’s stereo, and a boom box. In fact, try to 
listen to your music on as many different kinds of systems as you can. As you 
listen, notice whether the bass disappears or becomes too loud or whether 
the treble becomes thin or harsh. Basically, you’re trying to determine where 
you need to make adjustments in your mix so that it sounds good everywhere.
Unless you spent a lot of time and money getting your mixing room to sound 
great, you have to compensate when you mix to get your music to sound 
good on other people’s systems. If your room or speakers enhance the bass 
in your song, the song will sound thin on other people’s systems. On the 
other hand, if your system lacks bass, your mixes will be boomy when you 
listen to them somewhere else.
Choosing reference CDs
A reference CD can be any music that you like or that helps you to hear your 
music more clearly. For the most part, choose reference CDs that have a good 
balance between high and low frequencies and that sound good to your ear. 
That said, some CDs are mixed really well, which can help you get to know 
your monitors and train your ears to hear the subtleties of a mix. I name a few 
CDs in the following list. (Disclaimer: I try to cover a variety of music styles in 
this list, but I can’t cover them all without a list that’s pages long.)

273
 Chapter 14: Mixing Your Music
 
✓ Steely Dan, Two Against Nature
 
✓ Lyle Lovett, Joshua Judges Ruth
 
✓ Norah Jones, Come Away with Me
 
✓ Sting, Brand New Day
 
✓ Ben Harper, Burn to Shine
 
✓ Leonard Cohen, Ten New Songs
 
✓ Beck, Mutations
 
✓ Peter Gabriel, So
 
✓ Sarah McLachlan, Surfacing
 
✓ No Doubt, Return of Saturn
 
✓ Los Lobos, Kiko
 
✓ Marilyn Manson, Mechanical Animals
 
✓ Depeche Mode, Ultra
 
✓ Bonnie Raitt, Fundamental
 
✓ Macy Gray, On How Life Is
 
✓ Pearl Jam, Yield
 
✓ Metallica, S&M
 
✓ Dr. Dre, 2001
 
All commercial CDs have been mastered. This is going to affect the sound of 
them a little — most importantly, they will be louder than your music. If you 
toggle back and forth between your mix and a reference CD, adjust the rela-
tive levels so that each sounds equally as loud coming through your speakers 
because the louder song always sounds “better.” And remember: Don’t try to 
match the volume of your mix to a reference CD.
Dealing with ear fatigue
If you’ve ever had a chance to mix a song, you’ve probably found that you 
often do a better mix early in the process, and the longer you work on the 
song, the worse the mix gets. In most cases, this is because your ears get 
tired, and when they do, hearing accurately becomes harder. To tame ear 
fatigue, try the following tips:

274
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
 
✓ Don’t mix at the end of the day, especially after doing other recording. 
Save your mixing for first thing in the morning, when your ears have had 
a chance to rest.
 
✓ Keep the volume low. I know you’ll be tempted to crank the volume on 
your song as you work on it, but doing so only tires your ears prema-
turely and can cause damage, especially if you have monitors that can 
get really loud.
 
✓ Take an occasional break. Just 10 or 15 minutes of silence can allow 
you to work for another hour or so. Also, don’t be afraid to walk away 
from a mix for a day or more.
 
✓ Try not to mix under a deadline. This suggestion fits with the preced-
ing one. If you’re under a deadline, you can’t give yourself the time you 
may need to rest and reassess your mix before it goes to print.
Making several versions
One great thing about digital recording is that it costs you nothing to make 
several versions of a mix. All you need is a little (or a lot of) hard-drive space. 
Because you can make as many variations on your song’s mix as your hard 
drive allows, you can really experiment by trying new effects settings or 
trying active panning in your song. You may end up with something excit-
ing. At the very least, you end up discovering more about your gear. That’s 
always a good thing.
 
Print (record) a mix early on. Most of the time, your best mixes happen early 
in the mixing process. Print (or save) the first good mix that you make before 
you try making creative ones. This way, if you get burned out or run out of 
time, you have a decent mix to fall back on.

▶ Understanding dynamics processing
▶ Exploring signal processing
U
nless you record your songs using a live band in a perfect acoustic 
environment, your music will sound a little flat without the addition 
of some type of effects. Effects allow you to make your music sound like 
you recorded it in just about any environment possible. You can make your 
drums sound as if they were recorded in a cathedral or your vocals sound 
as if you were singing underwater. Effects also have the ability to make you 
sound better than you actually did. For example, you can add harmony parts 
to your lead or backup vocals, or you can make your guitar sound like you 
played it through a number of great amplifiers.
In this chapter, you discover many of the most common signal processors 
used in recording studios. (Signal processors are the neat hardware behind 
all the effects you can achieve in a recording studio.) You discern the differ-
ence between insert (line) and send/return effects, dynamics processors, and 
effects processors. You also get a chance to explore ways of using these pro-
cessors, with recommendations for using reverb, delay, chorus, pitch shift-
ing, compression, noise gates, and expanders.
 
All effects have presets. Presets are factory settings that enable you to dive 
right into using the effects processor without having to know how each 
parameter works. Presets are a good place to start when you’re not really sure 
how to get the sound that you want. Most presets are named, and the name 
may give you a hint about where you may use it. For example, a reverb with a 
preset called vocal plate lets you know that it may be worth trying on vocals. 
After you choose a preset, don’t be afraid to tweak it a little to get the sound 
you’re after. Most decent effects processors allow you to save any changes 
that you make to the preset.

Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
 
The best way to discover how to use effects on your music is to experiment. 
The more you play around with the different settings, the more familiar you’ll 
become with how each effect operates. Then you can get creative and come 
up with the best ways of using effects for your music.
The Bypass button on your effects processor is your friend. With a press of 
this button, you can quickly turn off the effect to your signal. Use it to check 
your effect settings against your original signal. Sometimes you’ll like the 
original sound better.
Connecting Effects
For an effects processor to work on your sound source, you need to connect 
the processor properly. Regardless of the type of signal processor or record-
ing system you’re using, you have the option of connecting your processor 
directly into the channel strip (called a line or insert effect) or routing it 
through your aux bus (a send/return effect).
Insert
Insert (line) effects are placed in the signal path so that all the instrument’s 
sound passes through the effect, as shown in Figure 15-1. Line effects alter 
the entire signal of the instrument and don’t allow you to mix the amount of 
effect that you have with the original dry (unaffected) signal at the mixer. 
(Some insert effects allow you to adjust the balance of dry and affected signal 
using a Mix dial.) Line effects are generally dynamics processors like com-
pression or gates, which are great for evening out signal levels and getting rid 
of noise on your tracks, but they can also be the useful new effects, such as 
amp or microphone simulators, that are available to the home recordist.
Send/return
Send/return effects, such as reverb, delay, chorus, and flange, allow you to 
mix both the affected and unaffected sound separately. The send/return 
effect is connected to the aux bus in your mixer (through the aux jack), as 
shown in Figure 15-2, and as a result, you can adjust both the dry signal and 
the affected signal separately. This enables you to do the following things 
that you can’t do with a line effect:
 
✓ Run as many instruments through the same processor as you want. For 
example, you can have your snare drum, kick drum, bass guitar, and 
backup vocals all run through the same reverb.

277
 Chapter 15: Dialing In Signal Processors
 
✓ Have as much or as little of the affected sound in your music as you 
want. This can be an advantage if you want just a little reverb on your 
vocal track, for instance.
 
✓ Pan the dry signal to one side of the mix and the affected signal to the 
other side. This can add depth to an instrument and can be used for a 
variety of cool effects.

Dynamics Processors
Dynamics processors allow you to control the dynamic range of a signal. The 
dynamic range is the difference between the softest and loudest signals that 
a sound source produces. This range is listed in decibels (dB). The larger the 
dynamic range, the more variation between the softest and loudest notes.
The three types of dynamics processors are compressor/limiters, gates, and 
expanders. The following sections give you the lowdown on each item, but 
suffice it to say that, with the help of dynamics processors, you can do a 
number of important things to your music. You can add punch or smooth out 
an instrument’s sound, you can eliminate noise from a track, or you can even 
out an erratic performance.
Figure 15-3 shows the dynamics processors section of a popular computer-
based recording program. Although each dynamics process works a little 
differently, they all use some of the same controls. In this figure, you use the 
sliders in the middle of the window to control the different parameters for 
the processor. The upper section’s level meters show you how much pro-
cessing of the dynamic range that you’re doing.

Introducing compressors/limiters
The compressor’s job is to compress the dynamic range of the sound being 
affected. The compressor not only limits how loud a note can be, but it also 
reduces the difference between the loudest and softest notes (it compresses 
the dynamic range).

279
 Chapter 15: Dialing In Signal Processors
The limiter works much like the compressor except it limits the highest level 
of a sound source. Any signal above the threshold is chopped off rather than 
compressed, as with the compressor.
Compressor/limiters are used for the following three main purposes 
(although other purposes certainly exist as well):
 
✓ To keep transients from creating digital distortion during tracking: 
This is common with drums that have a very fast attack (initial signal) 
that can easily overload the recorder (or converters or preamps).
 
✓ To even out a performance that shows a high degree of unwanted 
dynamic variation: You do this during either the mixing or tracking 
stage. An example is a singer who has poor mic control (moves con-
stantly in front of the mic), and as a result, some recorded passages 
become loud while others are very quiet.
 
✓ To raise the overall apparent level of the music during mastering: For 
example, listen to a CD recorded ten years ago and one from the last 
year or so, and you’ll notice that the newer CD sounds louder than the 
older one.
I cover purpose 1 in Chapter 7, and I explore purpose 3 in Chapter 16. So that 
leaves purpose 2 to explore with sample settings later in this chapter.
In Chapter 7, I explain the purpose of the various parameters of a compres-
sor, but to keep you from having to flip through the book to find that informa-
tion, I present those parameters here as well:
 
✓ Threshold: The threshold setting dictates the level that the compressor 
starts to act on the signal. This is listed in dB (decibels). This setting is 
often listed as dB below peak (0dB). In other words, a setting of –6dB 
means that the compressor starts to act when the signal is 6 decibels 
below its calibrated 0dB mark. (In digital systems, 0dB is the highest 
level a signal can go before clipping.)
 
✓ Ratio: The ratio is the amount that the compressor affects the signal. 
The ratio, such as 2:1 for instance, means that for every decibel that the 
signal goes over the threshold setting, the signal is reduced by a factor 
of 2. In other words, if a signal goes 1dB over the threshold setting, its 
output from the compressor is only 
1⁄2dB louder. With ratios above 10:1, 
your compressor starts to act like a limiter.
 
✓ Attack: The attack knob controls how soon the compressor kicks in. The 
attack is defined in milliseconds (ms), and the lower the number, the 
faster the attack.

280
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
 
✓ Release: The release parameter controls how long the compressor con-
tinues affecting the signal after it has dropped back below the threshold 
setting. Like the attack, the release is defined in milliseconds. The lower 
the number, the faster the release time.
 
✓ Gain: The gain knob allows you to adjust the level (volume) of the signal 
going out of the compressor. This is listed in decibels. Because adding 
compression generally reduces the overall level of the sound, you use 
this control to raise the level back to where it was going in.
 
✓ Hard knee or soft knee: Most compressors give you the option of 
choosing between a hard knee and a soft knee (or they do it for you 
based on the setting that you’ve chosen). Hard knee and soft knee refer 
to how the compressor behaves as the input signal passes the thresh-
old. They are defined as follows:
 
• Hard knee applies the compression at an even rate regardless of the 
level present over the threshold. So if you choose a compression set-
ting of 4:1, the compressor applies this ratio for any signal over the 
threshold limit. Hard knee compression is used for instruments like 
drums, where you need to clamp down on any transients quickly.
 
• Soft knee, by contrast, applies the compression at a varying rate, 
depending on the amount the signal is over the threshold setting. 
A soft knee setting gradually increases the ratio of the compres-
sion as the signal crosses the threshold until it hits the level that 
you set. Soft knee compression is used on vocals and other instru-
ments where the signal doesn’t have fast peaks.
Some two-channel compressors have a link function that allows you to connect 
the two separate channels and control them from one set of controls. Having 
the two channels linked ensures that you end up with the same settings on 
both channels. This is useful when you want to compress a stereo signal.
 
Some compressors have a sidechain option. Hardware compressors generally 
have a jack located on the back panel. Software compressors often have a 
sidechain section somewhere in the compressor’s control section. Regardless 
of where it’s located, the sidechain option allows you to insert an equalizer 
into the signal path of the compressor (you use a Y cord). The sidechain 
option is used to “de-ess” vocals (get rid of the nasty s sounds of sibilance).
Multiband compression
Multiband compressors allow you to designate the frequency range that you 
want to compress. Most multiband compressors have three or four bands. 
The four-band versions have low, low-mid, high-mid, and high band versions. 
The three-band versions have low, mid, and high band versions. You often 
get to choose where your frequency ranges are.

281
 Chapter 15: Dialing In Signal Processors
Multiband compressors are used most often during the mastering process, 
but they can be handy on individual tracks as well. The main advantage of 
these types of compressors is that you can compress a specific frequency 
range without affecting the sound of the rest of the track. This can be helpful 
if you have an instrument that’s either buried or is overpowering a mix. You 
just add a little (or a lot) of compression to the bass, for example, to bring it 
up in the mix, without affecting the higher-frequency instruments.
Getting started using compression
The compressor is one of the most useful — and one of the most abused — 
pieces of gear in the recording studio. The most difficult part of using com-
pression is that every instrument reacts differently to the same settings. So, 
instead of presenting specific settings for you to use, I offer you some guide-
lines and ideas for using the compressor effectively. (You can find sample 
settings and more ideas in the next section of this chapter.)
The following steps show you one good way to get familiar with the compressor:
 
1. Dial in a high setting (an 8:1 to a 10:1 ratio), and set the threshold all 
the way up by turning the dial fully to the right.
 
2. Slowly turn down the threshold, watch the meters, and listen carefully.
 
 As you dial the threshold down, notice where the meters are when 
you start hearing a change in the sound of the track. Also notice what 
happens to the sound when you have the threshold really low and the 
meters are peaked (the sound is very different from where you started).
 
3. Slowly dial the threshold back up again, and notice how the sound 
changes back again.
After you get used to how the sound changes as you adjust the threshold, try 
using different attack and release settings and do this procedure again. The 
more you experiment and critically listen to the changes made by the differ-
ent compressor settings, the better you’ll be able to understand how to get 
the sound that you want. The following guidelines can also help you get the 
sound you want:
 
✓ Try to avoid using compression on your 2-track mix while you mix 
your music. This is the job for the mastering phase of your project. If 
you compress your stereo tracks during mixdown, you limit what can 
be done to your music in the mastering stage. This is true even if you 
master it yourself and think you know what you want during mixdown.
 
✓ If you hear noise when you use your compressor, you’ve set it too high. 
You’re compressing the loud portions enough to make the level of the soft-
est sections of the music (including any noise) much louder in comparison. 
To get rid of the noise, turn down the ratio or the threshold settings.

282
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
 
✓ To increase the punch of a track, make sure that the attack setting 
isn’t too quick. Otherwise, you lose the initial transient and the punch 
of a track.
 
✓ To smooth out a track, use a short attack setting and a quick release 
time. This evens out the difference in level between the initial transient 
and the body of the instrument and results in a smoother sound.
 
✓ When using limiting to raise the volume of a track or mix, only limit 
2–3dB at a time. This way, the limiter doesn’t alter the sound of your 
signal; it just reduces the highest peaks and raises the volume.
 
Less is more when using compression. Resist the temptation to dial too much 
in — it just squashes your music. On the other hand, if that’s an effect that 
you’re going for, don’t be afraid to experiment.
Sampling some compression settings
Because compressors are used and abused so frequently, I thought it may be 
helpful for you to have some basic settings to get you started. This will hope-
fully save you the headache of ruining a few tracks before you get the hang of 
this powerful tool.
Lead vocals
Some recording engineers think compression is a must for vocals. It evens 
out the often erratic levels that a singer can produce and tames transients 
that can cause digital distortion. You can use compression on vocals to just 
even out the performance and to create an effect.
If you use a compressor to even out a vocal performance, you don’t want to 
hear the compressor working. Instead, you just want to catch the occasional 
extremely loud transient that would cause clipping. A good compression set-
ting has a fast attack to catch the stray transient, a quick release so that the 
compression doesn’t color the sound of the singer, and a low ratio so that 
when the compressor does go on, it smoothes out the vocals without squash-
ing them. Typical settings may look like this:
Threshold: –8dB
Ratio: 1.5:1–2:1
Attack: <1 ms
Release: About 40 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t 
need much added gain.

283
 Chapter 15: Dialing In Signal Processors
If you want to use a compressor that pumps and breathes — that is, one that 
you can really hear working — or if you want to bring the vocals way up front 
in the mix, try using the following settings. These settings put the vocals “in 
your face,” as recording engineers say:
Threshold: –2dB
Ratio: 4:1–6:1
Attack: <1 ms
Release: About 40 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You need to 
add a fair amount of gain at this setting.
As you can see, the two parameters that you adjust the most are the thresh-
old and ratio. Experiment with these settings and check the effects of them 
by toggling between the affected and unaffected sound (use the Bypass 
switch on your compressor).
Backup vocals
What about compressor settings for backup vocals, you may ask? I recom-
mend a setting that’s midway between the invisible compressions and the 
pumping and breathing compressions that I describe in the previous section. 
Such a setting brings your background vocals forward slightly. Your settings 
may look like this:
Threshold: –4dB
Ratio: 2:1–3:1
Attack: <1 ms
Release: About 40 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t 
need to add too much gain.
Electric guitar
Generally, electric guitar sounds are pretty compressed. You don’t need addi-
tional compression when you track the guitar unless you use a clean (undis-
torted) setting on your guitar. If you want to use a little compression to bring 
the guitar forward and give it some punch, try these settings:
Threshold: –1dB
Ratio: 2:1–3:1
Attack: 25–30 ms

284
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
Release: About 200 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t 
need much added gain.
The slow attack is what gives the guitar a bit of punch. If you want less 
punchiness, just shorten the attack slightly. Be careful though, because if you 
shorten it too much, you end up with a mushy sound. (Sorry . . . ahem . . . the 
guitar has no definition.)
Electric bass
Another way to get a handle on the potential muddiness of the amplified 
bass guitar is to use a little compression. Compression can also help control 
uneven levels that result from overzealous or inexperienced bass players. 
Try these settings for a start:
Threshold: –4dB
Ratio: 2.5:1–3:1
Attack: 40–50 ms
Release: About 180 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t 
need much added gain.
 
When using compression on bass, make sure that your attack setting isn’t too 
short or the sound becomes muddy.
Strummed or picked acoustic stringed instruments
You don’t generally need a lot of compression on acoustic stringed instru-
ments, especially if you want a natural sound. You can use the compressor to 
even out the resonance of the instrument to keep the main character of the 
instrument from getting lost in a mix and to avoid a muddy sound. These are 
good settings for strummed or picked acoustic instruments:
Threshold: –6dB
Ratio: 3:1–4:1
Attack: Around 150 ms
Release: About 400 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t 
need much added gain.

285
 Chapter 15: Dialing In Signal Processors
The release is set very high because of the amount of sustain that these 
acoustic instruments can have. If you play an instrument with less sustain, 
like a banjo, you may find that a shorter attack and release work just fine. In 
this case, try the following settings:
Threshold: –6dB
Ratio: 2.5:1–3:1
Attack: 40–50 ms
Release: About 180 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t 
need much, if any, added gain.
Horns
It’s rare that I use a compressor on horns. The only time I may use one is if 
an unnatural variation exists in levels due to poor playing (although I usually 
prefer to ride the faders to even the levels instead of trying to fix the prob-
lem with compression). Still, if I were to use a compressor, I would start with 
these settings:
Threshold: –8dB
Ratio: 2.5:1–3:1
Attack: Around 100 ms
Release: About 300 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t 
need much added gain.
Piano
As with other acoustic instruments, I don’t often use compression on a piano 
unless I’m going for a specific effect or I want to even out an erratic perfor-
mance. Settings for effect can run the gamut; just dial in some settings and 
see what you get. Using compression to even an erratic piano performance 
takes a little more finesse. In this case, start with these mild settings:
Threshold: –10dB
Ratio: 1.5:1–2:1
Attack: 100–105 ms
Release: About 115 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t 
need much, if any, added gain.

286
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
Classical strings
For the most part, adding compression to string instruments played with 
a bow isn’t necessary. However, you will find that using a compressor on a 
plucked acoustic bass and fiddle can bring them out in a mix.
A starting point for compressor settings for a fiddle would be as follows:
Threshold: –4dB
Ratio: 2:1–3:1
Attack: 40–50 ms
Release: About 100 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t 
need much, if any, added gain.
Try these settings for the acoustic bass:
Threshold: –6dB
Ratio: 5:1–8:1
Attack: 40–50 ms
Release: About 200 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You need a 
bit of added gain here.
Kick drum
The kick drum responds well to a compressor when tracking. For the most 
part, you can get by with settings that allow the initial attack to get through 
and that tame the boom a little. Sample settings would look like this:
Threshold: –6dB
Ratio: 4:1–6:1
Attack: 40–50 ms
Release: 200–300 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t 
need much added gain.
Snare drum
Adding compression to the snare drum is crucial if you want a tight, punchy 
sound. You have a lot of choices with the snare. The following settings are 
common and versatile:

287
 Chapter 15: Dialing In Signal Processors
Threshold: –4dB
Ratio: 4:1–6:1
Attack: 5–10 ms
Release: 125–175 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t 
need much added gain.
Hand drums
Compression is usually a good idea with hand drums because the drum can 
produce unpredictable transients. For most hand drums, start with the fol-
lowing settings:
Threshold: –6dB
Ratio: 3:1–6:1
Attack: 10–25 ms
Release: 100–300 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You don’t 
need much added gain.
Percussion
Because percussion instruments have high sound levels and are prone to 
extreme transients, I often like to use a little compression just to keep these 
transients from eating up headroom in the mix. Here are good starting points:
Threshold: –10dB
Ratio: 3:1–6:1
Attack: 10–20 ms
Release: About 50 ms
Gain: Adjust so that the output level matches the input level. You need a 
bit of added gain here.
Introducing gates
A gate is basically the opposite of the limiter. Rather than limiting how 
loud a note can get, the gate limits how soft a note can get. The gate filters 
out sound below the threshold while allowing notes above it to be passed 
through unaffected.

288
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
Gates are useful to filter out unwanted noise that may be present in the 
recording environment. A classic place to use gates is when you record 
drums. You can set the gate to filter any sound (other drums for instance) 
except for the sounds resulting from the hits to the particular drum that you 
have miked.
The following settings are similar to the ones for compressors/limiters:
 
✓ Threshold: The threshold sets the level (in dB) at which the gate opens 
(stops filtering the signal). The gate allows all signals above the thresh-
old setting to be passed through unaffected, whereas signals below the 
threshold setting are reduced by the amount set by the range control.
 
✓ Attack: As with the compressor/limiter, the attack time sets the rate at 
which the gate opens (in milliseconds). Fast attacks work well for instru-
ments with, well, fast attacks, such as drums, whereas slow attacks are 
better suited for instruments with slow attacks, like vocals.
 
 For the most part, try to match the gate’s attack time with that of the 
instrument you’re gating. If you don’t do this well, you may hear a click 
when the signal crosses the gate’s threshold. This is generally a result of 
having the attack set too slow for the instrument. Adjust the attack time 
until this click goes away.
 
✓ Hold: The hold setting controls the amount of time that the gate stays 
open after the signal drops below the threshold. After the hold time is 
reached, the gate closes abruptly. This parameter is listed in millisec-
onds (ms). The hold parameter allows you to get the gated drum sound 
that was so popular in the 1980s (Phil Collins, anyone?).
 
✓ Release: The release setting dictates the rate at which the gate closes 
after the signal hits the threshold (listed in milliseconds). Unlike the 
hold feature, the release setting doesn’t close abruptly; rather, it slowly 
closes (according to the release setting). This produces a more natural 
sound. You should set the release time so that it matches the natural 
decay time of the instrument. Otherwise, you can get a clipped-off 
sound. (If you want the clipped-off sound, use the Hold feature.)
 
✓ Range: The range is similar to the ratio setting on the compressor 
except you choose the amount (in dB) that you want the signal to be 
attenuated (reduced) by the gate. For example, a setting of 40dB drops 
signals below the threshold setting by 40 decibels.
Getting started using gates
Noise gates can be extremely useful in getting rid of unwanted noise. The 
most common use for a gate is to eliminate bleeding from drum mics. For 
example, you may get bleed from your snare drum into your tom-toms mics. 
When using noise gates, keep the following tips in mind:

289
 Chapter 15: Dialing In Signal Processors
 
✓ When the threshold is reached, the gate allows the signal through. If 
your background noise is high enough, when the gate opens, you still 
hear not only the intended sound but also the background noise. This 
can be a problem if you’re using gates to eliminate the noise of your 
hard drive fan or other room noise. Your best bet is to use acoustic 
panels to eliminate the noise rather to use than gates.
 
✓ When gating drums, be sure to set the attack very fast. Otherwise, the 
initial transient is lost, and you end up with mushy-sounding drums.
 
✓ Take your time setting the release time of the gate so that it sounds 
natural and doesn’t clip the end of your instrument’s sound.
 
✓ Only set the range high enough to mask unwanted noise. If you set it too 
high, the sound becomes unnatural because the natural resonance of 
the instrument may be filtered out.
Introducing expanders
The expander is to the gate what a compressor is to a limiter — instead of 
reducing the volume of notes below the set threshold by a specified amount, 
the expander reduces them by a ratio. In other words, with the gate, you set 
a certain amount, in dB, that a signal is reduced, and with the expander, you 
reduce the signal by setting a ratio. The ratio changes the signal gradually, 
making the affected signals sound more natural.
You use an expander when you want to subtly reduce noise from a track, 
rather than just filtering it out completely. A classic example is when dealing 
with the breath sounds from a singer. If you use a gate, you get an unnatural-
sounding track because the breaths are filtered out completely. However, 
you can set the expander to reduce the breath sounds just enough to be not 
so noticeable, but you can leave a little of the sound in so that the singer 
sounds normal. (Everyone has to breathe, right?)
Again, the following settings sound familiar from my previous discussion of 
compressors and gates:
 
✓ Threshold: The threshold in an expander works the same way as with 
the gate — anything below the threshold is affected and signals above 
the threshold pass unaffected.
 
✓ Ratio: The ratio dictates how much the signal is attenuated by the 
expander. When using a ratio of 2:1, for instance, the expander reduces 
signals below the threshold by a factor of 2. In this case, a signal that is 
10dB below the threshold is reduced to 20dB below it; likewise, a signal 
that’s 2dB below the threshold would be reduced to 4dB below it.

290
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
Getting started using an expander
Because the expander works much like a gate, you can use the same basic 
starting points. Choose the gate or expander based on the type of overall 
attenuation of the signal you want. For example, the expander is a good choice 
if you have an instrument that contains sounds that are too loud but you don’t 
want to get rid of them completely (you just want to reduce them a little).
A vocalist’s breath is the perfect situation for using an expander over a gate. 
In this case, you can set the expander’s threshold just below the singer’s soft-
est note and start with a low ratio (1.5:1 or 2:1, for instance). See whether the 
breath sounds improve, and if they don’t, slowly dial up the ratio until you 
get the effect that you want. Be careful not to overdo it though. If the breath 
sound drops too far away from the vocal, the vocal sounds unnatural.
 
If you use a high ratio in your expander (6:1 or above), the effect you get is 
similar in sound to that of the gate, only you end up having less control of the 
sound because you don’t have the hold or release parameters to adjust. So, if 
you have to use a high ratio on a signal, a gate may be a better choice for that 
situation.
Effects Processors
Effects processors can be used as either send/return or insert effects. In 
both cases, you can work with both the dry (unaffected) signal and the wet 
(affected) signal separately. If you use the effect in a send/return routing, you 
can adjust the wet and dry signals with the Aux Send and Aux Return knobs. If 
you use the effect in a line configuration, the effect has a Mix parameter on it, 
where you can adjust the wet/dry balance. Because most people record in a 
studio with a fairly dead environment, acoustically speaking, effects are neces-
sary to make the music sound more natural. The purpose of effects processors 
is to mimic real-world situations or to add a supernatural feel to the music.
You have quite a few choices in effects processors, and many more show up 
every year. The most common effects processors are reverb, delay, chorus, 
flange, and pitch shifting, all of which I detail in the following sections.
Introducing reverb
Reverb is undoubtedly the most commonly used effects processor. Reverb 
is a natural characteristic of any enclosed room and is the result of sound 
waves bouncing off the walls, floor, and ceiling. A small room produces 
reflections that start quickly and end soon, whereas larger rooms, halls, or 
cathedrals have slower start times and the reflections last longer.

291
 Chapter 15: Dialing In Signal Processors
This room effect enables you to place your track from front to back in the 
mix. You do this by varying how much of the affected signal you include with 
the unaffected one. For example, mixing a lot of reverb with the dry signal 
gives the impression of being farther away, so your instrument sounds like 
it’s in back in the mix.
You can adjust several parameters when using reverb, which gives you a lot 
of flexibility. Check out Figure 15-4. This shows what the reverb processor 
looks like in a popular computer-based system.
 
Figure 15-4: 
Reverb 
allows you 
to add ambi-
ence to your 
instrument, 
giving it a 
more realis-
tic sound.
 
The following list explains how the parameters, most of which you can see in 
Figure 15-4, affect the sound of the reverb:
 
✓ Algorithm: Whether you use a reverb patch within your recording 
system or a separate outboard reverb unit, you can choose the type 
of reverb that you want to use. You have the option of a room, hall, 
or plate (a type of reverb that uses a metal plate to create its sound). 
In addition, you can choose the size of the room (in this case, small, 
medium, and large).
 
✓ Decay: The decay is the length of time that the reverb lasts. Larger or 
more reflective rooms produce a longer decay.
 
✓ Predelay: A sound reaches your ears before the sound’s reverb does, 
and the predelay is the amount of time from the sound’s beginning to 
the start of the reverb, which is described in milliseconds (ms). Because 
reverb is made up of reflections of sound within a room, the sound takes 
time to bounce around the room and reach your ears. By then, you’ve 
already heard the sound because it came directly to you. Predelay helps 
to define the initial sound signal by separating it from the reverb. This 
parameter is essential in making your reverb sound natural.
 
 A small room has a shorter predelay than a large room. Predelay times 
generally range between 10 and 50 ms.

292
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
 
✓ Density: The density parameter (not shown in the reverb plug-in in 
Figure 15-4) controls the level of the early reflections (the first few mil-
liseconds of the reverb sound). Because the early reflections take less 
time to reach your ear than the main body of the reverb, you hear a 
thinner reverb sound to begin with, followed by the main reverb. The 
density parameter enables you to simulate different room sizes because 
the main section of a reverb takes longer to reach you in a larger room. 
The higher the density setting, the larger the apparent room size. Not all 
reverbs have this setting.
 
 Some reverb processors don’t have a density setting (as is the case for 
the processor shown in Figure 15-4). In such a case, this parameter is 
usually factory set and varies based on the type and size of room param-
eters that you choose.
 
✓ Diffusion: Diffusion affects the density of the reflections in the main 
section of the reverb sound. A higher diffusion setting results in a 
thicker sound. Think of the diffusion parameter as a way to simulate 
how reflective the room is. More reflective rooms produce a much 
higher diffusion. To simulate a less reflective room, use lower diffusion 
settings.
 
 Like the density setting, some reverbs don’t have a diffusion parameter; 
instead, it’s factory set and depends on the room type/size parameter 
that you choose.
 
✓ Hi Cut and Low Cut filters: These filters allow you to control the rate 
at which the high and low frequencies decay. Most of the time, the high 
frequencies decay faster, so being able to control this effect can result in 
a more natural-sounding reverb.
Getting started using reverb
Reverb is like garlic: The more you use, the less you can taste it. Just as the 
new chef puts garlic in everything (and lots of it), many budding sound engi-
neers make the same mistake with reverb. Go easy. Remember: Less is more.
Here are some other points to keep in mind:
 
✓ Mixes often sound better when you use reverb on only a few instru-
ments instead of them all. For example, it’s common for just the snare 
drum of the drum set to have reverb on it. The rest of the drums and 
cymbals remain dry (unaffected).
 
✓ Think about how you want each instrument to sit in the mix when you 
choose reverb. Make sure that the type and amount of reverb fit the 
song and the rest of the instruments.

293
 Chapter 15: Dialing In Signal Processors
 
✓ Try putting the dry sound on one side of the stereo field and the 
reverb on the other. For example, if you have a rhythm guitar part that 
you set at 30 degrees off to the right of the stereo field, set the reverb 30 
degrees off to the left. This can produce a nice effect.
 
✓ To keep the vocals up front in the mix, use a short reverb setting. A vocal 
plate is a great choice because the decay is fast. This adds a fair amount of 
the reverb to the vocal without making it sit way back in the mix.
 
✓ Experiment with room types, sizes, and decay times. Sometimes a long 
decay on a small-room reverb sounds better than a short decay on a 
large-room or hall reverb.
Introducing delay
Along with reverb, delay is a natural part of sound that bounces around a 
room. When you speak (or sing or play) in a room, you often hear not only 
reverb but also a distinct echo. This echo may be short or long depending on 
the size of the room. The original sound may bounce back to you as a single 
echo or as multiple, progressively quieter delays.
Several types of delay effects exist, including a slap-back echo, tape delay, 
and multiple delays, and each of them is designed to add dimension to your 
instrument. To create these various effects, you adjust several parameters, as 
the following list and Figure 15-5 make clear. Different delay processors have 
different parameters, but the three most universal and useful parameters are 
time, feedback, and mix/effect level, as follows:
 
Figure 15-5: 
A delay 
effect 
processor 
allows you 
to create 
various 
echoes.
 
 
✓ Gain: This lets you set the signal level going into the delay.
 
✓ Mix: This parameter controls the output level of the effect. The higher 
you set this parameter, the louder the delayed signal is relative to the 
original signal.

294
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
 
✓ LPF: The low-pass filter (LPF) lets you filter out some of the high
frequencies from the delay.
 
✓ Delay: This parameter controls the amount of time between the initial 
signal and the repeated sound. The time is listed in milliseconds (ms) 
and can be as short as a few milliseconds or as long as several seconds.
 
✓ Depth: This parameter lets you add modulation to the delay so that you 
can create a chorus effect. (See the “Getting started chorusing” section, 
later in this chapter, for more on chorus and flange effects). The higher 
the level on this setting, the greater the modulation.
 
✓ Rate: This setting lets you adjust the amount of time that the modulation 
takes to go one time through its cycle.
 
✓ Feedback: The Feedback parameter controls how many times the echo 
repeats. A low setting makes the echo happen just once, and higher 
settings produce more echoes.
Getting started using delay
Delay is used a lot in contemporary music, and many times you don’t hear 
it unless you listen carefully. Other times, it is prominent in the mix, like the 
snare drum in some reggae music. Here are ways that you can use delay in 
your music:
 
✓ Use delay as a slap-back echo on vocals. A slap-back echo consists of 
one to three repeats spaced very closely together, which fattens the 
sound of the vocals. You generally want to set your time parameter 
between 90 and 160 milliseconds. Set the level so that you barely hear 
the first echo when your vocal is in the mix and adjust it from there until 
you like the sound. In pop music, a slap-back echo and a vocal plate 
reverb are commonly used on lead vocals(it was really common in the 
1950s)..
 
✓ Use the tempo match feature to have your delay echo in time with the 
music. This can add some depth to the mix without creating a muddy 
or cluttered sound. Be careful, because if you use this too much, it can 
make your music sound annoyingly repetitive.
 
✓ To create special effects with delay, try using the pan or shift controls 
to move your instruments in the mix. This can be a lot of fun on back-
ground instruments, such as rhythm guitar and synthesizers.

295
 Chapter 15: Dialing In Signal Processors
Introducing pitch shifting
Pitch shifting allows you to change the pitch of a recorded instrument. This 
gives you a number of different options when you mix. For example, you can 
run your backup vocals through a pitch-shifting device to make them sound 
fuller. Or you can create backup vocals from the lead vocal track by multing 
(making a copy and putting it on another track or two) the lead vocal and 
subjecting it to a pitch shifter.
Using a pitch shifter is pretty easy: Open the program and choose how much 
you want to change the pitch either up or down. To use the pitch shifter to 
fill out a vocal, just change the pitch (up or down — it doesn’t matter) a few 
semitones until you like the sound. You can either create a subtle effect that 
sounds like two or more people trying to sing the same pitch, or you can 
create harmonies by changing the pitch one or more steps.
Chorus
Chorus takes the original sound and creates a copy that is slightly out of tune 
with the original. Unlike the pitch shifter — an effect that remains constant — 
the chorus’s shifted pitch varies over time. This variance is called modulation, 
and the result is an effect that can add interest and variety to an instrument. 
Chorus is used extensively to add fullness to a sound, particularly guitars and 
vocals.
Most chorus effects give you several parameters with which to work, as the 
following list makes clear:
 
✓ Rate: The rate dictates how fast the modulation happens. This param-
eter is described as a frequency (usually 0.1 to 10 Hz). The frequency 
actually doesn’t refer to a pitch; rather, it describes how many times per 
second (Hz) the oscillation happens. The oscillation is controlled by the 
depth parameter.
 
✓ Depth: The depth parameter controls the amount of pitch modulation 
that’s produced by the chorus. The settings are often arbitrary (you can 
get a range of 1 to 100). This range relates to a percentage of the maxi-
mum depth to which the particular chorus can go, rather than an actual 
level.
 
✓ Predelay: The predelay setting affects how far out of time the chorus’s 
sound is in relation to the original. This setting is listed in milliseconds, 
and the lower the number, the closer the chorused sound is to the 
original in time.

296
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
 
✓ Feedback: The feedback control sends the affected sound from the 
chorus back in again. This allows you to extend the amount of chorusing 
that the effect creates. This setting can also be called stages in some 
systems.
 
✓ Effect Level: This could also be called mix in some systems. The effect 
level controls how much effect is sent to the aux return bus. This allows 
you to adjust how affected the sound becomes.
Getting started chorusing
If reverb is like garlic, chorus is like cayenne pepper. You may get away with 
adding a little too much garlic in your food, but if you add too much cay-
enne, you run the risk of making your food inedible. Such is the case with the 
chorus effect. Used sparingly, chorus can add a lot to your music, but if it’s 
overdone, it can wreak havoc on a good song. Here are some tips for using 
this effect:
 
✓ To fill out a vocal track, try setting the rate at 2 Hz, the depth at about 20 
to 30, and the predelay at 10 to 20 ms. Keep the feedback level low.
 
✓ Use a chorus on backup vocals to make them fuller and allow you to use 
fewer tracks.
 
✓ Pan the chorus to one side of the mix and the dry (unaffected) signal to 
the other. This can be especially interesting on guitars and synthesizer 
patches.
 
Along with chorus, your system may have other modulating effects, such as 
flange and phase shifting. These two effects work much like chorus, except 
they alter the original signal in time (flange) and in sound-wave position 
(phase shifting) rather than pitch. The parameters you have for such effects 
are similar to those that you find for chorus effects. You can use the flange 
and phase shifters in many of the same applications as the chorus if you’re 
going for a different effect.
 Simulating Effects
Recently, effects have emerged that allow you to alter your original signal 
so that it sounds like it was recorded using a different technique or source. 
These are simulator effects, and the two most common are microphone and 
amplifier simulators (modelers). Both of these effects are intended to be line 
effects, but on some systems, you can use them as send/return effects to 
create interesting, well, effects.

297
 Chapter 15: Dialing In Signal Processors
Microphone simulator
As its name suggests, the mic simulator alters your signal to make it sound 
like it was recorded through a different microphone than the one you used 
(obviously). The great thing about the mic simulator effect is that you can 
have a bunch of microphone sounds available to you without buying a bunch 
of expensive mics.
The only real drawback to mic simulator programs is that they don’t sound 
exactly like the mics that they’re trying to model. I mean, making a $100 
dynamic mic sound like a $3,000 large-diaphragm condenser mic is pretty 
hard, no matter how much computer processing you do. But this is no big 
deal, because all you’re trying to do with a mic simulator is to expand the 
options that you have with a given mic. So even though the modeler can’t 
exactly match the bigger-buck mic, it can provide a pretty decent sound for 
your inexpensive mic.
The other possible drawback to using a mic simulator program is that the 
mic that you used to record the part in the first place may have an impact 
on how well the simulator sounds. Most mic simulator programs designate 
which mic was used to model the initial sound and which mic the simulator 
is trying to sound like. For example, in the Roland V-Studios, as you scroll 
through the various mic simulator patches (effects), you see them listed with 
one mic name followed by another (“SM57 – U87,” for instance). If you want 
to get a sound like the second mic listed, you need to use the first mic listed.
If you use a different mic than the one listed first, you get a different sound, 
but this isn’t necessarily a bad thing; it’s just different.
Amp simulator
The amp simulator effect allows you to essentially have access to a whole 
roomful of top-notch amps without having to buy, maintain, or store them. 
One of the great things about amp simulators is that they allow you to plug 
your guitar directly into your mixer (or direct box), and you can eliminate a 
lot of noise that miking your guitar amp can cause. You also get to choose the 
sound that you ultimately want after you’ve recorded your part. This gives 
you more flexibility during mixdown.
The downside to amp simulators, as with mic simulators, is that they may 
not sound exactly like the amp they’re trying to model, but this shouldn’t 
matter as long as you get the sound that you want. Another downside is that 
amp simulators use processing power, and if you have a ton of tracks with 
a bunch of effects and other plug-ins, you may find your computer getting 
bogged down a bit. The remedy for this is to print (record) the effect onto a 
separate track before you mix the song. This frees power for other uses.

▶ Putting your music on CD
Y
ou’ve spent a lot of time getting all your tracks recorded using the best 
mics that you can afford (mics you’ve carefully set up following the 
guidelines in Chapter 9, I hope!). You adjusted your levels just right, EQed, 
panned, and added effects to each instrument with great care so that they 
fit perfectly in the mix. Now you have awesome-sounding music. So all that’s 
left is to burn a CD, create cool cover artwork, and make some copies — and 
you’re ready to go platinum, right?
Well, you could do that, but you would be missing one of the most important 
steps in getting your music to sound its very best. This is the mastering pro-
cess. Mastering can turn your already-good music into a truly great CD. The 
only problem is that most people have no idea what mastering is. It’s been 
presented as some mysterious voodoo that only people who belong to some 
secret society and have access to a magical pile of gear can do.
This isn’t the case. Mastering is, in fact, a pretty simple process that involves 
pieces of equipment that you’ve already used. Mastering does require spe-
cialized skills, but you don’t need to go through strange initiation rites to 
understand them. All it takes is an idea of what to do, decent ears (you’ve got 
a couple of those, right?), and a dose of patience while you work your way 
through the process.
In this chapter, you get a chance to understand the “magic” that is mastering. 
You discover what’s involved in mastering your music. You explore ways to 
master your music yourself and discern when it may be best to find a profes-
sional to do the job for you. You also discover how to burn your mastered 
music to CD and how to make copies of your finished music.

Demystifying Mastering
The mastering process of recording involves preparing your music for dupli-
cation. Several steps are involved in taking your songs from individual, mixed 
tunes to part of a whole album. First, you need to optimize the dynamics and 
tonal balance of each song, and then you need to process the songs so that 
they are matched in volume to each other. These steps usually involve doing 
some EQing, compressing, limiting, and sometimes expanding to the songs.
You also need to sequence your music so that you have the songs in the best 
possible order and you have the appropriate amount of time between each 
song. Your last step is to put your mastered music onto a format that enables 
you to duplicate it. (This is usually a CD. I describe this process in detail in 
the “Getting into CD Burning” section, later in this chapter.)
Processing
No matter how well you recorded and mixed your music, you still need 
to do some processing during the mastering stage. This usually consists of 
adjusting levels with compression, limiting, and EQing and using additional 
processing if necessary.
The purpose of the processing stage is to balance the overall tonal characteris-
tics of each song and optimize the dynamics of each song so that the songs are 
at their best overall volume. You can achieve these goals by using the following 
tools:
 
✓ Compression: Some music sounds best when it’s smooth, and other 
music is much better when it has a punchy quality to it. Judicious use of 
compression can produce either of these effects. (I give you some sugges-
tions for compressor settings in the section “Optimizing dynamics,” later 
this chapter.) A good mastering engineer knows when and how to make 
music punchy or smooth. (Sorry, you can’t have both at the same time.)
 
 Adding compression to the mastering process is an art. Too much or the 
wrong type of compression makes your music sound flat. Too little, and 
your music may sound weak.
 
✓ Limiters: If any instruments are too loud in comparison to the rest of the 
mix, a limiter can tame them so that the difference between the song’s 
peak level and average level is optimal. This difference varies depending 
on the style of music, but it should never be less than 6dB and is usually 
between 12dB and 18dB.

301
 Chapter 16: Mastering Your Music
 
✓ EQ: Because you recorded and mixed each of your songs individually 
over a period of time (often a long period of time), each song probably 
sounds a little different. Some may be brighter than others and some 
may be heavier on bass, but one thing’s for sure — each has a different 
tonal quality.
 
 For your compilation of songs to work as a unit, the songs’ tonal quality 
needs to be somewhat consistent. The songs don’t have to all sound the 
same, but they do need to work well together. The mastering engineer 
uses multiband EQs on each song to make them work as separate songs 
and gel as a complete artistic statement.
Sequencing
Sequencing involves putting your songs in the order that you want and setting 
the blank space between each song so that the CD flows well from one song 
to another. Because a CD is supposed to represent a cohesive body of work, 
this is one of the most important aspects of mastering.
Leveling
A crucial aspect of mastering a CD is getting the levels of all the songs to be 
the same. After all, you don’t want your listener to have to adjust the volume 
of his stereo from one song to another. Having consistent levels from song to 
song helps with the cohesiveness and flow of a CD. This is done with simple 
gain adjustments, compressors, and/or limiters.
Getting Ready to Master
When mastering your music, you can save yourself a ton of time and energy if 
you keep a few things in mind during the mixing stage. When you’re wearing 
your Mixing Master hat, the following reminders can make the mastering pro-
cess go a bit more smoothly:
 
✓ Check your levels. Listen to your mix quietly, and you can tell whether 
one instrument stands out too much in the mix. Also, burn a CD of your 
mixed song to test on other systems (your car, a boom box, or your 
friend’s stereo system). Listen carefully. If the bass drum is even slightly 
too loud, it eats up the headroom of the rest of the instruments, and you 
can’t get the volume of the song very high.

302
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
 
✓ Check your EQ. Even though the mastering engineer EQs the entire 
song, make sure that you spend the time getting each instrument EQed 
as best as you can in the mix. If you don’t get your EQ just right during 
the mixing process and the bass guitar sound, for example, is muddy 
and needs to be EQed during mastering, you lose some of the low end 
on all the instruments. This makes your mix sound thin. If your bass is 
EQed properly in the first place, you don’t have to make this adjustment 
to the entire mix.
 
✓ Test your mix in mono (turn off the stereo panning on your master 
bus). This helps you hear whether any instrument’s volume or tonal 
characteristics are seriously out of balance with others. I never consider 
a mix finished until I monitor it in mono.
 
✓ Apply compression to your mix before you record the 2-track mix just 
to see what your music sounds like compressed. Don’t record the com-
pression, though. Leave that for the mastering engineer. By testing your 
mix with some compression, you may hear whether certain instruments 
are too loud in the mix because this becomes more apparent when the 
mix is compressed.
 
✓ Listen for phase holes. Phase holes occur when you record an instru-
ment (for example, piano or backup vocals) in stereo and the two tracks 
are out of phase. To listen for phase holes, pay attention to how the 
instrument sounds in the stereo field. You have a phase hole if you hear 
sound coming only from the far right and far left and nothing seems to 
be coming from the center of the stereo field. If you have this problem, 
just reverse the phase on one of the two channels for that instrument.
 
Even though a lot can be done to your music in the mastering stage, don’t rely 
on mastering to fix problems in your mix. Get your music to sound as good as 
you can during mixing. If you do this, the mastering engineer has an easier job 
and can make your music sound even better. If you don’t, you’re stuck with a 
bunch of compromises in the mastering stage.
Paying a Pro or Doing It Yourself
Whether to master your music yourself or to hire a professional may be one 
of your toughest music-making decisions. If you master your music yourself, 
you can have complete control from start to finish and save yourself some 
bucks. On the other hand, if you hand your mixed music to a skilled profes-
sional, you have the added benefit of another person’s ears and advice, and 
you can end up with a finished product that far exceeds your expectations.
So how do you choose? Well, your first consideration is probably based on 
economics — do you have the money to spend on professional help (for your 
music, that is)? Mastering can cost from a couple hundred to thousands of 
dollars. A midline mastering engineer often charges around $500 to master 

303
 Chapter 16: Mastering Your Music
your CD (about ten songs). This may seem like a lot of money, but if you 
find the right engineer for your music, it can make the difference between a 
decent CD and a truly world-class one.
Another consideration for hiring out your mastering is how well you know 
your equipment and how capable it is of performing the mastering proce-
dure. To do mastering, you need at least one good (well, preferably great) 
multiband compressor, a limiter, and a great multiband parametric EQ. You 
also need to have a CD burner of some sort and the software to create a Red 
Book CD master (more about this in the section “Recording Your Music to 
CD-R,” later in this chapter).
Before you decide, take a look at other benefits of hiring a skilled profes-
sional to do your mastering:
 
✓ You get a meticulously tuned room and top-notch monitors. This 
enables you to hear what your music actually sounds like.
 
✓ The professional has equipment that’s specifically designed to handle 
the process of mastering. The EQs, compressors, and other gear that the 
mastering house uses can tweak your music so that it can sound its best.
 
✓ You get a fresh set of professional ears that may be able to hear things 
in your mix that need fixing. You may be so close to the project that 
you have a hard time hearing your mix objectively. You may not even 
know what adjustments to make to your music so that it sounds its best.
Hiring a Professional Mastering Engineer
If you decide to use a professional mastering engineer, the following tips can 
help you choose one for your project:
 
✓ Ask around for referrals. If you know local bands or musicians whose 
music you like and whose CD sounds great, ask them who mastered 
their music. Call local studios and find out who they recommend for 
mastering in your area. Also check out Brad Blackwood’s forum at 
ProSoundWeb.com (http://recforums.prosoundweb.com/index.
php/f/31/0) and Recording.org’s mastering forum (www.recording.
org/forum-20.html).
 
✓ Listen to other recordings that the mastering house has done in a style 
of music similar to yours. You’re entrusting your artistic vision to some-
one else, and you need to be sure that this person is the right person for 
the job. If you like what the prospective mastering engineer has done on 
other people’s music, you’ll probably like what he does with yours. On 
the other hand, if he has never worked with music similar to yours or if 
you don’t like the way he mastered someone else’s music, he’s probably 
not the right person for the job.

304
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
 
✓ Clarify the fee for your project before you start working together. 
Most mastering engineers charge by the hour and can give you a pretty 
good estimate of how many hours they will need to do the job. You’ll 
also be expected to pay for materials (reference CDs, for example).
 
✓ If you don’t like the way the engineer mastered your music, you’ll 
probably be charged the hourly rate to redo it. Some engineers may 
redo your project for free, but don’t count on it. Be sure to discuss this 
possibility before you start the project so that you’re not met with an 
unwanted surprise.
 
Many mastering engineers can do a demo of one or two of your songs so that 
you can hear what kind of job they can do to your music before you hire them. 
Ask whether the mastering engineer you’re interested in offers this service. 
This can save both you and the engineer a lot of time and energy if he or she 
isn’t right for the job. It can also help you determine whether your mixed music 
is ready for mastering or whether you need to go back and make adjustments.
After you choose the mastering engineer that you think will work well for you 
and your music, you can make the process much easier and less stressful for 
both you and the engineer if you follow these guidelines:
 
✓ Discuss your expectations and desires. This is the best way to ensure 
that your mastered music turns out the way you want. People who are 
unhappy with the job that the mastering engineer does usually aren’t 
clear about what they want or don’t understand what is possible in the 
mastering process.
 
✓ Take a few CDs whose sound you like with you to the mastering ses-
sion. Talk with the engineer about how you can get your music to sound 
similar. A skilled engineer can let you know right away whether the 
sound you want is possible.
 
✓ Try to be present at the mastering session. Many people send their music 
to a mastering engineer and expect him or her to do the job without their 
presence in the studio. Try to go to the studio, but if you can’t, be sure 
that the engineer clearly understands your desires and expectations.
 
If you’re in the studio during the mastering process and things aren’t going the 
way you want, talk with the engineer and try to get things on track again. If 
you’re unable to communicate with the engineer, stop the session, have him 
burn a ref (reference copy), pay for the time that you’ve used, and listen to the 
ref at home. If you don’t like what you hear at home, you may be better off 
going somewhere else with your music.
 
If you’re at the mastering session and the mastering engineer insists on work-
ing on your music while listening at really loud levels (although occasional 
checks at high volumes are okay), grab your mix CD and run, don’t walk, from 
the session. This is a true sign of an inexperienced (or incompetent) mastering 
engineer. Mastering needs to be done at low to moderate levels because the 
tonal balance of music changes at high volumes.

Mastering Your Music Yourself
If you decide that you just have to do the mastering yourself, or at least you 
want to try it once before you decide to spend the money on a pro, following 
some guidelines can increase your chances of mastering success. I describe 
them in this section.
In other chapters, I present some specific techniques and settings to get you 
started. Unfortunately, I can’t do that when it comes to mastering. There are 
just too many variables and too many ways to mess up your music when trying 
to master it. What I can (and do) help you with in the upcoming sections is to 
walk you through the process of mastering and show you the tools to use for 
each step. When reading these sections, keep the following points in mind:
 
✓ Less is more when mastering. Do as little as possible to your music. If 
you find that you have to make a lot of adjustments, you may want to go 
back to the mixing process and try again. When you master your music, 
you only need to optimize the dynamics and tonal balance of each song, 
get the levels between the songs even, and sequence your songs.
 
✓ Mastering is all about compromise. Each adjustment you make to your 
mixed music affects all the instruments. If you use EQ to get rid of mud-
diness on the bass guitar, you affect not only the bass guitar but also 
every other instrument in the mix.
 
✓ Don’t try to master a song right after you mix it. Give yourself time and 
space from that song before you do anything. In fact, I recommend that 
you take a few days away from any of the songs for your album between 
the mixing and mastering stages. A little time to reflect and rest your 
ears can do wonders for your ability to hear what your music needs.
 
✓ You can only master music if your monitors and monitoring environ-
ment are great. Without a good reference for how your music sounds, 
trying to EQ or dynamically process your music does no good. The 
music may sound good through your speakers but probably doesn’t 
through others’. Before you master, make your room sound as good as 
you can and get to know the strengths and weaknesses of your monitor-
ing environment by listening to a ton of commercial CDs that have a 
sound that you’re trying to emulate.
Optimizing dynamics
Okay, this is where the magic in mastering happens. This is where you can make 
your music shine or where you can royally mess it up. (How’s that for adding a 
little pressure?) Before you get tense (okay, breathe), remember that you can 
always go back and try again. Oh, did I mention that you should make backup 
copies of your individual tracks and your final mix? Well, if you haven’t already 
done the backing-up business, now would be a good time to do that. I’ll wait.

306
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
Are you done? Okay, now to the job at hand — getting your music to be 
as loud as possible. (I’m just kidding; see the nearby sidebar “Turn it up!”) 
Seriously, optimizing the dynamics of your songs doesn’t mean getting it as 
loud as you can, but rather getting it to have life and emotion. And, yes, this 
also means getting it to be loud enough to sound good.
The style of your music and the arrangements that you use determine how 
you optimize the dynamics of your music. For example, classical music has 
a much broader dynamic range than rock music, and the infamous “wall of 
sound” type of arrangement has a narrower dynamic range than a song with 
sparse verses and thicker choruses.
 
When you’re optimizing the dynamics of your music, be sensitive to the song 
and try not to get sucked into the idea that you need to get the most volume 
out of your music. I know I’m beating this volume thing into the ground, but 
you would be surprised how seductive it is to try to get just a few more dB out 
of the song (no, wait; you’ll soon find out).
You have two main tools to use when you work on the dynamics during 
mastering — a compressor and a limiter — and each has its purpose. For the 
most part, if you’re trying to add punch or smoothness to your music, a com-
pressor does the job nicely. On the other hand, if you’re trying to squeeze 
a little more volume out of a song and you don’t want to change the song’s 
sound quality, a limiter is your best choice.
Here are suggestions that can help you to use compression and limiting (also 
covered in Chapter 15) most effectively during mastering:
 
✓ Use a mild compression ratio (between 1.1:1 and 2:1) to keep from 
overcompressing your music.
 
✓ Apply only 1–2dB of compression or limiting at one time. If you need 
more than that, chain more than one compressor together and use these 
small amounts on each. If you compress or limit more than 1 or 2dB at a 
time, you end up with artifacts (audible changes to your music caused by 
the compressor or limiter).
 
✓ Work with your attack and release times. An attack that’s too short 
takes the punch out of your music by cutting off the initial transients. 
Likewise, a release time that’s too long doesn’t recover quickly enough, 
and the dynamics of the vocals disappear. In contrast, if the release time 
is too short, you hear distortion.
 
✓ Set the threshold so that your compressor’s meters dance (bounce) to 
the rhythm of the music. Only the loudest notes (snare drum or lead vocal 
accents, for example) should trigger the meters and then only by 1 or 2 dB.
 
✓ Use a multiband compressor to bring out individual instruments in 
the mix. For example, if the bass drum seems to be getting lost, you can 
apply mild compression to the lower frequencies (around 80 to 100 Hz). 
This brings the instrument forward in the mix slightly.

307
 Chapter 16: Mastering Your Music
 
✓ When you’re not sure that what you’re doing sounds better, don’t use 
the processor. Any dynamics processing is going to affect the quality 
of your song’s sound to some extent. If adding this processing doesn’t 
improve the overall sound, you’re better off not using it.
 
A song without a significant difference between its softest and loudest notes 
quickly becomes tiring to listen to. Always keep the difference between the 
average level and the peak level greater than 6dB. In fact, try to have a peak-to-
average ratio of 18 to 24dB if you can. Your music will have a lot more life in it 
and sound much more interesting.
You can get a good idea of the peak-to-average ratio of your song by watching 
your meters and noticing where they max out and where they seem to stay 
most often. Some systems allow you to switch your meters between Peak and 
Average settings. (To find out whether your system has this option, check 
your owner’s manual, which should be clear about your metering options.) 
Play the song and make note of the highest peaks using the Peak metering 
setting. Then listen to your song again using the Average setting on your 
meters and make a note of this level. When you’re done, compare the two. 
More scientific ways to do this exist, but this technique gives you a good idea 
of your peak-to-average ratio.
 
When you’re testing your compression or limiter settings (you do this by com-
paring the processed and unprocessed versions), be sure to have the volume 
of both versions exactly the same. Any difference in volume defeats the pur-
pose of side-by-side comparison because people almost always prefer the 
louder version, regardless of whether it sounds better.
Perfecting tonal balance
The tonal balance of a song is how the various frequencies of the music relate 
to one another. You’re not concerned with how each instrument sounds in 
the mix (that’s the job for the mixing stage); instead, you’re looking for an 
overall balance of frequencies within the hearing spectrum.
For the most part, a tonal balance consists of an even distribution of frequen-
cies from 20 Hz to 10 kHz with a slight drop-off (1–2dB) from 10 to 20 kHz or 
higher. That’s great, you say, but what does that sound like? Well, listen to a 
number of great CDs, and you’ll hear it.
When you master your music, you want to constantly compare the sound of 
your song to that of other CDs whose sound you like. In Chapter 14, I list a 
variety of excellent reference CDs for mixing. These CDs work just as well for 
mastering, so check them out.

308
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
When you adjust the overall tonal balance of your songs, listen carefully for fre-
quencies that seem too loud or too soft. You can find these frequencies by lis-
tening to the instruments in the mix or by using a parametric EQ and sweeping 
the frequency spectrum. To do this, set your Q fairly wide (0.6, for instance) 
and turn the gain knob all the way up. Start with the lowest frequency and 
slowly raise the frequency as the song plays. Adjust annoying frequencies by 
cutting them by a couple of dB to see whether your overall mix improves.
Follow these general EQ guidelines:
 
✓ If your mix sounds muddy, add high frequencies (above 10 kHz) or cut 
low ones (200–400 Hz). Likewise, if your mix is too bright (common with 
digital recording), try reducing the frequencies above 10 kHz by using a 
shelf EQ or a Baxandall curve.
 
 To use a Baxandall curve, use a parametric EQ and set the threshold at 
20 kHz with a Q setting of about 1. This gradually cuts frequencies above 
around 10 kHz. You can adjust the Q to reach as far down as you want. 
Your EQ graph shows you what’s happening.
 
✓ Use the same EQ adjustments for both the right and left channels. 
This keeps the stereo balance intact and doesn’t alter the relative phase 
between the channels. For example, if you add some bass frequencies 
(100 Hz, for example) to the one channel and not the other, you may 
hear a wavering or pulsating sound around this frequency that goes 
back and forth between the speakers.
Turn it up!
Everyone wants his or her music to be as loud as 
possible. Louder sounds better. In fact, test after 
test has shown that when people listen to two 
versions of a song, they nearly always prefer 
the louder one (regardless of whether it actually 
sounds better). Musicians, producers, and engi-
neers seem to be in a competition to see who 
can make the loudest CD. If you compare a CD 
made about ten years ago with one made this 
year, you’ll notice that the newer one is much 
louder. Give them both a good listen though. 
Does the louder one really sound better?
You can test this by setting both CDs to play 
at the same volume and then switching back 
and forth. (You need to turn the volume up a 
bit on the older CD to match the volume of the 
newer one.) One way to do this is to record both 
songs into your DAW and set the levels of each 
so that they’re the same. At the same volume, 
which song sounds better to you? I’m willing to 
bet that nine out of ten times, you’ll prefer the 
older song. This is because older recordings 
have more dynamic range than newer ones. 
The variety is pleasing to listen to, whereas the 
song with only a small dynamic range quickly 
becomes tiring.
Do yourself and your listeners a favor, and resist 
the temptation to compress the dynamic vari-
ability out of your music. Your mix will be much 
easier to listen to and have a lot more life and 
excitement. You can always turn the volume up 
on your stereo if it’s not loud enough, but you 
can’t add dynamic range after you’ve squashed 
it out.

309
 Chapter 16: Mastering Your Music
 
✓ If you used a multiband compressor on specific frequencies, you may 
need to make some EQ adjustments to them. Compression tends to 
mess with the frequency response.
 
✓ If you need to adjust the EQ of certain instruments in the mix (the 
snare drum is buried, for example), note the overall effects of your 
adjustments on the rest of the mix. If your adjustments aren’t fixing 
the problem, go back to the mixing process and make your adjustments 
there. You’ll be glad you took the time to do this.
 
 Any adjustments you make to the EQ during mastering impact more 
than just those frequencies; the adjustments alter the entire frequency 
spectrum and the relationship among all the instruments. So listen care-
fully as you make adjustments, and back off the additional EQ if you 
don’t like what you hear.
 
Some people check the tonal balance of their songs against that of their favor-
ite CDs. You do this by recording a song into your mastering program and 
taking a look at its frequency response by using a spectral analyzer. (Some 
programs have a built-in spectral analyzer, but you can also buy one as a 
plug-in for many systems.) Then do an analysis of your song and compare it 
to the spectral analysis of a CD you like. This technique seems to work for 
many people (not me though; I like using my ears instead — but alas, I’m old-
fashioned).
Sequencing your songs
Sequencing your songs consists of choosing the order of the songs on the 
CD as well as the amount of silence between each song. When you wrote and 
recorded your songs, you probably had an idea about the order in which 
you wanted them to appear on your CD. If you don’t know how you want to 
arrange your songs, here are some things to consider:
 
✓ Consider each song’s tempo in the sequencing equation. Some CDs work 
well if songs with a similar tempo are placed together, while others work 
best when contrasting songs follow one another.
 
✓ Think about a song’s lyrics and how they relate to the lyrics from the 
other songs on your CD. If you want to tell your listener a story, con-
sider how the order of the songs can best tell that story.
 
✓ Think about the chords that you used in each song and how they relate 
to another song that you may want to place before or after it in the 
sequence. The ending chord of one song can conflict with the beginning 
chord of another.
Aside from having to decide how your songs are ordered on your CD, you 
also have to think about how much time you put between each song in order 
to create the most impact. Many people assume that you use a set amount of 

310
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
time between all the songs on each CD. This isn’t the case. You can put any 
amount of silence between each song that you feel is appropriate to set the 
mood that you want. Sometimes you may want just a second or two; other 
times, four or five seconds is more appropriate.
For example, if you have a mellow ballad followed by an upbeat song, you may 
want to leave a little more time between these two songs so that the listener is 
prepared for the faster song (try leaving a space that’s 4 to 6 beats long at the 
slower song’s tempo, for instance). Or, if you want two tunes to flow together, 
you can leave less time in between them. Use your ears and think about how 
you want your listener to respond when going from one song to another.
Balancing levels
For a truly professional-sounding CD, you want all your songs to be at nearly 
the same relative level so that your listeners (I hope you have more than 
one) don’t have to adjust the volume on their stereos from song to song.
Balancing the levels of your songs to one another is pretty easy. In fact, in 
most cases, you have very little to do after you EQ and optimize the dynamics 
of each song. You balance the levels from one song to the next by playing one 
song, then the next, and listening for significant volume differences. (Didn’t 
I say that it was easy?) You can also look at your master bus meters to see 
whether each song is at the same level, but your ears are a much better judge.
If you notice any differences, just raise (or better yet, lower) the levels until they 
are all roughly the same. Don’t get too finicky. Some variation from song to song 
is okay. In fact, minor differences can help to make your CD more interesting to 
listen to. When you’re balancing levels, just make sure that any differences aren’t 
enough to make the listener run to his or her stereo to adjust the volume knob. If 
one or two songs seem to be much lower in volume than the rest, you may want 
to go back to the volume-optimizing stage and raise those songs a bit to make 
them more consistent with the rest of the songs on the CD. This way, you don’t 
lower the volume of the entire CD based on one or two quiet songs.
Preparing for CD
After you have all your songs optimized, balanced, and sequenced, it’s time 
for the final step. This last step involves saving your music in a format that 
enables you to duplicate the music. Generally, duplication plants can take 
your mastered music in several formats, but the most popular and easiest is 
a Red Book audio CD-R. If you go to a professional mastering house, whoever 
you work with will put your mastered music on the format that they prefer 
(or you can ask for the format of your choice). If you’re mastering your music 
yourself, you’re most likely doing this with a hard-drive recording system, so 
you’ll use a CD-R to make a Red Book CD master.

311
 Chapter 16: Mastering Your Music
To make a CD master, you need to get your music files to a 16-bit, 44.1-kHz 
format. If you’re using any of the newer hard-drive recording systems, you 
probably recorded at a higher resolution and possibly higher sampling rate 
than this. (You would have set these parameters when you set up your song. 
If you can’t remember, check your owner’s manual to find out how to deter-
mine a song’s settings.) If this is the case, you need to translate your music 
from the higher rates to the CD rates. This is called dithering.
Don’t worry; dithering is easy to do — a heckuva lot easier than the record-
ing, mixing, and mastering steps you’ve done so far. In fact, you just set your 
mastering software to dither for you, and you’re set. Before you take your 
master to be duplicated, be sure to listen to the dithered and undithered ver-
sions to make sure that they sound the same (or close enough, because you 
lose some audio quality when you dither down).
Getting into CD Burning
Today, one of the coolest things about audio recording is that you can create 
music in your home and put it on the same medium that the biggest record 
companies use. When I first started as a recording engineer, the best you 
could do was put your music on a cassette for other people to listen to. 
Pressing vinyl was expensive. But now anyone with a computer, a CD burner, 
and a few inexpensive CD-Rs can put his or her music on the same format as 
all the best albums in the record store. You gotta love it!
You probably have a computer with a CD-R or CD-RW drive. If so, you also 
have software that you can use to burn your CDs. Most CD-burning software 
works fine for putting your mastered music onto CDs. If you don’t already 
have a burner and want to add one to your existing computer, check the 
system requirements for the burner that interests you to make sure that 
your system is capable of using it. For audio CDs, you can use just about any 
CD burner on the market (as long as it’s compatible with your system, of 
course).
If you have an SIAB (studio-in-a-box) system or a stand-alone system, you can 
burn CDs in one of these three ways:
 
✓ Connect your recorder to a computer and transfer your music files to 
your computer to burn your CDs.
 
✓ Get a CD burner that’s designed to work with your recorder. All SIAB 
systems have a CD recorder option. This option is generally mounted 
inside the box.
 
✓ Get a stand-alone CD-burning system. Stand-alone CD recorders 
come in a variety of types, from real-time recorders that function like 
a cassette recorder to hard-drive-based recorders, such as the Alesis 
Masterlink.

312
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
Regardless of the CD burner you get, make sure that you can create a Red 
Book CD. I know that this sounds mysterious, but all the Red Book term 
means is that the CD is an audio CD, not a CD-ROM. Red Book is a standard 
that dictates that the data is in an audio CD format. This ensures that your 
CD can play on all audio CD players. Your CD burner clearly states whether it 
can burn audio, or Red Book, CDs.
Purchasing CD-Rs
A staggering variety of CD-Rs are available. You have green, blue, gold, even 
black CDs, and you have data and music CDs. So which ones are best? Well, 
that depends.
Unless you have a consumer CD recorder from a few years ago, you can 
record your CD onto any data CD-R. You can find these just about anywhere, 
and they can cost as little as $0.10 to $0.15 apiece if you buy in bulk. If you 
have an older consumer CD recorder, you have to use music CD-Rs. These 
CD-Rs have a code in them that allows older consumer recorders to actually 
record. These CD-Rs cost a lot more, not because they capture music any 
better, but because a royalty, which is about a dollar and goes to the record-
ing industry, is figured into the price of the CD (don’t get me started).
So, if you have a recent CD-R recorder connected to your computer or SIAB 
system, or if you have a professional-grade CD burner, you can get by just 
fine using run-of-the-mill data CD-Rs.
As far as which of the countless CD-R brands to use, they’re all pretty much 
the same. I always go with the least expensive. The worst thing that can 
happen is that an error occurs and you have to record again. Keep in mind 
that some CD-Rs work better on some recorders, and the only way to find out 
is to try them. When you find a brand that works, try to stick with it.
Recording Your Music to CD-R
Burning a CD is easy. Just open your CD-burning software and follow the 
prompts. A few things, however, can be helpful to know to get the best 
sound and to create a CD that you can duplicate. I cover these topics in the 
following sections.

313
 Chapter 16: Mastering Your Music
Using different CD recorders
If you’re using a computer-based system, burning a CD is as simple as open-
ing your software and following the program’s directions for making a CD. If 
you have an SIAB system, you follow similar procedures, but your UI (user 
interface) is going to be much different. If you use a stand-alone burner, 
things are going to be even more different.
 
Some systems, such as computer-based programs, allow you to dither your 
mix separately, before you burn your CD. (Dithering is described in the sec-
tion “Preparing for CD,” earlier in this chapter.) I highly recommend this 
approach because it gives you a chance to hear the dithered music before you 
commit it to disc. If your system doesn’t support this approach (SIAB system 
users, take note), make sure that you compare your disc with the original mix 
file. (Actually, you should always check your burned CD to make sure that it 
plays properly and sounds good.) You’ll hear a slight difference in sound, but 
that’s what happens when you go from the 24-bit to the 16-bit format.
Computer-based systems
If you have a CD burner program, such as Toast, Jam, Wavelab, or CD 
Creator, burning your CD is easy. One of the advantages of burning a CD by 
using one of these programs is that you have quite a bit of flexibility in orga-
nizing your songs and placing space between them.
You generally just click the Add Track button on the main screen and select 
the track you want to add. You may also be prompted to choose any silence 
that you want to place before the track as well as ISRC codes (unique identi-
fiers for each song on your CD) and PQ subcode information. (A PQ subcode 
is additional information added to the CD data that includes start and stop 
times for each track, among other things.) When you have all your tracks 
assembled, you can burn your CD. Pretty simple, huh?
SIAB systems
Studio-in-a-box systems often contain a CD burner as one of their options. 
This can be convenient because you can do everything in the SIAB system, 
including preparing your master CD for mass production. On most SIAB sys-
tems, making a CD is pretty easy; the only problem is that you often end up 
having to do things differently than with a computer-based or stand-alone 
system.
For one thing, you can’t dither your file and check it before you record the 
CD. The dithering is done during the burning process. This isn’t a big deal 
because you’re going to double-check your finished CD before you send it out 
or sell it, anyway, right?

314
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
One thing that you often need to do, however, is assemble and sequence your 
songs before you enter the CD-burning program. This can be a lot more work 
than doing it in a computer-based system, as the following steps show. Here I list 
the procedure for assembling, sequencing, and burning a CD in a Roland SIAB 
system (other SIAB systems have similar procedures), just to give you an idea of 
the process involved (which can go pretty quickly after you get the hang of it):
 
1. Create a new “song.”
 
 This opens a new file for you to put all your mastered songs into. You 
end up with a “song” that consists of all the songs on your CD.
 
2. One by one, import your mastered tracks into the new “song” (follow 
the track import procedures for this).
 
 You get to the track import menu by pressing Shift+Track. Next, press 
Page once to bring up the Track Import function. Press F5 and follow the 
prompts to import a track.
 
 The assembly process works best if you work out the order of the songs 
beforehand and import each song in succession.
 
3. Place the amount of space you want to have between songs, well, 
between the songs. Use the Track Insert function to insert the space.
 
 You access the Track Insert function by pressing Shift+Track. Next, 
press F5 and follow the prompts to insert space in a track.
 
4. Place markers for the beginning of each track.
 
 You do this by pressing Shift+Tap (VS-1680) or Play+Tap (VS-880, 890).
 
5. Open the CD write menu and choose the “song” file that contains the 
sequenced songs and tracks on which you imported these songs.
 
6. Choose Disc at Once mode and 2x write.
 
7. Press Enter.
Stand-alone CD burners
A variety of stand-alone CD burners are available, and they all work differ-
ently. Some record the CD the same way that a cassette player records — 
you connect the input of the CD recorder to the output of the device that 
contains your music and press the Record button on the CD recorder while 
pressing the Play button on the device with the music. The CD is recorded in 
real time. Other stand-alone CD burners, such as the Alesis Masterlink (the 
CD-burning standard for many pro studios), work more like computer soft-
ware programs than cassette recorders.
With the Masterlink, you need to first copy the music files from your record-
er’s hard drive to the Masterlink’s hard drive. From there, you can edit, 
sequence, and even dynamically process each song before you burn all the 
songs to a CD-R. When you’re happy with the order of the songs and the 
spacing between them, you can then burn your CD.

315
 Chapter 16: Mastering Your Music
 
If you want to do dynamic processing to your music in the Masterlink, be sure 
to send your files to the machine undithered. You can dither in the Masterlink 
after you make your changes. This improves the sound of your final CD. If 
you’re only sequencing your songs, you can send the files dithered if you 
want.
Burning for mass production
If you intend to send your CD-R to a duplication or replication company to 
have it mass produced, keep the following suggestions in mind:
 
✓ Check for physical defects to the CD-R before you try to burn to it. 
Scratches, fingerprints, smudges, and other imperfections on the mirror 
side (bottom) of the CD-R can cause errors in the data. Be sure to use a 
clean and unblemished CD-R for burning your master.
 
✓ Always write your master CD by using the Disc at Once mode. This 
allows the CD to be read as a Red Book audio CD. Your other option 
when recording a CD is to use Track at Once. Track at Once burns one 
song (track) at a time and produces more errors than Disc at Once, 
which burns the entire CD at one time. Because of the errors present on 
CDs that are burned using Track at Once, a mass producer’s equipment 
can’t read — and therefore summarily rejects — CDs that people pro-
duce with this method. (In fact, many older CD players for homes and 
cars can’t read these CDs either.) So be sure that you use Disc at Once 
whenever you make a CD of your mastered music.
 
✓ If you can, use an error-detection software program to check for errors 
in your recorded CD. If you don’t have access to an error-detection 
program, check the back of the CD for any blemishes (just like you did 
before recording onto it).
 
✓ Listen carefully to your entire CD after it’s been recorded. Compare it 
with your original file and make sure that the CD is perfect. Also, spend 
time reevaluating the order of the songs. Make sure that they flow well 
together.
 
✓ Use a felt-tip marker to label your finished CD master, not a ballpoint 
pen or an adhesive label (paper or plastic). A ballpoint pen can damage 
the surface of the CD. Adhesive labels can slow the rotational speed of 
the CD and can cause errors in the duplication or replication process. 
They have also been known to come off inside a duplication machine, 
clogging the works (and irritating your duplication technician).
 
✓ Label the CD master with the name of your album and all your contact 
info. Use a felt-tip marker, of course, and write on the top (nonmirror 
side) of the disc. Your contact information should include your name (or 
your band’s name), your phone number, and the date the master was 
made.

316
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
 
✓ Make three CD-Rs of your mastered music. Keep one copy safe in your 
studio and send two to the duplication or replication company. This 
ensures that, if one of the two CDs that you send for mass production 
has an error, you don’t waste time sending the company a replacement.
 
✓ Prepare a PQ subcode log. PQ subcodes are additional information 
written on the CD that provides time code information, such as track 
numbers and start and stop times of each track. If your CD burner soft-
ware doesn’t support PQ subcodes, make a list of the start and stop time 
of each track (referenced from the start of the CD) on a separate piece 
of paper — as well as the track number and length of each track — and 
send it along with your CD masters. If your software program can gener-
ate a PQ subcode log, print it and send it with your CD master.
 
If you’re burning a CD for a major record label or if you want to make your 
music available as digital downloads, you need to supply ISRC codes with your 
CD. ISRC stands for International Standard Recording Code, and it contains 
information about the CD, such as the owner of the song, country of origin, 
year of release, and serial number. You enter ISRC codes into a dialog box on 
most CD-burning programs, and the information is placed on the disc. You can 
find out more about ISRC codes by going to the following Web site:
www.riaa.com/whatwedo.php?content_selector=whatwedo_is_r_c_codes
You can register yourself as a record label and be able to create your own 
ISRC codes by going to this site. This takes some time, so be sure to do this 
before you’re on a deadline to get your CD printed. If you don’t want to go 
through the steps to set yourself up as a label to generate your own codes, 
many of the larger CD replicators (check out the section “Making Multiple 
Copies,” later in this chapter) can create codes for you.
Protecting your rights
Before you put your music out into the world, get it copyrighted. Getting a 
copyright on your music is easy and relatively inexpensive, so there’s no 
reason not to do it. Just fill out an SR (sound recording) form and send it to 
the U.S. Copyright Office at the Library of Congress. You can find the SR form 
at www.loc.gov/copyright/forms, or you can call the Copyright Office at 
202-707-9100 and ask to have it mailed to you. Choose (or ask for) the Form 
SR with Instructions. The current cost for filing the form is $45, but double-
check this fee before you send in your form, because the fee has been known 
to go up (hey, it’s the government). You can fill out one form for each CD, so 
the cost per song isn’t very high.
The form is pretty easy to fill out, but if you find that you have difficulty, you 
can call an information specialist to help you out. The number is 202-707-3000. 
Be prepared to wait on hold for a little while (again, it’s the government).

317
 Chapter 16: Mastering Your Music
Send your completed form, the fee, and a copy of your CD to the address 
listed on the form. You’ll receive a certificate in the mail, but you can con-
sider your music copyrighted as soon as you mail the form (as long as you 
sent it to the correct address). If you’re especially protective of your music 
(paranoid?), you can wait until your check clears your bank. At this point, 
you can be almost certain that your form is being processed. If you can’t 
sleep at night unless your music is copyrighted, it’s best to wait until your 
certificate arrives in the mail before you start selling or distributing your CD. 
(This is a good reason to file for your copyright early.)
Making Multiple Copies
When you have a CD that you want to copy, you can either make the copies 
yourself or hire someone to make the copies for you. If you do them yourself, 
you have to burn CDs one at a time, just like the first one. This can cost little 
but takes a lot of time (as you undoubtedly found out when you burned your 
first CD).
Doing it yourself
Well, you’ve done everything else yourself, so why not add the copying pro-
cess to the list? If you have more time than money and only need a few CDs, 
making them yourself may be a good option.
To make saleable CDs yourself, you need not only the CD burner but also a 
graphics design software program and a printer to print the CD labels and 
cover material (the CD sleeve and tray card). Even with this equipment, your 
package won’t look as professional as the package that a CD duplication 
or replication company can create, but what you create is probably good 
enough for you to sell a few copies to your friends and acquaintances.
Having someone else do it
Depending on how many copies you want, you can either have them dupli-
cated or replicated. Either process can provide you with a professional-quality 
product that you can sell alongside major releases. Your choice between dupli-
cation and replication depends on how many copies you plan to have made.

318
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
Duplication
Duplication involves making copies of your master CD-R the same way you 
made the CD-R in the first place. The only difference is that duplication 
companies use CD burners that enable them to make more than one copy at 
a time. Duplication is great if you want to make a small number of copies — 
from 50 to 300. CD-duplication companies often provide one-color printing on 
the CD and either a vinyl sleeve or a jewel case to hold the CD. Some compa-
nies can prepare retail-ready packages, which look like other commercial CDs 
and include CDs with printing on them, jewel cases with color-printed inserts, 
and shrink-wrap. You can expect to pay $3 to $5 for each CD, depending on 
the quantity that you order.
An advantage to having your CDs duplicated is that they can usually be done 
quickly. Many duplication companies can provide you with a finished prod-
uct in as little as a few days (although seven days seems to be the average). 
The disadvantage is that you usually pay considerably more for each CD than 
if you do it yourself or go the replication route.
To have your CDs duplicated, you need to provide a CD-R master, that is, a 
CD-R that was recorded as an audio CD. If you want the duplication company 
to create retail-ready packages, you also need to provide artwork that’s laid 
out to the company’s specifications.
If you’re interested in going the duplication route, here are a few resources to 
get you started. You can also do an Internet search for more places by using 
the search term CD duplication.

Replication
Replication is used for making commercial CDs and involves burning a glass 
master — the master disc from which all your CD copies will be made — from 
your master CD-R. The glass master is then used to transfer the data onto 
CD media. Replication is designed for larger runs of 500 or more copies. 
Quantities less than 300 aren’t cost effective because the glass master often 
costs between $100 and $200, and the film needed to print the CD and sleeve 
and tray card can cost several hundred dollars more.

319
 Chapter 16: Mastering Your Music
CD replication usually comes with printing on the CD in one to four colors 
and a tray card and sleeve that are often printed in four colors. Most CD rep-
lication companies have retail-ready CD package deals that cover everything 
from the layout of your artwork (some do and some don’t, so be sure to ask 
first) to printed CDs, jewel boxes, and shrink-wrap. You can expect to pay 
between $1,200 and $2,000 for 500 to 1,000 copies from most manufacturers.
If you want to go the replication route, you need to provide the replication 
company with a master audio CD, artwork set to the company’s specifica-
tions, and a completed order form. Oh, and you probably need to pay half the 
money for the job up front before the work can start (bummer).
After people at the manufacturing company receive your order form, the CD, 
and artwork, they make a reference CD and proofs of your finished printed 
material. Be sure to look over the art proofs carefully and listen to every 
second of the reference CD. Any mistakes that you don’t catch are your prob-
lem, so take your time and compare the reference CD very closely with the 
master recording. (You did make a copy of your master CD before you sent it 
out, right?) The master and the reference CD should be identical.
Having your CD replicated is a stressful thing. You’re spending a ton of 
money and getting quite a few copies that you’ll need to be proud enough of 
to go out in the world and sell them. So choosing a CD-replication company 
is an important task. Quite a few companies are out there, so choose the 
place that makes you feel the most comfortable and that makes a high-quality 
product. Following is a list of the larger CD-replication companies. For more 
possibilities, input the terms CD replication or CD duplication in your favorite 
Internet search engine.

phone: 888-430-DISC; Web site: www.discmasters.com.

music. This company has six locations in the United States and one in 
Puerto Rico.
 
Many CD-replication companies can provide you with great resources, infor-
mation, and even opportunities for promoting your work. Take advantage of 
these opportunities if you can, but don’t choose a company based on its pro-
motional promises. Choose a company because of its customer service, price, 
and the quality of its product.

320
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
 
Be sure to ask for referrals — or at least a list of satisfied clients — before you 
choose a duplication or replication company. As always, your best bet when 
entrusting someone with your precious music is to ask friends for recommen-
dations. Also, take timing estimates with a grain of salt — I’ve had a couple of 
occasions where a company promised to finish my CDs by a certain date and 
the company missed its date. So leave plenty of time between when you print 
your CDs and when you need them.
UPC bar codes
If you make a CD that you intend to sell through 
major retailers, such as music stores or Internet 
retailers, you need a UPC bar code. A UPC bar 
code is a string of numbers that identify your 
product. Every CD has its own unique bar code. 
You can get a bar code in one of two ways: reg-
ister with and pay $750 to the Universal Code 
Council (UCC) or pay $0 to $50 to a CD replicator 
or distributor.
Unless you intend to release more than 35 
CDs, your best bet is to buy a bar code from a 
replicator or distributor, who can provide bar 
codes for a small (or no) fee with your CD 
order. Here are additional places where you 
can get a UPC bar code:

C
ongratulations, you have a CD to sell. The hard . . . oops, I’m sorry . . .
the easy part is behind you. I’m sure that you don’t want to be stuck 
with boxes of expensive coasters, so now you have to work on getting people 
interested in buying your music. You’ve just gone from being a musician-
composer-engineer-producer to being all those plus a record company owner-
businessperson (exactly how hyphenated can a person get, anyway?).
Your friends and some acquaintances will probably buy a few copies, but 
after you’ve sold a CD to all of them, you need to get your music to the 
broader world. This can be tricky. After all, you’re now competing with 
the big boys and, face it, you don’t have nearly the resources that they do. 
Traditional channels of distribution and marketing are pretty much out of the 
question for you. So, to succeed in selling your music, you need to try some 
alternative approaches.
In this chapter, you explore a variety of ways to get your music out to the 
masses. From basic promotional ideas to Internet distribution, this chapter 
covers a lot of ground. You discover how find Web hosting sites, how to 
encode your music for Internet distribution, and how to make a few bucks 
from music downloads.

Promoting Your Music
I’m no marketing guru, but I have managed to create a nice niche for myself 
and my music. So trust me; you can do the same. All it takes is a little imagi-
nation and a lot of hard work. In the following list, I present a few ideas that 
have worked for me and other enterprising, independent artists:
 
✓ Take yourself seriously. What I mean by this is take the job of promoting 
and selling your music seriously — treat it as a business. Getting people 
to notice and buy your music is a lot of work, but it doesn’t have to be a 
drag (if it is, you’re better off getting someone else to do it for you).
 
✓ Get organized. Get your new business off on the right foot by develop-
ing a habit of keeping track of your sales and developing a contact list. 
One of the best investments that you can make is to get a contact man-
agement database (Act! is a good one for Windows and Now Contact is 
great for Mac users) to keep track of promotion contacts (newspapers, 
radio stations, and clubs), CD sales, and fans. Also, do yourself a big 
favor and keep meticulous records of your income and expenses; you’ll 
be grateful that you did when tax time comes.
 
✓ Create a mailing list. This is one of the most cost-effective and powerful 
ways that you can start to develop a following. Make a sign-up sheet for 
your mailing list available at every public appearance. (Ask people to 
include not only their postal mail address but also their e-mail address.) 
Then enter those names into your database. You can then either send 
out snail mailings or e-mail notices whenever you play or do anything 
worth mentioning.
 
✓ Get out and be seen. This one is pretty straightforward. Get out in the 
world and let people know about your music. This can mean playing 
gigs or talking about your music. I have a good friend who releases an 
album each year. He prints a thousand copies, which he sells at his gigs, 
and every year he sells out. (Hey, that’s an extra ten grand a year after 
expenses — not bad.) He also uses his albums as his calling card to get 
more gigs.
 
✓ Look beyond the music store. It’s nearly impossible to compete with 
the major labels in the music store. Unless you live in a small town or 
know of a music shop that has a section devoted to local bands and can 
sell your CDs, you need to think of other places to put your music. For 
example, another friend of mine has his CD at quite a few of the local 
businesses in his neighborhood around the holidays. Everything, from 
the local pack-and-ship to the video store, has a countertop display with 
his CD. He creates a small poster that fits on the counter describing him 
and his music. He sells quite a few CDs and gets a handful more gigs 
each year this way.

323
 Chapter 17: Getting Your Music Out to Listeners
 
✓ Capitalize on your style. Another one of my friends composes folksy, 
New Age music, and he managed to get his CDs into a handful of New 
Age, gift-type shops. He often puts them in the stores on consignment 
and checks each store once a week to refill the countertop display and 
collect money that the store took in (minus the store’s cut, of course). 
Going into the stores every week helps him to develop a relationship 
with the store owners, many of who have arranged for him to do perfor-
mances in their stores, increasing exposure and sales.
 
✓ Try something different. Years ago, I teamed up with a local author 
and played at her book signings. (This is before I wrote books myself.) 
She read a passage from her book, and then I played for a few minutes. I 
always ended up selling a few dozen CDs at these events.
 
✓ Don’t be stingy. Give away your CD. I usually count on giving away 
about 10 to 15 percent of the CDs that I print. These can be for reviews, 
to try to get gigs, or for any purpose that may spread the word about 
your music. Giving out your CD as a promotional tool is an inexpensive 
way to let people know what you’re doing.
 
I’m sure you can come up with dozens more ways to promote and sell your 
music. Think outside the box and use your imagination. Don’t be shy. Do what-
ever you can to get your music out into the world.
Exploiting the Internet
The tried-and-true approach to playing live and getting exposure still holds 
today, but now the Internet has opened some new doors — doors that can 
lead you to national and international exposure from your computer room. 
You just have to get your music on the Internet and promote it well (easier 
said than done, I know). You can then make money from your music while 
you sleep (or at least make your music available while you sleep).
“How do I do this?” you may ask. Well, that’s the purpose of the remaining 
sections of this chapter. Here you explore the ways that you can use the 
Internet to promote and sell your music. You discover how to put up music 
files so that your potential customers can either download your music or 
listen to it online. You find out about some of the best ways to have your 
music hosted online, and you take a look at promotional ideas to get you 
started.

Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
Understanding MP3
I’m sure you’ve heard about MP3s. In fact, I’m willing to bet that you’ve 
already downloaded a few MP3s from the Internet and experienced firsthand 
the immediacy that MP3s offer. You go to a Web site and choose a song to 
download. After just a short while, you have a copy on your hard drive that 
you can listen to anytime you want. You can even put that song on a CD or 
portable player and take it with you.
With all this convenience and immediacy comes a downside. That MP3 song 
doesn’t sound as good as one that was mastered to a CD. For most people, 
this is a small price to pay for the ability to download a song for free. After 
all, most people play their music on less-then-stellar stereos (Walkmans and 
boom boxes come to mind). If you’re one of the lucky few with a stellar (or 
more-than-stellar) stereo system, you’re going to hear the difference, which 
may prompt the following question: “Why doesn’t a song in MP3 format 
sound as good as one mastered to a CD?” The answer: data compression.
 
MP3 is a process that compresses your music so that it takes up less hard-
drive space. Data compression is necessary for MP3s to work. A regular CD 
music file can take up 30–40MB (about 10MB per minute). That same song can 
take up only 3–4MB in MP3 format. This is important because, if you’re going 
to do any promoting of your music on the Internet, a 30–40MB file is way too 
big to download or to stream on the Web (even for people with broadband 
Internet connections). For example, dialup users with a 56-Kbps modem would 
have to wait more than two hours to download a 40MB file! I don’t know about 
you, but I don’t know anyone who is willing to wait that long to hear a piece of 
music.
Although compression causes your MP3 to lose fidelity as well as megabytes, 
I think this loss of quality is an advantage. Because your MP3 doesn’t sound 
as good as your mastered CD, you give listeners just a taste of your music. 
By giving people this taste, along with the opportunity to purchase a CD, you 
help them to decide whether they want to buy the high-quality version.
 
Other file compression formats being used, such as AAC (Apple Audio Codec) 
and WMA (Windows Media Audio), have improved on the sound quality of 
MP3 and are making some headway into the marketplace, so you may find 
that encoding your music into one of the other file types works better for you. 
Some of the encoding software I mention later in this chapter can encode into 
these file types as well as MP3, so you may want to try one of these on your 
music to see what you think works best, just make sure whatever file format 
you choose can be played by the people you want to hear your music.

325
 Chapter 17: Getting Your Music Out to Listeners
Engine
When you convert a song on your mastered CD to an MP3 file, the engine 
is the encoding algorithm (technical term: number cruncher) that is used 
to convert your file. Not all engines make your song sound the same. Some 
engines make your song sound much better than others, and you may get a 
better-quality sound from an engine if you adjust the bit rate and/or record-
ing mode. Some MP3 encoders allow you to choose the engine that you want 
to use, as shown in Figure 17-1, while others don’t.
 
Figure 17-1: 
MP3 encod-
ers use a 
variety of 
engines to 
convert your 
music.
 
What do you mean near-CD quality?
You may have heard the term near-CD quality 
when referring to MP3 sound. This is a market-
ing term that means, “It doesn’t sound as good 
as a CD, but we’ll make it sound like it’s pretty 
darn close and maybe the buyer won’t notice.” 
If you sense a note of cynicism in my writing, 
you’re right. Don’t delude yourself into believing 
that the song you start with is going to sound 
the same after MP3 conversion.
The difference between a song on a CD and a 
song that’s near-CD quality is like the difference 
between playing a CD in your car and then hear-
ing the same song on the radio. You lose some 
high end and the bass is thinner. You may even 
lose the stereo image, depending on the conver-
sion mode you choose, and you definitely lose 
some of the dynamic range. Overall, the song 
has a little less life to it.
This is not a huge difference for most people, 
but is noticeable nonetheless. The good news 
is that most people don’t seem to care (or are 
at least willing to accept it).

326
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
The standard and arguably best encoding engine is the Fraunhofer algorithm, 
although LAME is gaining in popularity. The encoding engine that you choose 
depends on the results that you get. You need to try a few engines to decide 
what works best for your music and your situation.
Bit rate
The bit rate determines the quality of your encoded music. When you encode 
your music, you have to choose your file’s bit rate, as shown in Figure 17-2. 
Bit rates range from 20 to 320 Kbps (kilobits per second). The higher the 
bit rate, the better the sound quality. The downside is that higher bit rates 
create larger files. When you convert your music to MP3 format, you’re con-
stantly balancing quality with file size.
 
Figure 17-2: 
MP3 
encoders 
allow you to 
choose the 
bit rate of 
your MP3.
 
The bit rate that you ultimately choose depends on how you plan to use your 
MP3 file. For example, if you want to put your music on an MP3 host site (an 
Internet site that makes people’s MP3 music available for download), you 
most likely need to choose the 128-Kbps rate because this is what many host 
sites require for Download or Hi-Fi mode. On the other hand, if you want to 
stream audio on the Web, you’re better off choosing a lower rate (between 64 
and 96 Kbps). Otherwise, your song may pause while it’s playing (for people 
with dialup modems anyway).

327
 Chapter 17: Getting Your Music Out to Listeners
Variable bit rate (VBR) is an option that many encoders offer. VBR allows 
the encoder to change the bit rate as it compresses the file. The advantage 
to this approach is that sections with fewer instruments or less data can be 
compressed further than sections with more critical information. The result is 
often a better-sounding MP3 file that takes up less space. The only drawback — 
and it’s a big one — is that not all MP3 players can read a file created with VBR. 
So, you’re probably better off not using this approach for your Web-based files.
If you’re making MP3s to listen to through your own player and it supports 
VBR playback, using VBR keeps your files smaller. If you do choose VBR, you 
are prompted to choose an average bit rate or a minimum and maximum bit 
rate. Try them both and choose the one that sounds best to you.
Mode
Modes essentially refer to whether your file is in stereo or mono, only your 
choices include more than just plain stereo and mono. You have the option 
to choose mono, stereo, joint stereo, or sometimes, force stereo (also known 
as dual mono), as shown in Figure 17-3. Again, choose the mode based on 
your music and how you prefer to balance quality with file size.
 
Figure 17-3: 
MP3 encod-
ers have 
several 
modes from 
which you 
can choose.
 
Here’s a look at the various modes and how they relate to quality and file size:
 
✓ Mono: Mono takes up little room because all the stereo data from your 
CD is contained on one track. The sound quality can be good, depend-
ing on the bit rate that you choose, but you lose all stereo-imaging data. 
Choose mono mode if the loss of the stereo image won’t adversely affect 
your song or if the overall sound quality is more important to you than 
the stereo information.

328
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
 
✓ Stereo: Stereo mode consists of two mono tracks. With stereo mode, 
you retain all your stereo information. The drawback is that your two 
tracks are at half the bit rate as the mono one that uses the same bit-rate 
setting. For example, if you encode in stereo at 128 Kbps, each of your 
tracks is only encoded at 64 Kbps. So, if you want each track to be at 128 
Kbps, you need to encode at 256 Kbps. This creates a file that’s twice as 
large as the mono file at 128 Kbps and has the same sound quality.
 
 Stereo mode is a good choice if you have a song with complex stereo 
panning effects that you just can’t live without and you don’t mind a 
sound quality that’s slightly lower.
 
✓ Joint Stereo: Joint stereo mode is a cross between mono and stereo. This 
mode consists of creating one track of audio information and one track 
of information that tells the player to send certain sounds through one 
speaker or the other (called steering data). You get most of the stereo 
information with only a slightly larger file size than with mono mode.
 
 For most songs, the difference between regular stereo and joint stereo 
is indistinguishable as far as the stereo image goes, but you end up with 
a higher-quality recording because the higher bit rate is used. You may 
find that this option works better for you than the regular stereo mode. 
Experiment and see whether you can hear a difference.
 
✓ Force Stereo: Force stereo (or dual mono) mode is essentially the same 
as the mono mode — one track of audio data is recorded and the stereo 
panning information is lost. The only difference between mono and 
force stereo is that force stereo makes sure that the mono data is sent 
through both speakers of the player. You choose force stereo mode if 
you don’t mind your music being in mono but you want to ensure that it 
plays through both speakers.
Creating MP3 Files
To create MP3 files, you need MP3 encoding software and a CD or audio 
file of your music (well, you need a computer, too). To create an MP3 file of 
your music, just choose the song to convert and let the encoder do the rest. 
Certain variables can make your MP3s sound their best — such as which 
encoder you use and what parameters you choose. I cover these variables in 
the following sections.
Choosing encoding software
You have a lot of MP3 encoding software choices. Some software encodes 
from various file formats as well as from CD, whereas others don’t encode 
directly from a CD. Not being able to encode directly from CD isn’t necessar-
ily a bad thing, however, because the process of lifting music from a CD (also 

329
 Chapter 17: Getting Your Music Out to Listeners
known as ripping) can cause audible artifacts (noise, clicks and pops, and so 
on). If you encode from a WAV or an AIFF file, you can first make sure that the 
sound going into the encoding process is as good as possible.
If you get an encoder that doesn’t encode from CD and you use a stand-alone 
or SIAB system that doesn’t support file importing (or you don’t have your 
recorder connected to a computer), you need CD ripping (copying) software 
as well.
A few popular MP3 programs that both encode and rip are as follows:
 
✓ iTunes (www.apple.com/itunes): iTunes is free and can rip from CD 
into MP3 format, among other things. It’s simple to use and, if you have 
an iPod or if you buy music from the iTunes store, you already have it 
loaded onto your computer.
 
✓ Musicmatch Jukebox (www.musicmatch.com): You can download the 
basic version for free, which allows you to play, rip, burn, and convert 
MP3s and audio CDs.
 
✓ Toast Titanium (www.roxio.com): This is the most common Mac-based 
program. This program costs about $100 and allows you to not only 
create MP3s but also to burn your mixes to CD.
A lot of MP3 encoders are available, so if you’re looking for a little more 
variety, check out these sites:
 
✓ Shareware.com (www.shareware.com): This site contains shareware 
of all sorts, from games to word processing software to MP3 encoders. 
From the main page, just type MP3 into the keyword search function and 
choose the computer platform that you use (Mac or PC). You can find a 
bunch of matches from your search.
 
✓ MP3-converter.com (www.mp3-converter.com): This site has MP3 rip-
pers and encoders for Windows-, Mac-, and Linux-based computers. You 
can find everything from simple freeware applications to full-featured 
programs for which you pay a fee.
 
✓ mp3software.com (www.mp3software.com): This site claims to have 
the most complete list of MP3-related software products available for 
download. You can find freeware and shareware versions in this site.
 
✓ MP3 for the Mac (www.mp3-mac.com/Pages/Encoders.html): 
This site contains tons of software programs (some free, some not) for 
Macintosh computer users. You may find one or more programs that 
meet your needs.
 
If you record using a computer-based system and you use one of the more 
full-featured popular programs such as Pro Tools or Logic Audio, you can 
probably create MP3 files without getting additional software. Most decent 
programs offer this capability.

Encoding your music
The actual encoding process is pretty simple. Just open your MP3 encoding 
software and choose the parameters that you want for your file. I can’t list 
step-by-step details here — every encoding program is a little bit different — 
but keep the following points in mind when you encode your music:
 
✓ To ensure that you get the best sound quality possible, encode your 
MP3s from a WAV or AIFF file instead of directly from your CD. The 
process of ripping a song from a CD can create problems in sound qual-
ity. So, by converting your CD to WAV or AIFF files first, you get a chance 
to hear your ripped song and to correct problems that ripping may have 
caused before your music goes to MP3.
 
✓ Import your WAV or AIFF file into a sound editor. Sound editor pro-
grams, such as Sound Forge 9, work fine. (You can find sound editors on 
the Web sites that I list in the preceding section.) When you have your 
file in the editor, use the Maximizer plug-in to raise the overall level of 
your song. You lose some dynamics, but they don’t come through with 
the MP3 file anyway. If you recorded your music in your computer, you 
can use the recording software instead of a separate sound editor to do 
this procedure.
 
✓ Choose the mono or joint stereo modes for a better sound. The regu-
lar stereo option has a lower resolution (bit rate) and doesn’t sound as 
good given the same file size. Choosing the force stereo option is fine if 
your encoder supports it.
 
✓ If you want to put your music on the Web, choose the 128-Kbps bit 
rate for downloading and a rate between 64 and 96 Kbps for stream-
ing audio. (I know I said this earlier in this chapter, but it’s worth 
repeating.)
 
✓ Experiment with different modes and encoding engines. Some sound 
better than others on certain types of music.
Hosting Your Music
When you have your music in MP3 format, it’s time to get it out into the 
world. This involves either putting it on your own Web site or someone 
else’s. The following sections explore the pros and cons of — as well as 
the process involved in — both of these options. Chances are you’ll end up 
choosing a combination approach if you’re serious about selling your music 
online.

331
 Chapter 17: Getting Your Music Out to Listeners
Choosing a host site
An Internet host site is a Web site that allows you to add your music to its list 
of available music downloads. Putting your MP3s on a host site can give you 
exposure that you wouldn’t otherwise be able to get. You can not only direct 
people to the site to listen to your music, but you can also benefit from traffic 
that the site itself, other musicians, and the site’s fans generate. For some of 
the larger sites, that can be a lot of potential listeners. Although MP3 host sites 
are constantly changing, a few have managed to hang around for a while.
 
Internet music host sites are always coming and going. To find out what sites 
are currently available and what they offer, check out http://compo10.
com/MusicHosts.htm for a comprehensive list.
 
Be sure to read and understand the contracts (often called agreements) that 
each of these sites requires you to agree to. Make sure that you don’t sign 
away your rights to your music. If you’re not sure that you like a particular 
agreement, don’t sign up for the service. You can find plenty of other places to 
put your music on the Internet.
AudioStreet.net
www.audiostreet.net
AudioStreet.net is a free music site, offering free music hosting and down-
loads. You can upload your songs, create a blog, and join the forum to con-
nect with other musicians and your fans. Of course, beyond the basic free 
plan (which gives you up to 3 songs, 20 pictures, a calendar for you to list 
your upcoming gigs, and some other basic services), you can enroll in com-
prehensive plans that go from $10 to $20 per month.
GarageBand.com
www.garageband.com
GarageBand offers free MP3 hosting. Also for free, GarageBand offers you a 
Web page for each song, 200MB of storage (25 to 50 songs), and a few other 
things. GarageBand makes its money from ads, contests, and its Gold mem-
bership, which includes listings in its gig calendar, one contest entry, plus 
a reduced fee for additional entries. The Gold membership has a one-time 
fee of $100. You can still enter contests without the membership for $20 if 
you just want the exposure and feedback that the contest offers. If you don’t 
want to pay any money but still want to be part of a contest, you can agree to 
review 15 pairs of songs from other musicians. GarageBand has been around 
for a while and has a pretty large membership, so the community is pretty 
dynamic. As well, having other musicians offer feedback can be helpful for 
improving your sound (although it can also throw you off course if you try to 
please everyone who has an opinion).

Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
MySpace.com
www.myspace.com
MySpace.com has become the place to be on the Internet for many people. 
Originally just a place to hang out for a few lonely souls, it’s become a cul-
tural phenomenon. (Of course, with the pace of the Internet, it could be gone 
by the time this book is published — just like the other sites I list in this 
book.) Regardless, tons of people go to MySpace.com, so putting your music 
there is probably a good idea. Besides, hosting for artists is free. You can 
post up to four songs and you get your own URL.
Setting up your own site
Even if you put your music on an MP3 site, you should consider creating your 
own Web site as well. With your own site, you can provide a lot more infor-
mation for visitors to read. You can also offer more products that may make 
you more money than your CDs — T-shirts for instance.
 
Having your own Web site is not without challenges. For example, you have 
to design and maintain the site, which can take a lot of time. You also have to 
pay for things like hosting. Granted, you can find places to host your site for 
free, but those are often thick with advertising for other stuff. If you intend to 
sell products on your site, you need to provide online ordering, which often 
involves setting up a merchant account with a credit card company. In all, 
having a Web site can be time consuming and expensive, so be prepared to do 
a fair amount of work if you really plan on making money from your Web site.
 
If maintaining a full e-commerce Web site sounds like too much effort, you 
can still make money from the Internet using your Web site to promote your 
band, especially if you get creative. In fact, with just a few simple steps, you 
can have a Web site without the expense or the hassle (at least less hassle) 
and still provide your visitors with a great Web experience. Here are a few 
suggestions:
 
✓ Create links from your site to your MP3 host site. This keeps you from 
having to put MP3s or streaming audio on your Web site, and your visi-
tors can still hear your music.
 
✓ Get your CD on Amazon.com (www.amazon.com) or CD Baby (www.
cdbaby.com) and link your visitors to those sites to buy your CD. You 
don’t get as much money in your pocket, but these other sites take care 
of all the ordering hassle for you. (You find out how to sell your music 
through CD Baby and Amazon.com in the section “Selling Your CDs,” 
later in this chapter.)

333
 Chapter 17: Getting Your Music Out to Listeners
Designing your site
Your first step in getting a Web site up and going is to design it. When you 
design your Web site, keep the following points in mind:
 
✓ Make your site easy to navigate. Make sure that your visitors know 
where they are on your site at all times. It’s often a good idea to have a 
menu bar on each page so that they can at least get back to the home 
page without having to search for it.
 
✓ Make sure that your site loads quickly. For those people who still use 
dialup modems (often at 56 Kbps), sites with a ton of big graphics or 
streaming videos take forever to download. Most people don’t have the 
patience to wait. Think lean and mean. Your visitors will appreciate it 
more than a fancy slow-to-load page.
 
✓ Make ordering your CD (or other stuff) easy. Put a Buy My CD icon on 
every page.
 
✓ Double-check all your links. Nothing is worse for a Web surfer than a 
bunch of links that don’t work. If you have links on your site, double-
check that each one works. And if you have links to other people’s sites, 
check the links occasionally to make sure that the page you’re linking to 
still exists.
 
✓ Test your site. Before you sign off on your site design, check it from a 
slow modem. You instantly get a sense of whether your site is dialup 
friendly. If it’s slow to load or confusing, keep working on it until it works. 
You may also want to check your site using different Internet browsers 
and screen resolutions to make sure that your site still looks good.
 
✓ Make your site your browser’s home page. I had a site down for weeks 
because I didn’t have it set as my default site in my browser. I never 
found out until I got a call from a friend who told me it was down.
For more tips and tricks on creating a great Web site, check out Creating Web 
Pages All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by Richard Wagner 
and Richard Mansfield (published by Wiley).
Putting up your site
After you design your site, you need to find an ISP (Internet service provider) 
to host it. Most ISPs allow you to put up a personal Web page for free, but if 
you want to do any business from it, you generally need to pay to have your 
site hosted. The exception is GeoCities (http://geocities.yahoo.com/
home), which lets you put up a site for free. GeoCities also has an inexpensive 
domain-hosting option ($8.95 per month), where you can have your name as 
your URL.

334
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
This leads me to the whole domain name thing, that is, a Web address that con-
tains your name or your band’s name. If you want your own domain name, you 
need to register it and pay a fee. It used to be that all domain names were pur-
chased through Internic (now Network Solutions), but now you can get a domain 
name in a lot of places. One of the most popular is GoDaddy.com. (I’m sure you 
can figure out its URL.) You can get a domain name for around $9 per year. You 
can also let GoDaddy host your Web site for as little as $6.29 per month.
To find a place to buy and register your domain name, search for domain 
registration in your favorite Internet search engine. You’ll end up with a ton of 
matches to get you started.
After you choose an ISP and register a domain name — if you choose to go 
that route — it’s just a matter of putting up your site and making sure that it 
works. Your ISP may either give you detailed instructions on how to do this 
or do it for you.
Getting noticed
You used to be able to submit your Web site’s address to the major search 
engines and get exposure when people do a search. Over the last few years, 
though, things have changed a lot. Nowadays, you can’t submit your informa-
tion and have your site show up in people’s searches. Still, you can do some 
things to get more visibility with search engine optimization (SEO). Countless 
professionals are available who will help you do this.
Here are some basic steps you can take to improve your site’s ranking (how 
close to the top your Web site shows up) in people’s searches:
 
✓ Put keywords in your page titles. These might be descriptions of your 
music, genre, song titles, or topics. Add anything that can help someone 
understand who you are. (Keywords are words that people use when 
they do a search.) For example, someone may be looking for music in 
the genre of electronica, and he or she may want something with a drum 
and bass approach. He may type electronica drum and bass into a 
search engine. If you have electronica as a keyword in your page title, the 
search engine can see it and put you in the search results (how high in 
the ranking depends on whether you also had drum and bass in your title 
and on how many other people have these keywords in their title).
 
✓ Put keywords in your copy. Try to be descriptive in the text you use 
anywhere on your Web site. Include words and terms to help people 
who are looking for your type of music to find you.
 
✓ Set up reciprocal links with other sites. Search engines are constantly 
scouring the Internet for new links and sites. If you have a lot of links to 
your site, it will show up higher in a relevant search than a site with fewer 
or no links. Not only do you get the benefit of possibly improving your 
rank in searches, but having links to other musicians’ sites also exposes 
you to their fans (and yours to theirs). This can only be a good thing.

335
 Chapter 17: Getting Your Music Out to Listeners
 
✓ Create a blog. Blogs, because they are always adding pages, are seen by 
search engines regularly as being new and updated. Search engines like 
dynamic sites, that is, the ones that frequently add information. Some 
people have suggested that a blog will show up more frequently than 
a regular page. I don’t know whether this is true, but I can think of sev-
eral other reasons to have a blog than simply trying to get higher in the 
search-engine ranks. The main reason is that you are more accessible to 
your fans, and creating new blog entries often increases the possibility 
that your fans will return to your site often. A blog is better than a news-
letter for most musicians because it’s less formal, and you can talk about 
anything you want. If you don’t want to put a blog on your Web site you 
can use any number of blog host sites such as Blogger.com or Blogspot.
com to publish your blog.
 
SEO is a deep subject, taking a whole book to cover all the details. If you’re 
interested in digging into SEO for your music, pick up a copy of Search Engine 
Optimization For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by Peter Kent (published by Wiley).
Providing Your Music Online
If you have a Web site, you probably want your visitors to be able to hear your 
music. You can make your music available for listening online in three ways:
 
✓ Music downloads: These are files that your visitors can download to 
their hard drives and listen to anytime that they want.
 
✓ Streaming audio: This is a file that your visitor connects to that plays 
without being copied to your visitor’s hard drive.
 
✓ Podcasting: This is a way of broadcasting your music over the Internet 
so that it can be downloaded automatically to a subscriber’s computer.
Each option has its advantages, which I outline in the following sections.
Offering downloads
Online promotion of your music almost requires you to make downloads 
available to your potential fans. You can talk about your music all you want, 
but what people want is to hear your music. The purpose of the download is 
to get your listener to buy your CD or to come see your show.
There are tons of sites that will host your music downloads, for free or at 
a cost for your fans, such as iTunes, Rhapsody, and Amazon. You can add 
these yourself or you can find someone else to put these up for you such as 
Tunecore.com. This service costs a bit but it makes putting your music on 
the most popular download sites easy.

336
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
 
Put only a few of your best songs on your site (or any site for that matter). If 
you make your entire CD available, visitors have no incentive to buy the CD.
Streaming audio
Streaming audio is basically an audio file that begins playing before the entire 
file is downloaded. The advantage is that it greatly reduces the amount of 
time your listener has to wait to hear your music. The downside is that the 
quality of the audio can be lower.
 
You always want to make the process of navigating your site and listening to 
your music as fast as possible. This provides a much better experience than 
having to wait. The less time a person has to wait, the more likely he or she 
is to return. The more repeat visitors that you get, the better the chance you 
have for selling CDs.
You can create streaming audio in a number of ways, but the two most 
common are a RealAudio file (a file format developed by Real Networks) and 
an MP3 file. The process is the same with either method, except that your 
filenames are going to be different. Note that you need an encoder that can 
create a RealAudio file if you want to go that route.
The following steps walk you through the process of getting your MP3 file to 
stream on your site:
 
1. Create an MP3 file, using a bit rate from 64 to 92 Kbps — a good range 
for streaming audio when used over dialup modems.
 
2. Save the MP3 file so that you can identify it.
 
 The easiest way to do this is to save your file as songname64.mp3 (the 
64 stands for 64 Kbps).
 
3. Create a pointer file and name it songname64.m3u.
 
 A pointer file is a file that directs your visitor’s audio player to the song 
so that it plays without waiting for the entire song to download. This file 
contains directions to your MP3 file. For example, your file would con-
tain the following text: http://www.YourWebSiteAddress/
songname64.mp3.
 
 You can also use the M3U file to create a playlist, that is, have more than 
one song play without making your visitor go to another page on your 
Web site. To do this, simply add another song on another line. Adding 
two more songs would then look like this:
www.YourWebSiteAddress/songname64.mp3
www.YourWebSiteAddress/anothersongname64.mp3
www.YourWebSiteAddress/yetanothersongname64.mp3

337
 Chapter 17: Getting Your Music Out to Listeners
 
 The M3U file plays the songs in the order they are listed in this file.
 
 Keep in mind that if your visitor doesn’t have an audio player, he can’t 
listen to your music. It’s a good idea to put a link on your site to another 
site where your listener can download an audio player.
 
4. Create a hyperlink on your Web page to the songname64.m3u file.
 
 For example, you can put the hyperlink in some text, like this: Check 
out our new song, songname; then link the text to the file. Or, you 
can place the hyperlink in a picture or graphic (or both).
 
5. Upload your MP3 file, your pointer file, and the new page with your 
hyperlink to your Web site.
 
6. Go to your Web site and see whether it works.
 
Make sure that your site-hosting service has its MIME types configured for 
MP3. Otherwise, your audio files won’t work. (Don’t worry. The people who 
work for your hosting service will know what you’re talking about when you 
mention MIME types. That’s their job.)
 
If all this sounds like too much work, you can just create a link to the stream-
ing files on your MP3 host site. This way, people can still hear your music, 
even if it isn’t available on your site.
Podcasting
Podcasting is another way to offer audio online. Typically, podcasts are 
media feeds that your visitors can subscribe to and get updates automati-
cally as they are published. If you regularly update your music or if you want 
to have an audio blog (or video blog) that your fans can listen to (or watch), 
this can be a great way to keep them involved in your music.
The process of creating a podcast starts with recording the content and then 
putting it in an MP3 format (if you’re doing audio). You have this book, so 
you can create audio content easily. Just follow the steps outlined through-
out the book to record and convert your music. Next, you need to host it or 
have a podcasting site host it for you. This process can get pretty compli-
cated, so I recommend checking out Podcasting For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by 
Tee Morris, Chuck Tomasi, and Evo Terra (published by Wiley). You can also 
check out these sites to learn more about podcasting:
 
✓ www.apple.com/itunes/store/podcadstingfaq.html: This page 
on the Apple Web site contains tons of information on creating a pod-
cast and publishing it. This is a good place to start.
 
✓ www.dummies.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-291804.html: Here is a 
great podcast describing how to podcast, brought to you by the authors 
of Podcasting For Dummies.

338
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
 
✓ http://podcast.com: Podcast.com has a ton of information about 
podcasting, both from a subscriber’s and a creator’s point of view. This 
is a good site to get you up to speed on what podcasting is and what you 
need to do it. The site doesn’t offer the tools and steps to create your 
podcast, but after you have the content and your feed information, you 
can post your podcast on this site.
 
✓ http://podcasting-tools.com: As the same suggests, this site has 
information, links, and tools for creating a podcast. This is a good place 
to get some quality information.
If you’re ready to get started podcasting, here are several sites worth 
looking into:
 
✓ www.hipcast.com: Hipcast is an easy-to-use site that lets you create 
and publish your audio or video blogs. This site offers a 7-day free trial 
period, with plans starting at $5 per month. You don’t find a lot of infor-
mation on this site about podcasting, but if you’re ready to give it a try, 
this is a good inexpensive option.
 
✓ http://mypodcast.com: This site offers free creation and publish-
ing of your podcast. Free is good, but when you record your podcast, 
MyPodcast.com inserts advertisements into your audio. If you’re strapped 
for cash and don’t mind the advertising, this might be a good option.
 
✓ http://podhoster.com: podHoster, as the name states, hosts pod-
casts. With this service, you record your audio and podHoster hosts 
it. This is a good option for musicians who record their own music and 
know the ins and outs of the audio-creation process (that would be you 
after you’ve read this book). podHoster offers a 30-day free trial, with 
monthly plans starting at $5.
Selling Your CDs
Regardless of whether you have your own site, you can always sell your CDs 
on the Internet through other outlets. An advantage to selling your music 
through other online stores is that you can capitalize on the traffic that the 
store generates. A number of online retailers are out there, but the following 
list gives you the lowdown on some of the major players:
 
✓ CD Baby (www.cdbaby.com): CD Baby is an online music store that 
specializes in independent artists. It puts your CD on its site for a small 
setup fee ($35). For this, you get a Web page (which the people at CD 
Baby design) with pictures, bios, MP3s, and streaming audio. The site 
sells your CD for any price you set, takes $4 from the sale, and gives 
you the rest. You even receive an e-mail whenever someone buys one of 

339
 Chapter 17: Getting Your Music Out to Listeners
your CDs. Signing up is easy; just direct your browser to www.cdbaby.
com and click the Sell Your CD icon. The instructions are clear, and a lot 
of helpful articles on the site can help you to, well, sell your CD. They 
also make downloads available on iTunes and other services.
 
✓ GarageBand.com (www.garageband.com/musicians): GarageBand.
com works in partnership with CD Baby. You just set up a membership 
with CD Baby and list your music on GarageBand.com. This gives you 
more exposure with no extra expense. GarageBand.com also has some 
great information to help you sell more of your music and get gigs.
 
✓ Amazon.com (www.amazon.com): Yes, you can get your music on 
Amazon.com, boasted as the world’s largest online retailer. Amazon.com 
has an Advantage program that allows you to put your CD on its site and 
compete with the major-label artists. All you need is a professional CD 
(retail-ready) package with a UPC code on it. To join, point your browser 
to www.amazon.com and click the Join Advantage link at the bottom of 
the page. Follow the directions, and you’ll have your music on the most 
prominent online retailer in no time.
Because the Internet is constantly changing and growing, you may find other 
sites that allow you to sell your music online. Use your favorite search engine 
to search for the phrase sell your CD. This gives you a ton of other places to 
consider selling your CD online.
Making the Most of the Web
The whole point of making CDs and putting MP3s of your music on the Internet 
is to promote and sell your music. To do this, you need exposure. Like any 
promotion technique, there are no rules except to use your imagination. 
Experience will be your guide, but here are some ideas to get you started:
 
✓ Start an e-mail newsletter. An e-mail newsletter is an inexpensive way 
to keep your music on people’s minds. Try to be somewhat consistent 
in sending it out, but don’t just send out the same message on a regular 
basis. Give your subscribers something. Provide new information in 
your e-mail, such as a press release about where you’re playing next or 
a link to a new song that you’ve just uploaded. Note: Don’t send your 
newsletter to anyone who hasn’t asked to receive it. This is called spam-
ming, and it’s illegal. To build a subscriber list, encourage people to fill 
in your mailing list sign-up forms at your gigs and on your Web site. Or, 
offer them a free download to sign up on your Web site, and put a sub-
scription form at the top of every page. (Check out my day-job Web site 
to see this in action at www.reiinstitute.com.) Always provide a way 
for users to unsubscribe from your list, and make it easy to do so.

340
Part V: Turning Your Tracks into a Finished Song 
 
✓ Put your Web site address on everything. People can’t come to you 
if they don’t know that you exist. So print your Web site address on all 
your promotional materials, including the CD itself. Also, include your 
Web site address on all e-mails and Internet correspondence that you 
send (for example, as a signature on Internet forums).
 
✓ Network. Check out as many independent musician sites as you can. You 
not only find out a lot about marketing your music, but you also have an 
opportunity to spread the word about your music. Check out GarageBand.
com (www.garageband.com), Getsigned.com (www.getsigned.com), 
and indiecentre.com (www.indiecentre.com) for starters.
 
✓ Stay up to date. Keep track of where you put your music, and check back 
often to make sure that everything is working properly. Web sites change 
and go out of business often. Unless you check the site occasionally, 
you may not know whether your music has disappeared. Also, routinely 
search for new places to put your music.
 
✓ Get linked. Try to get folks to link from their sites to your own. Likewise, 
share the wealth and link to other sites that you like. Cross promotion 
can be a good thing and allow you to pool your fan base with another 
band. This doesn’t take away from your sales (after all, you listen to 
more than one band’s CDs, right?). Visitors to your site will appreciate 
the link and will probably check back to see whether you have added 
new links.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
he Part of Tens is a staple of every For Dummies 
book. This Part of Tens contains some information 
and resources that you can use every day. Chapter 18 
contains ten great home recording resources as you 
continue your search for recording excellence. Chapter 19 
provides ten tips that you can use in your studio to 
improve the quality of your recordings.

Chapter 18
Ten Home Recording Resources
In This Chapter
▶ Finding recording information
▶ Connecting with other recording enthusiasts
▶ Improving your recording skills
A
s you can probably figure out from this book, audio recording is a com-
plex subject and one that you can spend a lifetime exploring. Given that, 
and given that this book can only contain so much information, I’ve included 
this chapter so that you can further your pursuit of audio perfection.
In this chapter, you find ten categories for recording resources that can help 
you further your audio-recording knowledge (not to mention your desire 
for more gear — a dangerous thing, I know). I introduce you to magazines, 
Internet resources, and recording resources in your own backyard, among 
other things.
E-Mail Newsletters
Granted, e-mail newsletters are generally sponsored by music retailers or 
magazine publishers who want you to go to their sites and hopefully buy 
something. As transparent as newsletters are as a means of trying to get you 
to shell out some money, many of the articles included in them are neverthe-
less well written and informative. Dozens of e-mail newsletters on recording 
are being published, and more are showing up every month. Here are a few to 
get you started:

Friends
Your friends can be invaluable in helping you discover how to make great 
recordings. If you have friends who are musicians, you can often talk them 
into playing on your songs or even get them to collaborate with you on some 
music. Or, you can record your friends’ music to help you find out more 
about recording. After all, the experience you gain from recording other 
people can translate into better-sounding music of your own.
Even if your friends aren’t musicians, you can often find out a lot about your 
music by letting your friends listen to what you’ve recorded. Getting honest 
and encouraging feedback from a nonmusician may help you see your music 
more clearly. On the other hand, you sometimes need to be careful about let-
ting nonmusicians comment on your work if they are unable to offer helpful 
criticism.
Internet User Groups
A user group is a place where people who are interested in a particular prod-
uct (like the Roland V-Studios, for example) can go to discuss problems they 
may be having with their systems and to share tricks and tips on how to use 
the product. A user group exists for almost every audio-recording product 
made. On the Internet, you can find user groups by typing the product name 
and user group into your favorite search engine or go to http://groups.
google.com. You may also find a link to a product’s user group on the man-
ufacturer’s Web site.
User groups can be helpful not only if you own the product and want to share 
information about it but also if you want to know whether a particular prod-
uct is a good choice for you to buy. You can generally find out all about a 
product’s issues, both good and bad, on these sites.
Internet Forums
Dozens of great Internet forums (message boards) cover audio recording, 
both home recording and pro audio recording. You can find many of them 
by doing an Internet search for recording forum or home recording forum, but 
here are a few great sites to get you started:

Local Commercial Studios
Sitting in on a recording session run by an experienced engineer who has the 
patience to share his or her techniques can save you hundreds of hours of 
trying to figure out things, such as gain staging, mic placement, mixing, and 
effects usage. Often the owners or engineers of local recording studios let 
you sit in on a session (usually for a fee) and may show you some of the tech-
niques that they use.
You can find these studios by looking in your local yellow pages (under 
recording studios), or you can ask around at your local music store for com-
mercial studios in your area.
Local Music and Pro Audio Stores
Your local music or pro audio store can be a great place to meet other people 
who are interested in recording. Some stores even have user groups where you 
can meet and discuss recording without using the Internet forums. You can 
find listings for these stores in your local yellow pages under musical instru-
ment retailers or audio recording sales and service. Also, many manufacturers 
tour these stores and often offer free clinics on how to use their products.
Magazines
Magazines can not only keep you informed about recording tips and tech-
niques, but they can also let you know about new products and product 
upgrades. Even if you don’t read the articles, the ads are enough to provide 
you with lots of gear lust. (I apologize in advance for any discomfort this may 
cause you.) Several recording magazines are on the market, and the most 
common are as follows:

346

Online Articles
You can find articles on the Internet about everything from MIDI to miking 
and mixing to effects. You can even sign up for full-length online audio engi-
neering courses. Heck, you can find an article on just about any part of audio 
recording on the Internet — often for free.
Finding these articles can be challenging, but here are a few ways you can start:
 
✓ Join one of the Internet forums and post a topic asking other members 
where they find online articles.
 
✓ Go to the home page of the Internet forum or e-mail newsletter. You’ll 
often find a few articles worth reading.
 
✓ Check out online musical instrument retailers. Many of them post 
articles online.
Other People’s Music
You can find out a lot by listening to other people’s music. Good or bad, any 
music that you hear is going to show you something about recording, playing 
an instrument, or songwriting. Listen to as much music as you can.

Recording Schools
Quite a few professional recording schools operate around the country. The 
courses that they offer range from intensive two-week courses on basic engi-
neering skills to a full-blown degree program designed to qualify you for a job 
in a commercial studio. If you’re interested in a recording school, you can do 
a search on the Internet or try these places:
 
✓ Berklee College of Music: Boston, MA. You can find out about the 
program at www.berklee.edu or by calling 800-421-0084.
 
✓ The Institute of Audio Research: New York, NY. This school can be 
contacted by calling 800-544-2501 or by visiting its Web site at www.
audioschool.com.
 
✓ Recording Institute of Technology: Los Angeles, CA. You can contact 
this school at www.mi.edu or by calling 800-255-7529.
 
✓ SAE Institute: Various locations, both within and outside the United 
States, including New York, NY, and Nashville, TN. Online, go to www.
sae.edu, and you can select the location that interests you for more 
information. You can also call the New York school at 212-944-9121 or 
the Nashville school at 615-244-5848.
 
✓ Los Angeles Recording Workshop: Los Angeles, CA. You can reach 
this school by calling 888-688-5277 or by going to www.recording
career.com.
 
✓ The Recording Workshop: Chillicothe, OH. You can find out about the 
Recording Workshop at www.recordingworkshop.com or by calling 
800-848-9900.
 
✓ McNally Smith College of Music: St. Paul, MN. The school’s Internet 
address is www.mcnallysmith.edu, and its phone number is 800-594-
9500.
 
Ask around about the benefit of going to a recording school and you’ll find 
some strong opinions. Some people believe that having a certificate from one 
of these schools can help you land a job, and others will tell you that you’re 
wasting your money. The truth is that the recording industry is changing and 
jobs aren’t as plentiful as they used to be (and they weren’t that plentiful back 
in the heyday of big-budget recording). So if finding stable and steady employ-
ment in the audio industry is your goal, I recommend that you get a four-year 
bachelor’s degree in audio engineering, electrical engineering, or even busi-
ness administration over getting an associate’s degree from a trade school. 
Even with such a four-year degree, you may end up having to find work in a 
related field at some point in your career.

Chapter 19
Ten Invaluable Recording Tips
In This Chapter
▶ Improving the sound of your recordings
▶ Making your room look and sound good
▶ Making edits easier
▶ Capturing and preserving an artistic performance
T
hroughout this book, I suggest things that you can do to make your 
recordings as good as possible. In this chapter, I present you with more 
simple and effective tricks that you can use to improve the quality of your 
recordings. You find ways to add more of that sought-after analog sound to 
your music, fatten up your tracks (add more depth), and increase the over-
all feel (artistic interpretation) of your performances. You also discover a 
couple of tips to help you improve the sound of your room, make the editing 
process easier and quicker, and double-check your mix before you call your 
song finished.
Using an Analog Tape Deck
If you have a digital recorder and yearn for that analog sound, you can run 
the tracks out of your recorder, into an analog tape deck, and back into the 
digital recorder. You can do this for drum tracks or even the final two-track 
mix. By blending the tape-saturated tracks back in with the original ones, you 
can add as much or as little of the distorted analog sound into your clean 
digital tracks as you want and reverse anything that you’ve done later.
This procedure is really simple. Just bus (route) the outputs of your recorder 
to the inputs of your analog tape deck, and run cords from the outputs of 
your tape deck back into two empty tracks in your digital recorder. You can 
then mix these two new tracks with your originals.

350
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
A slight time delay (a few milliseconds) occurs between the original tracks 
and the returned ones. If you have a graphical editor, you can eliminate this 
time delay by following these steps:
 
1. Choose a single snare drum or bass drum stroke on both sets of tracks.
 
2. Enter the waveform graphical mode and compare the two waveforms 
to see where they differ; you can use your cursor to determine the dis-
tance between the two beats.
 
 See Chapter 13 to find out more on editing.
 
3. Cut that distance from the front of the tape-returned tracks.
 
4. Double-check your work by listening to both sets of tracks.
 
 If both beats play at exactly the same time, you’re done. If not, just click 
the Undo button and try again.
If you don’t have a waveform editor, you eliminate the time delay by listen-
ing. You can start by picking a time, 20 ms for instance, and deleting it from 
the front of the tape deck–enhanced tracks. Listen and make any adjustments 
from there. With a little experimenting and a dose of patience, you can find 
the right amount to cut. Make a note of this amount because this number will 
be the same the next time you do this procedure.
Layering Your Drum Beats
If you use a drum machine or an electronic drum set to play your drum 
rhythms, you can make these rhythms much fatter by layering one sound on 
top of another. Likewise, you can use this technique to add sampled drum 
sounds to your acoustic drum tracks to fatten them as well.
If you recorded your drums using MIDI, just duplicate the drum tracks that 
you want to add to, select the drum that you want to duplicate, and change 
its patch number to match a sound that you want to add. Depending on your 
drum machine’s polyphony, you may need to record the original tracks to 
audio before you play the second set of drum sounds. (You can find out more 
about using MIDI in Chapter 5.)
If your original tracks are from an acoustic drum set, you have to trigger the 
sound from the drum machine by hand (press the trigger pads in time to 
the music) or, if your audio software has the capabilities (Logic Audio, for 
example), you can create a MIDI file from the audio track. Then just choose 
the instruments that you want to have triggered from the new MIDI track.

 Chapter 19: Ten Invaluable Recording Tips
Decorating Your Room
When you set up your studio, think about the types of materials you use for 
furniture, floor, and wall treatments. You can improve the sound of your 
room simply by using materials and furniture to absorb or reflect sound. For 
example, you can use a couch to catch some of the room’s reflections or a 
bookcase placed on the wall behind you to deflect some sound waves. Carpet 
on the floor or curtains over your windows absorb sound. In contrast, wood 
floors and bare walls add reflections and give your room a more live sound.
If you think about how the furniture and decorations in your studio affect 
sound, you can save time and money when you optimize your room for 
recording.
Setting a Tempo Map
Before you start to record, set a tempo map of the song within your system. 
You do this by entering the number of measures (on some systems), the time 
signature, and the tempo for each section of the song in the Tempo Map or 
Metronome dialog box in your system. Then, when you record, play to this 
metronome.
When it’s time to do your editing, just choose the section(s) of your song that 
you want to edit by cueing the measure and beat that you want to work with. 
This enables you to choose edit points much faster and more accurately and 
makes quick work of producing loops or assembling a song from parts.
Listening to Your Mix in Mono
After all the effort that you put into getting each instrument to sit exactly 
where you want it in the stereo field, the last thing you probably want to do 
is to listen to the song in mono. Doing so, however, enables you to see your 
mix differently and to hear whether any of your instruments are crowding out 
the others. Even if you like to have stuff moving in the mix, listening to your 
song in mono can help you to find problems in the arrangement.
 
If it sounds good in mono, it generally sounds great in stereo.

352
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Doubling and Tripling Your Tracks
If a track sounds thin to you in the mix, just make a copy of it onto an empty 
track (if you have one) and use both of them in the mix. Doubling or tripling a 
track is called multing and is especially useful for vocals, particularly backup 
vocals.
If you don’t have the tracks to spare, make a copy of the track you want to 
mult onto a separate virtual track and then combine those two tracks by 
using a bounce procedure, which I explain in Chapter 11. You can do this as 
many times as you want with digital recorders because you don’t lose sound 
quality in the process. If you want, you can mult dozens of times and end up 
with really thick tracks (don’t overdo it though — lots of thick tracks added 
together can create a muddy mix).
Tapping the Input of Your Mixer
Tapping the input of your mixer means eliminating the mixer’s circuitry from 
the signal. Depending on your mixer, this may provide you with a better 
sound going to disk. If you have an analog mixer, you may be able to tap 
the inputs when you record. Tapping the inputs involves using a Y cable. 
The TRS plug of the Y cable connects to the mixer’s input jack, one of the 
TS plugs goes to your preamp, and the other TS plug goes to your recorder. 
Check your owner’s manual to see whether you can tap the input of your 
mixer.
The downside to tapping the inserts on your mixer is that your EQ or fader 
doesn’t affect the signal, so make sure that you get the best sound you can 
from your instrument and get the levels going into the mixer exactly how you 
want them going to tape.
Overdubbing Live Drums
If you’re like most home recordists, you record most of your drum tracks with 
a drum machine or electronic drum set. You may find them thin-sounding or 
a bit stiff. A good remedy for both the thinness and stiffness can be overdub-
bing (adding separate tracks) some real drums or cymbals to add to the elec-
tronic ones.

353
 Chapter 19: Ten Invaluable Recording Tips
For example, you can add real hi-hats to a rock song. Eliminate the drum 
machine hi-hats, keep the electronic kick and snare, and play the hi-hat part to 
the other drums. In many cases, the variable nature of the hi-hats is what cre-
ates the feel of the drumming. I discuss overdubbing in detail in Chapter 11.
Pressing Record, Even During a 
Rehearsal
Get your instruments, mics, and levels set before you start to rehearse your 
part. Then when you start to practice, press the Record button. You may be 
surprised when you catch the perfect performance before you plan to record 
a serious take.
Leaving the Humanity in Your Tracks
Along the same lines of recording your rehearsals, don’t be so hooked on 
getting every note just right that you miss the feel of a performance. Listen 
to some of the greatest records ever made and you can hear little mistakes. 
In fact, it’s those little mistakes that often make those records so great. So 
before you go autotuning and editing the life out of your music, give it a good 
listen and see whether that note you want to fix is what gives the part its 
character.

Producer’s Glossary of Terms
If you’re going to produce your own music, you need to know how to talk like a producer (you know, muttering inco-
herent metaphors about colors, weather, and food to describe music). This glossary lets you in on the secret (or not-
so-secret) language of the record producer. Read and be enlightened (or not)!
Air: Refers to frequencies above 12 kHz. A quality that 
allows the song to breathe a little. A feeling of spacious-
ness. Similar to shimmer.
Angular: This means nothing. If people use this term, ask 
them to explain themselves. They’ve just gone over the 
deep end.
Body: The frequency range of an instrument where it pro-
duces its richest tone, often around 800 Hz to 1 kHz.
Boomy: Too much low-frequency energy. To get rid of 
boominess, cut frequencies below 120 Hz.
Boxy: Too much 400-Hz to 600-Hz energy.
Bright: Lots of high end, usually referring to frequencies 
above 8 kHz.
Brown: A term for the sound that Eddie Van Halen used 
to get from his guitar amp. Brown usually refers to a low 
midrange quality (200 to 400 Hz) — not to be confused with 
muddy, however.
Cold: Lacking warmth. Often used as a derogatory term to 
describe digital recordings. It could also mean too much 
high end in a recording. In this case, reduce frequencies 
above 10 kHz slightly.
Crisp: See bright.
Dark: Lacking high-frequency brightness. Could also be 
dull.
Depth: Full-bodied sound. Often the result of enhancing 
frequencies just above and below the main body of the 
instrument.
Dry: An instrument without effects applied to it.
Dull: See dark.
Edgy: An extreme of punchy, bordering on uncomfortable, 
depending on the music.
Grainy: Poor digital resolution.
Harsh: Another derogatory term for digital recordings. This 
could also refer to frequencies in the 5-kHz to 8-kHz range 
that are too pronounced. Reduce harsh frequencies to suit 
your taste.
Muddy: Lack of definition in a sound, often as a result of 
too much low-mid (400- to 800-Hz) energy.
Nasally: Too much midrange energy, around 1 to 2 kHz in 
some instruments.
Orange: Get this guy out of your studio; he’s just making 
stuff up!
Plosives: The result of saying or singing p sounds.
Presence: A nice balance between an instrument’s attack 
and its main tone. Usually attained by adding 2- to 5-kHz 
frequencies.
Punchy: A nice attack and sense of presence. A punchy 
sound can come from your performance, your instru-
ment, or the effective use of compression (or all three). 
To create punch with a compressor, set the threshold to 
compress just a couple of decibels (dB), set the attack 
long enough so that the initial transient passes through 
uncompressed, and set the release so that it doesn’t 
remain longer than the instrument and so that it isn’t short 
enough to pump the compressor.
Round: Sometimes refers to sounds that have a pro-
nounced midrange quality. When a sound is round, bass 
and treble are slightly reduced.
Shimmer: Frequencies above 12 kHz. Similar to air.
Sibilance: Pronounced s sounds.
Smooth: The opposite of punchy. Smooth sounds are 
those that have an even level to them. The body of the 
sound is not overshadowed by the initial attack.
Sweet: Good or great, depending on how enthusiastically 
you use the word.
Warm: Lacking harshness or coldness. This is a catchall 
term used to describe anything from analog equipment 
to a pleasing quality that can’t be put into words. Use this 
term around nonrecording people whenever you want 
to sound like you know what you’re talking about. When 
someone else uses this term repeatedly, take his or her 
recording advice with a grain of salt (a large one).
Wet: An instrument with effects applied to it.

Every effect (signal processor) that you use in your studio has certain settings, called parameters, that you can adjust to 
tailor the sound to your liking. This part of the Cheat Sheet outlines the parameters for the two most common signal pro-
cessors: the reverb and the compressor.
Reverb
Reverb is a natural part of every sound and represents the way a room sounds as a sound bounces around it.
 ✓ Room size/type: Whether you use a reverb patch within your DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) or a separate outboard 
reverb unit, you can choose the type of reverb that you want to use. You have the option of a room, hall, or plate (a 
type of reverb that uses a metal plate to create the sound). As well, you can choose the size of the room in either 
meters or feet.
 ✓ Decay: The decay is the length of time that the reverb lasts. Larger or more reflective rooms produce a longer decay.
 ✓ Predelay: The predelay is the amount of time from the sound’s beginning to the start of the reverb (described in 
milliseconds). Predelay helps to define the initial sound signal by separating it from the reverb. This parameter is 
essential in making your reverb sound natural.
 ✓ Density: The density parameter controls the level of the early reflections (the first few milliseconds of the reverb 
sound). This parameter enables you to simulate different sizes of rooms because, in a larger room, the main section 
of a reverb takes longer to reach you.
 ✓ Diffusion: Diffusion affects the density of the reflections in the main section of the reverb sound. A higher diffusion 
setting results in a thicker sound.
Compressor
The compressor is used to compress the dynamic range of your signal and is used in all the stages of recording: tracking, 
mixing, and mastering.
 ✓ Threshold: The threshold setting dictates the level where the compressor starts to act on the signal. This is listed in 
dB (decibels).
 ✓ Ratio: The ratio is the amount that the compressor affects the signal. For example, a ratio of 2:1 means that if a signal 
goes 1dB over the threshold setting, its output from the compressor is only ½ dB louder.
 ✓ Attack: The attack knob controls how soon the compressor kicks in. The attack is defined in milliseconds (ms), and 
the lower the number, the faster the attack.
 ✓ Release: The release parameter controls how long the compressor continues affecting the signal after it has started. 
Like the attack, the release is defined in milliseconds.
 ✓ Gain: You use the gain knob to adjust the level of the signal going out of the compressor. This is listed in decibels. 
Because adding compression generally reduces the overall level of the sound, you use this control to raise the level 
back to where it was going in.
