FOR MILLENNIA, DOGS HAVE BEEN OUR MOST
TRUSTED ANIMAL COMPANIONS. THEY MAY COME
IN AN ASTONISHINGLY DIVERSE RANGE OF SIZES
AND LOOKS, BUT THEY ARE ALL ALIKE IN THEIR
SINGULAR SUCCESS AT READING OUR INTENTIONS.
THIS UNIQUE ASSET EXPLAINS THE SUCCESS OF
OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH DOGS.
ANCIENT ORIGINS
Traditionally, it is said that
our relationship with dogs
began around 15,000
years ago when, with the
development of agriculture,
our ancestors became more
sedentary. Anthropological
evidence of the wolf
evolving into the dog – 
a reduction in the size of
the brain, teeth set more
closely together – dates
from that era. But recent
genetic evidence puts the
date much earlier (see
pp.22–23). Although the
date is uncertain, genetic
tests confirm that the dog
evolved from Asian wolves.
A line of wolves that felt
at ease in close proximity
to humans survived and
multiplied. This adaptation
proved to be immensely
successful for both parties,
and eventually some of
their descendants, living 
in human settlements, no
longer mated at will: their
matings were controlled
by people. For the first time,
dogs were selectively bred
to perpetuate attributes of
their parents that people
found advantageous.
BREEDS AND THEIR USES
The original values of dogs remain
cardinal virtues today. Because they 
are as gregariously sociable as we are,
and because, when raised from birth 
in a human environment they consider 
their human family to be their own, 
from the first, dogs have co-ordinated
their activities with ours. They naturally
protected the territory they lived in 
by barking warnings of approaching
strangers, and defended the settlement
when necessary. They accompanied
human “pack” members on the hunt
and, with their superior speed and scent-
trailing ability, and their unique facility
for knowing what we want them to do
by reading our hand signals and even
our eye line, they actively contributed
to successful hunting. No less
important was the dog’s social
position within the human
family. Young pups were

Australia, and New Zealand, there are
over 100 million canine companions –

years ago all the shapes and sizes of
today’s dogs – dwarfs, bantams, giants,

however, that selective breeding for size,
shape, and skill has grown into a true
industry, with kennel club standards
written for hundreds of different breeds.
CARING FOR A DOG
People who choose thoughtfully the type
of dog best suited to the way they live, and
then invest a little time sensibly training
their new companion, are rewarded with
all the values that come from sharing your
home with a dog – comfort, honesty,
constancy, entertainment, friendship,
and unfeigned affection. Unfortunately,
there’s a flip-side. An unwise choice,
random training, and haphazard care
lead to anxiety, distress, and finally
failure. The following pages describe
how easy it is to build a successful,
mutually gratifying relationship
with a canine companion.

STORY OF THE DOG
www.ebook3000.com


THE DOG’S ORIGINS
The species we call the dog is, both by intent and by accident, our
invention. It is also one of the most prolific land-based predators ever 
to have existed, vastly surpassing in numbers the wolf from which it
descends. The dog is a success story in so many ways because of its
ability to fit effortlessly into an ever-evolving human environment.
The hunt is on

looked like in
16th-century 
France – remarkably
similar to today’s

Dogs through the ages

chronicling the Norman conquest of
England by William the Conqueror in
1066. Full of animal imagery, the
tapestry depicts 35 hunting dogs.
The trusty husky
One of the most ancient 
of dog breeds, the agile, athletic, and
tireless Siberian Husky has
historically been used 
as a draught animal by the Arctic
Chukchi tribes.
Whatever role we ask of them however,
dogs unfailingly lavish upon us a quality
few other animals can: companionship.
If numbers of pet dogs throughout 
the world – estimated to be around 140
million in Europe and North America
alone – are an indication, whatever the
origins of the curious partnership between
man and canine that evolved all those
millennia ago, the dog’s position at
the centre of our lives is assured.
DOGS – THEN AND NOW
The dog’s ancestor, the Asian Wolf, chose
to live in proximity to humans. Proximity
developed into an intimate association –
an association that began almost 15,000
years ago, according to archaeological
records. In fact, when people first set 
foot in North America, they arrived with
their dogs. Today, new genetic evidence
suggests that their migration occurred
20,000 years ago, so our relationship
with dogs is even older than we thought.
While a number of breeds, such as 
the Siberian Husky, Chow Chow, Shar
Pei, Japanese Akita, Shiba Inu, and 
the Pekingese, are truly ancient breeds,
genetically close to their Asian Wolf
origins, the great majority of the world’s
400-plus breeds of dogs have been
“created” by us within the last 200 
to 300 years. Through selective
breeding, we have optimized both
the dog’s size and appearance, 
as well as its ability to hunt, 
herd, guard, and defend us.

Meet the ancestors
The statement “Your dog is a wolf in disguise” has been repeated 
so often that it’s often taken for immutable fact. Lurking under your
pet’s fine coat, so it is said, is a primitive wolf, waiting to escape and
revert to nature. The truth, however, is not quite that straightforward.
WHICH WOLF ANCESTOR?
When we think of wolves we usually
picture the majestic North American
Timber Wolf or the more independent
European Grey Wolf, the “baddie”
in Little Red Riding Hood.
It’s easy to forget that these
are but two of the many
races of wolf that once existed
or still exist today. Is the dog a
Timber Wolf or a Grey Wolf in
disguise? The question isn’t simply
rhetorical because, while these are
the subspecies of wolf we are
most familiar with, each has its
own unique set of behaviour
patterns. The Timber Wolf is 
a true pack hunter, coordinating
hunting and sleeping activity
with other members, while the
European Wolf is much more
self-reliant, hunting on its own 
or only with its immediate family.
OUT OF ASIA
In fact, the modern dog shares little 
of its ancestry with North American 
or European wolves. Recent evidence
indicates that the dog evolved in east
Asia. Throughout all of Asia, and
extending as far west as the Arabian
peninsula, there existed and still exist
races of relatively small, sociable, and
King of the canines
Wolves are the most successful members of the Canidae
family, which is named after its members’ large, gripping
canine teeth. Until recently, the European Grey Wolf (above)
– an especially large and powerful predator – was believed
to have been the direct ancestor of all dog breeds.

adaptable wolves. In both appearance
and behaviour, Asian wolves differ
considerably from their larger European
and North American relatives. The large
wolves specialize in capturing and killing
big game; their shorter-coated Asian
relatives evolved as efficient scavengers
and survive by preying on smaller
animals and living off carrion. However,
although there are obvious physical
LEPTOCYON
Evolution of the wolf 
Wolves are members of the Canidae family, which also includes jackals,
foxes, and African Wild Dogs. The canids’ immediate ancestor, Leptocyon,
lived seven million years ago. All domestic dog breeds are believed to
be descendants of an Asian wolf, such as the Arab Wolf shown below. 
JACKALS
PERSECUTED TO EXTINCTION
During the 19th and 20th centuries, hunters decimated 
wolf populations. Only 100 years ago there were over two million 
wolves in North America alone. Today, only one per cent survive. 
We have been ruinously successful at killing off isolated races and 
in the last century alone at least seven races of wolf became extinct. 
One of these, the Japanese Wolf, was the world’s smallest wolf. 
Standing only 39cm (14in) high at the shoulders and less than 
84cm (2ft 9in) long, it became extinct in 1905.

similarities between Asian wolves and

origins of the dog remain controversial.
While today’s Asian wolves may be the
direct ancestors of the dog, it’s equally
possible that an extinct type of wolf
provided the founder stock.

Pet dogs are “domesticated” wolves in the sense that they are wolves
that successfully acclimatized to living under our terms and our
management. But what is it exactly about wolves that made them so
willing to do so? And why do we find their behaviour so appealing?
Taming the wolf
A NEW ECOLOGICAL NICHE
The story of the domestication of the
wolf differs from that of most other
domesticated animals because we didn’t
actually tame it – the wolf chose to live in
close proximity to us. It chose to become
tame. Wolves found the area around
human campsites – effectively a new
ecological niche – to be a fruitful habitat.
They scavenged from human waste, fed
off rodents attracted by human food,
and were safe from other large predators
that had already been cleared from the
region by humans. No doubt young
wolves were captured by
locals: wolf pups were 
as appealing to humans
then as they are now.
Some were raised 
to adolescence, 
then eaten. Others,
probably the most
sociable, survived
into adulthood
Primitive partnership

reveals dogs’ early role in the human community, probably

T A M I N G  T H E  W O L F
and were able to breed. It was a case 
of “the survival of the friendliest”, those
with the most playful and most juvenile
characters survived. The wolfdog’s pack
instinct allowed it to fit in with the
human family group, with its familiar
hierarchy of dominant and submissive
members. Its superior hearing and keen
sense of smell made it a useful sentinel,
alerting its human pack to outside dangers.
FIGHT, FLIGHT, OR FRIENDSHIP
In terms of adapting to human life, a
modern-day equivalent of the wolf is the
fox. During the last 20 years this rural,
secretive, nocturnal animal has changed
its habits dramatically, integrating itself
into bustling urban environments and
emerging as a confident daytime hunter
and scavenger. And like its wolf ancestor
thousands of years earlier, the fox’s
“flight distance” – the distance within
which it will allow an “enemy” to
approach before fleeing – has
diminished considerably.
A working relationship
Humans soon discovered that, just as dogs protect the
human family from danger, they would do the same with
livestock if they were raised from puppyhood with the
animals. In Namibia today, Anatolian Shepherd Dogs still
protect goats from cheetahs, continuing an ancient role.
THE TAMING OF THE FOX 
Fascinating work by a Russian geneticist, Dmitry
Belyaev, that started in the 1950s showed just how
easily and quickly behaviours in animals can be
changed. From new litters of fox cubs on Russian
fur farms, Belyaev selected individuals that showed 
the least fear when handled and were most likely to 
lick him or approach him voluntarily. In other words, 
he selected from foxes that retained juvenile behaviour
characteristics. Within fewer than ten generations,
many of the descendants behaved as “domesticated”
individuals, eager to meet strangers, lick their keepers,
and whimper when left on their own. Selectively
chosen for docility, Belyaev’s foxes also developed other
characteristics, including blue eyes and piebald (black
and white) coats. The full-body wag of puppyhood and
the submissive raising of their paws to strangers were
retained. Belyaev had produced what were, in effect,
lifelong juveniles. And that’s exactly what dogs are.
Part of the family
Keeping a pet dog isn’t just the preserve 
of Western cultures. Here, a Yanomami
Indian family living in the Amazon 
rainforest of South America is pictured 
with a domesticated canine companion.

Dogs emerged out of Asia, accompanying humans on trade, conquest,
and migration routes. They moved north to Arctic lands, south to 
SE Asia, Papua New Guinea, and Australia, west via India to Africa
and Europe, and east to the Pacific Islands and the Americas.
Conquering the world
ARCHAEOLOGICAL CLUES
The first dogs, which 
were physically identical
to wolves, formed a loose,
scavenging association
with ancient humans. 
We can only assume this
because their fossils can’t
be differentiated from wolf
fossils. There are certainly
wolf bones, found with
human fossils, dating back
some tens of thousands of
years, but it can only be guessed whether
these wolves were prey or primitive
companions. In parts of Asia and even
in Europe, however, archaeological
evidence exists that suggests humans 
and wolfdogs may 
have formed a bonding
relationship long before
our ancestors settled into
permanent agricultural
sites. Researchers at the
British Museum confirmed
that a jawbone, found in 
a cave in Iraq occupied by
people 14,000 years ago,
was that of an equally
ancient domesticated 
dog. Israeli archaeologists
discovered a 12,500-year-old human
grave in which a dog pup was held in 
a seemingly warm embrace by its female
owner. In Spain, an even older burial site
was excavated, revealing the

DILUTING PRIMITIVE DOGS
As Europeans settled in the Americas, Africa, and
Australia, their accompanying European breeds bred
with indigenous primitive breeds. For example, in
Africa, European settlers crossed the Basutos’s Shenzi
dogs with their own European dogs, producing the
Rhodesian Ridgeback. And putting paid to the
“genetically pure” tag of Australia’s Dingo, DNA
results reveal that over three-quarters of the breed 
are descendants of hybridization with European dogs.
The distribution of the dog
Genetic evidence confirms that the first
wolfdogs emerged in Asia between
40,000 and 100,000 years ago before
rapidly spreading throughout the
world. A land bridge in the ancient
region of “Beringia” allowed land
migration of people and dogs from
Asia to North America around 20,000
years ago. The descendants of the first
Asian wolfdogs still exist today on all
continents except Antarctica.

During the late 1990s, scientists learned that all dogs share their 
DNA with wolves. Only a few years later, they discovered ways 
to analyse genetic data to reveal the antiquity of modern breeds 
and found that many of them are not quite what they seem.
The genetic relationship
WOLF
REPRODUCTION WOLVES
Genetic evidence has shown that several dog breeds
commonly believed to be of ancient origin, such as the
Pharaoh Hound and the Ibizan Hound, have actually been
recreated in modern times from combinations of other
breeds. Scientists had previously considered that these
“ancient” breeds were descended directly from Egyptian
dogs drawn on tomb walls 5,000 years ago. The German
Shepherd, too, although wolf-
like in looks, is a fully modern
dog sharing its genetic
heritage with breeds such as
the Rottweiler and the Boxer.

Ancient breeds
Recent studies show that a single genetic 
event took place in Asia leading to the 
evolution of the dog from its wolf ancestor. On three
subsequent occasions, further wolf genes were added,
resulting in three more distinct branches of genetically
ancient breeds in Africa, the Arctic, and the Middle East.
The majority of modern breeds are the result of only the
last 300 years of selective breeding.

CLUES IN THE GENES
Mitochondria are curious structures
within cells, and what biologists love about
them is that they contain their own DNA
and provide a unique signature to a line
of descent. By studying mitochondrial
DNA, scientists established that the dog
diverged from the wolf between 40,000
and 100,000 years ago. Further evidence,
published in 2004, showed that three 
out of four modern dogs share their
mitochondrial DNA with a single female
wolf ancestor. In other words, three-
quarters of all dogs today descend from
one family of wolves. The remaining 
one out of four modern dogs shares its
mitochondrial DNA with three other
wolf ancestors.
SCIENTIFIC BREED GROUPINGS
Just as the greatest diversity in human
genes exists in Africa, where our
ancestors evolved, the greatest diversity
in canine genes exists in Asia. In recent
genetic research, 85 dog breeds were
studied and geneticists observed that 
all breeds fit into one of four different
clusters of related breeds. The most
ancient of these, closest to the wolf,
include the Chow Chow and Shar Pei
from China, and the Japanese Akita and
Shiba Inu. More surprisingly, it was found
that four Asian companion breeds – the
Tibetan Terrier, Lhasa Apso, and Shih
Tzu, all from Tibet, and the Pekingese
from China – trace their origins to

related to the wolf than the “wolf-like”

of existing dog breeds which, genetically
speaking, have relatively recent origins –
each emerging within the last 300 years.
Within the modern breeds, genetic studies
have revealed three distinct subgroups:
mastiff-like breeds; herding breeds; and
hunting breeds, reflecting the traditional
breed groupings based on human activity.

Significant behavioural differences exist between dog breeds, and some
breeds are noticeably more wolflike than others. Through centuries 
of selective breeding we have enhanced a variety of un-wolflike traits
in our canine companions, and the changes are still going on.
The wolf within
A TRUE WOLF IN DISGUISE
All dogs communicate with each other
and with us in a variety of defined ways.
They use posture, 
body language,
voice, even odour.
These combined
communication skills
have been studied
extensively in wolves and in
dogs and have been classified
as “wolfish” and “doggish”. The
communication skills of the young
have also been studied, and these
behaviours have been classified 
as “puppyish”. Using the range 
of communication skills of the 
adult wolf as their baseline, a 
team of biologists observed 10
different breeds of adult dogs. 
Their results showed that while all
the breeds of dog were capable of all
aspects of “puppyish” communication,
in some breeds communication stalled
at that level while in others it developed
into full “wolfish” communication.
Only one of these 10 breeds is
genetically ancient and that breed, 
the Siberian Husky, is the only 
one that has retained its ability 
to communicate in all 15 different
aspects of “wolfish” behaviour. At 
the other end of the spectrum, the
Cavalier King Charles Spaniel retains 
an ability in only two of the 15 different
ways that adult wolves communicate.
CAN YOU TRUST YOUR DOG’S SIGNALS?
In a subtle experiment carried out in 2004, skilled dog trainers
showed that it is possible to train dogs to detect the presence
of bladder cancer simply by scenting affected urine samples.
However, they observed that some dogs – always the goofy
retrievers – were prone to detect “false positives”, a positive
result from a negative sample. There are some breeds that are
just so puppyish, so desperate to please us, that they will guess
at an answer to avoid disappointing their owners.

TOP 10 – FROM “WOLFISH” TO “PUPPYISH”
Researchers graded 10 dog breeds on a scale of 0–15
to identify the presence of 15 signals that wolves use
to convey threat or submission. Nine of them were
threat signals and included growling, standing erect,
standing over an opponent, and baring teeth. Six
submissive signals included muzzle licking, looking
away, crouching, passive submission, and a submissive
grin. A grade of 15/15 was awarded to the Siberian
Husky, the breed sharing the most “wolfish” qualities.
The King Charles Spaniel’s ability to
communicate is arrested in puppyhood.
In that sense, it is a perpetual puppy
with a limited adult social vocabulary.
A MEMBER OF THE HUMAN FAMILY
During the time I have practised
veterinary medicine, the role of the
dog has changed faster than perhaps
ever before. Some dogs exist for
practical reasons, but the majority of
those dogs we share our homes with
are thought of as hairy but honorary
members of the human family. We 
get profound emotional rewards from
living with them and, in many ways,
these are similar to the rewards we get
from caring for our own young. The
difference here is that our own kids
grow up and leave home. Not so our
dogs. Look at what we want from them
– perpetual puppyhood. Today, we
breed dogs selectively for their puppy-
like behaviour rather than their wolf-
like aptitudes. We want full-body wags,
a rocking-horse greeting when we meet,
kisses, rolling over to be tickled,
obedience, no aggression. In just a matter
of decades the behaviour of whole
breeds – the Bernese Mountain Dog
and the Pyrenean Mountain Dog, for
example – has changed from “wolfish”
to “puppyish” simply through selective
breeding for these characteristics. This
appears to be the future for virtually all
breeds of dog as they continue to move
from the workplace to the fireside.
Changing times, changing roles
Today, we demand qualities from our pets that they weren’t
originally bred for. The Bernese Mountain Dog, for example,
is now more likely to be a companion dog than a herder.

Street dogs
Street dogs in Mexico
Mexico has a serious poverty problem, with more than
half of the population officially living on or close to the
breadline. For the country’s street dogs, the knock-on
effect of this deprivation is a desperately bleak existence.
RABIES AND STREET DOGS
There are 100 annual human rabies fatalities in Sri Lanka
and most are caused by dog bites. The problem is even
greater in Mexico. In Mexico City alone, 70 people die
each year from rabies and over 100,000 are treated for
dog bites. Still more die from rabies in Brazil, where the
world’s highest number of cases are reported each year.
Although 42 million dogs are vaccinated against rabies
annually in Latin America, bites from rabid dogs cause
countless deaths. Street dogs may seem docile and
submissive, but they are potentially lethal.
Thousands of years of domestication have effectively created a surplus
of dogs. The net result is that for every pet dog in the world there is a
street dog. Accounting for half of the canine population, street dogs –
also called pariah dogs – survive by scavenging and begging from us.
Asian street dogs probably descend from
the first domesticated dogs that came to
India with the Aryan’s invasion of the
subcontinent. Generally speaking, they
are moderate in size, weighing around 
16kg (35lb), and brown or brown-white 
in colour, although other colours exist.
Because pet dogs have always been
allowed to stray, many if not most Asian
street dogs have been influenced by cross-
breeding with modern domestic dogs. 
THE NUMBERS GAME
In Latin America there are nearly 70
million stray dogs, almost as many as
there are pet dogs in the neighbouring
United States. In Mexico City alone there
are one million stray dogs. That’s more
WHAT IS A PARIAH DOG?
A pariah is an outcast, and throughout
the world pariah dogs behave as fully
wild animals, living on the fringe of
human society. There are millions 
of pariah dogs roaming free in India,
Thailand, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and
elsewhere, some treated with kindness,
most simply disregarded, and some 
killed with malicious barbarity.

strays in one city than the entire canine
population of Sweden. Although almost
250,000 dogs are destroyed in Mexico
City’s municipal pounds each year, this
regrettable need to cull doesn’t even
begin to dent the population.
Street dogs are tremendously resilient
creatures. On the resort island of Phuket
in Thailand, most street dogs disappeared
after the December 2004 tsunami, but in
less than a year their numbers returned
to pre-tsunami proportions. 
FROM PARIAH TO PUREBRED
Some of the “breeds” described in the
Breed Diversity section (see pp.50–51) 
are breeds only because people
intervened in their natural selection,
created breed standards, and gave
indigenous street dogs an approved
name. These pariahs turned purebreds
include the Basenji from Africa,
Xoloitzcuintli from Mexico, and the
Canaan Dog from Israel. Potential
pariahs turned purebreds include 
the Aso (Philippines), Bali Dog
(Bali/Polynesia), Sica (Natal, South
Africa), and Telomian (Malaysia).
FROM PUREBRED TO PARIAH
In Eastern Europe, the consequences 
of political change in the 1990s created 
a boom in street dog numbers, but these
animals look quite different from typical

dogs is relatively constant. In North
America and Britain, however, while
street dogs once had terrier characteristics,
today they display guarding-dog traits. 
SOS DOGS ORADEA, ROMANIA
The stray dog population of the town of Oradea in
Romania is in decline thanks to SOS Dogs Oradea, 
a project set up in conjunction with UK dog welfare
charity Dogs Trust. A “catch, neuter, and return”
project has been introduced, providing a humane way
of reducing numbers of street dogs instead of shooting
or poisoning them. It is hoped that Oradea’s neutering
clinic (below) will eventually rid the town of strays.

OPENING THE DOOR TO DOGS
It’s only in the last 100 years or so that
the dog has so cleverly and successfully
moved into our homes and our hearts.
The genetic potential to adapt to a range
of new environments was always within
the dog, but by moving into our homes
that ability to adapt was accelerated. 
It is still happening today. Only a few
generations ago, dogs were bred to have
temperaments that were appropriate for
specific jobs, such as working, guarding,
or hunting. Dogs have inherited their
flexible brains from their wolf ancestors.
Wolves, then as now, used the “learning
centres” in their brains to deal with
problems encountered in the wild. Dogs
have turned this learning ability to the
demands of domesticity. Regardless of
their original jobs, dogs have increasingly
been bred for companionship and to
integrate with members of the human
family. And we love them for it. 
Who wouldn’t rather return home to a
wagging tail than a cold, empty house?
DESTINED FOR DOMESTICATION
So why are we so quick to welcome the
world’s most numerous carnivore (other
than us) into our homes? Maybe it’s
because we share a great reciprocal
relationship – a mutual understanding.
Dogs have an uncanny ability to read 
us; a capacity to interpret from our
gestures what we want them to do. 
This is evident in the results of a simple
experiment carried out by scientists in
which they hid food under one of two
containers, designed so that no odour
could escape. They then let groups of
chimps, wolves, and young and adult dogs
examine which container concealed the
food, giving clues to the animals by gazing
at the “food container”, by pointing at it,
or by tapping on it. Dogs and pups quickly
understood. Wolves and chimps didn’t.
Somehow, in the evolution of its brain, 
the dog has acquired an improved ability
to respond to us, to pick up cues from
humans that wolves or chimpanzees 
are not capable of recognizing. 
It is this kind of ability that is key in
comprehending why the bond between
human and dog is so strong. The process
of domestication has only served to make
this bond stronger. All it took was for the
dog to understand its position in our
social hierarchy. From that point onwards,
dogs have grown ever closer to us as they
evolve social behaviour that improves
our mutually beneficial partnership.
Best of friends
Our relationship with dogs, the oldest union we have with
any other mammal species, began because we were good
for each other. Domestication cemented this relationship.
THE DOMESTICATED DOG
Making himself at home
Humans originally domesticated dogs for their usefulness,
but changes in lifestyles in the developed world have led
to a comfortable life for many of today’s dogs.
The dog has been our favourite animal companion for millennia
because it has a plastic ability to adapt to our changing needs. 
Until recently, dogs’ primary roles were practical and utilitarian.
Today, the core benefits they bring to the human family 
are more social and psychological.

While the dog’s shape and size vary more than those of any other
mammal, its design remains constant: that of a beautifully evolved,
powerfully muscled meat-eater. Just as in the wolf, every sinew is
primed for a life of hunting, capturing, and eating prey.
Dog design
AN INTEGRATED UNIT
Any anomalies that exist between the
genetic design of the dog and that of its
wolf ancestor are minimal. For example,
all dogs share an identical skeleton with
the wolf. However, sight hounds have
longer bones, allowing for greater speed,
while bassets and dachshunds have
shorter bones, enabling the smallest of
them to follow prey into their earth dens.
Both dogs and wolves share the same
carnivorous scavenger’s arrangement of
teeth, with 12 small incisors for cutting
and biting, 4 large canine teeth for
holding and tearing meat, 16 premolars
for shearing and holding, and 10 molars
to chew and grind meat and other food.
While all wolves, and most dogs, have a
double coat of insulating downy hair and
longer, protective guard hair, some breeds
of dog, such as the Basenji, have adapted
to warmer climates and lost their need
for a downy undercoat. 
The wolf and dog also share identical
types of muscles and nerves. Combined
with strong ligaments and elastic tendons,

Skeleton
The dog’s skeleton provides a superb framework for 
its body. The system is held together by strong, elastic
ligaments and tendons. Through selectively breeding giant
and miniature dogs, we have both dramatically enhanced
and diminished the size of skeletons, as illustrated below.
ANAL SACS
The anal sacs, filled with secretion, play a role in
territory marking and social recognition. Each time a
dog passes a stool, muscles around the anus squeeze
the sacs, anointing the just-deposited stool with a few
drops of quite smelly liquid. This pheromone-laden
substance helps disseminate a dog’s personal data.

the result is a powerfully built creature,
readily adapted for prolonged chases
rather than lightning bursts of speed.

producing glands are lighter in weight

less stress and thus less need for micro-

Muscles
Like us, a dog has three types 
of muscle. Smooth muscle, not
under their conscious control,
controls movement in the internal
organs. Cardiac muscle, also not
under conscious control, makes
up the bulk of the heart. Skeletal,
or striated, muscle makes up the
rest. The dog can control skeletal
muscle, which can be contracted
or relaxed at will. Most muscles
consist of bundles of long cells,
which make up muscle fibres. 
Peripheral nerves
The peripheral nervous system consists of millions of
individual nerve fibres, which conduct messages or signals
from the brain to the muscle fibres. These nerve fibres
cannot repair themselves when damaged. A severed 
nerve results in permanent inactivity of its muscle.

The heart, lungs, and circulation
Just as in humans, a dog’s blood carries nourishment 
and oxygen around the body. New blood is
manufactured in the spleen and bone
marrow, while the liver processes
toxins in blood returning to the
heart. When a dog exercises
vigorously, the blood supply to
the heart increases fourfold
and to the skeletal muscles
twentyfold. Carbon dioxide
in the lungs is replaced
with fresh oxygen, while at
the same time blood flow
to other parts of the body
temporarily diminishes.

it is pumped out to all body parts.
The valves quickly snap shut when

in the small intestine, while water and salts are absorbed in the large intestine.

to the prostate gland, where a liquid
transport medium is added. The prostate
gland surrounds the urethra, and

with urine flow. Older dogs commonly

The female reproductive system
Two ovaries hang just behind the kidneys,

tubes to the uterus – this has two distinct horns
which meet at the cervix. During pregnancy, 
the foetuses are positioned in rows in each 
horn. The cervix remains shut at all times except
during oestrus, when it opens to allow the entry
of semen, and at birth, to permit the passage
of puppies. Occasionally, bacteria pass
through the cervix to the womb, causing
serious infection.

NEUTERING
A male dog is neutered simply by
surgically removing the testes, thus
diminishing male hormone production.
Neutering a female is more complicated,
usually involving the removal, not only of
the ovaries, but also of the uterus. This
eliminates future reproductive problems
and oestrus cycles, and diminishes
oestrus-related behavioural changes.

With a sense of smell about one million times better than our own, the
dog’s olfactory ability is its prime asset. Additionally, selective breeding
has enabled us to hone the dog’s senses, optimizing the desired traits
and so producing a whole range of super-sensory canines.
The senses
MAKING SENSE OF IT ALL
Dogs and humans share the same senses,
but the dog’s senses are markedly superior
to ours. The reason for this is tied up in
the needs of our respective ancestors.
Where early man may have coveted the
canine’s acute survival-oriented senses –
for example, the sight hound’s long-
distance vision or the wolf’s sensitive
hearing – modern man is much less
dependent on his senses, instead being
more reliant on verbal communication.
The dog, however, retains the exceptional
sensory inheritance of its wolf ancestor.

Dogs’ eyes are flatter than ours, with

Hearing
Independently mobile ears
capture and transmit sound to the
middle and inner ear, and to the
brain. Dogs can locate the source of
a sound in six-hundredths of a
second, much faster than we can,
and can hear sounds at much higher
and lower frequencies. 
Taste
Dogs have a relatively poor sense of
taste. Once food has been chewed, 
it is swallowed. The epiglottis keeps
food out of the airway before the food
passes from the back of the mouth
into the oesophagus. From here, it 
is propelled towards the stomach.
In dogs, sensory information is transmitted
from nerve receptors in the organs and
tissues, travels through peripheral nerves
to the spinal cord, and then to the brain.
The brain triggers either a body response
– pain, for example – or a hormonal
response, from an action such as smelling
another dog’s scent. Part of the response
is pre-determined by the brain’s hard-
wiring. Sensory information is also
interpreted by the cognitive part of the
brain, the cerebral cortex, and a dog’s
response to this data is based on past
experience and anticipated consequences.
Smell
Scent is transmitted onto the nasal
membranes, which cover the nose’s turbinate
bones. These bones have convoluted folds,
ensuring that the tiniest amount of scent 
is captured within them. Sensory cells are
closely packed along the nasal-membrane
lining, and convert scent to chemical
messages transmitted to the olfactory 
bulb region of the cerebral cortex.

Touch
Touch is the dog’s most primitive
sense, and it remains a powerfully
important sense throughout life.
There are touch receptors throughout
the skin, but the most refined are in
the paws. Aiding touch receptors 
are the touch-sensitive long hairs
(vibrissae) on the muzzle, chin, 
and above the eyes.
More than just common sense
Domestication and selective breeding
mean that today’s pet dog is no longer
as dependent on all of its senses as
its hunter ancestors were, yet it still
retains awesome sensory ability.

Of all the body systems and senses, the brain is structurally the most
complex and difficult to understand. Within the brain rest all of the
dog’s potential behaviours and abilities. These inherited, hard-wired
capabilities form the bedrock of the dog’s mental make-up.
Instinctive behaviour
Understanding relationships
Dogs instinctively build relationships, both within their
packs and between their pack and other packs. There is 
a hard-wired ability to perceive pack hierarchy, and dogs
communicate continuously to reinforce the pecking order.
INTELLIGENCE OR INSTINCT?
In any breed description I guarantee 
you will find the word “intelligent”
quoted somewhere. My clients repeat 
it daily. “She’s so intelligent. She knows
I’m going out even before I put my coat
on.” Or “This is the most intelligent dog
I’ve ever owned.” Just as often I hear 
the opposite. “She’s cute, but she sure 
is dumb.” “Intelligent” is an ambiguous
word. In essence, there are three different
types of canine mental ability, each
underpinned by instinct – behaviour
hard-wired into the dog’s brain during 
its evolutionary history. These are an
ability to learn, a facility for problem
solving, and communication intelligence.
LEARNING AND PROBLEM SOLVING
Dogs have inherited an innate ability 
to learn – an in-built mental flexibility –
from their wild ancestors. Learning from
experience is a skill that helps a dog
adapt to its environment or alter its
environment to make it a better place 
to live in. Dogs are instinctively cautious
and wary of unfamiliar people, but they
soon learn who to trust and who to
avoid. Problem solving is slightly different.
This is the ability to construct mentally 
a solution to a problem. The faster a dog
solves the problem with the fewest false
starts, the better its problem-solving
capacity. Generally speaking, dogs are
not good at mental problem solving, 
but some are better than others. Sheep-
herding breeds, such as the Border
Collie, have been selectively bred for
their problem-solving capabilities.
COMMUNICATION INTELLIGENCE
This is sometimes called obedience or
working intelligence, and helps the dog
work with us. A dog may have good
problem-solving and learning ability, but
it also needs efficient communication
skills to understand what we want it 
What’s good to eat
Dogs naturally understand what should and shouldn’t be
eaten. This dog is grazing on grass, adding roughage to
his diet. Some dogs eat grass simply for pleasure, much
as we eat salads, while others do so only when they
experience gastrointestinal discomfort. 
Interpreting body language
Dogs have an instinctive ability to interpret
canine body language, such as this play
bow, an invitation to play games. They
interpret our body language under 
these terms. Reaching from above, 
for example, is seen as a dominant
gesture, like a paw 
on the withers. 

to do. Dogs instinctively perceive pack
hierarchy and communicate with each
other largely through body language and
scent, but they need a willingness to take
directions from people – usually through
vocal commands. Gundogs, such as
Labradors, have excellent communication
intelligence; their longer attention spans
and greater persistence make them more
capable of concentrating on what they
are being asked to do. 
Understanding motion
This terrier is retreating from the incoming tide because
she can judge motion and forces; she knows that the surf
will continue to break further up the beach.
Mating
Instinctively, a dog feels the need to mate, the time 
to mate, and who to mate with. This form of behaviour, 
of course, depends on the successful interaction of sex
hormones and the brain’s wiring.
Keeping cool
Maggi, a Labrador–Border Collie cross,
learned from experience that sunshine
makes sand hot, but if you dig down, 
as she has, the sand underneath is
cooler and more comfortable. 
Dogs with good learning 
ability need exposure to 
a situation only several
times in order to form
stable responses.
Exercising caution
This dog stops at the doorway in case
there is danger if he proceeds. Knowing
when to be cautious and what is
potentially dangerous is another
instinctive capability dogs possess.
Mapping a trail
The ability to map
mentally large territories 
exists in all breeds of dog.
However, because few are
given the opportunity to
do so they never learn
how to use this facility.
This unfulfilled potential
results in many dogs
lacking a keen sense 
of direction.
Marking territory
Dogs don’t need to be taught to patrol, investigate, and
mark a territory. This too is an instinctive ability, becoming
active during puppyhood.

T H E  D O M E S T I C A T E D  D O G
Dogs have a natural ability to learn from experience, solve problems,
and work as a member of a team. Even more crucially, dogs are able 
to understand what we want when we use specific gestures or vocal
commands, allowing them to fulfil vital roles in human communities.
The first dog jobs 
GUARDING THE HOME
It is likely that one of the first uses for dogs
was as a sentinel within family campsites.
Wolfdogs raised from puppies looked upon
the people who raised them as their pack.
With superior hearing and scenting ability
and sharper peripheral vision, they were
able to warn the settlements of potential
danger from prey animals
or from other people. The
dog’s ability to protect us
and our homes remains
one of the main reasons
that people keep dogs.
Consistently, when dog
owners are asked why
they keep dogs, over 75 per
cent include “protection”
among their answers. This
is reflected in the types of
dogs that remain popular
today. The world’s most
numerous dog, the German
Shepherd, is a wonderful
companion, but its primary
role is to guard and protect.
GUARDING LIVESTOCK
Just as a dog raised from puppyhood 
with people will protect its human family,
a dog raised from youth with livestock
will protect a herd rather than prey 
upon it. In ancient times, large mastiff
dogs were bred to work as livestock
guardians. From Tibet through to
Spain, especially in
mountainous regions
where livestock were at
risk from wolves and bears,
pups were raised with
livestock to act not only as
sentinels but also as fearless
attack dogs, assaulting
interlopers, be they other
animals or strange people. 
HUNTING BY SIGHT
Geneticists have shown
that sight hounds, breeds
of dog such as Salukis and
Afghans, are truly ancient.
This is perfectly consistent
with what was probably
the next job that evolved
for dogs: helping on the hunt. 
In this latest role, dogs that were
socialized to people would, of
their own inclination, accompany
men when they left the campsite
or settlement to hunt for meat.
With their exceptional senses and
their vastly greater speed, dogs
helped detect and capture prey.
Until the development of the gun,
this remained a primary job for
dogs. Fast, greyhound-type breeds
evolved in China, Tibet, India,
Afghanistan, and Russia, and
from Arabia through to European
countries such as Hungary,
Poland, France, Spain, and
To serve and protect
There is still no better deterrent to
potential burglars, reliant on stealth,
than a barking dog. This snarling
German Shepherd is enough to repel
anyone from entering its territory.

One small step for dogkind
Selective breeding to shorten the Basset Hound’s legs
created an expert tracker of rabbits and hares, whose
pace was matched to the human hunting companions
on foot. Pendulous, velvety ears help the breed 
pick up the scent of game.
THE HUNTER WITHIN
Whereas our ancestors developed
dogs to suit a variety of different
roles and uses, most dogs are
bred today to conform as
best they can to written
breed standards.
The Yorkshire Terrier, for example, was originally 
a robust and talented ratter. In the 1950s, Yorkies
weighed around 8kg (18lb) and, in the absence of rats,
were efficient skunk, porcupine, and muskrat hunters.
Breed standards call for a long silky coat, and fashion
trends demand ever smaller size. However,underneath
the luxurious exterior of today’s show-winning
Yorkshire Terrier remains an instinctive vermin killer.
Superior sight and speed
Long, lean, powerfully muscled sight hounds
such as this Greyhound can outrun all but the
fastest of animals. Greyhounds have been clocked 
running at speeds over 66km/h (40mph). In greyhound
racing, a mechanical hare replaces the original prey 
they were developed to hunt.
Britain. Their descendants today are 
the regional greyhound breeds, often
used for coursing hares and racing.
HUNTING BY SCENT
Another early dog job was to hunt prey
by scent, but it took longer for people 
to realize how to improve and capitalize
on the dog’s inherent abilities. It was
only when people fully understood how 
to breed dogs selectively for shortened
legs and a superior ability to track prey
that the role of the dog as scent hunter
truly flourished.
Dwarfing, the
reduction of the
length of long
bones, decreases a
dog’s running speed, and
in regions such as India
and Arabia, where men
hunted on horseback over
vast distances, short-legged
dogs were not developed.
Instead, these heavier, slower
breeds were most useful when
deployed in mountainous or
wooded regions of Europe where
it was only possible to hunt on foot.

THE DOG’S ROLE EVOLVES
As well as guarding livestock,
early dogs were used to herd
animals to new pastures. Such
skills were honed over time to
the levels demonstrated in the
sheepdog trials that evolved 
as a sport at the beginning
of the 20th century and
which are still popular today. 
New canine skills – setting,
to indicate the position of
game, and retrieving – were
called into play in the
hunting world with the
invention of guns, and many
new breeds were developed
specifically for this purpose.
CLASSIFYING BREEDS
As physical traits were bred
for in particular dogs to aid
them in their work, so distinct
“classes” of dog evolved
according to their specialized abilities.
With the inauguration of kennel clubs
around 150 years ago, the chosen breed
classifications mirrored the uses of dogs
in that era. The first kennel club was set
up in the United Kingdom and was
simply called “The Kennel Club”. It
classifies most breeds pragmatically:
hounds bred to hunt by scent or sight,
pastoral dogs used for herding, gundogs
trained to find or retrieve
shot or wounded game,
working dogs bred to 
guard and protect, and
terriers bred to hunt
vermin. That leaves a lot 
of dogs unaccounted for, 
so the Kennel Club has two
additional categories: toy
dogs, based upon size, not
working ability, and utility
dogs, a mélange of
wonderful breeds, almost
all of which were not
British in origins, where
selectors couldn’t agree
on where to place them.
The American Kennel
Club is equally arbitrary.
While it mirrors the UK’s
Kennel Club, classifying dogs
as hounds, herders, sporting,
working, terriers, and toys, it
classifies the rest – somewhat
unsportingly – as non-sporting dogs. The
International Federation of Cynological
Sports, an association of national kennel
clubs that evolved in Europe, has an
extended range of classifications that

A fighting chance
Dogs originally bred for fighting, such as the
Dogo Argentino or the American Pit Bull Terrier,
exist on all continents. In Japan, this Tosa, in
traditional regalia, is a representative fighting
dog, although today he wins in conformation
rather than in fights. The controversial practice
of dog fights remains common worldwide.
more accurately reflects the practical
uses of dogs: sheep-dogs and cattle 
dogs, Molossoid (mastiff) breeds, along
with pinschers, schnauzers, and Swiss
mountain and cattle dogs, terriers,
dachshunds, spitz and primitive types,
scent hounds and related breeds,
pointing dogs, retrievers, flushing dogs
and water dogs, companion and toy dogs,
and sight hounds. While this list is more
extensive and reflects the role dogs play as
companions, it still doesn’t reflect the true
variety of dog jobs.
LOST DOG JOBS
Dogs were once used
extensively for their
muscle power. In
Europe, “turnspit”
dogs,  whose job it was
to turn the spit on which
meat was roasting, were
once common. In parts
of North America, some
indigenous people used dogs to
pull loads and, of course, Nordic
spitz-type dogs were indispensable,
pulling the sleds of people living
in Arctic regions. This was a vital
dog job until the 1970s, with the
advent of the motorized sled.
Elsewhere, in mountainous
climates where nights were 
cold, hairless dogs acted as 
living hot water bottles.
UNFORTUNATE DOG JOBS
Two of the earliest functions 
of the dog regrettably still exist. 
In China, Korea, the Philippines,
and elsewhere, dogs are regularly
eaten. In countries throughout the world,
dogs have also been used to attack each
other for our amusement (in southern
Asia dogs are still used to fight bears), or
as fearsome warrior dogs to attack people. 
A welcome winter warmer
In Mexico, Peru, China, and
perhaps even in mountainous
regions of Africa, hairless dogs
such as this Chinese Crested
acted as super-efficient hot
water bottles, keeping their
mistresses warm at night.
DOGS FOR CONSUMPTION
It’s a sad reality that throughout the world millions of
dogs are eaten each year, but the practice isn’t a recent
innovation. In parts of Mexico, dogs were once raised
by indigenous people as home-living livestock, fed
cultivated maize, and ultimately consumed. Across the
Far East dogs are still eaten for cultural reasons, often,
it is supposed, to enhance the eater’s sexual prowess.
Stalls selling dog meat, such as this one in Vietnam,
are a common sight in the Far East. Support for
educational charities involved in international
animal welfare will help end this abhorrent custom.

While many dogs continue to fulfil their original, practical roles, 
most have readily adapted to the ever-evolving demands placed 
upon them. Today, the dog’s most profound role is as a permanent,
reliable companion, fulfilling our social and psychological needs.
Changing roles
PET OR PARASITE?
It has been argued that dogs are superb
parasites, that they have adapted their
behaviours to parasitize our biological
need to nurture. In a sense that’s true. 
In an extraordinarily short time, we have
moved from relatively small communities
of people where three generations lived
together to where we are today – a
primarily urban species where parents
may live great distances both from their
own parents and from their children.
Throughout these changes and upheavals,
dogs have been available and willing to
fill a void in our lives, to provide
companionship and community.
THE CANINE AS A CONSTANT
Beyond obvious roles – assisting people
with disabilities, for example, or helping
search for people who are lost – there are
many less overt questions we ask of dogs.
We humans are no different from any
other species of intelligent animal. We

enjoy familiarity. We thrive on stability.
We worry about change or the unknown.
The world is evolving faster than at any
time in the history of our species. New
dangers emerge. Conflict has become
personal. Trust between neighbours in 
a new, urban society is questioned. And
REASONS TO BE CHEERFUL
Why do we keep dogs? “They make us smile. They
make us laugh,” many people reason. We may have
dogs “for the children” or “to protect us”, but their
mirth-making ability – and the Labrador (below)
personifies this characteristic to perfection – is a
profound reason why the canine–human relationship
is so successful. Just watching a dog can trigger
chemical changes in your brain that lift your mood 
and put you in a positive frame of mind. 
yet, standing tall among all this doubt and
uncertainty is the innocent-eyed canine:
honest, uncomplicated, stable, a lifelong
Peter Pan, interested only in us and
doing things with us. This may well be 
a case of successful parasitism, but it’s a
parasite we need more than ever before.

temperament test, this German Shepherd visits patients

NEW JOBS FOR DOGS 
While the dog’s original responsibilities
evolved over thousands of years, a great
variety of new jobs have been developed
within the last 75 years. As trainers
acknowledged the potent power of
reward, rather than punishment, as 
a training tool, a whole range of new
opportunities opened up. Most of these
roles, in search and rescue, drug and
ordnance detection, and in assisting
people with a wide range of disabilities,
require careful, specialized
training and a strong bond
between dog and handler.
Training dogs from an
early age helps if they are
to carry out such complex
and responsible jobs. 
ASSISTANCE ROLES
The oldest “new” role 
for dogs is assisting blind
people. The first guide
dogs were trained in
Germany after World 
War I. The first national
scheme developed in
Switzerland, and by the
1930s there were training
schools around the globe.
The largest guide dog or
seeing-eye dog associations breed their
own dogs; these are often Labrador–
Golden Retriever crosses. 
Assistance dogs for disabled people,
usually Golden Retrievers, are trained 
to help people who are restricted to
wheelchairs. They do so by picking up
items from the floor that their owners
can’t reach, reaching up with a paw 
to turn on light switches, even taking
laundry out of a washing machine. 
Hearing dogs act as ears for deaf
people, using physical contact to tell 
the deaf owner that, for example, the
baby is crying or someone is knocking 
at the door. I’ve been
involved with a hearing-
dog organization since its
inception. When we asked
a psychologist to interview
recipients, we discovered
that these dogs don’t just
fill a sensory void. After
acquiring a hearing dog,
deaf people have an
ongoing improvement 
in their feelings of self-
confidence, self-esteem,
and self-worth. What’s
more, their fear of vehicles
is profoundly diminished,
increasing mobility and
independence. The
support of a dog
can reduce a
person’s sense of vulnerability
and greatly improve their
quality of life.

When disaster strikes…
Almost any dog can be trained in search and rescue. Here,
Ma Klea, a locally trained dog, searches in the north of the
Thai resort island of Phuket for victims after the December
2004 tsunami. Teams of dogs from Australia, Europe, and
North America assisted in searching for survivors.
A NOSE FOR DETECTION
Following either 
natural or man-made
disasters, dogs are
often used in
search and rescue.
In mountainous
regions, search and
rescue dogs need good
insulation, physical
stamina, and superior
scenting abilities. While the
St Bernard is famous for its role in
avalanche rescue, other breeds, the
Border Collie in particular, are perfectly
adapted for rescue work. 
Any individual dog with natural air-
scenting ability can be trained in search
and rescue. After the Hanshin earthquake
in Japan in 1995, dog
trainers began training
family pets to help track
down the missing.
Other uses for
dogs include
sniffing out land
mines, guns, drugs, illicit
chemicals, and illegal
immigrants. Dogs in
Scandinavia have been
trained to detect mould 
in lumber yards, while in Florida,
termite-detector dogs can ensure that
your house stays standing. Roles for 
dogs simply continue
to evolve 
as our needs
demand.

Dogs in modern cultures
OUR DEPENDENCY ON DOGS
The relationship you enjoy
with your dog is likely
to be one of the most
intense, honest, and
trusting you’ll ever
have the pleasure 
of sharing. Just hold
that thought for a
minute. In a grasping
world, where it is
difficult sometimes to trust
anyone’s motives, one fact
is certain: that your dog is
interested in you simply
because you’re you. Call 
it “love”, call it “fidelity”,
for many people, dogs are reliable and
true when it’s hard to know whether the
same can be said of friends and associates.
You need only open the daily papers or
switch on the television to sense the kind
of dependency we have on dogs today.
An accessory to modern life
In the park, at the office, in pavement cafés, or peeking
out of a handbag … dogs are everywhere. An integral
part of our lives, they often act as surrogate children 
for those not ready or able to have kids of their own.

Throughout North
America, Europe,
Japan, and Australasia
we are experiencing 
a dramatic shift in our
cultural values. The cult
of fame has set deep
roots. People who are
in essence no different
to you and me suddenly
find themselves both
immensely wealthy and
under intense media scrutiny.
Prominent personalities attract
people who may or may not be
interested in that person’s well-
being. Is it really any wonder
that so many international stars appear
in the press with their dogs?
THE DOG AS FASHION ACCESSORY
Look closely and you’ll spot one. The
Chihuahua tucked surreptitiously under
the leading lady’s arm at the movie

glamorous restaurants. Always in vogue,
dogs are the ultimate fashion accessories.
There are as many roles for dogs in the world today as there are varieties
of new and evolving lifestyles. For some people, dogs are child substitutes,
for others, fashion accessories. A dog may be a politician’s image 
of honesty or a social climber’s symbol of his personal aspirations.

It might seem frivolous, but
dogs such as this Shih Tzu 
feel perfectly at home in

D O G S  I N  M O D E R N  C U L T U R E S
When I first started working as a veterinary
surgeon I met lots of geriatric miniature
and toy poodles, the remnants of the
poodle’s “fifteen minutes of fame” in 
the 1960s. Bichon Frises followed in the
1970s and then Shar Peis in the 1980s.
In the 1990s, the Staffordshire Bull
Terrier became the most fashionable
breed among my clients, and now, in 
the 21st century, I’m seeing increasing
numbers of Labradoodles, intentional
crosses of Labradors and Standard
Poodles. Four of these wonderfully droll-
looking dogs are exercised in the small
park near my home. Among my most
fashionable clients, I’m also seeing a
resurgent interest in hard-to-find small
breeds: Havanese, Coton de Tulear, and
Bolognese. And now that the Chihuahua’s
temperament is more reliable, I’m seeing
many more of these, frequently carried in
expensive designer-label pooch carriers.
Often these dogs wear carefully chosen
collars and leads, sometimes costing
exorbitant sums. I should know. We 
were asked so often for distinctive items
we ended up stocking fashion accessories 
at the veterinary clinic.
A SYMBOL OF FAMILY VALUES
While the dog’s role has modified
because of cultural changes, its role has
also been affected by the changing values
we place on dog ownership. In Western
culture, the dog is a symbol of family
values. The nuclear family has 2.3 kids,
an SUV parked on the drive, and a
family pooch. Many families choose 
to own a dog because these creatures
symbolize youth, playfulness, and a sense
of innocence while providing us with
companionship and unconditional love.
By owning a puppy, children can learn
about care and responsibility, love and
loyalty, and respect for other living beings.
In other words, a dog encompasses the
family values we identify with best.
Political parties in the US regard dogs
as essential in helping them rise to power.
The Republican Party asks its candidates
for public office to have pet dogs
included in family portraits, but never
cats. Advertisers tell us that cats symbolize
sleekness, venality, independence, selfish-
ness, and the feminine, while the dog is
an icon of honesty, integrity, reliability,
and downright manhood.
THE EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBER
Cultural shifts also influence dog
keeping. We live in an era where couples
are choosing to have children later on in
their lives. Increased work commitments,
spiralling house prices, cohabiting, and 
a general increase in the cost of living
often mean that having kids can be put
on hold. Women may decide to wait
until their late thirties to have their own
children and, in the absence of “the

real thing”, the family 
dog takes on increased
significance. It may be
treated just like a child;
partners in relationships
often encourage their dogs
to participate in as many
aspects of their daily lives
as is possible, including
jogging, hiking, even
dining with them, and
thus create a family unit.
The emergence of
confident urban gay
communities has also
created a new sector 
of dog owners. Almost
invariably, couples who
don’t have children are
honest with themselves and with 
their vets when they acknowledge 
that dog ownership adds glue to 
their relationships, a common bond,
something that both individuals can 
embrace and care for.
THE DOG AS STATUS SYMBOL
Some people consciously choose dogs 
to represent their social order. The
Labrador is overwhelmingly the most
popular dog, and although nowadays
owned by all strata of society, it is still
the traditional symbol of people who
divide their time between town and
country. Owning a Springer or a 
working Cocker Spaniel broadcasts
the same message. 
At a different position on 
the social spectrum is the
Staffordshire Bull Terrier,
successor to the Dobermanns
and Rottweilers that were
popular with my working-
class clients in the 1980s. 
A Staffie, especially one
wearing a wide designer
collar, symbolizes the
tough-as-nuts-on-the-
outside, soft-as-a-jelly-
baby-on-the-inside values
of their owners. Among
my middle-class clients, 
a new breed has emerged
during the last decade 
as the most popular: 
the recycled mutt. In 
a complete role reversal 
of canine ownership
trends, mongrels used 
to belong to the working
classes, who couldn’t
afford a pure-bred dog.
Now that owning
purebreds isn’t so
exclusive, middle-class
families are visibly
showing their ecological
and environmental values 
by acquiring homeless 
dogs from rescue centres.
Owning mutts isn’t just
the preserve of the middle
class, however; they’re also
kept by members of the
British Royal Family and
Japan’s Imperial Family.
WORLDWIDE ATTITUDES TOWARDS DOGS
The family dog is a broad cultural
phenomenon, but the popularity and
intensity of this relationship varies from
country to country. In excess of 40 per

cent of households in countries as
diverse as Australia, Poland, and the
United States keep dogs, while in Canada,
France, Holland, and Hungary around
one-third of homes have dogs. Roughly
one-quarter of households in the United
Kingdom, Spain, and Italy have canine
occupants, while in Japan, Switzerland,
Germany, and Scandinavia that number
is lower, with around one-fifth of house-
holds being home to dogs.
Tradition is a powerful influence among
many dog lovers, and the ancient tradition
of docking the tails of a number of breeds
remains a contentious issue. Historically,
tails were amputated for a variety of
reasons, including to prevent injuries
during dog fights or while hunting game,
to enhance muscular appearance, and
even, it was once alleged, to prevent
rabies. Today, few dogs “work” as they
once did and in some countries, such as
Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden,
the practice of docking for cosmetic
reasons is banned on humane grounds.
In other countries, including the UK, it is
frowned upon but a ban is not enforced.
The procedure is still common in the US.
The unspoken language of dogs
These Shetland Sheepdogs in Beijing are being exercised,
but at the same time they are also broadcasting to others
that their owner identifies with Western values and is
wealthy enough to license and feed several dogs.

HONING THE HOUND
Long before the concept of breed
standards was defined or the term
“selective breeding” coined, canines
faced their own, intra-species battle to 
be top dog, namely the survival of the
fittest. Dogs suited to the conditions
they were living in were more
likely to stay alive and reproduce
than those which were not
suited to their surroundings.
Possessing a warm, double
coat, for example, while
battling against the coldest,
harshest conditions, often
meant the difference between those dogs
that lived and those that became extinct.
Another evolutionary trait that enhanced
the survival chances of certain types of
dogs was their tendency to associate with
humans. In time, pressed into the service
of man, those dogs were bred to bring 
out other traits that would help them fulfil
certain roles, such as hunting and guarding.
It was at this point that the concept of
selective breeding was realized, and humans
began to exaggerate both the
preferred psychological and
physical characteristics we saw
as being practical, functional, 
or utilitarian. It wasn’t until 
the 19th century, however, that
kennel clubs were formed,
breed classifications created,
and breed standards written
(see pp.40–41).
IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER
By their nature, breed standards are open
to interpretation. For example, breeders
may interpret the word “brown” to mean
any colour from dark tan to almost black.
There is no harm in having this range 
of interpretations, but there certainly
was when standards for some breeds
called for extremes such as “the back 
Introducing dog breeds
SIZE MATTERS
While kennel clubs continue to classify breeds on the
basis of their now historic mid-19th century functions,
most dog owners today keep dogs primarily for
companionship. Invariably, the most important
consideration for a dog-owner-to-be is size. In the
following section, all of the breeds are classified
according to four sizes: small, medium-sized, large,
and extra-large. Size generally increases as you read
48 (19)
Median height in cm (in)
through each section, and within
each section dogs are also grouped
according to their original function
or their present form. Remember,
size does not equate to the need
for activity; small dogs may need
more exercise than extra-large ones.
Throughout the world there are hundreds of dog breeds, each with its
own written standards describing what it should look like and, in many
cases, how it should behave. On the surface, it seems a simple method of
classification, but is often confused by disagreement, or even by politics.

Dog shows are the highlight of the breeder’s calendar.
Below, pure-bred dogs are carefully inspected and the

“NEW” BREEDS
Breeding only from within the closed genetic pool of
an individual dog breed increases the risk of inherited
diseases, for example
cancers or heart
disease. During
the last 20 years,
crossing recognized
breeds, for example
the Standard Poodle
and Labrador, and Cocker
Spaniel and Miniature
Poodle, has resulted in
the Labradoodle and
Cockerpoo – breeds
that, hopefully, are less
genetically inclined to
breed-specific illnesses.

as long as possible”. Until these standards
were rewritten, mostly during the 1980s,
breeders bred for grossly exaggerated
features. Some still do. An extreme
example was the Bulldog, bred with
heads so large that mothers could give
birth to pups only by Caesarian section.
POLITICAL DOGS
Even when breed standards seem
innocuous, there may be a hidden agenda
behind their creation and adaptation. 
A historic example is the Cocker Spaniel.
In the US in the 1930s, disagreements
over interpretation of breed standards
within the Cocker Spaniel Club became
so intense they led to the creation of the
American Cocker Spaniel (see pp.152–153).
Political rather than personal conflict can
also produce “new” breeds. When the
Soviet Union seized most of the Finnish
province of Karelia in the mid-20th
century, it became home to hundreds of
Finnish Karelian Bear Dogs (see p.159).
Dogs identical to these, but living on the
Russian side of the border, were later
renamed Russo-European Laikas (see
p.159). What these examples tell us is that
breed classifications and standards are
not fixed, instead being liable to change
as the canine world evolves.

Staying true to his roots

transition to household pet quite readily, the Jack Russell

Bright eyed and big eared, the Chihuahua is the ultimate

VALUED COMPANIONS
Small dogs are an accident of nature
that is perpetuated by human intervention.
Both dwarfism, where the long limb bones
shorten and the joints thicken but all other
features are normal, and miniaturization,
where all parts of the skeleton are equally
reduced in size, can occur spontaneously
by a genetic mutation within a single
generation. To preserve this happenstance
of small size, humans have selectively bred
miniature and dwarfed dogs to maintain
small-dog lines. The human fascination
with oddity was probably the initial spur,
but our ancestors were quick to recognize
the small dog’s potential to give warmth,
companionship, and later, to hunt in the
confined spaces of burrows.

It’s a curious paradox, but small dogs are perhaps our biggest canine
companions. From virtually palm-sized balls of fluff to solid armfuls 
of robust muscle, these diminutively built, highly portable characters
thrive in almost any environment. As we have become increasingly
urbanized, numbers of small dogs have multiplied enormously.
SMALL DOGS
UNDER 10KG (22LB)
small dogs have always been fashionable.
But that does not mean that their sheer
“doggedness” has been curtailed: not 
all small dogs are lapdogs. Terriers and
dachshunds were diminished in size so
that they could more efficiently help 
us hunt. In Germany, the dachshunds
worked rabbit warrens and badger setts,
while in Scotland and England, Border,
Cairn, Norfolk, Norwich, and Jack Russell
terriers carried out similar work. Other
breeds of terrier were selectively bred 
to confront foxes, while the Lancashire
Heeler and Shetland Sheepdog evolved
as effective livestock herders.
Petite pooches invariably possess big
personalities. It is this sense of character,
combined with their practicality, which
means the trend towards owning small
dogs shows no signs of slowing down.

MINIATURE PINSCHER
This German breed, called Zwergpinscher
in its native land, has been known since
the 16th century. It was originally used 
for ratting, but over time breeders have
refined the once-stocky build to create 
a lighter, more agile dog that has become a
popular companion. Despite a resemblance
to a tiny Dobermann, the two breeds are
not directly related.
Pinscher means “terrier” or
“biter”, and this breed remains
a terrier inside, willing to
challenge dogs much larger
than itself. The “Min Pin” 
is energetic, confident,
and curious, and,
combined with its
fearless nature,
these qualities
make it an effective
small guard dog.

It is, however, vulnerable to the slightest
degree of cold, the short-haired variety
especially so. Unfortunately, Chihuahuas
are also susceptible to epilepsy, a trait they
share with other breeds with domed skulls.
In spite of the tiny size of its frame, 
the breed has the hunting and protective
instincts of a much larger dog. Breeding
for a more relaxed temperament has been
quite successful. Nevertheless, Chihuahuas
are still apt to act first, and although their
teeth are small they are still very accurate.

prone legs, the

HISTORY OF THE BREED
Surprisingly little is certain about this popular breed’s
origins. It was exported to the United States in the
1850s from the neighbouring Mexican state from
which it takes its name, which means “dry, sandy
place”, but before this date all is mystery. Miniaturized
dogs may have arrived in the Americas with the
Spanish in the 16th century, but some speculate 
that they arrived much earlier from China. There are
even legends of these dogs being used as sacrifices
by the Aztecs, but these are questionable at best.

YORKSHIRE TERRIER
The Yorkie is today the world’s most
popular toy or lapdog. While show
individuals sport lustrous coats that are
strikingly dramatic, even in the world 
of the show ring, pet Yorkies are likely 
to have more manageable hair, although 
it mats easily and needs routine trimming. 
Yorkshire Terriers were not always as
compact as they are now. Their ancestors
were black-and-tan terriers from the Paisley
and Clyde regions of Scotland, brought 
to Yorkshire when Scottish weavers
migrated to the newly opened cotton 
mills in the West Riding of that northern
English county. In the early 1800s, Yorkies
acquired their present name and were 
used both as household vermin catchers
and in organized, public rat-catching events.
Until the 1950s their size varied
enormously. While large dogs are now
uncommon, individuals who grow to 
8kg (18lb) are still produced on occasion
by their very small mothers. Selective
breeding for small size exacerbated three

COAT

problems: collapsing windpipes, slipping
kneecaps, and gum disease. Nervousness
has also crept into the breed, a trait that
early socializing can diminish.
The Yorkshire Terrier still has the
inclination and the will to behave as it
evolved to do. Tenacious and stubborn, 
it is a big personality in a small package.
While some Dobermanns and German
Shepherds secretly desire (and try) to live
on their owner’s laps, Yorkies that are given
free reign are fearless canine dynamos.
Bursting with energy, and seemingly
unaware of its small size, the Yorkie
makes a good guard and sparky pet.
FASHION TRENDS
Small breeds are more likely to be
affected by fashion trends than
are larger dogs. As the popularity
of both Miniature and Toy Poodles
declined in the 1960s, these stylish
breeds were replaced as icons of
fashion by the feisty Yorkie. Its
reign as the fashionista’s favourite,
however, may now be waning.

AMERICAN TOY TERRIER
The breeders who developed the
American Toy Terrier miniaturized its
body, but not its personality. Also called
the Toy Fox Terrier or Amertoy, this
breed shows the influence of Chihuahuas
and English Toy Terriers in its domed
head and erect ears, but that of the
Smooth Fox Terrier in its nature.
These busy, querulous dogs were
bred in the 1930s for their ratting
ability. Today, they are family
companions suited to both urban
and rural life, and with patient
training have proved natural and
obedient guard dogs and sentinels. 
Originally bred for hunting
rats and rabbits, the English
Toy Terrier appeared a little
over one hundred years 
ago and remains relatively
rare. Developed from runt
Manchester Terriers, it is also
known as the Toy Manchester
Terrier or Black-and-tan 
Toy Terrier in different
countries. The American
and Canadian versions 
are slightly heavier. It has
a distinctive look with a
narrow, wedge-shaped
head, and dramatic
“candle-flame” ears.
The English Toy Terrier
makes a reliable small guard
dog and lively companion

RAT KILLING
Most small terriers are natural
ratters and helped keep homes
free from these disease-carrying
vermin. In the 1900s, the role of
the ratter evolved into a “sport”.
Brown rats were intentionally
domesticated and then bred as
“bait” in rat-killing contests,
staged in deep-sided, walled
pits. The terrier that killed the
most rats in the allotted time
was declared the winner.

This easy-going little dog has been a
companion breed since its earliest history.
Once called the Maltese Terrier, the
ancient “Melita” (an archaic name 
for Malta) breed probably came to
Malta 2,000 years ago with the
Phoenicians. It is likely that
today’s Maltese, also known
as the Bichon Maltais, was
bred from miniature spaniels
and the Miniature Poodle.
The Maltese relishes
exercise, but will also adapt
to a more sedentary life. 
It behaves well around
children and other dogs,
and suits city living. The
only drawback is the
breed’s luxurious coat,
which mats easily and
demands daily grooming. 
The Bichon Frise originated in
the Mediterranean region, and
by the 14th century it had been
taken to Tenerife, hence its other
name of Tenerife Dog. By the
15th century it was a favourite 
at court, but after that it fell into
obscurity until its successful
resurgence in the 1970s.
Of “powder-puff ” appearance, 
the Bichon makes a good-tempered
family dog. It is so amenable to
training that it has even proved itself
at herding sheep. The coat needs daily
grooming, and the teeth and gums
require attention. However, unlike
many white-haired breeds, the Bichon
has fewer allergic skin problems.

Less extrovert and less well known than 
the Bichon Frise, the Bolognese, or Bichon
Bolognese, is a loyal companion and is
well-behaved in the company of other
dogs and children. The tufted, cottony
coat has no undercoat, making this a dog
suited to warmer climates. Although its
name is taken from the city of Bologna in
northern Italy, it is possible that the breed
originated from the Bichons of southern
Italy. The Bolognese was described as long
ago as the 13th century, and was popular
in the courts of Renaissance nobility.
This breed is related to the Italian
Bolognese and the French bichon
breeds, and like them, it is a loyal
and sweet-natured companion,
gentle with children, and friendly
around other dogs. The long, fluffy
white coat sometimes has yellow or
black patches. The Coton de Tulear
may have arrived on Madagascar with
French troops or administrators in the
17th century, and was a favourite breed in
the southern town of Tulear for centuries.
Unknown in the wider world until about
25 years ago, its popularity has since grown.

The Havanese dates back to the 18th

AFFENPINSCHER
A DEVIL IN DISGUISE
Although Affenpinschers are now more likely to be
found in North America than in their country of origin,
this breed still exists throughout Europe. Its French
name, Diablotin Moustachu, “moustachioed little devil”,
is an accurate description of the Affenpinscher’s looks,
as well as its deliciously confident personality.
64
The comical look of this breed is best
summed up by its other name: Monkey
Dog. Despite its impish features, this
breed was first developed in Germany
as an adept ratter, and it will still hunt
vermin and track small game. The origins
of the Affenpinscher are obscure, but its
anatomy suggests that it was developed
from crossing small, local pinschers with
pug-like dogs from Asia. It is probably 
the parent of the Belgian griffons.
As a companion breed, the Affenpinscher
is feisty and stubborn, with a tendency 
to snap. However, it adapts well to urban
living and, unlike most terriers, does not
feel the need to challenge other dogs. The
bushy, coarse coat doesn’t mat easily. While
breathing problems in this short-nosed
breed are uncommon, gum disease, caused
by closely packed teeth, is more frequent.

BELGIAN GRIFFON
In their homeland, the Brussels Griffon
and Petit Brabançon are regarded as
separate breeds from the Belgian Griffon
or Griffon Bruxellois, but in other countries
the three are treated as one. Bred as ratters,
today they make biddable companions,
tolerant of children and other dogs. 
The Belgian Griffon is a neat, terrier-
type dog with short, wiry hair. Its ancestor,
the Griffon d’Écurie, or Stable Griffon,
was crossed with the English Toy
Spaniel in the 19th century,
resulting in reduced size, a
shortened face, and the loss 
of the ratting instinct. The
longer hair of the Brussels
Griffon is a legacy of the
international assortment 
of breeds used in its
development, probably
including the Dutch
Smoushond, the Yorkshire
Terrier, the Affenpinscher
from Germany, and the
Barbet from France.
Despite the Brussels and
Belgian Griffons’ long coats,
they are not suited to very
cold climates. In French,
griffon means “wire haired”,
therefore the smooth-coated
variety has a different breed
name: the Petit Brabançon.
The coat and the face show the
influence of Pugs in its breeding.
Unfortunately, the domed
head also indicates an
increased risk of epilepsy 
in this good-natured breed.

entered the Forbidden City in the Second
Opium War. By the late 19th century, the
breed standard, a list of rules set down by
the Dowager Empress Cixi (Tzu-Hsi), stated
that the breed should have fastidious eating
habits, a ruff to give it an aura of dignity,
hairy feet to allow it to walk silently, and a

Small versions of the tall, elegant Standard
Poodle (see p.207) have existed since the
1700s, but it wasn’t until well into the 20th
century that the Miniature Poodle, and
then 20 years later the Toy Poodle, were
recognized by kennel clubs. The Toy and
Miniature sizes are recognized in most
English-speaking countries. In most
European countries, a poodle about the
size of the Miniature is called the Dwarf,
which is curious because it does not have
dwarfed legs (see p.55), and “Miniature” is
used to describe a medium-sized Poodle
ranging up to Standard Poodle size. Very
small individuals, weighing under 2kg

Small Poodles suffer from bad press. 
It is true that the temperament of the breed
deteriorated through breeding for quantity
rather than quality, but that was 50 years
ago. Nervousness and unpredictability
around children today can be attributed
more to poor socializing rather than 
to an inherently inferior temperament.

owning a poodle is that they seldom have

prone to gum disease and associated
halitosis. Some lines are predisposed to
inherited blindness caused by cataracts

Breeding animals should always be
examined for these conditions. Because
thick hair grows down their ear canals,
poodles are also prone to ear infection,
making routine ear hair removal essential.

Bred in Germany, and popularized
elsewhere by Queen Victoria, the
Pomeranian, or Dwarf Spitz, is a
miniaturized version of the German Spitz.
In its mind, it is still that larger breed, so it
will challenge other dogs, even large ones,
and makes a noisy watchdog. 
Also called the Loulou, the Pomeranian
is an active and vibrant companion, good
for family and city life. The long, straight
coat with ruff and plumed tail is the breed’s
most distinctive characteristic. Originally,
the coat colour most often seen was white,
but by reducing size, breeders also brought
out the brown-toned coat colours that are
now most popular. Poms are surprisingly
amenable to early obedience training.

show in London in 1925. The

three years to reach maturity. 

Similar to the Pomeranian in its foxy
appearance, the Volpino, or Cane de
Quirinale, developed separately in Italy in
the 17th century, and remains much less
well known than its northern counterpart.
Volpinos were favoured by Renaissance
ladies, who would adorn them with ivory
bracelets, and they still make affectionate

successfully trained to act as gundogs.

This compact, spitz-type breed originated
in Belgium in the early 1500s and is
probably related to the Pomeranian
and German Spitz. The name 
is said to mean “little captain”,
from the breed’s past as
guard dogs and ratters on Flanders and
Brabant canal barges. These are energetic
companions, and although they respond
well to training they can be aggressive
around other dogs. The Schipperke’s build
is muscular, with a deep chest and
straight legs. The hard coat has a
dense undercoat and a ruff around
the neck, framing the typically 
fox-like face and pointed muzzle.

The Löwchen, or Little Lion
Dog, lives up to its name. It is a

to take easily to obedience training.
Although dogs of this kind have been
known since the 16th century, the
Löwchen became rare by the 20th
century and is still uncommon. It is 
a French bichon breed, and probably
shares its ancestry with other bichons
of southern Europe, but is the only
one still to sport the lion-cut of the
coat, found in paintings by artists such
as Goya. Its hair is fine, so this dog 
is comfortable in warm climates and
needs some protection in the cold.

where they were kept as companions and,
probably, as watchdogs. Today they remain
outgoing, entertaining companions,

The Tibetan Spaniel may be the ancestor
of the Japanese Chin, and it also has
similarities with the Pekingese, particularly
in the slightly bowed front legs. Due to
their longer faces and legs, however,
Tibetan Spaniels do not suffer the

back problems as the Pekingese.
This breed may not be Tibetan, and it is

and neighbouring Bhutan, to act as both 
a companion and a noisy guardian. Its
Tibetan name, Apso Seng Kyi, roughly
translates as “bark lion sentinel dog”.
When Lhasas first arrived in the West,
they were classified together with Shih
Tzus and Tibetan Terriers as a single
breed. Even today it can be difficult to
differentiate between a large Shih
Tzu and a small Lhasa Apso. 
Lhasas have profusely
dense, long coats, ideal
insulation for breeds 
of dog living at an

generally bond

Superb insulation
Under this dense, heavy coat of hair is a rugged little dog, 
surprisingly well muscled. The legs and feet are covered
by hair, natural insulation and protection against snow.

More dynamic in spirit than its close
associate the Lhasa Apso, this popular
breed comes from Tibet via China, where
it was a favourite of the Chinese imperial
court. What we see today is probably the
result of selective breeding in the Dowager
Empress Cixi (Tzu-Hsi) kennels in Peking
in the late 19th century, almost undoubtedly
of Tibetan dogs similar to the Lhasa Apso,
with smaller Pekingese-type dogs. 
Shih Tzus have dense, thick coats like
their Lhasa Apso relatives. It’s best to tie
up the hair in a topknot to enhance vision
or simply keep facial hair clipped short.
Like the Pekingese, Shih Tzus seem to be
unaware when their prominent eyes brush
against vegetation or other objects and 
as a result they are prone to sometimes
serious eye injuries. Shih Tzus are more
extrovert than Lhasas. Their small size
and willingness to spend considerable
amounts of time ensconced on sofas make
them ideal companions for people who
live in small dwellings. Their median life
expectancy, 13.4 years, is almost identical
to that of the Pekingese. As with most small
dogs, they are prone 
to gum disease.

Immensely popular in Britain, this breed
was developed as a ratter in 19th-century
Devon, England, by the Reverend John
Russell, the “Sporting Parson”. It retains
all of its terrier instincts, and is feisty 
and outgoing, generally exuberant and
affectionate, but needing competent
discipline to curb its more aggressive
tendencies. Explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes
walked his Jack Russell to both the North
and South Poles, testament to how much
exercise these rugged little dogs crave.
The waterproof double coat may 
be smooth- or wire-haired, the build 
is short-legged and muscular, and the
long head has generally folded ears. As
working dogs, Jack Russells originally
had their tails cut short, a habit that
persists in some breed registries. Until
recently, the name “Jack Russell” was
also used to describe the type now
called the Parson Russell Terrier.

PARSON RUSSELL TERRIER
Less common than the Jack Russell, this 
is the Reverend John Russell’s other legacy
to breed registries: a longer-legged terrier,
able to keep up with horses on a hunt but
still compact enough to dig after foxes.
Originally classified with the Jack Russell,
it has the same ebullience and energy as 
its near-namesake, and also comes in wire-
and smooth-haired coats. The wire-haired
type was preferred by the breed’s originator,
but both types are equally popular today.

The Japanese Terrier is a streamlined,
elegant dog with a distinctive colour
scheme. It is probably descended
from Smooth Fox terriers taken
to Japan by the Dutch in
the early 18th century.
The body is white and
flecked with black, while
the head is solid black. 
Although they make very
competent retrievers on land 
and in water, historically these
dogs have been most popular as
companions. Also called the Nippon
or Nihon Terrier, the breed is virtually
unknown outside its native land, and
rare even there. Inbreeding is an ever-
present problem, and is not helped by 
a tendency to breed for miniaturization.

Dogs similar to the Portuguese Podengos also exist in

of dogs brought to this region of the Mediterranean 
by Phoenician merchants over 2,500 years ago.

This agile little breed’s name translates as
“Puffin Dog” – historically it was used in
Norway to hunt puffins from their nests
on cliff faces. Its physical adaptations
include paws with exceptionally large pads,
double dewclaws, and extra toes, which
helped give excellent grip as it hunted. 
Its erect ears have a soft fold across the
cartilage that allows them to fold down 
for protection. When puffins became a
protected species, the Lundehund, which
was only recognized in 1943, almost died
out, and it remains rare. Individuals can
suffer from serious digestive disorders.

Little is known about the origins 
of this breed, except that by the 
late 18th century it seems to
have been found along the
border between England
and Scotland. Its form has
changed little since then,
partly because it has never
become very popular and 
so has not been subject to
changing fashions. It remains

The Cesky was developed by Czech
geneticist Dr Frantisek Horak in the
1940s to be a compact dog for burrowing.
He used the Sealyham Terrier for its
dropped ears, which would not get
earth in them underground, and the
Scottish Terrier for its dark coat, which
makes it less visible. Also called the
Czech Terrier or Bohemian Terrier,
the Cesky is a strong-willed, fearless
little dog with a typical terrier
tendency to snap, and makes a
good watchdog. The coat is usually
kept short on the body, but the
longer areas require daily attention.

The Sealyham was developed in Britain
from a range of terriers. The aim was
to produce a small, powerfully built
dog that would take on otters and
badgers above ground, below ground,
and in water. It excelled in this role,
and was an immensely popular dog 
in the early 20th century. Today,
redundant from the job it was originally
bred for, the Sealyham is
seldom seen, and has made
the transition to the show 
ring with only partial success.
Although their spirited
personalities are attractive and
they make good watchdogs, these
dogs tend to be territorial and often
aggressive towards other dogs. Males
in particular can be a challenge to
train. The dog’s wiry coat is kept 
at its best by stripping, which may
need to be done professionally.

The smallest version of the Mexican Hairless
was created in the 1950s. Along with other
sizes of Mexican Hairless, it shares the
alternative names of Xoloitzcuintli and
Tepeizeuintli. Despite the rather naked-
sounding breed name, all of these dogs
produce offspring of which one in
three is a coated or “powder-
puff ” pup. These cannot be shown, 
but breeding with them is necessary 
to minimize genetic problems. Hairless
individuals are very vulnerable to cold in
winter, needing warm coats, and to sunburn
in summer, needing to be kept out of direct
sunlight. Peaceable, loving companions, they
make good guard dogs, barking only when
necessary. This is an affectionate, quiet
breed, and is good with children.

One of the world’s most popular small
breeds, Cavaliers are easy to train, affable,
and energetic dogs. It’s a shame that there
is a high incidence of inherited heart
disease within the breed, restricting their
median life expectancy to 10.7 years,
which is short for such a small dog.
The idea of breeding King Charles
Spaniels with long noses was a 19th-century
concept. It wasn’t until the 1920s, however,
when an American by the name of Roswell
Eldridge offered prize money at Cruft’s Dog
Show in London, that this kind of selective
breeding intensified. By the 1940s, these
dogs were classified as a unique breed and
given the prefix “Cavalier”, to differentiate
them from their forebears. 
This is an ideal urban dog, reliable 
with children and friendly with strangers,
although males can be surprisingly bold
with other male dogs. They also have 
a great tendency to urine-mark their
territories. Swedish vets have observed
that the onset of heart disease, likely to
occur in the majority of individuals, can
be postponed until later in life through
selective breeding. When choosing one 
of these dogs, it is extremely important 
to check the medical history of several
previous generations. Throat problems,
causing intense snoring, are very common.
In spite of their serious potential health
concerns, however, this is a breed perfect
for families unfamiliar with dogs.

now relatively uncommon. It is often
quoted as fact, but is sadly only myth,
that English law from the time of King
Charles II gives these dogs “freedom
of the realm” – the right to go wherever
they pleased. The king’s dogs were larger,
with longer noses, than today’s breed, but
with the demands of fashion, both dog and
nose shrank to present-day proportions.
Their colour variations also once had royal
connotations; tricolour was called Prince
Charles, black and tan, King Charles, and
chestnut and white was Blenheim. Today,
only the Blenheim name remains in use.

It’s hard to believe that this muscular,
compact, exuberant breed is genetically
closer to the wolf than, for example, the
German Shepherd. Pugs are truly ancient
and, as with all ancient breeds, they can
be challenging to obedience train fully. 
Originally from China, they were brought
to Holland nearly 500 years ago. Their
Dutch name, Mopshond, roughly translating
as “grumbling dog”, refers to the breed’s
snorting and snuffling rather than to its
temperament. Pugs are opinionated and
individualistic. With their enormously
endearing flat faces, tightly curled tails,
and thick, wrinkly skin they are absolutely
distinctive in the world of dogs. 
Pugs are susceptible to infection in the
nasal fold of the skin and are particularly
prone to damaging their prominent eyes,

BOSTON TERRIER
One of the few breeds developed in the
United States, the Boston Terrier is the
state dog of Massachusetts. It originated
in Boston, of course, in the mid-1800s as 
a fighting pit dog. By the early 1900s
breeders were paying attention to reduced
size, and by the 1950s small dogs under 7kg
(15lb) were the norm, although larger dogs
were and still are both bred and shown. 
Bostons are easy-to-
care-for couch potatoes
if given the chance,
but can also make lively family playmates.
Their tails are naturally short, never cut. 
In the US, some individuals still have their
dog’s ears amputated or “cropped” – for
the owner’s or breeder’s vanity, not for the
well-being of the dog. This practice is
illegal in most European countries and
Australia. As with Pugs, Caesarian births
are common because of the relatively
large size of pups’ heads, although breeders
have been successful at producing a more
natural head size in recent times. Like
other brachycephalic breeds (those with
short, flattened heads), problems with this
terrier’s snoring and breathing can require
veterinary intervention.

With a terrier-like temperament but 
a greater willingness to respond to
obedience training, the Miniature
Schnauzer is the smallest, most recent,
and overwhelmingly most popular of the
various sizes of Schnauzers (see p.126). 
Developed from wire-haired Pinschers
from the Bavarian region of Germany,
the family of heavily whiskered dogs now
called Schnauzers acquired their name
from Schnauze, the German word for
“snout”. The Standard Schnauzer, from
which the Miniature descends, was a
herding dog and this is perhaps why all
Schnauzers are so amenable to training.
Until early in the 20th century, bitches
produced pups that grew to both Standard
and Miniature size. It’s possible that both
Affenpinscher and Miniature Pinscher
bloodlines were used to ensure the smaller
size of what is now the Miniature breed. 
Like Poodles, Miniature Schnauzers
don’t moult. Their hair grows prolifically
and needs regular trimming, usually about
every six to eight weeks. Neither as feisty
nor as opinionated as some terriers of
equal size, they are amongst the most
popular dogs in North America. 
Originally bred for ratting, today the
breed has an equable temperament and is
an excellent companion in active families.

The Shetland Sheepdog is a highly
trainable, affectionate dog that thrives on,

ancestral home is on the remote Shetland

The origins of this most popular of
robust terriers is both dramatic and tragic.
In the late 1800s, a Scottish landowner,
Colonel E.D. Malcolm, out rabbit hunting
with his favourite Cairn Terrier, mistook
his dog for a rabbit and accidentally shot
it. Wheaten-coloured Cairns occasionally
produced white pups, and so the Colonel
chose to selectively breed his Cairns for
white coats to improve the visibility of
his hunting terriers. By the early 20th
century, these dogs, now called West
Highland White Terriers, as they originated
near Poltalloch in Argyllshire in the west
of Scotland, were appearing at dog shows
in England and the United States. 
Westies are among the most popular 
of terriers in many countries. In Japan,
their white colour signifies good luck as
well as good looks. To keep coats pristine,
and skin free from irritation, routine body
maintenance involves daily brushing and
occasionally clipping the hair on the ears
to keep it short. Some Westies have a grey
or golden look because of chronic skin
irritation, the breed having extremely high
incidence of allergic skin disease. Sadly,
allergy can also affect the lungs, causing
connective tissue changes leading to a
chronic cough later in life. Westies are zesty,
natural diggers and
clowns, happiest when
there’s lots to do.

The distinctive Scottish Terrier is 
a sturdy powerhouse of a dog with a

work outdoors and pursue small game

Aberdeen in the 19th century, probably
from dogs from the Scottish Western
Isles, and was also called the Aberdeen
Terrier. Scotties have always been most
popular in North America. 
The Scottish Terrier makes a quiet,
reserved, slightly stubborn companion

1955 Walt Disney film, Lady and the Tramp.

That it is named after a

Dachshunds are true dwarfs. Their bone
structure is normal with the exception of
their long bones, which are dramatically
shortened. Dachshund-like dogs are
portrayed in an ancient Egyptian sculpture
of a pharaoh seated with three dogs, but
today’s opinionated individuals probably
originated in the Middle Ages in what

The Smooth-haired

short-legged spaniels,
creating a very
affectionate breed. The
Wire-haired was developed

dogs with rough-coated local
pinschers and then crossing these
individuals with the somewhat 
goofy, avuncular, Scottish Dandie
Dinmont. This is probably why

MEDIUM-SIZED DOGS
10–20KG (22–44LB)
Practical, both in their size and in the services they once performed,
this group of dogs evolved mostly on the farm and as gundogs. It was
the role of sight and scent hounds to accompany hunters in search 
of food or in pursuit of sport. Well loved in their native countries,
many of these dogs are yet to make their mark worldwide.
BRED FOR ABILITY
Throughout Europe,
medium-sized breeds
evolved to accompany local
men hunting on foot. From
the Drevers and Dunkers of
Scandinavia to the Cocker
and Springer Spaniels of
England and Wales to the
French bassets, breeds were
developed for specific roles,
whether they be tracking,
pointing, setting, flushing,
or retrieving. Meanwhile,
medium-sized water dogs
were bred to assist hunters
who stalked game with bows and arrows 
or, latterly, the gun. Breeds such as the
Portugese and Spanish Water Dogs,
French Barbet, and Hungarian Puli are
among the oldest water-loving breeds.
While one group of dogs worked closely
with hunters on foot, sight hounds –
dogs that hunt more by sight than
by scent – were bred for the speed
to chase down prey. Originating
in ancient Arabia, medium-sized
sight hounds exist throughout
Europe. Found primarily 
around the Mediterranean,
these breeds include the
Podenco Canario, Cirneco
dell’Etna, and the most
numerous, the Whippet.
Medium-sized dogs are
also ideal for working
livestock. The Border
Collie is perhaps the best-
known of these herding
and driving breeds. Truly
adaptable, this popular
breed has proved equally
successful in new activities
such as field trials, agility
trials, and competitive
sports including Flyball.
Other working farm dogs,
such as the Welsh corgis,
are now bred primarily as
family companions. A size
that suits many households, and an eager
enjoyment of human interaction, ensures
the popularity of this group of dogs.
A spring in his step
One of the best examples of
medium-sized dogs, the English
Springer Spaniel is a tireless

Nordic Spitz, or Norbottenspets, hails

squirrels when their furs were still traded,
and then later used for game birds such 
as black grouse. Today, it is still used as 
a gundog and makes a good guard dog,
though most are now kept as companions.
The breed’s popularity waned in the first
half of the 20th century, when it became

hunter arrives. This noisy trait makes

of Jindo as a hunting and
guarding dog. Like the Akita
in Japan, the Jindo descends
from the first wolf dogs that
arrived centuries ago in what
is now Korea. It was virtually
unknown outside the country
until it spread to North
America late in the 20th
century. Still true to its
purpose, it is intensely loyal

Spitz-type dogs arrived in central Europe
with the Vikings and are mentioned in
German literature as early as 1450. The
Standard German Spitz was a herding
dog, while the Giant and Toy versions
were developed as companion breeds.
Today they are known widely across
Europe, but numbers have been in
decline for many years in Germany.
The characteristic long, dense
coat needs a good deal of care,
and without early learning
TOY STORY
The three squarely built German
Spitz breeds can be distinguished
primarily by their size, being
almost perfect replicas 
of each other. The Toy
German Spitz (right) 
is the ancestor of the
Pomeranian; today
it is eclipsed 
in popularity
by its “Pom”
relative.

Small feet with

and protective towards a strong owner, 
but is aloof with strangers and challenging
to other dogs. The Jindo needs plenty of
exercise, during which it will show a keen
desire to hunt anything small and
furred, from wild animals to pets. 
Almond-shaped
eyes in triangular
settings
these dogs often resent grooming. Alert
and outgoing, they can be stubborn pets.
Males may challenge other dogs
or strangers; this territorial
quality can make them good
guard dogs, although not as
trainable as some breeds.

to hunt any small animal they encounter.

The ancestors of this breed
were brought to the Canary
Islands from the Iberian
mainland some 400 years ago,
and were themselves descended from
Mediterranean hounds. The Podenco
Canario, or Canary Islands Hound, is
probably related to the Ibizan Hound,
and hunts by hearing and scent as well as
sight. In the demanding environment of
these volcanic islands, the breed developed
into an adaptable hunting dog that will both
point and retrieve, and it is still used in
packs for hunting rabbits. Podenco Canarios
do not suit a sedate or city life: they need
exercise and are not very easy to train.

This most common of all French Bassets
originated, as its name says, in Artois and
Normandy. The English Basset Hound
has its origins in this ancient French breed.
As with its other short-legged brethren,
the wars of the 20th century drastically
reduced its numbers, but it was saved
from extinction by dedicated breeders.
A version of this breed known as the
Basset d’Artois is shorter at the withers
and lighter in weight. Both dogs happily
work alone or in a pack.

FRENCH BASSETS
A “basset” is simply a short-legged version of a taller
hunting dog. It is, in essence, a dwarf. Bassets are
ideal hunters in dense bush, forest, or in mountainous
regions when hunting on horseback is difficult or
impossible. Dwarfed hunting dogs existed in France for
centuries, but it was only after the French Revolution,
when hunting became the right of ordinary citizens and
not just the privileged aristocracy, that the present
wide variety of French bassets flourished.

One of the oldest of French scent hounds,

appetite) may be one reason it survived

This is a supremely trainable working
dog, bred for ability, not size or colour, and
it forms a very close bond with its owner.
However, this is not a breed for the novice
owner. Their quick minds, deep-seated
herding instinct, and need to release their
high levels of energy make many of them
uncomfortable in family environments,
where they are highly prone to behaviour
problems and obsessive or compulsive
activities. Show lines are bred for show ring
conformation and reduced energy levels.
This breed is consistently top dog in the

decades the hyper-alert and ever-vigilant
Border Collie has evolved from being the

smooth-coated individuals shed profusely.

original size. Once called the Wire-haired
Pinscher, it is now also known as the
Standard Schnauzer or Mittelschnauzer.
At this size, the breed makes an efficient
guard and ratter, and it is often classed as
a terrier. Its willingness to learn means it
can also be trained to retrieve and makes 
a superb livestock dog. Like many terrier
breeds, it can be aggressive towards other
dogs, and like many working dogs it needs
a good deal of activity; if you can cope
with these traits, they make alert and

routine clipping every six to eight weeks.

The Corgi has been in Wales for at least a
millenium, and possibly for as long as
3,000 years. Until the 1850s, the Cardigan
Welsh Corgi was the only dog known to
be kept in some Welsh communities.
Records dating from
1574 suggest the
breed gets its name
from the word cur,
meaning to watch
over, and in old
Welsh, gi means dog.
This breed was originally a robust
livestock guard on farms, as well
as an instinctive “heeler”, driving
cattle by nipping at its heels; it was
built low enough to the ground to
avoid flailing hooves. Corgis are
still given to this behaviour today,
being self-willed and sometimes
snappy. They make exuberant,
alert, but opinionated companions
for owners with a firm hand.

This sturdy breed resembles the Swedish

matter of speculation.
What is certain, however,
is that these little dogs
have been herding cattle,
ratting, and guarding
farmyards in Wales since 
at least AD 920. 
Although this efficient yet
stubborn breed is still worked
today, most Pembrokes are
kept solely as companions.

Known since 1870, this is Australia’s most
popular working breed – over 100,000 of
these livestock dogs exist there. The breed
was created after collies from the north of
England were taken to Australia in the
19th century. Mating then took place with
a black-and-tan bitch, Kelpie, the name 
of the benign water spirit in Robert Louis
Stevenson’s Kidnapped.
In spite of very good records of the
breed’s origins, legends persist that it
carries Dingo blood, perhaps because of
its ability to work in the sun from dawn to
dusk. Often called a “workaholic”, this is 
a breed of seemingly inexhaustible energy
and enthusiasm that disregards extremes
of both heat and cold, and is not at all
suited to a quiet life. Working Kelpies are
slightly smaller than their show or “bench”
relatives, who are bred more for colour and
size than for gathering mobs of sheep. All
Kelpies delight in herding everything from
cattle to farmyard poultry; if deprived of
these, they may round up humans and
pets to stave off boredom. Unique among
herders, Kelpies will run over the backs 
of sheep to reach the head of the flock.

Australia’s climate places strong demands
on a working dog, and many of the dogs
taken from Britain in the 19th century
simply could not endure the heat. Pioneer
Thomas Smith Hall from Queensland set
out to create a new breed, also called the
Australian Heeler, Queensland Heeler,
Blue Heeler, or simply Hall’s Heeler. 
The Blue Merle Smooth Highland Collie,
Dalmatian, and possibly Bull Terrier were
the British breeds used, and the indigenous
Dingo was added to these. The result is an
alert dog with tremendous stamina for
driving stock long distances in
harsh, hot conditions. Kelpies and
Border Collies have now taken over
these responsibilities. Most Australian
Cattle Dogs are exclusively companions,
and good breeders select for temperament,
breeding out the natural tendency to bite.
These dogs have a huge reserve of energy
demanding copious exercise, and a natural
wariness of strangers, including children.

Spitz-type dogs were brought to Iceland
by Viking settlers at the end of the 9th
century, and from those dogs evolved this
tough, agile, enthusiastic, and expert herder,
also known as the Icelandic Dog, Islandsk
Farehond, and Friaar Dog. 
Its history is troubled. In the late 19th
century, canine distemper reduced numbers
drastically. Then, before effective tapeworm
treatments were developed, the breed was
banned from Iceland’s capital city of
Reykjavik following the spread of the
Echinococcus parasite in humans – the result
of dogs consuming contaminated sheep
carcasses. The ban still survives today.
No longer on the brink of extinction, the
Icelandic Sheepdog makes

mainly in Scandinavia
and northern Europe.

herders. Legend has it that in the 16th
century it provided the foundation stock
for the Bearded Collie in Scotland.
Despite its long history, the breed was
almost extinct by the end of World War
II. It is now popular in Poland and beyond,
especially where Poles have migrated and

Vallhund means “herding dog”, and
this determined, energetic breed
resembles the Welsh Corgis (see

It has the tenacity, toughness, and
courage of all heeler breeds, and 
also the potential to nip at the ankles

It is possible that it is descended
from the Corgis, arriving in
Scandinavia with Vikings
returning from Pembrokeshire
settlements, and ultimately, the
ancestors of both breeds are
probably the short-legged
bassets of central Europe. The
breed was close to extinction

Like other Pinschers or “biters”, this is an old farm
breed, used for vermin control and guard duties. It has 
existed in countries of the old Austrian Empire since the
late 18th century, but now is rarely seen outside Austria,
where it is called the Österreichischer Kurzhaariger
Pinscher. It is a good guard dog, with a willingness to bark,
but a tendency to bite and to be aggressive towards other
dogs make the transition to the role of companion difficult.

a Wire-haired Fox Terrier bitch produced
robust, distinctive puppies, and the breed
was recognized in 1955. They are devoted
and biddable companions, easy-going with
children and other dogs, and with no strong
urge to chase wildlife. Despite these traits
they remain rare, with small breeding
populations in Germany and Finland.

Also called Irish Red Terriers, but aptly
nicknamed “Daredevils” by their fans,
Irish Terriers are reckless,
animated dogs that both work
hard and play hard. Bred around
Cork in the far south of Ireland
as a superb vermin hunter and
water dog, they have an elegant,
racy build and a striding gait that
covers plenty of ground. They
make entertaining and loyal
family companions, but are
inclined to take the mere
presence of another dog as a
challenge. Thorough training
is vital, as exercising on a

way to tire
them out.

A law of 1698 stated that in Ireland
only the landed gentry could
own a “hound, beagle,
greyhound, or land
spaniel”. The terrier or
all-purpose working dog
was the peasant’s lot, and
into this category  fell the
versatile Wheaten, used
for guarding, herding,
droving, and hunting
since at least the 18th
century. It is among

The looks of this rare Irish breed reflect its origins
as a tough, powerful country dog, designed to hunt
down and kill foxes and badgers and triumph in
fights. The bone and muscle of the broad body
make the Glen extraordinarily heavy for its size,
and it gives the impression that
it will go over or through
anything that gets in its
way (which largely it can).
Selective breeding has
modified the breed’s
temperament, and it 
now makes a friendly
companion that is
relaxed around people.
With other dogs it is now
less inclined to start fights,
but it will still finish them.
Think of this breed as a big
dog: firm training is essential,
and can produce a good guard
dog. The rough topcoat should

Should another dog appear, however, you
may be faced with a ferocious throwback
to pit-fighting days, determined to destroy
its opponent at any cost. As bull-baiting
declined in the 17th century, breeders
crossed terriers with bull-baiters, whose
faces were too short for fighting other dogs.
This created a range of bull terriers that
would fight each other, until this “sport”
too was outlawed in Britain and other

This breed was created from English
Staffordshire Bull Terriers that
crossed the Atlantic in the 19th
century. The American breeders
preferred a heftier dog, and bred for
greater height and a bulkier build,
resulting in this separate breed being
recognized in 1936. Its ears are often
cropped in the United States, a
practice that is illegal throughout
Europe and elsewhere. American
Staffordshires were used for dog
fighting until this was banned in the
United States in 1900. Like the British
Staffie, this is a gentle, loyal, and
affectionate breed, good with children,
but it needs early socialization to curb
its instinct to attack other dogs.

The black sheep of the bull terrier family,
the American Pit Bull is subject to more
laws than perhaps any other breed. In 
the 19th century, some bull terrier lines 
in the United States were developed into
the American Staffordshire, others into the
American Pit Bull. Even today, it is possible
for individuals listed as one breed with one
registry to be listed as the other
with another registry.

Not a true miniature, this breed 
was developed in the 1930s – going
against type in a period when
breeding consistently larger Bull
Terriers was the norm. It was
initially defined by a lower weight,
but is now defined by its height,
which allows the dog to keep the
same sturdy build characteristic 
as the Bull Terrier. The Miniature 
Bull Terrier shows more typical
terrier temperament than the larger
version, being aggressive towards
other dogs and inclined to snap if
teased. It settles into urban life well
and will make an effective watchdog
and humorous companion.

The large Podengo (Podengo

popular pack dog, bred to assist
in the hunt for game such as wild
boar. However, unlike its small

(see pp.80–81), the large Podengo
faded into obscurity after Portugal’s
agricultural and forestry policies
changed following the country’s
admission to the European

The large Podengo has been

CHANGING ROLES
The French Bulldog was at its most popular in France
over 100 years ago (Degas and Toulouse-Lautrec painted
them; Colette wrote about hers). Unlike the bull-baiting
origins of its larger English relative, the French Bulldog
was originally developed for ratting. Like other bulldogs,
little of the breed’s hereditary aggression remains, and
the French Bulldog makes an affectionate, playful, and
reliable pet.

with short faces 
make this a potentially
expensive breed, and it is

Bulldogs are susceptible to overheating,
meaning it is advisable to carry a water
bottle to quench their thirst when walking

breed was used as a successful rabbit

WATER DOGS
All dogs can dog paddle, but some are born to swim.
Water is their second home. Throughout Europe and
later in America, medium-sized breeds were developed
to work in water. Some had surprising uses, such as
collecting shot arrows that had fallen on water, but the
majority were bred selectively to retrieve and return
game that had landed in water. The curious show cuts
of some modern breeds have their origins in clipping
hair to reduce drag in water, while leaving dense hair
over the joints to help keep them warm. The Portuguese
Water Dog pictured below benefits from this practice,
emerging from the sea to reveal a suitably functional
cut for a hard-working fisherman’s friend.

Equally popular as a working gundog 
and a companion, the Welsh Springer is 
a good-natured and tractable breed with
stamina to spare. Its original function

Red-and-white dogs of this type

Dog owners love their spaniels and their
spaniels love them. These have always
been affectionate dogs from the time they
emerged from Spain almost a thousand
years ago. In the 1300s, Chaucer, writing
about the Wife of Bath, said of her, “for as
a spaniel she would on him leap”. “Spaniel”
was once a generic word, referring to dogs
that flushed birds from thicket or marsh
and then retrieved them for their masters.
By 1800, small spaniels used for hunting
woodcock in southwest England and Wales
were called “cocker spaniels”: the origin
of the modern English Cocker Spaniel. 
The doe-eyed Cocker Spaniel has long
been a family favourite throughout the
world. Its domed head, floppy ears, and 
big eyes epitomize companionship. Some
Cockers do still have working roles, but
the majority are household companions,
selected for their looks and luxurious coats,

retain their potential to work in the field, 
the so-called Working Cocker Spaniel is
often bred from completely different lines 
of dogs. These individuals have
shorter bodies, less pendulous 
ears, and a more frenetic desire
to work that is reminiscent of
the English Springer Spaniel.
These lines of Cockers are the
most successful of all breeds as
hearing dogs for deaf people.

Popularity has its drawbacks, however, and
unprincipled breeding of Cocker Spaniels
has led to an increased occurrence of eye
disorders and skin complaints. There is
also a higher incidence of hypothyroidism
(a condition in which the thyroid gland
stops producing sufficient hormone) in
Cockers than in any other breed. Cases 
of cancer and heart disease remain low,
but behavioural problems can occur,
particularly in solid-coloured dogs. The
vast majority of Cockers live blissfully 
free of these disorders, however.
LITERARY LEANINGS
A Cocker Spaniel whose fame spread further than
most was Flush, the dog belonging
to 19th-century poet, Elizabeth
Barrett Browning. Inspired
by references to the dog
in love letters between
Elizabeth Barrett and
her future husband,
Robert Browning,
author Virginia Woolf
(right) wrote the dog’s
biography, giving his
perspective on the love
affair. Flush, when it
appeared in 1933, was 
an instant best-seller.
Water lovers
Whether bred for work or companionship, Cocker Spaniels
thrive on two activities: retrieving and swimming. Given
the opportunity, there is nothing more satisfying than
combining both pleasures, as this dog demonstrates.

In the 1930s, a conflict arose among
Cocker Spaniel breeders in America.
Some wanted to breed for working ability,
while others wanted to breed for the show
ring, emphasizing the drama of the coat
and muzzle. Those who favoured working
ability broke away to form a new club,
leaving the original Cocker Spaniel Club,
founded in 1881, to continue breeding
selectively for the new, slightly smaller
“Americanized” variety: shorter at the
withers, with a smaller head and muzzle,
longer, denser, silkier hair, and a more
dramatic down-slope of the top line. In the
United States, the name “Cocker Spaniel”
refers to this new American Cocker Spaniel,
while the older style is called the English
Cocker Spaniel (see pp.150–151). In Britain,
the older variety is the Cocker Spaniel and
the newer, the American Cocker Spaniel. 
Cocker Spaniels appear almost invariably
in every country’s top ten most popular dog
breeds. All Cockers retain their hunting
instincts, but the popularity of the

LADY AND THE TRAMP
The most popular breed with American dog owners
from the late 1930s and for the next 50 years, the
American Cocker Spaniel was the obvious choice of dog
to portray the refined and gentle Lady in Walt Disney’s
1955 film, Lady and the Tramp. With her flowing ears,
the pampered pooch personified the innocent abroad,
taken under the wing of the scruffy,
streetwise Tramp. Romance
blossoms over spaghetti, and

American Cocker, particularly in North,
Central, and South America, as well as
Japan, is based squarely on its charm,
striking looks, and gentle companionship.
This is a truly loving breed that forms deep
bonds with a human family. Unfortunately,
it shares with its English relative a variety
of inherited disorders, including epilepsy,
eye conditions, skin complaints, and kidney
problems. Responsible breeders will assess
their dogs for each of these disorders
before breeding from them.

Despite its name, this breed is not and
never has been a working terrier intended
to go to ground after small animals. The
first Westerners who saw it were simply
reminded of these dogs familiar to them
at home, but its Tibetan name is the
Dhoki Apso, which can be translated as
“long-haired watchdog”. Traditionally, it
was kept by monasteries as a companion
and a vocal guard dog, both roles that it
still fulfils well today. Dogs were considered
lucky, and were given as gifts or tributes,
which is how the breed came to the West.
A medic working in India in the 1930s, 
Dr Greig, was given puppies by a grateful
patient, with which she established 
a breeding kennel in Britain. Although
gentle, affectionate, and surprisingly lively,
the breed has never become as popular as
its smaller compatriot, the Lhasa Apso.

SMALL MÜNSTERLÄNDER
DIMINUTIVE HUNTERS
The slightest of all gundogs, the Small Münsterländer
still makes an enthusiastic and efficient hunter. 
It readily uses its voice when tracking game, and
experienced hunters can interpret from the tone 
of voice what type of quarry is being tracked. The
breed has an especially soft mouth when retrieving
birds, as the dog shown here demonstrates.
This engaging and intelligent breed was
originally used centuries ago to flush birds
for nets and hawks. The role earned it one
of its other German names, Heidewachtel,
or “heath quail” dog. It is also classified
under the names of Kleine Münsterländer
Vorstehhund or, more succinctly, Spion. 
When hawking declined, the breed was
used as a pointer and retriever, and later 
as a household companion. In the early
20th century a concerted effort was made
to revive the breed, using crosses with
other European gundogs to increase
numbers. Today the Small Münsterländer
is gaining a wider audience, and is favoured
by hunters in North America, where it is
listed in working rather than show registries.
Alongside its natural working abilities, 
the companion traits that saw it through
its period of unemployment are still
present, and this is a happy, affectionate,
lively dog that asks for nothing more than
leadership and entertaining exercise.
Distinctive coat colour
The Small Münsterländer’s coat may be brown
and white or, as seen here, brown roan with
brown patches. Some individuals have areas
of tan hair on the muzzle or around the eyes.

LARGE DOGS
20–40KG (44–88LB)
Closest in size to the Asiatic wolf, large dogs are the most numerous in
variety, although many breeds were developed for only two primary
purposes: to work with the hunter, finding and retrieving game, or to
work with the farmer protecting his livestock. Today, these trustworthy
breeds include some of the world’s most popular canine companions.
RETRIEVING AND TRACKING
Gundogs had to be open
to instruction from the
hunter and to be willing
learners who enjoyed
working as team-mates
with people. The European
breeders who created the
great variety of spaniels,
setters, pointers, and
retrievers unwittingly also
created breeds that became
some of our most reliable,
obedient, and easy-to-train
family companions.
Some large breeds thrive
on teamwork with the
hunter, while others enjoy
greater rein. From Europe to Scandinavia
to the US, specialist scent hounds were
developed wherever there was game to
be tracked. Elsewhere, sight hounds, the
Blood ties
The dog evolved from the
Asiatic wolf and it is no
surprise that several large
dog breeds, including the
Chow Chow, are a similar
size to their wolf ancestor.
Flexible friend
The English Pointer is a superb example of the malleability
of the dog. Pointers are bred to ignore their natural chase-
and-kill instincts, and instead indicate prey to the hunter.
Farm hand
A dependable and intelligent breed,
the German Shepherd’s first use was
as a farm dog. Military service roles
in World War I showcased the breed’s
versatility, leading to a global profile.
speed merchants of the
canine world, developed
in locations as diverse as
Europe, Asia, and Africa.
While medium-sized
dogs are ideal for driving
livestock, larger dogs are
better for protecting flocks
from predators such as
wolves. Many of today’s
shepherd dogs emerged 
in the late 1800s, on farms
in the region of Europe
where Belgium, the Netherlands, and
Germany meet. Of these adept guards,
only the malleable German Shepherd has
gone on to achieve worldwide stardom.
Today, it is matched in numbers only by
the Labrador Retriever, with the Golden
Retriever set to join them as top dog
within a decade.

The indigenous spitz dogs of Siberia were
first selectively bred in the 19th century,
and remain genetically close to the wolf.
In the mid-20th century, the biologist 
K.G. Abramov wrote the first breed
standard for the Vostochno-Sibirskaia
Laika, encompassing both the lighter dogs
used for pulling sleds and more powerful
individuals used for hunting large game.
Some variation remains in the breed
today, which is defined as much by
its working abilities as its appearance,
but it is essentially a large,
strong dog with a dense
double coat. This breed 
is calm and even-tempered,
and makes a good companion,
even in the city. It can also be
trained in obedience.

West Siberian Laika.
It has been used
mainly for hunting
large game, such as
elks, reindeers, and
bears, but can also
be trained to hunt
small game, and makes a fine sled dog. 
It originated in the Khantu and Mansi
areas of Russia as two slightly different
types of dog: the former sturdier, the latter
speedier. Both variations still exist today,
with performance in field trials being
rated as important as appearance in 
the breed standard. A good guard and
hunting dog, this breed does not adapt

Laika, meaning “barker”, was
once a name for all the athletic,
fearless spitz-type dogs renowned
for hunting, guarding, and sled-
pulling in Russia. From the mid-
20th century, the Soviet authorities,
who annexed the Finnish area of
Karelia as part of the Soviet Union,
developed this regional type into 
a breed, the Russko-Europiskaia
Laika, also called the Karelian 
Bear Laika. Originally, wolf-grey
coats similar to the Siberian Laikas
predominated, but the black-and-
white pattern is now the only one
allowed. Early crosses with the
(possibly mythical) Utchak Sheepdog
may have given this breed its fierce
nature, making it an ideal working
dog but unsuitable as a companion.

Siberian or Arctic Huskies were used 
for centuries to pull sleds by the Chukchi
and possibly the Koryak and Kamchadal
peoples of Siberia. Genetically close to
the wolf, they seldom bark but howl as 
a pack. Fur traders first brought them to
Alaska in 1909, and continued for the next
two decades until the Soviet Union closed
the border in 1930. Siberian Huskies were
used for draught work, but also excelled 
in racing, being smaller and lighter than
other dogs then in general use. The breed’s
hour of glory came in 1925, when it helped
carry diphtheria serum across Alaska in
record time in the “Great Race of Mercy”,
saving the city of Nome from an epidemic.
Ideally suited to long-distance endurance
work, they are still used for sledding, as
well as in the newer sports of skijoring and
ski-pulka, in which they pull a skier wearing
a special harness. Bred as pack animals,
they need lavish amounts of company and
activity, and make fine, gentle companions.

Outside English-speaking
countries, this breed is known
by the name of Jämthund, after
its native region of northern
Sweden. At one time, virtually every
valley in Scandinavia had its own
variety of elkhound. The Swedish
Elkhound became the national breed. 
The Swedish Elkhound probably started
its existence hunting bears, but it became
a successful hunter of lynx, wolves, and
moose, running its prey to a standstill and
then guarding it until the hunter caught up.
This versatile breed has also done service
as a herder, watchdog, sled dog, and
military dog. A good companion
breed, it is popular in Britain, the

Spitzes probably arrived in
Germany over 1,000 years ago,

Once there were many spitz breeds 
in Germany, and different colours were
associated with different regions. Today,
all are increasingly rare. The German
Wolfspitz, also called the Chien Loup, 
is an outgoing companion dog, but it does
have a tendency to nip. Although not an

barges, and were also used as guards
and vermin hunters. In the 20th

for fighting, and when this sport declined
it was used for hunting. By the 1930s, its

provoked the formation of the Society
for the Preservation of Japanese
Breeds to save it. Today it is kept

Although a lively

a placid and retiring

HUNGARIAN GREYHOUND
An indigenous sight hound of the Indian
subcontinent, this breed is named after
the state of Rampur, where it probably
originated. English Greyhound blood was
introduced in the 1800s, considerably
altering the breed’s form. Along with the
Rampur, two other distinct sight-hound
breeds remain today: the Banjara and the
Mahratta Greyhound. Rarely seen outside
India, the powerful Rampur Greyhound
is an instinctive courser, seldom kept as a
companion and unsuitable for urban living.

This lean, racy hound, also known as
the Arabian Greyhound, originated in
North Africa, although it is probable
that nomadic Arab tribes brought its
ancestors there over 1,000 years ago. 
In the desert environment, the Sloughi’s
sand-coloured coat provided perfect
camouflage when hunting hares, gazelles,
and Fennec foxes. It was more than just 
a hunting dog, however, and was treated
very much as a member of the family. 
It makes a quiet, dignified companion,
but is a little too highly strung for some
family households. A naturally vigilant
breed, this dog can react aggressively 
to strangers. Sloughis have tremendous
stamina, and need plenty of exercise.

Also known simply as the Staghound, 
this dog is not recognized by any registry,
but has been bred selectively for as long 
as many “official” breeds. The name
“Staghound” is misleading. Pioneers in
the American West needed dogs that
could tackle wolves and Coyotes, 
and this dog was the answer, developed
from the Scottish Deerhound (see p.245),
Irish Wolfhound (see p.245), and English
Greyhound (see p.166). It has speed,
stamina, and strength, together with an
irrepressible urge to hunt, and, although
relaxed with other dogs, it cannot be
trusted around other small pets. It is now

is historically a dog of crosses, with each
new generation a new cross of greyhounds
and collies or terriers. Today, Lurchers 
are bred to Lurchers, but many coursing
competitors are still first-generation
crosses. Their distinguishing
characteristics are lightning speed,
boundless energy, and an unstoppable
urge to chase and kill small game. Although
not suited to confined city living, it makes
a fine, non-aggressive family pet for those
who can keep up with it.

In Britain and Ireland, the alert and versatile
Lurcher is associated with Romany people
(Gypsies). Its name may come from lur, the
Romany word for thief, because of its fame as 
a poacher’s dog. The short-haired Lurcher was
historically more prized than the long-haired,
its greyhound ancestry providing a useful
turn of speed for rabbit and hare poaching.

The ancestors of this lithe, finely

Ibiza in the Balearic Islands

Ca Eibisenc, Podenco Ibicenco, and

They are somewhat reserved with strangers,

As hunting dogs, used for coursing or

Shorter in height than the Nivernais, this ancient breed
descends from the Fauve de Bretagne. Brittany farmers
once used this strongly built dog to track wolves. In the

The rough-coated, long-legged
French hounds probably descend
from crosses between greyhounds.
The word “griffon” comes from the
old French word greffier or clerk, as
one of the first breeders of griffons
was clerk to the French monarchy.
These breeds are all larger than
the French basset griffons
(see pp.110–111). Jan van

griffon-type dog in this 1434

Medieval France was at the forefront of developing an
enormous variety of large scent hounds, with vast packs
hunting through the parks and forests of the King and

BASSET HOUND
Short but massive, the Basset
(from the French word bas for
low) is a hound once used to
hunt in packs. Originating in
France and possibly descended
from dwarfed Bloodhounds, selective
breeding shortened the legs so that human
hunters could keep pace. They are mild and
affectionate by nature, with tuneful voices.
It may be the hound described by
Shakespeare in A Midsummer Night’s Dream:
“their heads are hung/With ears that
sweep away the morning dew/Crook-
knee’d, and dew-lapp’d like Thessalian
bulls”. This singular appearance has a
practical function: the long ears sweep 
the ground, stirring up scent on a trail,
while splayed feet give stability. Lighter
examples still take part in field trials, but
the majority of Bassets are now to be found
lounging langorously in family homes.
Exaggerated breeding for excessively long
backs and ears has, to some extent, been
reduced, but there is still a higher-than-
average incidence of back pain and
irritating eye conditions. Paw problems
are also common in older individuals.

has also become a
success across the
Atlantic. These dogs
have even been used

drawback with breeds

AMERICAN COONHOUNDS
The Coonhounds, descended from large French, Irish,
and English hounds, are among the world’s more
specialized breeds. They vocally follow the scent trail
of a raccoon or opossum until their quarry is cornered
up a tree and then change the tone of their baying
voice to one that the hunter recognizes as “It’s here!”

The Redbone is named not after its colour

As with all the coonhounds, this makes 
a gentle and affectionate companion

BLUETICK COONHOUND
This dog’s elegant coat, which technically is tricolour,

frequent participants in licensed night trials where,
over three hours, teams of three to four coonhounds
track and tree raccoons. Points are lost for treeing the
wrong game. Males can be double the size of females.

TREEING WALKER COONHOUND
Most similar in looks to the English
Foxhound, this breed is named after
Thomas Walker who imported English

task of “treeing” involves confining
an opossum or raccoon to a tree,
then altering its howl, telling the
hunter that game is
cornered. As do all
coonhounds, this
makes an elegant
family companion
when raised from
puppyhood in a

American coonhounds, its
ancestors were German hounds, and 
it has an unusual high-pitched voice. In

Kept primarily as a hunting dog rather
than for companionship, this Norwegian
hare hunter is named after its first breeder.
It was developed from local hounds crossed
with imports from the German–Danish
border region. It makes a reliable watchdog,
gets on moderately well with other dogs,
needs vigorous exercise, and has a tendency
to snap or bite. It is not a city dog, and
when the weather permits, it is content to
live outdoors, although it is a

This breed takes its name
from its place of origin,
near Halden, in southern Norway.
Remaining relatively obscure, even 
in Scandinavia, it is a young breed,
created in the early 20th century from
crosses of English Foxhounds and local
hounds, and was recognized in 1950. Like
other Norwegian hounds, it was developed
to hunt singly with its owner rather than
in a pack. It is a calm and friendly breed
that thrives on human companionship.

TRACKER, GUNDOG, AND COMPANION
Although there have been hunting hounds
of this kind in Sweden since the Middle
Ages, this breed was first shown in only
1886. It can be traced back to crosses of
Swedish hounds with English Foxhounds
and German Beagles. These crosses were
made by Adolf Patrick Hamilton, the
founder of the Swedish Kennel Club. 
The Hamiltonstövare is one of the most
populous breeds in Sweden, used singly
rather than as a pack hunter for tracking
and flushing hares and foxes. It is even-
tempered and reliable around children
and other dogs, and it has gained 
a foothold as a companion 
breed in Britain.

SEGUGIO ITALIANO
The Segugio, or Italian Hound, has the

legacy of cross-breeding with mastiffs.
The result is a wonderfully versatile
breed, single-minded in pursuit of
a scent, but also keen to capture and 
kill the prey. In addition, it makes a
beautiful dog. Reliable and affectionate,
this breed is a fine companion, although
it needs plenty of physical activity.

hounds on the Iberian peninsula. It is 
a tracker of great stamina that thrives 
on hard work and is used alone, rather
than in packs. Also known as the
Spanish Hound, sizes of the breed
vary considerably; a smaller
variant, the Lebrero, is now
virtually extinct. It does not
make an ideal companion, as
it can be troublesome around
unfamiliar dogs. As with all
breeds of dog, however, early
socialization diminishes this
potential concern.

1,000 years in the region, it nearly died out
during World War II. Worse was to come
when, in 1947, the dogs were exterminated

survivors in Slovakia and Hungary, and
breeders in these countries are

Probably the world’s most numerous
breed of dog, all of today’s millions of
German Shepherd Dogs descend from 
a small population of working shepherd
dogs from northwest Germany. Only 
a hundred years ago, there was a great
variety of coat types and body shapes
among shepherd dogs in northern
Germany. A retired German cavalry
officer, Max von Stephanitz, was 
to change that. With a stockman’s
keen eye and an entrepreneur’s
confidence, he purchased a local
shepherd dog, and, with the help 
of a colleague, set up the German
Shepherd Club (Verein für Deutsche
Schäferhunde, or SV), registering
the world’s first German Shepherd.
Von Stephanitz was a superb
publicist. When the Great War
broke out in 1914, he offered some
of his dogs for military service, and 
by the end of the war, 48,000 had
served in Germany’s armed forces.

line layers, and scouts was noted by Allied
troops, and soldiers returning to Britain
and North America took German
Shepherds with them. The reputation of
the breed was enhanced further through
Hollywood films such as Strongheart. Already
the most popular breed in Germany, by the
1950s, the TV series The Adventures of Rin
Tin Tin had made it one of the most prized
dogs in North America and the UK.
THE BERGER BLANC SUISSE, OR WHITE SHEPHERD
The colour white is “undesirable” according to UK standards, but
downright “verboten” in the United States, where dogs of that colour 
are disqualified from the show ring. Nevertheless, creamy-white pups are
not rare in German Shepherd litters. In 2002, Swiss breeders sought and
achieved recognition from the FCI for a “new” breed, the Berger Blanc
Suisse. This breed is also recognized by one of the American canine
registries, the United Kennel Club, as the White Shepherd. Elsewhere, 
it is still simply a German Shepherd Dog (white).
By the early 1970s, there were well over 
a million German Shepherds in the United
States alone, with over 100,000 registered
there annually. However, breeding was no
longer in the hands of dedicated people
who bred for reliable character and sound
health. The virtues and soundness of the
breed started to decline, and so too did its
numbers. In the press it became a “devil
dog”. But the problem of aggression in the
breed was never a genetic problem; it was
a social phenomenon. Today, the German
Shepherd is acknowledged as the world’s
most successful police and military dog. 
This is a strong, agile, and ever-alert dog,
friendly within a family, but often cautious
with strangers. With its rhythmic gait, it is
an all-round action dog that participates
in herding and tracking and excels at agility
and obedience. German Shepherds shed
hair profusely. Sadly, they may also suffer
from medical problems, including chronic
degenerative radiculomyelopathy (CDRM)
and hip dysplasia, causing incurable
progressive loss of use of the hind limbs.

When British soldiers brought German Shepherds to
the UK after World War I, anti-German feeling was still
intense. Breeders decided it would be diplomatic to
rename the breed after the province of Alsace, which
was German until the war but is now part of France.
Enmity towards Germany continued and it was not
until the late 1970s that British breeders recognized
the breed by the name used worldwide and re-named
their club The German Shepherd Dog (Alsatian) Club.

feeding habits led to a waning in popularity,
but it regained some ground as a butcher’s

suitable for a household with other dogs in

The first mention of the “Hofwarth”, an

century, a group of breeders decided to

from the Black Forest and Harz mountain
regions. These may have been crossed with
the Hungarian Kuvasz, Newfoundland,
and the German Shepherd. The elegant

BELGIAN SHEPHERDS
Classifying the Belgian Shepherds is not
easy because national kennel clubs cannot
agree on how to name them. In 1891,
Professor Adolphe Reul, of the Belgian
School of Veterinary Science, conducted
a field study of all the existing sheepdogs
in Belgium. Eventually, four different
breeds came to be recognized nationally.
In many countries, these are classified as
varieties of one breed, namely the Belgian
Shepherd. In the United States, however,
the Groenendael is the Belgian Shepherd,
while the Malinois and Tervueren are
recognized separately, and the Laekenois
not at all. These dogs are all similar in
type, differing only in terms of their
coloration and coat length. Not naturally
aggressive, the Belgian Shepherds are
excellent family companions, although
they can be wary of strangers and timid. 
From the Malines region of Belgium,
the Malinois is one of the least common
of the Belgian shepherds. It is, however,
the first to have a written breed standard,
and the closest in conformation to the
German Shepherd Dog and the Smooth-
haired Dutch Shepherd (see pp.186–189
and p.191). The Malinois is both a highly
successful scent detector and police dog.
Enduring stamina
While many breeds thrive on physical
activity, Belgian Shepherds such as
this Malinois have enormous energy
and endurance, whether at play, in
the agility ring, or in police work.

MULTI-PURPOSE DOGS
Regardless of coat length or texture (revealed by 
recent studies as the only significant genetic
difference between these four breeds), Belgian
Shepherds are champion multi-taskers. Some
individuals thrive in the obedience ring, while
others are champions in the agility field. A
Belgian Shepherd may be superb at Flyball and
equally adept at moving sheep; a star in the
show ring and at the same time a vigilant
home companion. With these all-round qualities,
its worldwide popularity is unsurprising.
The breeding of the Groenendael began
in about 1890, almost by chance. Nicholas
Rose, the owner of the Belgian Café du
Groenendael, bred a black puppy, and
obtained another. This pair formed the
basis of the distinctive, long-haired breed. 
The shaggy, rustic-looking Laekenois 
is the rarest of the Belgian Shepherds. A
favourite of Queen Henrietta of Belgium,
it acquired its name from the Château de
Laeken, a residence she frequently visited.
It is fairly easy to obedience train and a
superb companion, and therefore hard 
to explain why it is not more popular.
The Tervueren is accorded separate
breed status, although Groenendael
matings occasionally produce Tervueren
puppies. This variety of Belgian Shepherd
has become enormously popular as a drug-
detecting dog. Easy to train, it is equally
successful on the agility trials circuit.

Picardy has been a cruel place for dogs in
the 20th century. Trench warfare in the
region in World War I diminished numbers,
and the ravages of World War II drove the
breed to near extinction. Because it has
never gained popularity on the show
circuit, the Berger Picard survives
primarily on farms in northeastern
France. Its thick, weatherproof coat
is ideal for the damp climate, while
the ease with which it can be
obedience trained and its natural
inclination to herd and guard
sheep make it a reliable but
underestimated breed,
unfortunately on the

Bouviers are cattle-herding dogs, and there
was once a wide range of these across
Belgium. The Bouvier des Flandres is the
best known of the three surviving breeds,
with the Bouvier des Ardennes still very
rare, and Bouvier de Roulers on the verge
of extinction. The muscular Bouvier des
Flandres does not resemble either of the
other two, which are far more rangy, and
may have been created from crosses of the
old-type Beauceron and griffons. It was
used in the medical corps of the French
Army during World War I, and numbers
were very low afterwards. The intervention
of the Belgian Kennel Club saved the breed,
which is now popular as a companion in
several countries, particularly the United
States. It is generally amiable, but its
aggressive side can come out around other
dogs, and it makes a good guard dog. The
distinctive, rough double coat and beard
need a lot of attention and regular clipping.

guardian for centuries, becoming more
widely popular in the latter part of the
19th century, and is one of France’s most
popular companion breeds today. Used 
by the French army in World War I, it was
taken to the United States by returning
soldiers, but took 50 years to become
established there. Breeders have
worked to eliminate shyness and
aggression, and the best Briards
make lively but well-mannered
companions and guard dogs.

Originating in the region of the town 
of Castro Laboreiro, the Cão de Castro
Laboreiro, as it is called 
in Portugal, is a natural
guardian, used to a more
limited extent to herd
sheep and cattle. 
The breed is inclined
to give its opinion
through its voice, a deep
growl proceeding to sharp,
threatening barking. This
sentinel behaviour makes it an
equally good watchdog. Rarely
seen outside its native land, it is
typical of the livestock guardians
that exist in the Iberian peninsula
and the Balkans, and these dogs
willingly use threatening behaviour
to intimidate predators, including
people. A rugged, powerful dog, it
requires experienced, firm handling.

This breed originated in Scotland as a

Queen Victoria acquired a Rough Collie

Smooth Collies traceable back to Trefoil,

Sheepdogs (see p.132). It almost died out,

England. Selective breeding for showing

The tallest of the flat-faced (brachycephalic)
breeds, Boxers are dogs that never grow up.
Ever. They are bouncy, energetic, fearless
risk-takers, although males can be wary and
circumspect with strangers. The typical
Boxer’s mantra is “All I wanna do is have
fun.” This is a breed for active families.
They make superb companions for young
children because they are, in thought and
action, similar to perpetual three-year-old
kids. Although the breed’s muscularity,
size, and intimidating appearance suits 
it to a role as house protector, these dogs
are unfailingly gentle with children.
Boxers were first developed in Germany,
probably from the Brabant Bullenbeisser
(bullbiter) from Belgium and similar dogs
from the Danzig region. Bavarian breeds
and perhaps even the English Bulldog
may have been used in its original
development. By the turn of the 20th
century, they were essentially as they are
today. No one knows exactly how the
name “Boxer” developed. 
Unfortunately, there are serious health
problems within the breed and these lead
to a shorter-than-average life expectancy.

WHITE BOXERS
There have been white Boxers since the breed was
first developed. It was not until 1925, when the German
Boxer club banned their registration, that other clubs
moved to reduce the numbers of white individuals.
Today, in many countries white pups may be registered
but may not be shown: in the United States, Boxers
with more than one-third of their body covered in white
are not eligible for showing. Sadly, mostly or wholly
white individuals are also more prone to deafness.

Boxers aren’t commonly associated

In some countries tails are still amputated,

heart condition causing a ballooning of the
lower chambers, a “dilated cardiomyopathy”,
is regrettably all too common.

NEW ZEALAND HUNTAWAY
This curious breed is not recognized 
by any registry, and has a very variable
appearance, because it is defined
by a single trait: its ability 
to herd sheep using its voice. The original
sheepdogs exported from Britain to New
Zealand had been bred to work silently,
but some breeders decided to develop
those that did bark into a new breed. 
The field trials were called huntaways,
giving rise to the breed’s name. The result
is a healthy, highly responsive dog that
can be trained to bark or not bark 
on command, which has been
exported back to Britain and 
is used in field trials or as

Perhaps because of this prosaic
background, it did not receive the

made a concerted effort to save it.
Since then the breed has become
popular in Great Britain, and as a

in the heat. A steady, affectionate,
and active breed, even tempered
unless provoked, it makes a vocal
watchdog and a fine companion 
for those who can keep up with it.
DEDICATED TRAINING
As with virtually all the Nordic spitz breeds, the
Buhund requires patient training to create a reliably
obedient companion. Even so, its chasing instinct
remains powerful, and given the opportunity it will
chase livestock. Unlike the Border Collie, the Buhund’s
primary goal is to please itself rather than to please
the farmer, or the pet owner for that matter. This
is not an affection-demanding dog, nor is it
one that slavishly worships its handler.

DOBERMANN
One of the best-known German breeds,
the Dobermann was the creation of Louis
Dobermann, a tax collector who often
had to carry money through risky areas
and wanted a dog to accompany him.
He used the Weimaraner, Manchester
Terrier, Rottweiler, German Pinscher,
and English Greyhound to produce a
loyal, alert bodyguard that is fearless and
resourceful in combat. The breed was an
instant success when it was first shown in
1876, and has since become established
across Europe and also in North America,
where it is called the Doberman Pinscher
and is usually seen with
cropped ears. 
Its popularity as 
a guard dog has not
always helped this sleek
breed. Unscrupulous
breeders have produced
strains given to nervousness
and fear biting, and
careless owners looking
only for a guard have not
always socialized their dogs adequately.
However, a Dobermann from a good
breeder, integrated into the household,
makes a fine companion.

This breed’s distinguishing ridge
of hair growing forwards along the
spine is unique among recognized breeds.
Dogs with this characteristic were kept as
companions and used for hunting by the
Khoikhoi of southern Africa. In the 19th
century, they interbred with the Dutch and
German mastiffs and scent hounds of the
settlers, and the best attributes of five
existing dogs were combined into a breed
standard at a meeting of breeders in 1922.
The Rhodesian Ridgeback was used in
“lion country” in Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe,
and was once called the African Lion
Hound. It was never used to attack lions,
but as a scent hound to bring game to the
hunter’s attention, although its size and
strength did offer hunters some protection
should they suddenly find themselves the
prey. Today, the breed is more often found
as a guard dog or companion; males need
an experienced hand at home.

STANDARD POODLE
Don’t let those frivolous cuts deceive you.
The Poodle has acquired the unfortunate
image of an over-groomed fashion
accessory, but the breed’s names and its
modern temperament tell a different story.
Poodle probably comes from the old low
German pudeln, to paddle or splash, and
the French name of Caniche means “duck
dog”. This is a retrieving dog bred to work
in water, and the elaborate “lion” clip of
the coat was originally created to reduce
water resistance, while still affording some
insulation against cold water around the
chest and the joints in the legs. 
Although some registries regard this
breed’s home as France, where it is held in
great affection and also called the Barbone,
the evidence points to these curly-coated
dogs originating in Germany in the Middle
Ages and then influencing French breeds
such as the Barbet, rather than the other
way round. The Standard Poodle scores
consistently high in canine “intelligence”
tests, is amenable to training, good-
tempered around children, and is still 
a working dog underneath it all. This breed
is remarkably healthy. The only significant
condition Poodles suffer from more than
other dogs is the skin complaint sebaceous
adenitis, which can be mistaken for allergy
or other skin diseases. Stomach bloat, hip
dysplasia, and various late-onset cancers
are also potential concerns, but remain
relatively rare. This is a superb breed, one
of the best for urban or rural families.

as a carriage dog because of its unique
willingness to walk or run beside carriages,
clearing a way in populated areas. Today,
it is a popular companion breed, in part
due to its literary and cinematic fame,
although owners must remember that 
the Dalmatian loves to run, and run, and
run. Males are sometimes aggressive with
other male dogs, and deafness affects
some individuals of either sex.

COACH DOGS
In the 1800s, in Europe and especially in Britain, it was
the fashion for the carriages of the aristocracy to have
“coach dogs” running alongside. Although their original
purpose was probably to protect the occupants against
highwaymen, they undoubtedly served a decorative
purpose, and Dalmatians were in demand because 
of their eye-catching coat. This wood engraving from
1807 shows the custom’s popularity in England.

breed due its affectionate temperament,
and adapts very well to family life. Some
breeders wish to produce a smaller size,
but it is not yet a “designer” dog.
SEARCH AND RESCUE
A highly versatile breed, the tough and resourceful
Australian Shepherd has branched out from its farming
roots into a variety of new roles. Obedient and trainable,
and well-adapted to a variety of weather conditions,
they make excellent search and rescue dogs, working
with a handler to locate missing persons. Search and
rescue organizations exist all over the world, often
relying on voluntary funding and groups of dedicated
individuals, who are involved not only in searches but
in training the dogs. Exercises where a dog and
handler track down a “missing” person who is hiding
develop the dog’s finding capabilities, which will be
tested in real emergency situations, and cater to this
energetic breed’s demands for constructive activity.

but in all other ways it lives up to the

Old English Broken-haired Terrier with
the Otterhound, creating a tough, versatile

the Waterside Terrier, and is often referred
to as the King of Terriers. Used as a vermin
hunter, messenger, sentry, and police dog,

Pit fighting, where two dogs are set against each other

event, spectators would cheer on their chosen animal
and place bets on the outcome, as shown in this 1821
illustration of a scene at the Westminster Pit, London.
Banned in Britain in 1835, this cruel “sport” is illegal in

Labradors love the world and everything
in it, especially food. And water. This
gloriously happy, extrovert dog is the 
UK’s and North America’s overwhelmingly
favourite breed, outdistancing the next
favourites, Golden Retrievers and German
Shepherds, by three to one. The breed’s
distant origins are uncertain but it is known
that dogs reached Newfoundland – either
with Portuguese and Basque fishermen, 
or even earlier with Norse explorers – and
were there when the first Irish and English
fishing boats arrived in the 1500s. By the
1700s, there were two types of working dogs
on that isolated province off Canada’s east
coast, a heavy draft dog called the Greater
St John’s Dog, which became the relaxed
Newfoundland, and a smaller, smooth-
coated, black dog, the Lesser St John’s Dog,
adept at retrieving from land and water.
Some of these smaller dogs were exported
COAT COLOURS – GENETICS
Yellow can vary from light cream to fox red, while
chocolate or liver-coloured Labs range from a light milk
chocolate to deep cooking chocolate in colour. Some
yellow Labradors have black noses while others have
liver-coloured noses, a visual clue that they carry the
gene for potentially chocolate coloured pups. Advances
in genetics have revealed that a Labrador carries one of
nine possible colour genotypes, which can be tested for
with a mouth swab. By knowing a mated pair’s colour
genotypes it’s possible to predict whether the pups will
be all black, all yellow, all chocolate, or mixtures.

Breeders report that while it is superbly easy to obedience
train and is reliable with strangers, the yellow Labrador

inherited and painful hip and elbow
dysplasias are common. Labs used for
breeding should have their joints checked
by a certification programme. Eyes should
be checked for signs of progressive retinal
atrophy (PRA) and hereditary cataracts.
The most common problem, however, 
is the Labrador’s eating habits. Without
providing only calorie-controlled portions,
these slothful dogs instantly go to fat. 
WATER BABY
The thick coat has silicone-like imperviousness to water
and can shed brambles and burrs, while the dog’s “otter
tail” acts as a superb rudder, making this an excellent
swimmer. A newspaper report recounted how a young
Lab fell from a moving boat and was eventually seen
swimming ashore 12 miles away. When approached,
all it wanted to do was play in the water. If ever there
was a dog that wanted to be an otter, this is it.

to England, where they were bought by
wealthy estate owners. The third Earl of
Malmesbury was the first person to use
the name Labrador to describe these dogs. 
In the 1950s the Labrador was still a
country estate dog. It rocketed to its present
unassailable position of popularity for one
simple reason: its endearing personality.
With an overwhelming need to carry things,
a toy or preferably your dirty socks, and an
enormous generosity of spirit, it is almost
a cartoon of the ideal family companion.
Labradors thrive on many different
activities – walking, jogging, hiking, but
also dozing in front of a warm fireplace.
Enthusiastic water workers, they will find
a puddle in which to splash around in the
driest of locales. They excel at mountain
and avalanche search and rescue and are
the breed of choice with many charities
that train dogs for blind people. They are
also among the most popular breeds used
in “pets as therapy” schemes.
As with any breed, there are drawbacks.
Although this is a breed devoid of spite 
or malice or vindictiveness, it can wreak
havoc. Lab pups are clumsy, uncoordinated
bundles of enthusiasm. Their powerful
and gaily flamboyant tails are weapons of
sweeping destruction. Puppyhood lasts a
long time: Labs don’t emotionally mature
until two, even three years of age. Sadly,

and Cowslip. Their descendants, and in
particular Cowslip’s, are the ancestors of
all Golden Retrievers. Lord Tweedmouth
did what is virtually impossible to do today.
He introduced occasional outcrosses with
other breeds into his breeding programme:
Flat-coated retrievers, an Irish Setter for
colour, even a tan-coloured Bloodhound
for improved tracking skills. Initially, his
breed was classified under “Flat
Coats – Golden” but later
acquired its own name.
In the US, the breed
standard calls for “rich,
lustrous golden” while
in the UK, golden or
cream colours are accepted.
This has led to the emergence
of strikingly different-looking
dogs on either side of the
Atlantic. In Britain, smaller
working lines have diverged
from the more common show
lines of dogs. Regardless of looks,
however, the temperament is the
same: sensitive, devoted, sociable,
obedient, with an intense desire
to please and an almost obsessive
compulsion to carry something
in their mouths. As with all
dogs bred for retrieving
waterfowl, these mouths
are gentle, and the patient
Golden Retriever will rarely snap
and is especially reliable with children.
(These retrievers are also surprisingly vocal,
but as far as watchdog value is concerned
they may bark momentarily before gleefully
watching a burglar strip your house.) 
Their affability, responsiveness, and
eager desire to please has resulted in them
becoming the top choice as assistance dogs
for people in wheelchairs, as therapy 
dogs for visits to hospitals, as guide dogs
for blind people, as well as superb police
or mountain search and rescue work dogs.
They are also used for drug and ordnance
detecting. Popularity, with its accompanying
intensive selective breeding, does bring
problems. Skin and gastrointestinal allergies
are increasingly common and, surprisingly,
possessive aggression over food and toys
occurs at a greater frequency than average
in dogs. X-raying hips for dysplasia is 
still vital in breeding programmes.

Once called the “Modder

in Gaelic, the sheen and
lustre of this handsome dog’s
coat is the envy of many human
redheads. Irish Setters like to party.
They are racy and can be rather
rambunctious. They mature late,
at over three years of age, and
this probably accounts for
their reputation as flighty,
exuberant extroverts. Under
the joyous exterior remains a
hidden setter, and while it is now kept only
as a family companion, it retains its natural
abilities to set game. Fast and active, 
it thrives on canine company.
Working Irish Setters were once
chestnut and white as well as solid
chestnut; the latter is the more popular.
Because of this, red-and-white coloured
Irish Setters declined to near extinction,
but in recent years this colour has
been rescued. The Red-and-white

chestnut cousins, and often needs
extra time spent on socializing
and early training. Like all deep-

No longer commonly worked as a gundog, this breed retains
the serious personality of a dog bred to behave unnaturally: to
track and locate its quarry and then simply freeze, historically

allowing the hunter to shoot. The English
Pointer has a kindly and biddable,
although sometimes rather sensitive,

POINTING
When pointers scent or sight game they “strike a
pose”, pointing rigidly in the direction of the quarry.
On the hunter’s command they “flush”, scaring the
game out of hiding, and then after the hunter has shot
the game, retrieve it from land or water. This pointer
(a Vizsla) is pointing in the direction of its prey and 
is close enough for the hunter to see the quarry.

Until the early 1800s, German pointers
were rather stocky in build. Crossing with
English Pointers produced a lighter, more
athletic physique with powerful muscling.
They make superb trackers and retrievers,
and will retrieve game and vermin such 
as raccoon dogs, in Eastern Europe, and
foxes. Some are trained to retrieve deer-
and elk- antler racks, now a valued find in
the forest. The German Short-hair

This dog’s ancestry in scent
hounds is apparent in its
pendulous ears and lips,
heavy rolls of skin, and
heavier bone structure
than other pointers.
(This is what
German Pointers looked like until the
early 1800s.) Today’s Spanish Pointer was
created by crossing old, even heavier-
boned breeds like the Perdiguero Navarro,
with lighter-boned pointers. Once used 
to hunt large quarry such as deer, like its
Portuguese compatriot, its primary quarry
is now hares and partridge. This dog is as
content in water as on land and is an easy-
going, reliable companion for a family
with children. Droopy facial skin can

Hunting in the rough terrain of the
Pyrenees mountains called for a dog with
shorter legs than other French pointers.
This breed has legs that are 10cm (4in)
shorter than its Gascony relatives. Rarely
seen outside southern France, this dog’s
shorter limbs allow it to stand on its hind
legs while sniffing the air for the scent.
As with the other French pointers, it has
an equable temperament, a responsiveness
to obedience training, and a desire to pass
time with its human family. Enthusiastic
when working, off-duty it is happy to relax.
FRENCH POINTERS
While British nobility preferred dogs that “set”, meaning
that the dogs sat and waited when they found game,
their French counterparts favoured pointers, dogs that
froze in a pointing pose when scenting or sighting game.
Pointers were worked wherever men hunted, but war
and revolution diminished both their variety and numbers.
Today, only these four breeds survive in France.

Intentionally decimated after
the French Revolution, the

breeding with English and
French Gascony Pointers.
Today, while some
continue to work,
the majority are delightful companions,
perhaps slightly tentative by nature, but
trustworthy within families with young
children and very easy to obedience train.
This pointer has existed in Bourbonnais
since at least the late 1500s. The shortest
of the French pointers, it is also the most
relaxed and confident in temperament.
It is not uncommon for pups to be born

particular, because of their strength 
of body and personality, are best raised

EXTRA-LARGE DOGS
40KG (88LB) PLUS
Early in the history of the dog’s domestication, breeders selectively
bred the largest of individuals, creating mastiffs, the giants of the dog
world. The genes of these ancient breeds live on in nearly all of
today’s largest dogs. Physically breathtaking in size, mastiffs and
related giants are generally easy-going in nature. 
Komondor in command
The Komondor is well suited to its
traditional role of guarding flocks. 
Its coat helps it to blend in
with the sheep it protects.
To the rescue…
The St Bernard, celebrated for its mountain-
rescue ability, was first bred for draught work,
hauling, and to make trails through fresh snow.
Swiss role
Perhaps typifying what most people picture when
they think of an extra-large dog, the St Bernard is 
certainly a breed of imposing proportions. Tall, broad,
and massively boned, it is a true gentle giant.
A BIG HELP
In ancient times,
adaptable, heavyweight
mastiff breeds acted as
weapons of war, to guard
livestock and property, and
as fighting dogs. The
Chinese and Babylonians
used dogs in battle. So, too,
did Alexander the Great. Later, mastiffs
accompanied invaders and migrants as
they moved from Asia into Europe.
When the Europeans moved on to the
Americas, they took their mastiffs – not
as dogs of war, but as dogs used to
intimidate both slaves and the native
peoples encountered by the Europeans. 
Giant breeds remain at work today. 
In most mountainous regions of Europe,
breeds were developed to protect livestock
from predators. And if it wasn’t for the
strength and warmth of huge breeds
such as the Canadian Eskimo Dog and
the Alaskan Malamute, the native peoples
of these bitterly cold regions would never
have survived. Another Goliath of a dog,
the Komondor, has been exported to
North America, where it protects sheep
from Coyote predation, and to Namibia
to guard farmers’ livestock from lions.
Mastiffs today are also involved in dog
fighting. Breeds including the Brazilian
and Argentinean mastiffs and the Italian
Cane Corso are still used in their own
countries and others to satisfy the needs of
those who enjoy this
“sport”. In 
the extra-large
category of breeds
exists one small anomaly. Geneticists say
that Switzerland’s greatest canine export,
the life-saving St Bernard, descends from
(or is a progenitor of) herding breeds
rather than a member of the mastiff
family. Purists can be assured, however,
that the Newfoundland, that other life-
saving breed, is a true genetic mastiff.

ALASKAN MALAMUTE
The largest of all the Nordic breeds, the
Alaskan Malamute has been a favourite
family companion for generations in
North America. It is named after the
Mahlemut Inuit people from the western
coastal regions of Alaska and, like the
Canadian Eskimo Dog, was used as a
draught animal, pulling sleds, long before
Europeans visited North America.
Selective breeding for companionship
successfully reduced the breed’s natural
inclination to establish a pack hierarchy
and increased its willingness to engage
with people. As with all of the Nordic
breeds, this is not an overly demonstrative
dog, but when raised in a family with
children it is a wonderful participant in
family activities. It is also a great athlete,
excelling at sled-racing, where only the
smaller Siberian Husky is more popular.
Although most prevalent in North
America, Malamutes are now ubiquitous
around the world, with breed clubs in
regions as diverse as Italy and Korea.

well in excess of double that size. Indeed,
the people of Arctic Canada, the Inuit,
have survived in that harsh climate for
over a thousand years only because of the
versatility of this large, hard-working but

The endurance of these powerful dogs is phenomenal,

numbered around 20,000, and all Inuit
used to keep a sled dog. However, the
introduction of the snowmobile brought
this breed to near extinction. By the early
1970s, with numbers reduced to fewer
than 200, a breeding programme was
initiated. Today, the Canadian Eskimo
Dog is still endangered, with numbers in
the low hundreds. This is the great husky
as it was described in Jack London’s stories.
Recreational activity
Dog-sledding as a winter tourist activity 
is increasingly popular in Canada. This new 
use will hopefully ensure the breed’s survival.

trailing abilities, made possible by their
vast nasal membrane. Indeed, the surface
area of this membrane is greater than the

The mother of all mastiffs, this Tibetan
dog was rescued from oblivion by British
breeders in the late 1800s. Although its
numbers remain small, it has been popular
on European and North American dog-
show circuits ever since. It is very likely
that dogs similar to these, once used
by Tibetan nomads to protect their
homes and their flocks, provided
the root stock for all of Asia’s and
Europe’s giant livestock-guarding
breeds. Over a century of selective
breeding for show and companionship
has resulted in a more easy-going
temperament. Although this dog
can be a little aloof, it makes 
a good family pet in either
temperate or cold climates.
Mastiffs were being bred in Britain
over 2,000 years ago and were
prized exports to the Roman
Empire, where they were used
in both war and blood sport.
The word “mastiff ” probably
derives from the old Anglo-
Saxon word “masty”,
meaning powerful.
English court
documents from
500 years ago record the purchase of a
“masty dogge”. This giant canine needs
exceptionally experienced handling, if
only because of its size.

This unique British breed was produced by
crossing the English Mastiff with old-fashioned
Bulldogs. A powerful gamekeeper’s assistant, 
its speed and strength enabled it to chase and
subdue poachers without causing them lasting
injury. While it is roughly the same size as the
Rottweiler, its relative lack of popularity can be
attributed to its boisterous stubbornness. Head
halters work well to control the rather headstrong
behaviour of males in particular. This is a breed

Familiar in western Europe for their role

used mastiff dogs for
centuries to protect their

bold Central Asian Sheepdog has

Sredneasiatskaia Ovtcharka, smacks

rather than an Asian language word.

Kangal Dog or Karabash Dog. The breed
standard for the Anatolian Shepherd Dog
is just one of the diverse forms of Coban
Kopegi. These naturally protective and
suspicious dogs are used as guardians to
protect flocks of sheep and goats, rather
than to herd. The smaller but equally
strong-willed and independent Hellenic
Shepherd (see p.197) is no doubt closely
related, as is the smooth-haired variety 
of Central Asian Sheepdog. These powerful
dogs have not yet been bred selectively 
for companionship. With careful early
socialization they adapt to a family
environment, but they must
always be regarded 
as potentially
aggressive,
especially with
other animals.

his extended family (he may even be shorn when they
are). Later in life, when he is mature, he will naturally
protect and defend his flock from predators.

This shaggy-haired breed is a

had accompanied Merino sheep

This Turkish sheepdog, also known by 
the names of Akbas or Coban Kopegi, is
a light-coloured breed developed in western
Turkey. Like the Anatolian Shepherd Dog,
this breed is rangy in shape with a natural
dignity and calmness, qualities that make
it a superb livestock guard. Its passiveness
should not be mistaken for a feeling of
trust; it is innately suspicious of strangers
and readily attacks other animals. In the
1970s, this breed was exported to North
America, where it is successfully used to
prevent Coyote predation on sheep and
goat ranches in the Canadian and
American Rocky Mountains.

COAT CONCERNS
While this magnificently corded coat is wonderful to
behold, it can create problems for the owner and also
for the dog. Outdoors it acts like a magnet, picking up
twigs, leaves, debris, and even insects. A wet coat can
take almost a day to completely dry out. Komondors
should only be bathed when medically necessary, 
and then thoroughly dried using a hand-held drier.
KOMONDOR
251
E X T R A - L A R G E  D O G S
The largest and most unique of the
Hungarian guarding breeds, the ancestors
of the Komondor probably accompanied
the Magyar tribe from the East when they
settled in Europe over 1,000 years ago.
The breed’s name was first used almost
500 years ago, although it was not until
1910 that the Komondor was firmly
established as a modern breed.
While its coat is now
admired for its
unusual appearance,
it evolved for practical
reasons, for protection
from the elements and from the
teeth and claws of wolves and bears as 
it protected its flock. The Komondor’s
guarding abilities led to its establishment
in North America to protect sheep from
Coyote predation. Pups are raised with
sheep, move pasture with the flock, and,
as adults, are even shorn when the flock is
shorn. So effective is the breed at thwarting
Coyote attacks on sheep, some ranches in
British Columbia have eliminated livestock
loss. The coat of the working
Komondor is thick and
protective, but it 
does not develop into a show-quality coat
as illustrated here. This protective breed
needs careful obedience training, but with
early socializing, it makes a reasonable, 
if sometimes musty-odoured, companion.

YOUTHFUL ACTIVITY
While adult Great Danes are typically moderate in
their desire for frenetic activity, during their youth 
they can be enormously vigorous. A racing Great 
Dane like this one is wonderful to watch, but needs
considerable space for manoeuvring. Care must 
be taken when exercising young 
dogs to prevent injury to 
dog and bystanders.
This majestic and truly grand dog –
the tallest of all dog breeds – was
called the Grand Danois by the great
French naturalist the Comte de Buffon,
because he felt the strongest examples
came from Denmark. It was not
until 1880 that its other name, the
Deutsche Dogge, was established at
a dog show in Berlin. It is now Germany’s
national dog. Like all mastiffs, the Great
Dane’s origins are in Asia, and it is very
likely its ancestors, the Alaunts (mentioned
by Chaucer in the 1200s), were brought to
Europe by the Alans, a Scythian tribe that
originated in what is now Asian Russia.
The Great Dane, as we know it today, 
was developed in the 1800s by crossing
the regional northern European mastiffs
with local greyhound stock. Great Danes
are enormously gangly as pups and then
develop into dignified and surprisingly
gentle adults, some of whom love to sit 
on their owner’s laps. A heart condition,
dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), can be
passed by unaffected females to half of
their pups. Gene testing will eventually
make it easier to reduce the risk of this fatal
condition from developing. As one of the
deepest-chested of all breeds, it is prone
to life-threatening rotation of the stomach.

Mastiffs arrived in Scandinavia as Viking

that country’s mastiff breed, was registered
by the Danish Kennel Club (DKK) in 1910.
In 1974, DKK breeders started recreating
the Broholmer and it was internationally
recognized in 1998. Although it can now
be sold outside Denmark, virtually the
entire population lives within the country.
The new Broholmer has been bred
primarily for companionship.

It is difficult today to comprehend just
how powerful Professor T.D. Lysenko was
in Soviet Union science. His biologically
impossible theory, which stated that
acquired knowledge and learning could
be passed in the genes from one generation
to the next, had tremendous appeal to the
Soviet authorities because it meant it only
required the training of a single generation
of communists to ensure the perpetuation
of that philosophy. To show the gullible
Party hierarchy how heredity could be
broken down and moulded, he arranged
for dogs to be selectively bred and then
trained at the Red Star Army dog kennels
in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to
prove his theory. The Russian Black Terrier,
created by crossing the Giant Schnauzer,
Airedale Terrier, and Rottweiler, is one
result. This is a powerful dog, best in the
hands of an experienced dog owner.

Although genetic studies

is related to other mastiff breeds, such 
as the guarding dogs featured on previous
pages, it is unlike many of them in
personality. In fact, Newfoundlands (or
“Newfies”) can be the biggest softies of
the dog world. While painful joint diseases,
osteochondrosis dissecans (OCD), and hip
dysplasia are serious problems within the
breed, these are stoic dogs that benignly
want to participate in family activities and
thrive on human companionship. There is

named after the 19th-century British
painter Sir Edwin Landseer, who featured
them in his work. The Landseer is black

Newfies are inveterate swimmers, with an inclination

or flotation rings to people in the water, boat towing,
floating retrieves, and even underwater retrieves.
French authorities have a number of trained, sea-
rescue Newfoundlands at their disposal along the
Mediterranean coast. This breed’s lifesaving urge is 
so strong that the greatest problem may be stopping 
it from “rescuing” those not in difficulties.

KEEPING A DOG
www.ebook3000.com


THE CANINE CONUNDRUM
There is no other animal species,
domesticated or wild, with such a
tremendous variety of shapes, sizes,
coats, and conformations. So how 
do you choose the right dog for you?
Whatever your lifestyle, with a little
thought and guidance, you can pick the
perfect canine partner for a reciprocal
relationship that will last a lifetime.
CARE AND CARE ALIKE
Dogs are creatures of routine, and this 
is an important consideration when
caring for them. Every day, your dog
relies upon you to make the right
decisions about nutrition, for example.
CARING FOR A DOG
All dogs depend upon us for their physical health and psychological
well-being. Living with a dog can make your life more interesting and
enjoyable, but alongside the benefits come special responsibilities. 
Your canine friend is ever-reliant on you for food, 
security, health, and peace of mind.
The right choice
Kitting out your dog need not be expensive, but you should
choose items that are robust and suited to your pet. A dog’s
bed is his private den, so make sure it stands up to the job.
Dogs are good groomers, but they need
continuing attention from you to keep
their eyes, ears, mouth, paws, skin, and
coat in prime condition. All dogs thrive
on regular grooming from us, so make 
it part of your daily care drill. Consider
also what other essentials a dog needs:
permanent identification, regular health
check-ups, bedding, collars and leads,
and a varied selection of toys.
IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH
Routine body checks on your dog reveal
potential problems before they become
serious, while preventative care protects
your dog, other dogs, and you.
Elderly dogs in particular depend
upon you to know when they are
in pain or discomfort. And when
emergencies occur – fortunately
infrequently – the techniques you
learned to assist people are easily
adapted to giving first aid to a
dog. The principles are the same,
only the scale changes.
Letting off steam
Although requirements vary with size and breed, all dogs
need constructive daily exercise. Taking your dog for a
walk is a great way for you both to keep healthy, happy,
and to meet new friends, canine and human.
A clean bill of health
Regular veterinary examinations of your dog
can catch future problems at an early stage
when they are easier to treat.

Dogs continue to have practical purposes – to guard and protect, 
to control vermin – but of all domesticated species it is the dog that
today provides us with the greatest social, psychological, and emotional
rewards. These are the modern values of living with a dog.
The value of living with dogs
clocks, often altering their diet
according to their changing
tastes. We chauffeur them to
the park for their daily exercise.
We follow them, sack in hand,
cleaning up their poop! We
wash and groom them, provide
them with comfortable bedding,
and take them to the vet’s when
they tell us they’re unwell. We’re
putty in their paws, but we care
for them as we do because the
benefits of living with them
are so profound.
OUR NEED TO NURTURE
While our relationships with
our children and grandchildren
evolve, we retain throughout our lives 
a perpetual need to nurture, to look after
other living things. By gardening, for
example. Or keeping pets. One of the
greatest rewards of living with dogs is that
they provide us with an outlet to care for
WHAT’S IN IT FOR THEM
It’s obvious why dogs are
delighted to live under our
protection. And yet some
people in the animal rights
movement feel that dog
ownership is a form of
slavery and should be
abolished. It certainly is,
but exactly who’s the slave?
Can you imagine what an
alien would make of it,
landing on Earth, seeing
how our dogs control our
lives? At a dog’s command
– a bark or an unblinking
stare – we feed them
according to their biological
Reasons to be cheerful
Having dogs around is good for us. Studies prove that
people living without pets are exposed to more persistent
fears, stronger feelings of panic, experience more frequent
headaches, and take more medication for stress-induced
illnesses than pet owners.
Taking the lead
Dogs generate positive energy,
encouraging their owners to
get off the sofa, step outside,
and stay physically active.

271
T H E  V A L U E  O F  L I V I N G  W I T H  D O G S
because deep in the core of our being 
is the need to be needed. Owing to the
lifestyle changes we chose to make in 
the 20th century – increased mobility,
physical separation from the extended
family, enhanced leisure activities – the
source that would naturally fulfil our
need to be needed isn’t always there.
EMPTY NESTERS
Dogs are increasingly part of the lives 
of empty nesters, people whose children
have grown up and left home. In my
veterinary clinic, it is primarily women
who bring pets in for health checks 
or medical attention, although I also 
see many couples over 60 years of age 
and lots of gay couples of any age
accompanying their pooches. To many 
of these people, dogs are like surrogate
children, filling a void in their lives that
may be impossible to fill otherwise. 
It’s easy for cynics to belittle the intense
relationship that can develop between an
empty nester and his or her dog. It’s easy
to ask why people don’t devote this surfeit
of warmth towards other human beings.
That’s a societal problem for us to deal
with. In the meantime, dogs are here –
offering unconditional love and undivided
attention to those who need it most –
delighted to fulfil their role in helping
people enjoy their lives to the full.
those who cannot care for themselves on
their own. In turn, they care for us. The
dog’s effortless ability to raise our spirits
ranges from reducing feelings of stress
and anxiety to lowering blood pressure
and helping us to lead healthier, more
active lives. This care
aspect is important,
A special relationship
The unconditional acceptance and love dogs give to their
owners positively impacts on their owner’s emotional
health, particularly among the elderly.

Before even thinking about acquiring a dog, ensure that you
understand the long-term costs. Do you have the time, space, and
energy to commit yourself to the demands of living with a canine
companion, and have you researched the best places to get a dog?
Finding a dog
CONSIDER THE COST
While the purchase price of a dog 
may range from nothing to over £1,000,
start-up equipment and veterinary costs
add, on average, another £400. Then
there’s food. Feeding a typical Labrador-
sized dog costs at least £1 per day. Dogs
are also living longer than ever before.
With long life comes the additional cost
of caring for the elderly canine. Health
insurance averages out that cost over 
the years, but assume average annual
veterinary and insurance costs of around
£300. In total, running a typical dog for
an average lifespan of 12.8 years will
cost almost £12,000.
A HOME FIT FOR A HOUND
Is your home suitable for a dog to live in?
Is it safe? Does it have enough living space
for a dog to grow into throughout its life?
Surprisingly, a dog’s size is not the primary
determining factor you need to consider.
Some giant breeds, such as greyhounds
and mastiffs, are content to laze around
in relatively modest habitats, while smaller
breeds, such as Border Collies and some
terriers, relish larger home territories where
they can release their high energy levels.
RELIABLE SOURCES OF DOGS
As well as coming in a variety of shapes
and sizes, dogs also come from a variety
of sources: some reliable, and some that
should be approached with scepticism.
■The neighbour whose bitch has just
had a litter is often an excellent source.
Pups that are raised by amateur breeders
may already be socialized and react 
well to the routines of family life.

bark or howl?

idea of any problems you may be inheriting.
Make sure you ask the recycler the following questions about your prospective pooch :
How does your home measure up?
Even a town apartment can be a suitable home for the
right breed of dog. However, you will need to have a toilet
area inside if your pup does not have access to a garden.

273
F I N D I N G  A  D O G
Dog breeder kennels
Take time to look round a breeder’s facilities before
buying your dog. These kennels are clean, comfortable,
and the dogs are not crammed into their living spaces.
A good breeder will want to assess your suitability 
as an owner: be prepared to answer as many 
questions as you ask.
Choose your sources wisely
They may look cute now, but not knowing a puppy’s
ancestry or at least its early history could lead to
extreme behavioural issues and exorbitant
veterinary bills in the future.
■While many professional breeders are
involved because they love dogs, others
breed canines simply to make money.
Just because a breeder is registered with
a kennel club does not ensure reliability.
Look for pups raised in the home, rather
than pups brought up in an outbuilding.
■Professional rescue centres examine all
dogs that they recycle, not only for their
health but also for their temperament.
Wonderful individuals, including a large
number of purebreds, can be obtained
from pounds and dog homes. 
■Notice-boards at veterinary clinics
often advertise dogs for sale. These are
invaluable sources because the staff at
the clinic are likely to know the parent
dog or its family personally.
■Consider homing a retired working
dog, often available from charities such 
as Guide Dogs for the Blind. These
intelligent dogs deserve a loving home
after the responsibilities of their service
roles, and often make excellent pets.
WHERE NOT TO FIND A DOG
Avoid puppy farms, where unscrupulous traders sell
cheaply and cruelly farmed animals. Avoid pet shops,
which may be fronts for this trade. Avoid newspaper
advertisements offering dogs for free. Avoid buying dogs
off the Internet unless you can guarantee the validity
of your source – while many websites offer excellent,
fully vetted animals, some are fronts for the illicit trade
in dogs. Avoid letting your heart rule your head while
you’re on holiday – don’t rescue that poor moth-eaten
stray. But if your options for getting a dog are limited
to these means, be cautious, thorough, and sensible.

Before looking at individuals, you need to make some important
choices. Decide whether you want a pup or an older dog. Take into
account the sex differences in canine behaviour, even in neutered dogs,
and consider carefully what size and type of dog will suit you best. 
Choosing a dog
Older and wiser
There may be many reasons why you decide that an adult
dog will fit in better with your lifestyle than a puppy. But
don’t look on it as a soft option: any new dog requires a
big commitment from the owner to forge a strong bond.
PUPPY OR ADULT
Your first decision after you’ve agreed
that a dog will be a welcome addition to
your home is whether to get a malleable
putty-in-your-hands pup or provide a
home for an older dog that has already
reached adolescence or adulthood. Pups
are adorable but they remain pups for 
an amazingly short time. The advantage
of getting a pup at around eight weeks of
age is that this is the ideal time to socialize
him to your lifestyle: travel, urban life,
living with other animals, and so on.
What some owners consider the greatest
disadvantage is that you are responsible
for the sometimes tedious, sometimes
exasperating, house training. Many, 
but not all adult dogs, arrive already

275
C H O O S I N G  A  D O G
house trained, although there is always 
a degree of retraining in a dog’s new
environment. Adult dogs also often arrive
already obedience trained. A drawback 
is that older dogs frequently come with
unexpected emotional baggage, and a
predisposition to separation anxiety is
not uncommon in recycled adult dogs. 
BOYS, GIRLS, AND NEUTERING
The difference is relatively simple. A rush
of male hormone masculinizes male pups
at the time of birth, whereas females are
“neutral” until becoming “feminized” at
puberty. Male dogs are more likely to be
dominant, active, and destructive than
females, as well as acting aggressively
towards other male dogs. In general,
female dogs demand greater affection and
are easier to obedience train and house
train. Whichever sex, there is no difference
in their ability to watchdog bark.
If you are not planning to breed from
your dog, consider neutering. It is 
a highly effective form of birth
control, which offers several
other benefits. Neutered
males are less likely to
urine-mark, pick fights
Young and cute
Puppies entering a new
household often form an

with any children in the family.

same breed, and may have greater exercise demands. As

which sex you choose is a matter of personal preference.
with other male dogs, or wander off.
Neutered females will not urine-mark (as
they would at the onset of oestrus) or go
off their food or attempt to escape (tell-
tale signs of ovulation). Overly possessive
behaviour is also prevented. They also
live on average 18 months longer than
similar females that are not neutered 
and the risk of mammary tumours and
uterine infection is greatly reduced. The
downside of neutering in females is that
it may either increase the density of the
coat (and so reduce its lustre) or lead to
hair loss. One in three neutered dogs 
are also predisposed to weight gain.
TEST A PUPPY AT 
6 WEEKS OLD 
TESTING A PUPPY 
It’s difficult to assess a pup’s personality on only one visit, 
but try the following exercises, ideally on a puppy around 
6 weeks old. Give a score from 1 to 5 for each test.

Pups that score low are likely to be nervous or submissive. Pups with

these extremes are likely to be an easier addition to your household.

All breeds start life relatively similar in size. However,
whereas the Yorkshire Terrier reaches its adult weight
of 3kg (6.5lb) by 41⁄2 months, a giant breed like the St
Bernard will continue to grow rapidly for the first year,
not attaining its full 60kg (132lb) until 18 months. Most
breeds’ growth curves fall between these two extremes.

although pet insurance actuarial statistics

expectancies in excess of 14 years. At the

CROSSBRED DOGS
Only a decade ago, crossbreds, the
progeny of two different purebred dogs,
were considered “mistakes”. It could be
difficult to find homes for the results of
unauthorized alliances between, say, a
Bichon Frise and a Yorkie. Thankfully,
this is no longer the case. Crossbreeding
is now both planned and successful. It
diminishes the risk of genetic diseases
and often produces exhilarating results,
such as Labradoodles and Cockerpoos.
This success has led to some countries
setting up breed registries for crossbreds.
MUTTS
Mutts are just about anything else – 
the result of random breeding. The look 
and shape of random-breds varies with
dog stock from country to country. In
parts of the United States, mutts have 
a hound-like appearance, while in
regions of Britain there is an obvious
element of sheepdog. Japanese mutts
often have the appearance of Shiba
dogs. From a medical perspective, one 
of the advantages of random breeding 
is the reduced risk of genetic disease. On
the other hand, random breeding makes
it more difficult to assess a pup’s eventual
adult size and personality.
EXTENDING OUR OWN PERSONALITIES
While the size and the sex of a family
companion are often easy choices,
what you want your dog to look
like is a more complicated
question to answer. Guys often
prefer short-coated, muscle-bound
dogs, until they learn that a
Chihuahua or a Yorkshire Terrier
can compete in the thuggishness
Olympics with the burliest
Rottweiler. Purebred, crossbred,
or random-bred is also a tough
decision to make. There has
been a gratifying cultural
shift during the 
last quarter of
a century or so regarding dog
selection. Today, many families are
actively choosing to give a home to an
unplanned or unwanted dog, rather than
buying a purebred with an impeccable
pedigree or show-quality looks.
POSITIVELY PUREBRED
The advantage of getting a purebred is
that you can accurately predict adult size,
shape, and personality. Knowing your
dog’s ultimate size and temperament
upfront is very handy – you’re saving
yourself from any unpleasant surprises.
However, because of the consistent
inbreeding necessary to create and
perpetuate a breed, you also get known
genetic predispositions to disease, for
Random-breds
The majority of dogs living in rescue centres are random-
breds, but the good news is that dog lovers are increasingly
opting for mutts from shelters rather than purebred pets.

Every single day of your dog’s life you tend to the needs of your

or treat mouth and digestion problems than for any other reason.
Feeding a dog
SPECIFIC DIETS FOR DOGS
Canine nutrition is as susceptible to food fads as 
is human nutrition. One popular diet is called Bones 
and Raw Food (BARF). This diet consists of uncooked
bones, muscle and organ meat, raw eggs, vegetables,
fruit, and cereals. Whether it is wise to feed dogs this
kind of diet, however, is contentious. Chewing on
bones certainly massages the gums and scrapes the
teeth, but swallowed bones are the most common
foreign bodies vets end up operating on dogs for.
What’s more, raw meat and eggs are more likely than
cooked foods to be contaminated by Salmonella or 
E. coli – bacteria dangerous to 
dogs and potentially
transmissible 
to humans.
Canine teeth
The design of the dog’s
jaw is a vestige of its
origins as a hunting
animal – specialized
for catching, killing,
and eating prey. 
Promoting good oral health
Dental chews for dogs can help clean the teeth,
prevent the build-up of tartar, and reduce
instances of dreaded “dog breath”.

DOGS ARE DIFFERENT
Your dog’s nutritional needs are different
from yours and because dogs no longer
capture and kill their own food, but have
constant access to tasty and nutritious
meals, obesity has become a common
canine condition. It is up to you to make
the right choices for your dog to avoid
these problems. The medical evidence 
is arresting. If you feed your dog a well-
balanced diet, gradually altering it as
your dog progresses through life, and 
if you ensure that his teeth and gums
remain healthy, you can extend his life
expectancy by, on average, 18 months. 
TEETH, GUMS, AND INFECTION
Your dog has a carnivore’s teeth, designed
for capturing and killing prey, removing
meat from carcasses, and chewing meat
and roughage. Because we feed our dogs
either commercially produced dog food
or our own table food, dogs seldom have
the opportunity to use their teeth as they
evolved to be used. Gum infection, the
cause of “dog breath”, can spread via the
bloodstream to other parts of the body.
You can prevent gum disease through
good nutrition and oral hygiene. Ask
your vet about diet, compacted biscuits,
chews, and toothbrushing to keep your
dog’s teeth and gums in good condition.

THE RISK OF BLOAT
Bloat is a life-threatening condition in which partial 
or complete rotation of the stomach prevents food
from entering or leaving. The affected dog may drool,
retch, wander restlessly, become listless, or show
signs of pain. Symptoms of shock quickly develop. 
Bloat affects mainly deep-chested large breeds, such
as German Shepherds, Great Danes, Dobermanns and
Weimaraners. If you have a dog that is known to be 
at risk of bloat, prevent the problem by limiting water
consumption for an hour before or after each meal. 
Do not allow the dog to drain the bowl of its contents:
water should be consumed in moderate quantities. 
Do not allow rolling or other exercise after meals.
The burdens of obesity
Obesity is becoming a serious problem in domestic
dogs. Among other ailments, the ability to exercise 
is reduced and the work of the heart increased. 
DIFFERENCES IN ENERGY NEEDS
The average daily kilocalorie (kcal) requirements for
your dog depend on age, weight, and lifestyle. Dogs
in colder climates will need a slightly increased 
energy intake depending on the amount of time 
they spend outdoors. Ask your vet about the specific 
energy needs of pregnant or lactating females.

ENERGY AND OBESITY
Plump pups look cuddly but they’ve
manufactured excessive numbers of fat
cells. Later in life, it’s harder to reduce
the number of fat cells than to shrink
them in size. The evidence is dramatic
and overwhelming. Lean dogs are likely
to live, on average, 18 months longer
than their plumper siblings. It’s up to you
to maintain your dog’s healthy physique.
Do so by offering any food in moderation.
A commercial diet produced to help dogs
lose weight usually contains around 15
per cent fewer calories than the
manufacturer’s regular food.
THE STOMACH AND INTESTINES
A dog’s stomach is essentially a holding
tank. Its great capacity allows dogs to
gorge on food, as they are naturally
competitive and opportunistic feeders.
Digestion is then a slow process.
However, your dog’s intestines house 
a dynamic ecosystem in which various
competing “good” bacteria, taken in
with mother’s milk and supplemented by
new bacteria from different foods, strike
a balance that is optimum for digestion. 
The dog is built primarily to digest
protein and fat, which contain all the
vitamins and minerals it needs. Dogs are
superbly formed for an “Atkins-style”,
high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet.
Carbohydrate is necessary for good

INGREDIENTS OF A HEALTHY DIET
Regardless of how you choose to feed
your dog, he needs essential ingredients.
A well-balanced diet, containing high-
quality nutrients, is vital for good health.
The essential components of a healthy
canine diet are protein and fat. Proteins
are complex molecules made up of a
variety of amino acids, which are the
building blocks for all body tissues and for
all the enzymes that support the body’s
chemical reactions. The most natural
source of protein is meat but, like us,
dogs can get all the essential amino
acids they need for a healthy life
from vegetable protein.
Fat (or “oil” as it’s usually
described on food labels)
contains essential fatty acids
(EFAs). It is energy-dense, 
with around twice as many
calories per gram as protein or
carbohydrate. Both the aroma
and taste of fat make food more
palatable, but fat is also essential
for transporting the fat-soluble
vitamins A, D, E, and K. Dogs
prefer animal fat, but vegetable
fat can be equally nutritious. For
example, linseed oil has similar
nutritional benefits to fish oil.
Fibre is a natural part of a dog’s
diet, and is needed to promote good
digestion and solid stools. In the wild,
fibre is consumed when a dog eats the fur
UNDERSTANDING FOOD LABELS
Comparing protein, fat, and fibre levels in different
commercial dog foods isn’t easy because levels vary
according to the food’s water content. It is simpler 
to compare foods on a “dry-matter” basis – what
remains if all moisture is removed. Here’s how to
calculate dry matter levels of protein, oil, and fibre.
A typical canned food label might say: moisture
80%; protein 8%; oil 6%; fibre 1%. This food is 
80 per cent moisture so it is 20 per cent dry matter.
Calculate the true levels of protein, fat, and fibre
using this formula.
Dry matter nutrient content = 
The label’s nutrient percentage 
x 100 ÷ Dry-matter content
percentage. Therefore:
Protein = 8  x  100  ÷ 20  = 40
Oil (fat)   = 6  x  100  ÷ 20  = 30
Fibre
= 1  x  100  ÷ 20  = 5

A good all-rounder
To be at his peak, your dog requires a diet
that incorporates all of his nutritional needs.
This diet will be dependent on his
age, his health, and on any
food allergies.

or intestine contents of other mammals.
There are many types of fibre. They fall
into two main groups: water-soluble and
insoluble. Water-soluble fibre, from foods
such as cooked vegetables and rice,
increases the stickiness of food, slowing
digestion and the absorption of nutrients
from the small intestine. Insoluble fibre,
such as bran and animal fur, retains
water and makes faeces more bulky,
helping waste to pass through the large
intestine. The amount of fibre that your
dog needs varies with its age and lifestyle;
older dogs sometimes benefit from an
increase in both soluble and insoluble
fibre in their diet, to aid bowel function.
A constant supply of fresh, clean, easily
accessible water is essential for life. Water
is the largest component of most cells in
your dog’s genetic makeup. It is absorbed
by fibre and carries the water-soluble
vitamins – the B group, folic acid, and
vitamin C – around the body. The daily
amount a dog drinks will vary according
to its diet, activity levels, and the weather
conditions. Dogs fed on dry food will
need more to drink than those fed on
canned or home-cooked food.
ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS
Nutritional studies show that fats do
more than simply provide energy. EFAs
are involved in controlling a range of
problems, such as allergies, arthritis, heart
disease, and even cancer. There are two
main groups of these fats: Omega 3 and
Omega 6 EFAs. The larger group, Omega
6 EFAs, are essential for the walls of cell
membranes to function efficiently. Omega
3 EFAs are associated with reduced cell
inflammation. An optimum balance of
Omega 3 and Omega 6 EFAs is necessary
for strong, robust, healthy skin, efficient
reproductive organs, and an all-round
strong immune system.
FREE RADICALS
“Free radicals” are molecules and atoms
that destroy cell membranes. The level of
free radicals in the body increases with
illness and age, but also with routine
physical activity. “Free radical scavengers”
are substances that sweep up and destroy
dangerous free-radical molecules and
atoms. Antioxidants, such as vitamins C
and E and the minerals selenium and
zinc, are free radical scavengers. So are
substances called “carotenoids”, such as
lutein and beta-carotene. Diets high in
free radical scavengers may help a dog’s
natural systems to destroy free radicals.
FOOD ALLERGIES
Dietary allergies in dogs are being
increasingly diagnosed by vets. A food
allergy occurs when a dog’s immune
system is abnormally sensitive to a
particular component in its food. This
may be a flavour or a colouring, but is
more likely to be a nutrient, such as
milk, beef, or other natural foods. The
allergy usually causes a skin reaction,
often itching; it may also affect the
gastrointestinal tract and cause vomiting,
diarrhoea, or both. Trying to discover
what in the diet is causing a problem is
time-consuming, but once the “allergen”
is avoided problems resolve themselves.
Whether age- or health-related, any
changes you do make to your dog’s diet
should be introduced gradually, over a 5-
to 10-day period. This lets the digestive
enzymes adjust to the new nutrients, and
makes it easier to spot adverse reactions.
DIFFERENT NUTRITIONAL NEEDS
All dogs share the same dietary needs and digest food
in the same way. What differentiates one breed from
another are genetic factors that predispose the breed
to medical or physical problems. For example, some
large breeds are prone to arthritis and have a tendency
to gain weight easily. Small breeds, like the Yorkshire
Terrier shown here, will readily eat a meat-only diet if
allowed, resulting in dangerously low levels of calcium.
In that sense, diets formulated for specific breeds –
and their respective sizes – may be beneficial.

There is no such thing as a single diet suitable for all dogs. Each 
dog varies according to its own metabolism. Nutritional needs change
as a dog matures from puppyhood through to old age, and energy
demands vary according to the lifestyle your dog enjoys.
Your dog’s diet
WHAT TYPE OF FOOD?
All dog diets should provide the correct
balance of nutrients. After this, it’s your
call. If you want to cook for your dog,
there are books and websites available to
help you formulate a balanced, nutritious
diet. If you choose a commercially
produced dog food, whether to go for
wet or dry food is a personal decision,
based upon convenience for you and
palatability for your dog. One texture 
of food is not nutritionally better than
another, although manufacturers of pet
food often produce their greatest variety
of super-premium foods in dry form.
Your vet can explain the pros and cons
of different diets for your particular dog.
CHANGE THROUGH LIFE
During puppyhood a dog needs to grow
as well as simply maintain itself. This
demands more energy, ideally in the
form of protein. Young dogs thrive on
diets 20 per cent higher in protein than
do mature dogs. Avoid feeding too much
energy-dense food during puppyhood,
however. Overweight pups are more
likely to have lifelong weight problems.
Many commercially produced adult foods
contain far more than enough nutrients,
and are very tasty. If these nutrient-rich
diets are fed freely, obesity is the natural
outcome. Most of these commercial
foods are formulated for mature dogs,
but manufacturers’ recommendations
often advocate quantities that are directed
at vigorous adults. To this end, your dog
may actually benefit from eating smaller
amounts than what the
manufacturer suggests.
Contrary to what is
sometimes written, healthy
older dogs do not benefit
from reduced protein
levels in their diet. Most
older dogs thrive on their
adult diet simply reduced
slightly in quantity and
augmented with extra
vitamins and minerals.
Some may benefit from
special “senior” diets,
containing high-quality,
easily digested nutrients
and extra antioxidants to
help the immune system,
and extra nutrients for
skin and gut health.
WATER
A dog loses water daily in urine and faeces, through
panting, and to some extent through sweating from the
pads. Dogs are as dependent on water as humans, and
can suffer irreversible body dehydration and damage 
if it is unavailable for over 48 hours. Although canned
food is usually 75 per cent liquid, this is not enough 
to satisfy a dog’s needs. Dogs should 
be provided with a clean bowl of water
every day to drink from when thirsty.
It is important to monitor your dog’s
water consumption, since excessive
thirst can be a sign of particular
health problems, including kidney
failure and liver disorder. 
If you are aware that your
dog is drinking far more than
usual, contact your vet.  
Food for thought
Good nutrition is as important to your dog’s health as it is
to your own. With a dizzying array of types of dog food to
choose from, finding the right one for your pet isn’t always
easy. If in doubt, ask your vet for advice.

Meat consists of
amino acids in the

fatty acids in the
form of fat. Both are
essential for life.
Meat, especially
fatty meat, is tasty.

evolved to capture
and eat prey.
Meat is seriously
deficient in calcium.

and antioxidants
from vegetables.
Vegetables balance
the nutrients. The
result is a diet closer
to the dog’s natural
diet, which includes
the intestinal content
of prey.
Some dogs pick out
the meat, leaving the
vegetables. Finding
the time to cook for
their dogs can also
be a problem for
some owners.
Dogs can convert
vegetable-derived
protein and fat into
essential amino
acids and fatty acids.
Vegetarian dog
owners need not
bring animal-derived
protein, fat, or

Shopping has become our most popular leisure activity, and shopping
for your new dog is extra exciting. When buying dog accessories, make
sure you choose items primarily for their practical use rather than
solely for their design or cost.
Basic dog accessories
THE BARE MINIMUM
All dogs have certain essentials: bowls for
food and water, an ID tag, a collar and
lead for security and control, and their
own bed to call home. Almost as essential
is a selection of toys, items to give mental
and physical stimulation (see pp.314–315,
The importance of play). Choose items
that are designed according to your dog’s
needs. Some dogs, for example, are not
the right shape for collars, and would
benefit more from a body harness.
BEDDING
Before choosing a bed, think about
both where your dog will sleep and his
eventual size – you are buying bedding
with an adult dog in mind and not a
perennial puppy. Many dogs enjoy the
security of a solid perimeter. Think of
teething. Wicker looks wonderful but 
is very tempting to chew. Choose a bed
large enough for your dog to lie on, on
his side with his legs fully extended.
FOOD AND WATER BOWLS
Many individuals, particularly large dogs,
don’t eat their food – they vacuum it. The
best food and water bowls are wide for
easy access and either heavy or with non-
slip bases to prevent sliding across the
floor. Don’t rely on your dog’s tongue for
bowl cleaning. Wash all feeding utensils
daily after use, just as you wash your own.
Bowled over 
Before buying food and water bowls, consider
your dog’s needs: small breeds, such as the
Yorkshire Terrier, will
struggle to feed from 
a high-sided bowl.
Beds fit for a dog
A comfy, spacious, and hygienic bed is essential for your
pet’s well-being. Destined for years of service, the type 
of bed you choose now is all-important.

In harness with your dog
Harnesses place less stress on
the neck area of small breeds
with wide necks, such as Pugs,
or those with delicate windpipes,
such as the Yorkshire Terrier
and Chihuahua (below).
COLLARS AND LEADS
By all means exercise your fashion sense
when choosing a collar or harness for
your dog, but always choose items that
are practical and comfortable. Wide, 
flat collars are excellent for breeds with
long necks such as whippets, while rolled
leather is ideal for those with a long coat
such as Golden Retrievers. You should
be able to slide two fingers under a well-
fitted collar. With all but the thickest-
necked breeds, this means that the collar
is comfortably loose but will not come
off if your dog tugs backwards. If your
dog’s shape is not right for a collar,
provide him with a body harness.
A full choke chain is commonly used 
as a safety device to prevent a dog from
slipping its collar. Choke chains should
never be used simply to control a dog’s
behaviour, however, because they may
cause compression of the windpipe,
especially in small breeds. Head halters
are ideal for controlling either giant or
flamboyant individuals (see p.327).
Taking the lead
Choose a durable lead that is suitable
for your dog’s size and is comfortable
in your hand. A good lead could last
your pooch for its whole life.
Get collared
For the majority of
dogs, a traditional
nylon or leather collar
is sufficient. Other
options include sight
hound collars, buckle
collars, and quick-
release flat collars.
CANINE ID
Your dog should always carry two
forms of ID. One is an engraved
name tag or capsule containing
your and your vet’s telephone
numbers. The other is a microchip,
a transponder the size of a grain
of rice that is injected under the
skin between the shoulder blades.
Microchips are the most
efficient way to trace a
dog’s owner. One dog
found wandering in
Toronto, Canada, 
was traced back to
its family visiting
from Portugal.

There is an ever-increasing array of practical accessories available for
your dog, designed to ensure that he is safe when he participates with
you in your own leisure activities. Whether you’re hiking, sailing, or
just driving to the shops, make sure your dog is equipped for the event.
Additional dog equipment
TRAVEL EQUIPMENT
A crate eases travel problems, as a sudden
stop can turn your unsecured dog into a
lethal missile. If you have an SUV, estate,
or hatchback, a crate provides safe, secure
transport for your dog. Alternatively, install
a rigid dog guard. If your dog travels on
the back seat, secure him to the seat belt
anchor with a dog’s seat belt harness.
You should also carry a folding bowl so
that you can stop every two hours to let
your dog feed and have a drink of water.
Packed and ready to go
When attaching a backpack to your dog, ensure that
the load is not too heavy, the fit is good, and that no
straps or buckles will cause chafing to your dog’s girth.
Eating on the run
Small enough to fit in 
a glove-box, a foldable,
waterproof, lightweight
bowl is an essential
accessory for your 
dog if you do a lot 
of travelling together.

HIKING BACKPACKS
It’s up to you to carry your dog’s
gear if you’re going on a short
walk. Those walkers who cover
more ambitious distances, however,
can always accustom their dog to
lightening the load by attaching 
a backpack to it to help carry bulky
but lightweight items. A healthy, well-
conditioned canine should be able to
carry one-quarter of its own weight.
Safe and sound
Using a crate when you travel by car ensures that your
dog is secure and can’t jump around, distract you from
driving, or hang its head out of the window.
Belt up in the back
Your dog needs to be restrained if it is to travel
with you as a passenger by car. Large dogs can
wear special dog harnesses that attach to
seat belts in the back seat.

Staying buoyant
Good swimmers they may
be, but all dogs should be
fitted with a canine life
jacket if they will be near
water for long periods.
BODY INSULATION
It’s easy for you and me to dress warmly,
but dogs, like humans, can suffer from
hypothermia, especially if they get wet.
Short-haired dogs need cold-weather
protection from wind, rain, and snow.
Choose a coat that is comfortable, water-
proof, provides great insulation, and looks
good on your dog. Close-fitting neoprene
garments are a very
effective way of
helping your dog
preserve its own
body warmth.

FLOTATION DEVICES
Even the most inveterate
Labrador can’t swim
indefinitely. If you take your
dog with you while sailing,
ensure he wears a flotation
device. A doggy lifejacket will
not only help him keep afloat, it
will also help you find him if he
falls or jumps overboard. A grab
handle positioned on the dog’s
back makes lifting a sopping-wet
pooch out of water easier.
FOOT PROTECTION
Shoes for dogs might seem a slightly
frivolous idea, but in freezing weather,
for example, breeds such as Boxers are
prone to frostbitten feet. Burning hot
sand is just as dangerous as ice and snow,
so ensure your dog wears some form of
foot protection in extreme weather. The
neoprene rubber-soled dog boots pictured
below also protect your pooch’s paws from
thorns, broken glass, and grass seeds.
Dressed for the job
This working dog wears a neoprene camouflage vest,
helping to keep him warm and comfortable in the cold 
and rain or when diving into lakes and rivers.
DON’T DEMEAN YOUR DOG
There are lots of cute canine accessories you can buy,
but are they really for your dog or are they there to
satisfy our own vanities? Is it really in a dog’s interest
to wear a pink satin baby doll outfit or reindeer ears
or a leather hat and goggles? By all means have fun
with your dog, but laugh with him, not at him.

Preparing the household
NAMING YOUR DOG
The name you choose for your 
dog says as much about you as it
does about your pet. It shows
how you view your dog and
your relationship with it.
Choose as pretentious a
name as you wish, but
always use a one- or 
two-syllable word when
speaking to your dog.
Short, sharp names are
best for getting your dog’s
attention. My dog’s full
name was Lexington, but
always Lex or Lexy when
speaking to her. Use your dog’s name
when getting its attention, but never 
for when you need to punish. That 
only teaches it to worry when it 
hears its name. Train everyone 
in your family always to use
your dog’s name when they
want its attention.
PREPARE FOR THE ARRIVAL
Dogs are born mischief-makers.
Before welcoming one into your
home, think about your new
pet’s indoor and outdoor
environment. Remove any
chewable and breakable
items from your dog’s
territory-to-be. Make sure
low windows are closed
and outside doors latched.
Ensure that all detergents,
cleaners, insecticides, and
fertilizers are out of reach.
Tape down electrical wires,
or spray them with taste
deterrents. Check your back-yard fences
for openings through which a puppy
might escape; baby-guards are ideal for
preventing a new dog from wandering
out of its designated area. Even with
perfect preparation, remain vigilant.
Dogs are just amazing at finding the
weaknesses in our best-laid plans.
Primed to make mischief
A puppy on the loose requires your
supervision. It’s very important to start
as you plan to continue when setting
rules and routines for your dog.
Her first pet
The first few days you spend with
your puppy sow the seeds for your
future relationship together.
With careful planning, caring for a new dog is a joy. But bringing 
a dog into your life includes responsibilities to your dog for its well-
being and to your family, friends, and neighbours. There are several 
guidelines you should follow before bringing your new friend home.

MEETING THE FAMILY
Keep human activity to a minimum when
your pup arrives in your home. Restrict
him to a single room at first, but let him
investigate it to his heart’s content. Explain
to children that they should be calm and
quiet when they meet the new arrival.
A resident dog, especially an older one,
can resent the arrival of a newcomer.
Wait until your new addition is asleep
and then let your resident canine take
the initiative and sniff its new house-
mate. Use the same approach with 
the family cat. Cats rule dogs and if
your cat has the opportunity to hiss first
he will establish his own ground rules.
Make sure your cat’s feeding bowl is
inaccessible to your dog. Cat food always
tastes better to canines than dog food.
SETTLING IN
For some dogs, moving home is very
stressful. The stress increases the risk 
of illness, especially gastrointestinal
disorders. Regardless of what you plan 
to feed your dog, get a sample of what
FURNITURE FANATICS
Dogs aren’t dummies. Even the slowest pup knows
that sofas and beds are more comfortable than the
floor. And there’s an added bonus for them: these
places smell comfortingly of us. It’s your choice
whether you let your dog on your furniture or bed. 
If you don’t want dog hair everywhere though, never,
ever let them on furniture. To your dog, just once is
enough to say it’s always okay. Be firm from the outset
and only let a sleeping dog lie where you say so.
The security of his own bed
Your new arrival needs a safe, permanent place to retreat.
Plan where your dog will eventually sleep, not just where
she sleeps during her first weeks with you. Bedding should
be hygienic, washable, comfortable, and protecting – an
old duvet or a beanbag are ideal.
he’s been eating and continue feeding
that for the first few days, gradually
switching it during the first week to the
diet you have chosen. See pp.278–283
for more advice.
For the first eight weeks of his life, your
dog snuggled in close with his mother and
siblings when he slept. Where your dog
sleeps now – in a crate in the kitchen, in
the hallway, or in your bedroom – is your
choice, but wherever it is be consistent. If
he is to sleep alone, don’t make a big fuss
over him. Leave quietly and don’t respond
to howling or crying. If you do, he wins
and he knows it. If you have thin walls,
take your neighbours a box of chocolates
and some earplugs, and offer an apology
for any noise your dog may make. Only
the rarest of canine individuals does not
learn to sleep quietly alone within a week.

Health and safety
CHECK OUT THE RISKS
Just as you planned ahead before you
brought your dog home, make sure
you’re not exposing him to unnecessary
outdoor risks. Before letting your dog
into the garden, carry out a complete
inspection. Is the fence or hedge escape-
proof? Have you recently used any
garden herbicides or insecticides? Are
they safe if a dog is exposed to them?
Can your dog create havoc with your
barbecue? He’ll want to investigate those
scrumptious odours as soon as he smells
them. If you’re lucky enough to have 
a swimming pool, is it fenced off from
access by your dog? When you take 
your dog outdoors, always visit his 
toilet area first (see p.316).
Following your dog’s arrival, over the next few days gradually
introduce him to his new life within your family. When it’s safe to do
so, allow your dog outdoors, first into your garden, then into public
areas. Car trips should be introduced as soon as possible.
An outdoor adventure
Letting your dog out in the garden for the first time is an
exciting moment for each of you. Before doing so, however,
ensure that your garden is escape-proof and that no harm
can come to your puppy or any other animals you may have.
DOGS ON HOLIDAY
While kennels and dog sitters are always available,
it’s great fun taking your buddy on dog-friendly
holidays. However, take special precautions when
travelling with your dog. Make sure his dog tag carries
your mobile phone number, including the international
dialling code if necessary. Include a local number
when possible. Ensure you pack essential accessories
and clothing, such as a life jacket (below). Check on
risks where you’re travelling; for example, there are
poisonous snakes and scorpions in the American
southwest, leishmaniasis in Mediterranean Europe,
and tick-borne diseases throughout the world. Finally,
check out physical risks, too, such as cliffs, strong
local currents, or thorny, impenetrable undergrowth. 
C A R I N G  F O R  A  D O G

H E A L T H  A N D  S A F E T Y
Stay in control
By all means expose your dog to the
great outdoors at an early age, but be
sensible and keep him on a lead
initially. A pup allowed to run free
is a danger to itself and others. 
SAFETY IN PUBLIC PLACES
With puppies in particular, a wealth 
of experiences introduced early on is the
ideal way to raise a well-socialized dog.
Discuss with your vet the pros and cons
of taking your dog to public areas before
the age of 12 weeks – the age they are
usually judged protected by vaccines
from infectious diseases. Where I practice,
the incidence of infectious diseases is now
extremely low, and I tell my clients that
the benefits of their dog walking on a
lead along the streets and visiting public
parks outweighs the minimal risk of
coming in contact with canine infections.   
Be sensible though: always keep your
dog on his lead in circumstances where
he could run away, such as an unfenced
public park. And never leave your dog
unattended outside a shop. Regrettably,
young dogs are at risk of being stolen –
sometimes, in my experience, for ransom.
Relaxed and ready to ride
For some dogs, car sickness is related to stress rather than
the motion of the vehicle. Slowly acclimatize your dog to
travelling by car by taking short journeys at first, always
finishing with a positive experience, such as a long walk.
291
TRAVELLING WITH YOU BY ROAD
My next door neighbour’s new French
Bulldog pup accompanies the family’s
children in the car when they are taken
to school in the morning and is there
waiting for them when the kids are
picked up in the afternoon. She has done
so since she arrived and thinks of the car
as part of her home. However you plan
to transport your dog, let her become
accustomed to the car, the bus, even 
the basket on your bicycle, as soon as
possible. By doing so you reduce the 
later risk of motion sickness or excitable
behaviour when your dog travels.

Your dog’s skin and coat need regular bathing and brushing, and
occasional cutting or clipping. As well as making your dog feel clean
and content, this kind of maintenance trains you to notice anything
out of the ordinary that may indicate a medical problem.
Grooming and bathing
GROOMING AND BRUSHING 
When grooming and brushing your dog
for the first time, keep sessions short and
always reward him for his compliance.
Most dogs look forward to grooming if
it is carried out properly. Another bonus
is that your actions – picking him up,
holding him still, gently brushing him –
help to reinforce your leadership role.
Use brushes and combs that are suitable
for your dog’s particular type of coat. 
A smooth coat like a Boxer’s is the easiest
to care for: use a rubber brush or a hound
glove twice weekly, against the lie of the
fur, to remove debris, dirt, and loose hair. 
A short, thick coat like a Labrador
Retriever’s needs different tools. Use 
a slicker brush with the lie of the coat 
to clear tangles, then against the lie to
Different dogs,
different brushes
Your dog’s grooming kit
should contain the right
tools for the breed’s coat
type. A Boxer may only
need a rubber brush,
while other breeds will
require a succession of
brushes, from slickers
to clear tangles to
bristles and combs
to finish off.
CLIPPING A DOG
Clipping and cutting is necessary in breeds with
permanently growing hair such as poodles (below), but
also in dense-coated breeds, such as schnauzers and
spaniels, for warm-weather comfort. Unless you’re a
hairdresser, it’s best to leave this form of grooming 
to the experts. However, you
should occasionally trim
your dog’s coat yourself,
to prevent tangles.
Shedding hair
All dog breeds shed, or
moult, hair. Losing hair 
in this way is a natural
process, occurring mainly
in spring and autumn.

remove loose hair. Use it twice weekly,
followed by a bristle brush to remove any
remaining dirt. Finish with a fine-toothed
comb, concentrating on the neck and tail.
If the coat is slightly longer, like that of
a Golden Retriever, it needs to be slicker-
and bristle-brushed more frequently,
preferably daily. The long hair around
the feet, chest, and hind legs needs
occasional trimming with scissors.
Some long-haired breeds, such as the
Yorkshire Terrier, have no protective
undercoat, and thin skin that is susceptible
to laceration. This makes them sensitive to
irritation from rough grooming. First, tease
out tangles with a slicker brush, then use
a bristle brush to position the hair. Follow
by combing. Perform this routine daily.
WASH YOUR DOG REGULARLY
It’s a myth that frequent shampooing
dries out your dog’s coat. Dog shampoos
have come a long way; many are now
made from natural ingredients, meaning
they are kind to both skin and coat. In my
experience, dogs are not washed enough.
Washing your dog cleanses the hair and
rids it of accumulated pollen and mould
spores. It reduces the build-up of dead
skin, making the coat less attractive to
bacteria and parasites. Shampoos wash
away accumulated sebaceous gland
secretion, a common cause of “doggy
odour”. A washed dog smells better,
looks more attractive, and has generally
healthier skin than an unwashed one.
2
Apply the shampoo all over the
coat, then rinse very thoroughly,
especially under each leg and the 
tail. Check that the coat is completely
clean of any debris or dirt. If not,
repeat the shampooing process
before rinsing for a second time. 
3
Have plenty of towels ready. Your
dog will want to shake himself
dry of all that water, and to make sure
you get as wet as he is. For dogs with
long or dense coats, a hair dryer can
be effective for quicker drying, but
use only a low temperature setting.
TYPES OF SHAMPOO
There is a wide range of shampoos specifically
formulated for different coat textures and skin
conditions. Your vet will be able to advise you about
what type of shampoo is best for your dog’s skin. Here
are some of the shampoos available on the market:
■Hypoallergenic – for dogs prone to itchy skin.
■Antiseptic – kills surface
skin bacteria.
■Antibacterial – kills skin
bacteria and prevents
their multiplication.
■Antiparasitic –
prevents or kills 
skin parasites.
■Humectant – adds
shine to the coat.
■Perfumed – to
appeal to us, not dogs.
MATERIAL IN HAIR
All types of material can become stuck 
in a dog’s coat – some too stubborn to
disappear of their own accord. Hair is 
a magnet for chewing gum, burrs, tar,
and paint, as well as for fleas and ticks.
However, you should never use paint 
or tar remover to remove substances. 
For tar, paint, and chewing gum stuck 
in the coat, use scissors to cut out the
substance and matted hair. Plant burrs
are easiest to remove if you spray on 
a little cooking oil. Corn starch powder
can help to untangle mats in your dog’s
coat, because it acts as a dry lubricant.

Brush your dog before bathing

from bathing about once a month; long-

attention, while smooth coats need less.

Your dog depends upon you to carry out routine body 
checks for damage, disease, or infestation. Keep an eye on 
any changes in movement or behaviour. Contact your vet 
if your dog looks or acts any different from normal.
Routine body checks
CLEAN EARS
Dogs with hair growing down
their ear canals (breeds such as
Poodles and many terriers) are
prone to wax accumulation, leading
to inflammation or infection. Lift
each ear flap and check for unexpected
odour, visible wax, or inflammation.
Your vet will show you how to remove
excess hair routinely from the ears.
Sudden head shaking, especially when
one ear is held slightly lower than the
other, can mean a foreign object such 
as a grass seed caught in the ear canal.
HEALTHY TEETH AND GUMS
Lift your dog’s upper lips each day and
check that there is no unpleasant smell,
and that the gums are a healthy pink
colour. Dental plaque can build up
surprisingly quickly – sometimes at only
two years of age – especially in small
breeds. Your vet can show you how to
brush your dog’s teeth effectively, using
food treats to reward compliance.
NAIL CARE
Nails on medium- or larger-sized dogs
usually wear down with exercise, but

Look inside your dog’s ears
Check your dog’s ears routinely for odour or wax build-
up. Floppy-eared dogs, such as this Cocker Spaniel,
are more prone to ear problems because of the
warm, damp climate in their ears.
A DAILY ROUTINE
Virtually all of us touch or stroke our dogs
every single day. We love it, and so do they.
It’s simple to turn this natural activity into
a short and easy daily physical inspection.
Start with the head and move down your
dog’s body. This is the simplest and most
effective way to find potential problems
when they are easiest to resolve.
BRIGHT EYES
Some breeds of dog, Yorkshire Terriers
for example, develop sleep in their eyes
overnight – small, hard crusts of dried
tears that catch in the hair at the corners.
Often it is easy to pick this off with your
fingernails, but if it is firmly adhered,
soften it with a cotton ball dipped in
tepid saline solution or lukewarm water.
If the eyes and skin around them do not
look normal to you, consult your vet.

skin, and coat daily, feeling for

for signs of pain.
need their nails trimmed routinely.
Nails should never be brittle, but they
soften when wet, so trim them after 
a bath. Cutting white nails is a simple
process: cut in front of the visible pink
“quick” in the heart of the nail. Cutting
black nails is more problematic and
needs special care because the quick,
which is painful when cut, can’t be seen.
FRESH SKIN AND COAT
Run your hands over your dog’s whole
body. There should be no lumps or bumps.
Any resistance can be an indication of
pain. The coat should smell and look
fresh and clean. Any stickiness might
indicate a site of skin infection or a
penetrating injury. Frequently part
the hair to examine the skin:
it should look “quiet”,
without too much
flaking dander
visible.
CHECKING ANAL SACS
Here’s the bit your dog won’t appreciate. Accustom
him to your checking his bum. It should be clean and
odourless with no signs of swelling or inflammation.
Dogs that drag their butts along the carpet or lick
incessantly probably have blocked anal sacs, their
scent-emitting marking glands. They normally empty
naturally, but should be drained if they are full. (Full
sacs feel like hard grapes.) Your vet can show you 
how to do so by gently
squeezing both sides
of your dog’s anus.

It’s a repetitive old mantra, but it’s true: prevention is better than
cure. It’s easier and cheaper, too. There are simple, proven, and
effective ways to protect your dog from infectious disease, parasites,
unwanted pregnancies, and physical injuries.
Preventative medicine
of pathogens, the protein shells of
viruses, for example. What your dog
should be vaccinated against varies
depending on where you live or where
you visit. Vaccines against diseases such
as rabies, distemper, hepatitis, and
parvovirus give protection for at least three
years, although some vets recommend
annual booster shots. All puppies should
start a course of “core” vaccinations
against such diseases as soon as possible
once they reach eight weeks of age.
PREVENTING INFECTIONS
Preventative vaccination is the single
most important reason why dogs no
longer die in massive numbers from
infectious diseases such as distemper 
and parvovirus. Yet some dog owners 
are fearful of vaccinations, believing 
that inoculations are responsible for
triggering other diseases. Any medical
procedure has a possible risk associated
with it, but the risk from effective and
efficient vaccination, compared with the
risk from the potentially lethal diseases
dogs are vaccinated against, is minimal.
Vaccination, or immunization, stimulates
a natural and protective immune
response against the
agent in the vaccine.
Vaccines contain
killed or live but
genetically modified
pathogens. Some
contain only parts
Routine injections
As a responsible owner, you should
inoculate your dog against infectious
diseases. Discuss with your vet
which vaccinations are appropriate
for your dog’s lifestyle and where
you live, and how often booster
shots should be given.
PREVENTING INJURIES
I’ve been in clinical practice long enough to see the
life-sustaining value of simply walking a dog on a
lead. Early in my career, when it was still common to
let dogs wander off the lead, I treated at least two
dogs each week for road traffic accident injuries.
Today, these are thankfully rare. The best prevention
of physical injuries to dogs is the use of a lead
combined with basic obedience training.

P R E V E N T A T I V E  M E D I C I N E
PREVENTING PARASITES
Internal parasites have evolved
fascinating survival strategies, the most
efficient of which is to become activated
from a dormant state when a mother is
pregnant and to pass to the pups in her
first milk. That’s why so many pups are
born with worms, but these are easily
and gently eliminated with the range 
of modern drugs that are available. 
The frequency of worming
varies with where you live and
the age and health of your
dog. So too does the need for
prevention of external parasites
such as fleas and ticks. Fleas are
one of the most common canine
parasites, and besides causing itchiness
can also spread roundworms if infected
fleas are eaten. Ticks are particularly
troublesome because they are capable 
PROBLEMS OF LIVING WITH DOGS
While rabies is the most dangerous disease dogs 
can transmit to us (see p.26), there are other less
serious but nevertheless irritating drawbacks to
owning a dog. Ringworm, a fungal infection, causes
circular skin lesions in humans. If a dog eats raw,
infected sheep offal, it can pass on hydatid disease 
to us via tapeworms. If swallowed by humans, the
eggs of canine roundworms can cause blurred vision
and trigger an allergic response in some children. Ticks
can carry a range of bacteria, some of which can cause
conditions like Lyme disease, resulting in enlarged
lymph glands, joint inflammation, and pain.
of transmitting potentially lethal
infections. In large parts of the world,
mosquitoes transmit heartworms while
sandflies transmit leishmaniasis. Using
safe and effective oral or “spot-on”
medications can prevent both internal
and external parasitic diseases. 
PREVENTING UNWANTED PUPPIES
Millions of dogs are killed each year
because no one wants them. Preventing
unwanted pups is our moral obligation,
but neutering also brings wonderful
fringe benefits in terms of increased life-
span for females and reduced wanderlust
for males. If you choose not to neuter
your bitch, be vigilant when she is in
season and keep her on a lead when
outdoors to prevent unplanned matings.

With the dog seated or restrained, use both hands 
to carefully prise open the jaws. Using the fingers of
the lower hand, drop the tablet as far back into the mouth 
as it will go, past the “hump” of the tongue.

Hold the dog’s mouth closed with one hand and tilt

Just as in children, allergies in dogs have increased enormously in the
last few decades. So too have immune-mediated disorders, conditions
in which a dog’s immune system turns on a healthy part of the dog’s
body and damages or even destroys it.
Allergies
THE SIGNS OF ALLERGY
Scarcely acknowledged before the 20th
century, today we know that the body
can experience an allergic response to
almost anything, including foods, drugs,
and chemicals. In the dog, two systems
are primarily affected by allergy: the 
skin and the gastrointestinal system. 
The indicators of allergy are frequently
mistaken for signs of other, often more
common conditions. Itchy skin, and
especially itchy ears, is commonly
attributed to parasites, while food
poisoning from scavenging is often
erroneously thought to be the cause 
of either vomiting or diarrhoea. 
WHAT DOGS ARE ALLERGIC TO
Most dog allergies are caused by
allergens in the environment, with only
15 per cent caused primarily by food.
The most common environmental causes
are the house dust mite and, somewhat
poetically, human dander. It is only since
dogs were welcomed into our homes –
and particularly into our bedrooms and
beds – that they have experienced their
greatest leap in the incidence of allergy!
Sleeping partners?
Letting your dog sleep with you on your bed may seem
kind, but you are both at risk from allergens. Fleas and
moulted hair may start you scratching, while your dog 
has to contend with dust mites and human dander.

299
A L L E R G I E S
Some dogs, particularly
those with white coats, are especially
prone to an allergic reaction to the
chemicals injected by fleas when they
bite; a single fleabite can lead to the
dog’s whole body flaring up. Fungal
spores can also precipitate an
allergic response.
Just as allergies tend to run
in human families, there is also
a breed disposition in dogs. Genetically
ancient breeds, such as the Shar Pei and
Japanese Akita, are prone to skin allergies,
while Golden Retrievers and Westies are
susceptible to gastrointestinal allergies.
IMMUNE-MEDIATED DISEASE
At the same time that the incidence 
of allergy has increased (now affecting
almost one in five dogs), numbers of
immune-mediated disorders also appear
to have risen. For example, Cocker
Spaniels are particularly susceptible 
to hypothyroidism, where the immune
system erroneously decides that the
thyroid gland is “foreign” and destroys 
it, leading to medical and behavioural
problems caused by low thyroid hormone
levels. Reports of immune-mediated
disease have increased dramatically over
the last few years, but this could simply
be down to better diagnoses.
Scratch that itch
All breeds of dog –
even hairless
varieties – are prone
to suffering from itching.
Parasites, and particularly 
the flea, are responsible 
for irritating skin conditions.
ALLERGIC TO YOUR DOG?
Contrary to popular belief, there are no dog breeds that pose a lower risk
of allergy than others. All dogs carry the same protein (called Can F1) on
flakes of their skin and in their saliva. This is what triggers the allergic
response – runny eyes, sneezing, and even wheezing – in susceptible
people. All breeds, including non-moulters such as poodles and hairless
ones such as the Chinese Crested, produce Can F1. We are less likely 
to be allergic to dogs with clean
skin and a regularly washed and
clipped coat; these activities
reduce levels of F1 production.
Symptoms of allergy
Streaming eyes and a runny nose
can be prevented by keeping
your dog clean and clipped.
DUST MITE
REDUCING THE RISK OF ALLERGY
External parasite prevention, especially
flea control, is high on the list of measures
to reduce both the risk and the severity
of allergic skin reactions. So too is routine
shampooing. A terrier’s rough coat, for
example, is adept at capturing two causes
of allergy, namely mould spores and
pollens, but washing can remove them.
The essential fatty acids found in fish oil
or linseed oil added to the daily diet may
also be beneficial in reducing the allergic
response. And any dog that suffers from
chronic allergy – skin or gastrointestinal
– should be fed a unique, changed diet,
such as fish and potato, for at least six
weeks, to determine whether food is a
complicating factor.

With age, a dog’s body simply does not work as well as it once did.
Many geriatric medical problems seem more frequent now because
dogs are living longer than ever before. With good care and regular
check-ups, however, many of them can be treated successfully. 
The elderly dog
older dogs simply get confused, entering
a room and then seemingly wondering
why or how they have arrived there. 
BODILY FUNCTIONS
With age, previously “clean” dogs can
lose their toilet training. Sometimes there 
is a physical cause, such as sphincter 
muscle weakening that leads to urinary
incontinence, but in other instances
keeping the den clean ceases to be so
important. A dog urinates or defecates 
in the home because it is no longer 
a priority to ask or wait to be let out.
SKIN AND COAT
Ageing causes the skin to lose its youthful
elasticity, becoming thinner and more
sensitive. Older dogs groom themselves
AGEING AND THE SENSES 
Dogs grow old gracefully, but their
senses, it seems, can suddenly deteriorate.
The lenses in the eyes go cloudy at
around 10 years of age, a sign that the
dog can no longer focus efficiently close
up. He can see movement at a distance,
but something lying in the grass in front
of his nose is just a blur. His hearing
may deteriorate quickly over a matter of
months. Some owners feel that their dogs
develop “selective hearing”, but more
often than not this is a genuine hearing
loss, even a profound deafness. Many
Signs of old age
Large breeds such as Golden Retrievers often suffer from
hip dysplasia, a wearing down of the joint that leads to
chronic pain. Older dogs of any breed are likely to suffer
from deafness, poor vision,
muscle shrinkage, and
joint fluid drying up.

less and resent our grooming them more.
The skin also produces more secretions
from the sebaceous glands, which can
create either an oily or a dry, flaking
condition. All this means that old dogs
often become smellier than they were.
TEETH AND INTESTINES
“Dog breath” is so common in older
dogs that it is often considered normal.
Gum disease and dental calculus may 
be inevitable, but both are medical
conditions requiring attention. Slowing
down in older dogs is far too often
attributed to ageing when, in fact, it 
is caused by chronic, treatable mouth
infections. Dogs seemingly gain years in
strength and vigour after these infections
are tended to. Similarly, constipation and
flatulence, other age-related problems,
are often easily corrected by making
changes to your dog’s diet. 
HEART AND LUNGS
There are some breeds of dog, Boxers
and Labradors are often great examples,
which never grow up. Whatever their
age, they want to play games for ever
and ever. Watch your dog’s breathing.

but cardiovascular diseases, which are
treatable conditions, are as common in
older dogs as they are in humans.
MUSCLES AND JOINTS
Don’t delude yourself when you see 
an old dog getting up gingerly, walking
slowly, or limping. He may not complain,
but he’s certainly in pain. Osteoarthritis
is virtually inevitable if a dog lives long
enough. Weight and pain control are at
the core of improving his quality of life.

breeds than in others. Breeds most at risk include:

AGEING AND YOU 
While ageing is inevitable, there is ample
evidence that with modifications to the
diet, weight management, changes in
exercise routines, maintenance of good
health, and routine mental stimulation,
the active years of an ageing dog can 
be dramatically prolonged.
A MANAGED DIET
As the years advance, what a dog eats
becomes ever more important. Cell
damage increases, which means an
increase in free-radical scavengers
becomes vital (see p.281). The ability 
of the intestines to digest food diminishes,
so feeding higher-quality, more digestible
protein is a simple way to guarantee
continuing optimum nourishment. 
A WEIGHTY ISSUE
Weight must be carefully managed;
controlling a dog’s calorie intake can
make the difference between living a life
of vitality and struggling with obesity.
Some older dogs gain weight simply
because they continue to consume the
level of calories they’ve always done, 
but don’t exercise enough to expend 
this energy. Other older dogs gain 
weight because of medical conditions,
such as underactive thyroid glands. 
Once medical causes have been controlled
or eliminated, alter your dog’s calorie
intake so that it is in line with his daily
energy requirements (see p.279). This will
help reduce strain on old joints, the most
common site of age-related pain. If your
ageing dog has become picky with his
food, there’s a medical problem. It may
be as simple as gum disease, tooth pain,
or diminished taste or smell, but it is just
as likely to be caused by even more
serious medical conditions. Your dog
should be seen by your vet. In the
meantime, warming food to body
temperature releases aromas, improves
flavour, and makes it more palatable.
CONTROLLED EXERCISE
Exercise is as beneficial to your older dog
as it is for you, but it should be constant
and routine. Avoid sudden increased
activity. If your dog walks for half an
hour a day and you plan to go for a four-
hour hike at the weekend, then leave
your golden oldie at home. Walking and
occasional trotting is best. Avoid vigorous
exercise. Leave ball catching to youthful
canines, unless it’s a simple toss straight
to the mouth. Contrary to what you
might read, walking up stairs is very
good exercise and is safe for all but
overweight dogs, who are prone to
tearing knee ligaments.
ROUTINE GROOMING
While some older dogs groom less
because they’re either too fat to do 
so or have mouth pain caused by gum
and tooth disease, others groom less just
because they forget. Your intervening
and grooming your dog not only keeps
the skin and coat in fine condition, it also
enhances skin circulation and massages
the muscles. If you don’t need to groom
daily, give your dog a gentle all-over
massage. Improved circulation keeps
muscles in their best condition.
MENTAL STIMULATION
Yes, let sleeping dogs lie. Don’t pester
Old Faithful, but when he’s awake and
alert offer him mental stimulation: a food
treat he has to get out of a hollow bone,
a moving target he has to get his paw 
on to maintain physical dexterity. The
longer he uses it the longer it will take
for him to lose it.
The health risks of obesity
Obesity in dogs is a serious medical problem. Fat dogs are
more prone to injury, and have more stress placed on their
heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, and joints. They also run a very
high risk of tearing the cruciate ligaments in the knees.

A QUESTION OF ETHICS
More than one-third of
all dogs in the US, Canada, 
the UK, and Germany are
over 10 years old. They’re
chronological geriatrics. 
In Sweden, however, 
where veterinary care and
compassion for pets is equal to
that of those aforementioned
countries, only 17 per cent 
of dogs are over ten years old.
In some countries there is an
ethical debate on how far we
should go to extend an older
dog’s life. Amputations, radiation
therapy, and chemotherapy for
cancers are common treatments
in many countries, but in Sweden
they are rare events. There is no
universal interpretation of the
words “quality of life”. Decision-
making is influenced by the
culture you live in as well 
as your own principles. 
EUTHANASIA
In Judaeo–Christian culture, 
the decision to euthanize an
elderly dog for humane reasons 
is fraught with emotion, but is still 
a morally simple choice. In other
cultures, where the value of a
dog’s “soul” is equal to that of
a human’s, for example in Hindu,
Buddhist, and Buddhist–Shintoist
cultures, euthanasia creates an
intense moral dilemma. When a
decision is made to euthanize, it is
inevitably an easier process for the
dog than for those attending to him.
In most cases, an excess of barbiturate
is given. The dog simply falls asleep
and, while asleep, his heart stops.
THE REASONS WHY DOGS DIE
A recent pet insurance survey revealed illness –  and
not old age – as the primary cause of death in dogs.
The full list of causes of death was as follows:
■Natural causes
8% 
■Accidents
5%
■Illness
35% 
■Euthanasia due to illness
29% 
■Euthanasia due to behaviour problems
2%
■Euthanasia due to old age
21%
A joint enterprise
Daily gentle exercise and an all-over massage 
can dramatically improve the quality of life of 
an old dog. Massage reduces pain by stimulating
or relaxing the muscles and improving circulation.

Assessing injuries
AN EMERGENCY MUZZLE
Muzzle an injured dog if
it looks frightened or has
obvious painful injuries. 
A gauze bandage, a tie, 
or a pair of tights makes an
efficient emergency muzzle.
This should be 50–75cm
(20–30in) long. Make a
loop and slip it over the
dog’s nose. Gently tighten,
draw the ends under the
chin, cross them under the
jaw, and tie in a secure
bow behind the neck.
HOLDING YOUR DOG
Your dog should be held safely and
reassuringly while you do an emergency
examination. If your dog is large, wrap
one arm around his neck and support
him against your body. It may need two
of you to hold and examine him. Hold
smaller dogs gently but firmly by the
muzzle, using the elbow of your free 
arm to press the dog’s body against yours.
MONITOR YOUR DOG’S BREATHING
Large dogs normally breathe in and 
out around 10 times a minute, while 
the smallest dogs may breathe 30 times 
a minute. Pain, fever, heart conditions,
and being in the early stages of shock 
all increase a dog’s breathing rate. Note
that breathing and panting are different.
Panting increases with exercise, anxiety,
and pain. Calculate breathing, not
panting, by timing chest movements 
for 15 seconds and multiplying by four. 
A large dog has a normal heart rate as
low as 50 beats per minute; a small dog’s
heart beats up to 160 times per minute.
An irregular heartbeat can indicate life-
threatening advanced shock. To monitor
the heart, press your fingers to the left
side of the chest, just behind the elbow.
On small dogs, grasp the chest on both
sides and squeeze gently to find a pulse.
WHAT TO DO FIRST
Initially, you need to
consider if your dog is in
continuing or immediate
danger. Are you in the
same danger, or at risk
from being bitten because
of what has happened?
Your first objectives are to:
■Save your dog’s life.
■Prevent any further 
injuries occurring.
■Reduce pain and stress.
■Get your dog quickly 
and safely to a vet.
RESTRAINING YOUR DOG 
After determining that you are not 
in danger, approach an injured dog 
with care, always speaking quietly and
reassuringly. Reduce his fear by avoiding
direct eye contact. Even the gentlest dog
may bite because of fear or pain. If you
can, loop a lead around his neck. A belt,
tie, scarf, or any other available item can
be used as an emergency collar and lead.
A precautionary measure
An injured dog may be very frightened or in severe pain,
and its behaviour unpredictable as a consequence. You
will need to muzzle it to avoid the risk of being bitten.
Chances are, you’ll never need to use life-saving first aid skills on 
your dog, but when emergencies do occur your dog depends on you
to remain calm and to assess the priorities. Is he breathing? Is he in
shock? Do you need to administer first aid for cuts or broken bones?
Lifting an injured dog
Grasp your dog gently under the neck
and rump. Lift with a straight back,
and bring your arms together to
support the dog’s weight.

Caring for a dog in shock
Shock reduces the blood flow around the body, and can
dangerously lower body temperature, leading to failure of
vital organs. Use coverings to keep a dog in shock warm.
LOOK FOR SIGNS OF SHOCK
Shock occurs when blood fails to get
transported throughout the body. Treating
advanced shock is your top priority. 
SIGNS OF EARLY SHOCK ARE:
■Faster than normal breathing and 
heart rate.
■Colour returns slowly to the gums after 
finger pressure applied and released.
■Persistently pale gums.
■Anxiety or restlessness.
■Lethargy and weakness.
■Subnormal body temperature
SIGNS OF ADVANCED SHOCK ARE:
■Shallow breathing and an irregular 
heart rate.
■Blue gums.
TREATING SHOCK
If your dog shows any signs of shock, 
do not give him anything to eat or drink,
or allow him to wander around. Keep
him calm and do the following:
■Stop any bleeding and give heart  
massage and artificial respiration as 
necessary (see pp.306–307).
■Wrap him in a blanket to prevent 
further heat loss.
■Elevate his hindquarters to enable 
more blood to flow to the brain.
■Keep his neck extended (to help blood 
flow to the brain) and immediately 
transport him to the nearest vet. 
Checking breathing
With an unconscious dog, your priority is to find a pulse
and check the dog’s breathing rate. Place your fingers
either behind the left elbow or inside the hind leg.
■Extreme weakness or unconsciousness.
■Very cool body temperature – less than 
36.7ºC (98ºF).

306
In emergencies, heart massage can restart a stopped heart while
artificial respiration puts oxygen into your dog’s lungs, to be carried to
his brain until he starts breathing again on his own. This combination
is called cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR.
Emergency treatment
MORE ABOUT CPR
Every living cell in your dog’s body
needs oxygen to survive. Oxygen is
breathed into the lungs, picked up by 
red blood cells, and pumped by the heart
around the body. Brain cells have a huge
need for it – they use 20 per cent of the
body’s supply. If brain cells are deprived
of oxygen, even for a few minutes, they
are damaged or die. CPR saves lives by
restoring and maintaining breathing and
circulation, providing blood and oxygen
to the heart, brain, and other vital organs.
GIVING ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION
Only give artificial respiration if your
dog has stopped breathing. Check the
gums. If they are pink, the blood is still
carrying oxygen around the body. If they
are blue or white, artificial respiration may
be necessary. If in doubt whether or not
a small dog is breathing, place a small
piece of tissue in front of a nostril and
see if it moves. If breathing has stopped,
give artificial respiration (see opposite).
Give breaths every five or six seconds
and check the pulse after every three
breaths (see pp.304–305).
GIVING HEART MASSAGE
Give heart massage only if the heart has
stopped beating. Check your dog’s eyes –
pupils dilate when the heart stops. Feel
for a heartbeat or pulse. Check the gums.
If the gums are pink, exert pressure on
them with a finger. If they turn white
and immediately return to pink when
you release finger pressure, the heart is
still beating. If there is no pulse and the
gums do not refill with blood, the heart
has stopped beating. Start heart massage
immediately (see opposite). After giving 15
seconds of heart massage, give artificial
respiration for 10 seconds.
GAGGING AND CHOKING
If your dog has something stuck in its mouth and 
is gagging, restrain it without using a muzzle.
Then open the mouth, with one hand grasping
the upper jaw and pressing the upper lips
over the teeth and the other hand
holding open the lower jaw. Look at
the roof of the mouth, the back of
the throat, and around the teeth to
locate the object. Use tweezers or 
a spoon handle to gently remove the
obstruction as  quickly as possible. 
If your dog is choking and conscious, put
your arms around its belly, make a fist, and
squeeze firmly upwards and forwards just
behind the ribcage. For a small dog, place
your hands either side of its belly and
squeeze in the same way. If the dog is
unconscious, place it on its side. Press
sharply with the heels of your hands just
behind the back ribs to expel the blockage.
REMOVING AN OBSTRUCTION
LIFTING A CRITICALLY INJURED DOG
Take care when lifting or moving a critically injured
dog. Always use a muzzle unless a dog is vomiting,
convulsing, has obvious mouth or jaw injuries, or is
unconscious. Improvise a stretcher using any flat 
item, such as an ironing board or removable shelf. 
If there is no one to help during transport, lightly tie
his body, but not his neck, to the board. Alternatively,
use a strong blanket to carry the dog. With his back
towards you, gently pull him by his chest and rump
onto the blanket. Cover him in the blanket to keep him
warm and reduce the risk of shock. In cold weather,
ensure you turn on the car heater.

307
E M E R G E N C Y  T R E A T M E N T
If performing CPR on your own, continue
alternating the two until the heartbeat
returns, then give artificial respiration
alone. Then seek emergency veterinary
attention. If two people are present, one
gives heart massage for five seconds, then
the other gives a breath of artificial
respiration. Continue this alternating
procedure until the heart resumes beating
and it is safe for one person to leave to
arrange transport to the veterinary clinic.
RESUSCITATION PROCEDURES
Performed promptly and properly, CPR
saves lives. Would you be prepared to
correctly administer CPR on your dog 
if you were faced with an emergency?
Learn and remember the following steps.
They should only be carried out if your
dog has stopped breathing. 
3
Check the pulse every 15 seconds to make sure the
heart is still beating. If it stops, perform heart massage
by compressing the chest with the palm of your hand
around 100 times a minute (in large dogs), or by squeezing
the fingers and thumb on both sides around 120 times a
minute (in small dogs), pushing blood up towards the brain.
EMERGENCY TRANSPORT
It is almost always better for you to get to
the vet than for the vet to come to you. If
your dog can walk to the car let him do so,
otherwise carry him. If his chest is injured,
lay him injured side down; gravity keeps
blood in the damaged lung. Elevate an
injured leg so weight is born on healthy
limbs. Keep an injured head higher than
the heart to reduce pressure in the skull.
Ensure he is restrained and supported.
Ensure mouth 
and nose are free 
of any debris
Perform heart
massage only 
if dog’s heart 
is not beating
Neck is kept in 
a straight line to 
ensure airways 
remain clear
1
Place your dog on its right-hand side, if possible with 
its head lower than the rest of the body. Clear any
debris from the nose and mouth, and pull the tongue
forwards to clear the airway. Close the dog’s mouth 
and ensure that the neck is aligned with the body.
2
Place your mouth over the dog’s nose and blow in
until its chest rises. If you prefer not to do this, seal
your hand around the nose and give breaths through your
hand. Lift your mouth away. The lungs will deflate. Repeat
10–20 times until the dog breathes on its own.

308
As a dog owner, be prepared to deal with the odd graze or wound to
your pet. A wound is a break in the skin or internal tissues, and there is
usually bleeding from damaged blood vessels. A wounded dog requires
medical attention in case of excessive bleeding or the risk of infection. 
Wounds and bleeding
ASSESSING THE WOUND
The skin may be broken, producing 
an open, bleeding wound, or it may 
be closed, producing only visible dis-
colouration and swelling. Open wounds
look worse, but closed wounds can hide
deeper, more dangerous injuries, which
should be dealt with by your vet.
Heavy bleeding or slow, continuous,
lighter bleeding can lead to dangerous
clinical shock (see p.305). While internal
bleeding is difficult to control, external
bleeding can often be controlled by
applying pressure. Spurting blood, or
arterial bleeding, means that an artery
has been damaged. This is more difficult
to stop because the blood pressure is
higher in arteries than in veins. A wound
may not produce much blood at all, but
it can still be life-threatening to your dog.
Don’t waste time treating more minor
Rest and recuperation
An injured dog needs care after
his wounds have been dressed.
He may be in pain, so speak
reassuringly and watch for any
signs of biting. The tightness 
of bandages should be checked
frequently as wounds can swell.
problems. A dog requires immediate
emergency veterinary attention in any 
of the following circumstances:
■A penetrating wound to the chest or 
abdomen, with or without bleeding.
■Blood spurting from an open wound.
■Any bleeding that does not stop after 
five minutes of applied pressure.
■Bright red blood in vomit or diarrhoea.
■Profuse bleeding from any body opening.
■Signs of clinical shock (see p.305).
CONTROLLING BLEEDING
Apply pressure at the site of bleeding,
preferably using absorbent material, such
as medical gauze. If no first-aid material
is available, use anything at hand, such as
kitchen towels and facial or toilet tissue.
When the bleeding stops, don’t remove the
blood-soaked pad; the clot is controlling
the bleeding. Wrap it in place and keep

BE PREPARED
It is impossible to prevent all
accidents, but you can reduce risks
and be prepared for emergencies.
■Train your dog in obedience and
always keep him under your control.
■Keep a first aid kit close to hand
containing basic wound dressings
(non-stick sterile pads and dressings,
cotton wool, stretchy roll bandage), 
scissors, tweezers, washing soda
crystals for inducing vomiting,
activated charcoal powder for use 
if your dog is poisoned, and a bottle
of clean water for cleansing wounds.
■Keep both your vet’s telephone
number and a back-up vet’s number
in a convenient place.

Use tweezers or clean fingers to remove loose dirt or other
material from the wound. Flush the wound with 3% hydrogen
peroxide, antiseptic fluid, or clean water. Pour the fluid over the
wound, or use a clean hand-held plant spray with the nozzle
turned to “jet”. If the hair is getting into the wound, rub a little
water-soluble jelly onto a pair of scissors and cut the hair away;
the hair will stick to the scissors. Avoid using oil-based ointments,
because these substances are particularly difficult for your vet to
cleanse from around open wounds. Always see your vet as soon
as possible after administering this kind of first aid – your dog is
at risk from infection and may require stitches.

vet, at the latest on the same day. 
If possible, keep the bleeding area
higher than the heart, but don’t
elevate a bleeding limb if there 
is a possibility of a fracture.
TAKE CARE USING TOURNIQUETS
A tourniquet is a tight band that 
is applied to a limb to stop life-
threatening bleeding. If applied
wrongly, it cuts off the blood
supply and can lead to the loss
of the limb; it should only
be used for severe and
profuse bleeding. Wrap 
a tie or similar strip above
the bleeding wound and tie
with a releasable knot. Slip a stick or 
pen into the knot and twist until bleeding
stops. Release after less than 10 minutes
and reapply intermittently if needed.
Use a section cut from 
a pair of tights to secure
ear in position
Keep bandage
applied to wound
Dressing a bleeding ear
Immobilizing the ear prevents blood loss when the dog
shakes his head. Apply absorbent pads to each side of the
ear and secure them in place with a stretchy bandage or a
section of tights, taking care not to restrict the breathing.

TRAINING A DOG
Training your dog is vital if you are to forge a pleasurable
relationship, as an untrained individual will be a constant source of
concern. Dogs share a range of needs, feelings, and emotions with us,
but they’re not people in disguise. To your dog, you and your family
are the pack leaders. It’s up to you to teach your dog compliance.
Good habits to get into
You need to toilet-train your
pup from an early age if
the two of you are 
to share a happy
relationship.
A little give-and-take
You command and your dog
obeys – that’s the theory. 
If it is to work, training
demands patience
and enthusiasm.  
THE IMPORTANCE OF TRAINING
I’ve been in veterinary practice for over
35 years, but it took only the first few
months of meeting dogs and their
owners for me to realize that answering
questions about training is as vital a role
for vets as preventing or treating illness
and disease. Dogs’ behaviour makes or
breaks the bond between them and us. 
I see relationships that are fraught, fraying,
or broken, not because the dog is doing
anything other than behaving like a dog,
but because its owner can’t comprehend
that problems have arisen because they
haven’t trained their dogs properly. 
The word “training” can sound a little
dull, but when you’re talking about dog
training, nothing could be further from
the truth. For a dog, playing is training.
When you throw a ball or a stick for
Rover, he is unwittingly (or, in some
cases, instinctively) learning to retrieve.
And those who’ve mopped up after their
puppy for the umpteenth time following
another mess in the house won’t argue
that training is just another chore –
housetraining is essential. 
Basic obedience is the very least one
can expect of a dog owner to instil in
their pet. A dog that has never been
taught the “Stay” command, 
for example, is in very real danger from
everyday situations, such as passing
traffic or other dogs. Even walking on a
lead – something every dog is expected
to do – is a skill that canines have to
learn, so that they don’t surge forwards
or jump up or climb and chew the lead.
For the truly gifted pooch, or likewise
for the most recalcitrant mutt, advanced
training offers something a little extra.
Those dogs who have excelled at basic
training may benefit from a step-up in
learning – beauty contests and agility
training, for example. At the other 
end of the scale, dogs who refuse to 
act upon your teachings, or those with
difficulties in learning, can always be
recommended to an animal behaviourist,
a personal trainer, or even veterinary
help to aid them in progressing.

Think dog thoughts
Set sensible
goals
Dog training
takes patience on
your part. Training
two dogs at the
same time is extremely
difficult and is best left to
professional dog trainers only. 
He looks up to you
Your dog isn’t just asking for 
a tickle when he rolls over; he is 
also telling you, through this classic
submissive action, that he sees you
as a natural leader.
UNDERSTAND YOUR DOG’S POTENTIAL
Each dog has its own personality and
this affects its ability or, in some
instances, its willingness, to be
trained. Dominant and confident
dogs may disregard or even challenge
your commands. At the other
end of the personality
spectrum, overtly
submissive dogs may 
be so insecure that at the
mere hint of a command
the dog simply rolls over in trepidation. 
Fortunately, the vast majority of
dogs are content to compromise. Their
natural curiosity, combined with their
affinity for people, makes them easy to
train. Remember, most dogs have mixed
personalities. Some want to please and 
at the same time can be easily distracted.
Others may seem intensely submissive,
but in fact control your behaviour by
acting in a helpless way. Each dog has
greater potential in some areas and 
lesser potential in others.
UNDERSTAND YOUR OWN LIMITATIONS
If you don’t have much patience,
another member of your family should
be primarily responsible for training your
dog. Dog training can be frustrating and
it is easy to make two common mistakes.
The easiest trap to fall into is to treat
your dog like a person. All that Sparky
hears when you say, “If you do that
once more Sparky, I’ll get really, really
angry” is “Sparky”. You’re wasting
your breath issuing warnings, as
dogs don’t understand conditional
threats. They understand cause
and effect. The other mistake to
avoid is the misuse of discipline.
Discipline should only be
theatrical. It’s pointless to take
out your own frustrations by
inflicting pain or retribution
on your pet. All you will do
is make your dog fear you.
Dogs think in the present. When training your dog, timing is vital.
Use both rewards and discipline instantaneously, within seconds,
either to reward achievement or to correct bad behaviour. Mistakes
should be disregarded, not punished.

Train with certainty
This dog is being told to “Come”, with the certainty that if
she does not respond she can be induced to do so through
the training line attached to her collar.
A few well-chosen words
Dogs have a great capacity to understand both words and
your tone of voice. Associate words of praise with other
potent rewards, such as food or touch.
PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
Dogs respond best to
training through rewards
and, to most dogs, the
most powerful reward is
tasty food. Train your dog
before meals when he is
hungry using food treats 
to reward compliance. 
Chew toys can be equally
potent rewards. Touch is
also welcome; a stroke 
to the neck or body is
immensely rewarding for
tactile dogs, but avoid a pat on the head
for submissive individuals. Always give
verbal praise with any more potent
reward. Eventually your words alone 
will be sufficient to satisfy your dog.
Only give commands during training 
if you know you can enforce them. For
example, when training your dog to
“Come”, have your dog on a long line. 
If he is distracted, you can use the line,
not to reel him in, but to regain his
attention as you attract him with a food
lure and the potential reward of your
praising him and stroking him.
Set achievable targets for your dog. 
For example, don’t expect him to bark 
at “baddies” when they approach your
front door, but not bark at other people.
Don’t expect him to stay off furniture
when you visit friends if you allow him
on furniture at home. Don’t expect him
not to beg at the table if you occasionally
give him something from your plate.
Don’t expect more from your dog than
you would from a 3-year-old child.
TRAINING GUIDELINES
In all aspects of your relationship with your dog,
including active training and relaxed play, follow these
guidelines and you’ll have a well-mannered companion.
■Be consistent.
■Give clear, concise commands.
■Give one command at a time and be sure to always
reward compliance.
■Use your dog’s name when giving a command.
■Always initiate activity. You’re the leader.
■Finish any training activity with a spot of fun 
to leave your dog wanting more.

Dogs are honorary members of our families, and playing with them
and having fun with them is at the heart of this satisfying relationship.
We need to remember, however, that we have our own rules of play,
which are different from theirs. Train your dog to play by your rules.
The importance of play
PLAY HAS A PURPOSE
By playing together as pups, dogs learn
social and hunting skills. They become
physically dextrous, adroit at ambush,
chase, and tackle. As with humans, a
pup’s desire to play is perpetuated into
adulthood. Both humans and dogs are
naturally “neotenized” species: we carry
into adulthood a range of juvenile
characteristics. Adult dogs continue 
their playful activity to preserve social
relationships and simply to have fun. 
Visit your local park and it’s easy to 
see that fetch games are one of the most
rewarding activities for dog and owner.
Even non-retrieving
breeds of dog have 
a yearning to chase and return objects to
their owner. However, make sure you call
it quits long before your obsessive friend
collapses from over-exertion. 
Play is a fine way to train your dog to
accept commands from children, asserting
their higher ranking in the pack hierarchy,
but restrict this solely to fetch games.
Avoid tug-of-war games; ensure that your
dog doesn’t unwittingly feel it owns some
of your children’s toys; and watch out for
inadvertent teasing, especially with food.
Mutual fun
Playful behaviour is a lifelong activity. Playing with your
dog is rewarding on so many levels, providing you both
with mental and physical stimulation, while at the same
time teaching your dog that he plays by your rules.

315
T H E  I M P O R T A N C E  O F  P L A Y
PLAYING WITH OTHER DOGS
Some male dogs are only interested 
in play as a prelude to mating, and some
insecure dogs are so frightened of canine
social activity that they will bite out of
fear. The majority of dogs, however, enjoy
playing with each other, even on first
encounters, especially if they are still
relatively young. Play among friends
usually involves chasing, shadow boxing,
and neck chewing. Just be careful that 
a tug-of-war over sticks or toys doesn’t
escalate into possessive aggression.
TYPES OF TOYS
Choose toys that are both appropriate 
for different types of play and provide 
a variety of differing rewards.
All dogs, not just puppies, need to chew,
and in the absence of prey to gnaw on,
they need chew toys. Rawhide is excellent,
as are dried pig’s ears and sterilized
bones, though be alert to the possible
danger of fractured teeth. Hard rubber
chew toys with hollow insides are also
available. They serve two purposes: they
are chewable and they can be filled with
food rewards, such as spreadable cheese
or peanut butter, to make them even
more stimulating for your dog.
Squeak toys belong to you, not your 
dog, and are best played with for only 
a short time. Soft sheepskin-like material
surrounding a squeaker makes an ideal
toy. So do very thin-skinned rubber balls
with squeakers inside; dogs are less
inclined to chew on squeak toys that
collapse under the slightest pressure.
Give this toy to your dog as a treat.  
A hard rubber ball on a rope, a Frisbee,
a rubber ring, or an erratically bouncing
Kong all make suitable fetch toys, and
there is a vast selection of purpose-made
tug-of-war toys for dogs. Make sure the
toy suits the dog: avoid strenuous fetch
games for dogs with potential joint
problems, and forget about tug-of-war
with dogs with dominant personalities –
your position as pack leader will be
jeopardized if you let them win. 
A small, empty plastic water bottle is a
great homemade toy. A slight nudge with
the nose gets it rolling. Add a little water,
and it is more exciting. Don’t allow your
pup to chew through the plastic though.
Canine play
These dogs are innocently playing a favourite game, 
tug-of-war, but through this activity they learn which 
is the naturally more dominant individual.
Squeak and carry toys
It’s probably best not to think
too much about why dogs
like playing with squeak 
(or kill) toys! Your dog
should learn that these
belong to you and are 
given only as a reward.
SPOILT FOR CHOICE
Don’t overwhelm your dog with toys. Initially provide 
a maximum of three, each with a unique “feel” in the
mouth when he chews them. If you give him too great
a variety of textures and “feels” he will think he is
allowed to chew anything, including your carpets,
furniture, and walls.

eliminates. As 
a general rule, a 
3-month-old puppy needs
to eliminate every three
hours. Plan a house-training
programme, then you’ll know that 
your dog may want to relieve himself:
■After eating (sometimes within a 
minute of walking away from his bowl).
■After waking up.
■After play or exercise.
■Following a bout of excitement, such 
as meeting new faces.
Take him to his designated toilet area
frequently and certainly after under-
taking any of the above activities.

Housetraining can make or break your relationship with your dog.
Never punish when your dog messes inside. That only leads to skilful
avoidance of you. Housetraining is simple if you are sensible,
conscientious, alert, and – most importantly – consistent.
Housetraining
GETTING DOWN TO BUSINESS
If your dog experiences any difficulties
learning housetraining be aware that it 
is almost certainly not your dog’s fault.
Dogs are instinctively clean animals, 
so soiling their nest is the last thing they
would want to do. Perhaps one of the
first lessons a puppy learns, after his
mother consumes all the waste her 
pup leaves in the nest, is the need to 
be houseproud. As the new pack leader, 
it is your responsibility to teach your 
dog that your entire home is “the nest”.
WORK WITH YOUR DOG
It is easiest to housetrain your dog 
if you have immediate access to the
outdoors. Before a dog even arrives 
in your home, choose a toilet area,
preferably a hard surface rather than
grass, away from any activities and
distractions. Have poop scoops available
to clean up immediately after your dog
Ready to go
A dog that puts its nose
down and sniffs intently
is usually signalling that
it is about to eliminate,
so always be alert to
this kind of behaviour.
Choose the site
This pup has found a place it is happy 
to urinate in. Dogs prefer to pee on grass, but
their acid urine often kills it. You may prefer 
to train your dog to eliminate on hard surfaces. 

317
H O U S E T R A I N I N G
URGENT SIGNALS
Your dog will give clues that he has 
to relieve himself. These include:
■Sniffing the floor.
■Circling.
■Running with his nose to the floor.
■Getting ready to squat.
■Moving in the direction of the door 
to his toilet area.
If you see him start any of these activities,
get his attention and immediately take
him outside. Where possible, don’t pick
your dog up, but let him walk to the door.
Choose a phrase you’re happy to say in
public and use this every time your dog
eliminates. “Do it” is a short, sharp word
cue. Your dog will quickly associate these
words with his toilet, and this phrase
alone will soon induce him to “do it”.
PUNISHMENT IS POINTLESS
Accidents will happen. When you see
your dog about to squat in the house, get
his attention by any means that he finds
interesting but not threatening. Pushing
his nose in his mess is utterly pointless. It
only teaches him to be frightened of you
when he messes. Instead, once you have
his attention, quickly lead him outdoors
to his toilet area and let him
finish off his business. If he
has already messed in the
house, keep him in another
THE IMPORTANCE OF HOUSETRAINING
Lack of housetraining can lead to:
■Never being fully housetrained.
■Sex-related urine marking, or lack of sexual maturity.
■Submissive urinating.
■Fear, stress, anxiety, or emotional conflict.
■High excitement.
■Changes in who is top dog in a multi-dog home.
■Medical problems.
If your previously reliable dog suddenly starts soiling
the house, always contact your vet for advice.
room while you clean up after him. 
Your dog is less likely to mess indoors
again if you “neutralize” the affected
area with a commercial odour eliminator.
CRATE TRAINING
Introduced early in life, a crate is a dog’s personal den.
A dog instinctively feels comfortable in a crate and is
unlikely to mess in it. It is worth training a puppy to
eat, play, and sleep in a crate, because it will come 
to enjoy the reassurance of this container when it is
home alone, or when travelling in a car. What’s more,
crate training speeds up housetraining because your
dog is either in his crate, taken out of the crate and
eliminating where you want, or safely wandering around
your home for a while because both tanks have just
been emptied. Using a crate also frees you up to spend
time on things other than 24-hour puppy watch. In short,
crate training provides the solution to a variety of
behaviour problems before they happen.

All dogs can learn basic obedience, but to teach your 
dog requires great patience from you. Use consistent
hand and word signals, keep the training sessions short,
and maintain an upright posture and strong eye contact. 
Basic obedience
COMING TO YOU
This is the easiest command for a dog to learn. To 
start with, divide his meals into ten equal portions, and
throughout the day entice him to his food bowl using his
name and the command “Come”. Once he responds
reliably, move on to the steps shown below. Never call 
your dog to you to discipline him: always go to him.

eye contact

2
As your dog moves towards you,
bend down and hold the food
treat out to him. Encourage him with
the positive words “Come. Good dog”.
3
As he reaches you, kneel down
to get closer to his level. Praise 
him with words and a gentle stroke, 
and give him the food reward. To
maintain his interest, vary the locations
in which the training takes place.
DOG CLASSES
Dog training books, videos, and
CDs are fine, but there’s nothing
better than teaching your dog 
in the presence of an efficient 
dog trainer. Dog classes are like
pre-school for kids, but not quite
as unruly! The pups thrive on the
social activity and, at the
same time, the owners
receive an excellent
refresher course in all
aspects of dog training.

for virtually any dog to learn successfully 
to follow this sequence of commands. 
To ensure that you are always in control,
attach a lead to your dog’s collar.

1
Facing your dog, move away with 
the lead in your left hand and

command him to come to you, show
him the food. Stay calm, and do not
excite your dog during this exercise.
2
As he reaches you, begin to
slowly move the food treat above
his head. The dog will naturally want
to sit in order to keep his eyes on the
treat. As he begins to bend his hind
legs, give the command “Sit”. 
REFUSING TO SIT
If your dog does not sit for a 
food treat, hold his collar with
one hand and, while giving the
command “Sit”, tuck his hind-
quarters under with the other. 
Be careful not to push down hard
on his spine, but instead gently
squeeze the base of his lower
back to settle him. Praise him
once he is sitting. If he meekly
collapses, encourage him with 
a toy, then try again later.

“Stay” 
WHY “STAY” MATTERS
Training a dog to “Stay” doesn’t just
ensure that you can leave him outside
safely while you pop into the shops.
“Stay” training is a potential life-saver.
Busy roads, coastal paths, and even 
other dogs can be a hazard to your
pooch. For this simple reason, “Stay”
may be the most important command 
you ever teach your dog.
If your pup has mastered “Come” and “Sit”, he has
learned to follow a sequence of commands. “Stay” is
simply a prolonged variation of “Sit”. It is especially
useful when you anticipate possible dangers.
1
First, command your dog to “Sit”. 
Hold a food treat in your hand so
that the dog can see it. Make sure
his head is up, looking at your face,
but do not stand too close; he should
not be looking up vertically. Choose a
location with few distractions so that
your dog’s attention is fully on you.
3
Keep the duration of the first 
“Sit–Stay” commands short.
When your dog sits and stays
obediently, give the food treat and
praise him. Conclude “Stay” by
using the release word “Finished”.
Gradually increase the duration 
of the “Stay” command on each
occasion, making the food rewards
intermittent while still praising him.

Show your dog the palm of your
hand while you command “Stay”.
Take a few steps back. If your dog
moves, start the exercise again from
the beginning. Over several sessions,
gradually increase the distance that
you move away from your dog, until
you are at the limit of the lead.

PRAISE AND REWARD
To get the best out of your training sessions, learn how
and when to show appreciation for your dog’s efforts.
■Avoid giving your dog excessive praise, especially
when finishing training. The excitement may teach 
him to jump around and be overly exuberant. 
■If food treats turn your dog into a whirling dervish
and he can’t concentrate, stop the training session.
Train him later, on a fuller stomach.
LIE DOWN
“Lie down” needs only a little more 
work than “Stay”: the action itself is
perfectly natural to your dog. Your initial
aim is for your dog to comply with your
command “Lie down”. Once this is
achieved, gradually extend the duration
until he lies down for as long as you say.
3
Continue moving the treat along the
floor until your dog is completely lying
down. Praise him with “Good down”, and
reward with the treat. Repeat the exercise
frequently until your dog responds 
to words alone.

With your dog in a “Sit” position, kneel to his right

dog’s nose, and then start moving your hand downwards.
2
As your dog follows the food treat with his nose,
sweep your hand in an arc, forwards and downwards. 
As your dog starts to lie down to keep its nose by the
treat, give the command “Lie down”. 
REFUSING TO LIE DOWN
If your dog refuses to lie down,
kneel as before and lift – but don’t
grip – his forelegs with the palms
of your hands. Raise him into a
begging position and then lower
him into a lying position as you 
give the command “Lie down”.
Then immediately reward him 
both verbally and with a treat. If 
he won’t stay down, apply gentle
pressure to his withers, and then
reward him for lying down.

With careful training, most of us manage to teach our dogs to come, 
sit, and stay. Teaching walking to heel, with your dog not pulling on
his lead, is more difficult. This takes time and perseverance but is
essential if you and your dog are to share a happy outdoor relationship.

Give the release command “OK” and start walking 
with your left leg first. Let your dog feel only the
slightest tension on the lead. As your dog moves forwards,
give the command “Heel”. If he surges forwards, slide
your hand down the lead to his collar and very gently 
pull back and give the command “Steady”.
1
Attach your dog’s lead to his well-fitted, comfortable 
collar and, with the lead and a food treat in your right
hand, stand to his right. Give the commands “Sit” and
“Stay”. Make sure you hold the slack in the lead with 
your left hand, ready to slide down to the collar if your 
dog decides to make a run for it.
PLAN AHEAD
Don’t expect your dog to understand “Heel” training
until he is reliably obedience trained to “Come–Sit–Stay”
on command. By now, he should feel comfortable
wearing his collar, as well as a lightweight training 
lead. Train indoors first, ideally in a hallway with no
distractions. Slowly graduate to a quiet area outdoors.
Build up to more distracting environments only once
your puppy is comfortable with “Heel” training. Keep
sessions short – between 5 and 15 minutes at a time, and
never when the dog is tired. Think about which leg you
use first when you start walking: your pup takes his cue
from your lead leg. The steps below assume you lead with
your left leg; if not, start the dog on your other side.

ALL DOGS ARE TOY DOGS
Sometimes food is too powerful a reward – a
dog pays attention only to the food, and not
to the training. Less commonly, some dogs
are not interested in food rewards. In
either situation, use a toy that triggers
interest as a reward. Train your dog to
value the toy, to want to possess
it, by tantalizing him with it
before giving it to him.

After walking only a few steps, stop and immediately

walk together as you grow in confidence.

Left turns are a little more

control him closely. Keep your dog
close to your left leg, and give the
command “Steady” as you slow him
down before turning.
4
Once your dog heels reliably, you
can begin to introduce turns to the
right. As you walk forwards, use your
left hand gently to guide him to the
right, and as he begins to turn, give
the command “Heel”.

Dogs don’t bark or howl when left alone, or dig under the fence, 
or chew your carpets, furniture, or wallpaper, for no reason at all.
Dogs don’t do these things “to get even”. They behave in these 
ways because they are bored and don’t like having nothing to do.
Destructive behaviour
BOREDOM
Prolonged boredom leads to anxiety,
which leads to creativity, which produces
mayhem. Prevention is always easier and
better than trying to overcome a problem.
Make your dog’s life more stimulating.
That’s easier said than done, but here
are some suggestions.
■Before leaving your dog home alone,
get out a favourite toy and rub it in 
your hands to leave your scent on it.
■Make sure your dog has had mental,
physical, and social activity before you
leave. Exhausted dogs are less likely 
to bark, dig, chew, or destroy.
■Feed your dog before you depart. 
Dogs are more likely to curl up and sleep
on a full stomach after a good meal.
■Leave quietly, without fuss. And no
smoochy goodbyes. Draw the curtains
and leave the television on, especially 
if there’s an animal channel available.
■Never leave your dog at home all day.
Arrange for a neighbour or dog walker
to visit and exercise your pooch.
The importance of play
Think of your dog as a coiled spring,
crammed full of energy every day. Playing
with him releases this energy, conquers
boredom, and leaves him feeling
relaxed, happy, and thankful for
the attention.
Employ a dog walker
A dog walker is a great help if, on occasion, you’re not
there to exercise your pooch, but this isn’t sufficient when
you’re away. Consider kennels or a professional dog sitter.
Bored, bored, bored
All dogs need stimulation to prevent them from getting
bored. A dog with nothing to do is an unhappy dog, so
always ensure you leave plenty to keep him occupied.

325
D E S T R U C T I V E  B E H A V I O U R
2
Once your dog understands the
command “Speak” he can be
taught “Quiet”. Command “Quiet”
when he is barking and then give the
toy and a verbal reward as soon as
he stops. This takes time. Be patient.
3
When your dog routinely
responds to the “Quiet” command
while barking, increase steadily the
distance between the two of you.
Reward compliance only with a verbal
“Good dog” – stop using the toy now.
DIGGING AND FENCE JUMPING
If you have an instinctive digger, lay chicken wire 
just under the soil where you don’t want your dog
to dig. Or try channelling his energy into an
area of the garden where you have provided
a safe, sandy pit for him to dig in. 
To prevent fence jumping, a line 
of tin cans strung on a rope
around 30cm (12in) from
the fence and 1m (3ft)
off the ground make 
a safe, noisy deterrent.
BARKING AND HOWLING
Barking through boredom is a difficult
problem to overcome. The best way 
to turn off barking is to train your dog 
to “Speak” on command. This exercise
takes patience and time on your part; 
if you can stick to it, you are a marvellous
and dedicated dog owner.
CHEWING
Some pups go through an excessive chewing phase
between 6 and 12 months of age. If your dog does,
provide him with exciting chew toys and restrict him 
to his crate (see p.317) when you’re not able to keep an
eagle eye on him. Apply taste deterrents to any objects 
you do not want your dog to chew.
1
Attach your dog’s lead to a fence
and then play with a toy, out of his
reach, until he barks with excitement.
As he does so, give the command
“Speak” and reward him with the 
toy and the words “Good dog”. 
4
With your dog reliably trained to stop barking at 
the “Quiet”command, set up mock departures from
home, commanding “Quiet” before you leave. Stand
outside the door or garden gate. If he barks, make a noise
to startle him to stop barking, then return and praise him
for being quiet. It’s time-consuming, but it works.

We offer dogs comfort, security, and a lifetime
supply of food. But there are disadvantages to
this lifestyle, the greatest being a lack of mental
stimulation, leading to over-excitement. 
Over-excitement
PULLING ON THE LEAD
Dogs seemingly invented one of the basic laws 
of physics: “For every action there is an equal
and opposite reaction.” Pulling on the lead is 
by far the most common problem dog owners
experience. What complicates matters is that by
pulling back to rein in your dog, you only make
him pull harder. To rectify this problem, return
to the basics of dog walking (see pp.322–323).
Think of the lead as a guide, not a restraint,
and remain mentally focused on walking. You
want your dog to be aware of you, to feel your
presence subtly through the lead. Remember, you
are in control. Anticipate and interrupt your dog’s
thoughts of lunging forwards by luring his mind, as
well as his body, back to where you want him to be.
PREVENTING PULLING
You want to take your dog for a leisurely walk, not 
start a frantic game of tug-of-war. Do not attempt to
match your strength against your dog’s. If retraining
your dog in basic obedience (see pp.318–319) doesn’t
improve things, you need to follow the
remedial techniques shown below.
Reward 
is given
1
In a quiet location, start to walk 
forwards with your dog on your
left, your left hand on the lead near
his collar, and the right hand holding
the end of the lead. As your dog
starts pulling, stop walking and
immediately slide your hand down 
to his collar. Gently but firmly, pull
him back to the heel position. Try to
avoid pulling on the lead repeatedly.
2
When your dog is back in the 
correct position, command “Sit”
and verbally reward him for doing 
so. With him once more under your
control, start to walk again, giving
the command “Heel”. After a few
paces, stop and repeat the command
“Sit”. Repeat the procedure every
time your dog pulls forwards until 
it learns to stop pulling on the lead.
3
Only when he is walking 
sensibly and obediently to heel,
without pulling on his lead, do you
reward him with a food treat.
Gradually increase the distance you
walk together, and, as in basic “Heel”
training, start to move from the quiet
location you chose when retraining
began to ever-more stimulating and
distracting environments.

327
O V E R - E X C I T E M E N T
HEAD HALTERS
For some dogs, walking or being
trained while on a lead actually
incites them to pull. Use a head
halter on these headstrong
individuals. The lead clips 
to a ring under the dog’s 
jaw. When the dog pulls
forwards on the lead, his
own momentum pulls the
head down (and jaws
shut). Common sense
says stop pulling.
Not the leader of the pack
Even a normally well-behaved dog can start pulling
when he visits an unfamiliar and exciting place like
the beach. However, you must bring him under
control; allowing your dog to pull you along
undermines your role as pack leader.
Jumping up
Small dogs are particularly prone to jumping up. If someone
approaches your dog to stroke him, get your dog to sit so
that the person has to bend down to pet him.
PREVENTING OVER-EXCITEMENT
Dogs show they are excited by barking
and pulling on the lead (see opposite), or 
by jumping up. Try the following if your
dog jumps at visitors:
■First, ensure your dog is in another
room when visitors arrive.  
■If visitors are willing to participate in
retraining, put your dog on its lead, use
the positive command “Sit”, and ensure
your dog complies before visitors enter. 
■Instruct your visitors to move slowly
and avoid eye contact with your dog
upon entering the room. 
■Reward quiet compliance with a food
treat and a hushed “Good dog”.
■Allow your dog to be approached or
touched by your visitors only after he has
responded to your obedience command
and shows no signs of jumping up. 
Attention-seeker
Nipping at your ankles and clothes is an unwelcome form
of dog flattery. Offer him a toy as a distraction as soon as
he begins to play a little too exuberantly.

Understanding aggression
Some dogs are born with a greater
tendency to become aggressive, but
problems occur only where owners
“encourage” the development 
of a dog’s aggressive potential.
AGGRESSION AWARENESS
There is always a reason, obvious to 
the dog but sometimes less so to us, 
why canines bite. Most dogs are skilled 
at giving body-language warning signs
before biting. We fail if we see these
signs but do nothing about them.
Different forms of aggression should
be treated in different ways, but all
should ultimately be eliminated.
DANGER SIGNS TO WATCH OUT FOR
Does your dog:
■Growl at you, other people, or other animals?
■Show his teeth to you, other people, 
or other animals?
■Snap, growl, or show his teeth when 
you approach his food or toys?
■Hide when approached by strangers 
or when you have visitors?
■Nip at your face or limbs when 
playing with you?
■Chase cats, wildlife, livestock,
joggers, or bicycles?
■Give you prolonged 
cold stares?
■Make you invent excuses,
telling people, “It’s just a
phase he’s going through”?
If you answer “Yes” to any of these
questions, your dog has the potential
to become aggressive.
It’s embarrassing, and startling, when a canine member of your
family shows unexpected aggression, but we forget too easily that
there’s a carnivore under that benign dog exterior. Aggression takes
many forms. Fortunately, most can be prevented or controlled.
Aggression 

FEARFUL AGGRESSION
Fear is the most common reason why dogs
bite strangers. It occurs most commonly
in poorly socialized individuals and dogs
with low self-confidence. Fear-biting dogs
have usually learned from experience not
to trust humans. Aggression is used to
make a “threat” go away.
■TREATMENT: Tell visitors to avoid eye
contact with your dog. Equip them with
food treats to throw on the floor so that
your dog gets a mixed message: strangers
are worrisome but, then again, they
bring rewards. This will develop trust.
SEX-RELATED AGGRESSION
Mothers suckling their pups may be
outwardly aggressive to humans and
other dogs. Male dogs may pick fights
with other male dogs to assert superiority. 
■TREATMENT: Neutering can eliminate
sexual drawbacks, and is a sensible way
to reduce sex-related aggression.
POSSESSIVE AGGRESSION
Growling and showing teeth are classic
signs of possessive aggression. Some dogs
become protective over food or toys and
are liable to bite other dogs – or their
owners – if their possessions are touched. 
■TREATMENT: Train your dog to be
touched while eating. Offer a treat even
tastier than his own food, and he will
soon learn to enjoy your presence. If
he bites to retain possession of a toy,
confiscate the toy permanently.
PREDATORY AGGRESSION
Dogs are carnivores. They naturally 
chase and kill animals, especially small
ones. This is a basic and primitive form
of aggression. Early socializing, and
channelling a puppy’s desire to chase
toys, are the best forms of prevention.  
■TREATMENT: Seek professional help.
DOMINANCE AGGRESSION
Dogs instinctively understand pack
hierarchy, but some dogs want to be pack
leaders. They assess you and your family
members for some time and eventually
challenge for the position by biting. 
■TREATMENT: Avoid any form of physical
punishment – it is provocative and may
make matters worse. Always have a lead
or houseline attached to your dog’s collar.
Use a muzzle if warranted. Through body
posture, facial expression, and tone of
voice, assert your position as pack leader.
At the hint of a challenge, move your
dog into isolation for a symbolic minute,
then release him and ignore him.
TERRITORIAL AGGRESSION
This is the postman’s worst nightmare. A
dog is most confident on its own territory,
and will potentially protect its home,
garden, or car. Many of us encourage
our dogs to bark protectively, which
promotes potential territorial aggression.
■TREATMENT: Make a point of rewarding
your dog for not being aggressive to
delivery people. Leave food treats in a
weatherproof box at your gate or door
with instructions to visitors to take treats
and toss them to your dog when they
enter your property.

Fear factor
The snap of a fearful dog’s jaws may look like dominant
aggression, but the reason for it is often low self-esteem.
Fear biting is most likely in dogs that as puppies did not
have the opportunity to meet lots of people.
Barks and bites
Aggression between two dogs is more likely to occur when
both are relatively equal – same sex, age, and size. Trouble
is more probable in dogs that as puppies were allowed
to play rough games without correction.

In virtually all activities we undertake, we learn from experienced
others. Advanced training can help the top dogs better themselves, as
well as aiding those dogs who find learning more of a struggle. Either
way, it’s a sure sign of your firm commitment towards your dog.
Advanced training
WHAT IS ADVANCED TRAINING?
Advanced training is a set of commands, routines, and
exercises developed especially for those dogs who have
gone as far as they can with the teaching and guidance
available and are ready for another challenge. Whether
they are an animal behaviourist’s worst nightmare or a
rescue dog as intelligent as a canine Einstein, any type
of dog can benefit from advanced training. 
OBEDIENCE CLASSES
Dog trainers at obedience classes can advise you on the
basics of living with a dog, helping you to understand
what a dog is and how it functions. While you learn
more about your dog, your dog will learn self-control,
social skills, and any basic exercises you weren’t able 
to teach it yourself. Your veterinary receptionist will
probably know who the best trainers are in your area.
Alternatively, contact one of the training organizations
listed on pages 334–335.
PERSONAL TRAINERS
While classes are ideal for standard obedience training,
there’s nothing more efficient and rewarding than one-
to-one training. If you can afford one, a personal trainer
can individually cater for you and your dog’s needs,
addressing any particular difficulties and problems. 
Gunning for success
This gundog is being taught a highly
specialized set of commands. Soon 
he will be adept at directional control,
retrieval, water work, and understanding
whistle and hand signals.
IN A CLASS OF THEIR OWN
A dog show may appear to be
nothing more than a beauty
contest, but it’s not. Winners 
are more than just good-lookers. 
The best in show are superbly
trained to behave obediently,
confidently, and with panache
when being examined or parading
in the ring. Unofficial dog shows
can be more relaxed events,
allowing any dog
to compete.

RESIDENTIAL TRAINING
There are excellent trainers who offer
residential courses for dogs, but sending
your pet away for a week isn’t the best
option for solving routine problems. Most
problems occur because of us – either
what we do with our dogs, or because 
of our unwarranted expectations of what
we think they can do.
VETERINARY HELP
Most vets today are well
aware of the importance 
of effective training and 
the negative effects 
of problematic canine
behaviour. Some clinics
arrange their own
training programmes
and many vets have
products available such
as drugs and pheromone
sprays, which may be
useful when treating
behaviour disorders.
ADVANCED OBEDIENCE
For those dogs who 
like to be mentally and
physically challenged,
advanced obedience
could be the answer. 
In pursuit of excellence
This Rough Collie takes flight as it participates in an
organized agility show. The aim of the game is to get 
your dog around a course “clear” (without faults) and 
within the specified course time.
Why not try his paw at agility training –
jumping hurdles, walking beams, climbing
A-frames, leaping through tyres, and so
on? Many traditional herding or sledding
breeds enjoy the challenge of sheep trials
or sledding races. Field trials to test a
dog’s abilities to point, flush, or retrieve
game are a good choice for hunting
breeds. Or what about trying Flyball?
This popular sport, dominated by Border
Collies, pits one team of four dogs against
another. The teams are trained to run
a course, hit a pad that releases a ball,
catch the ball, and run with it back
to the starting line in the fastest time.
Agility ability
A Belgian Shepherd
Dog learns how to
use weave poles 
as part of its agility
training. The course
is a test of speed
under pressure.

Author’s acknowledgments
Thanks to everyone at the Portman Veterinary Clinic, particularly my colleague Simon Lewi, 
for creating extra “writing time” for me, and to the delightful people at Studio Cactus, all of
whom worked efficiently—dare I say doggedly—to create this book. Special thanks to Candida

Her freelance help from home was superb.
