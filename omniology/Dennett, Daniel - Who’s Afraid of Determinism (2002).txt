INCOMPAT I B I L I S M ,  the view that free will and determinism are incompatible, sub­
sists on two widely accepted but deeply confused theses concerning possibility and 
causation: (1) In a deterministic universe, one can never truthfully utter the sen­
tence "I could have done otherwise," and (2) In such universes, one can never 
really take credit for having caused an event, since in fact all events have been 
predetermined by conditions during the universe's birth. Throughout the free will 
literature, one finds variations on these two themes, often intermixed in various 
ways. When Robert Nozick1 describes our longing for "originative value," he ap­
parently has thesis (2) in mind, and thesis (1) may underlie his assertion that "we 
want it to be true that in that very same situation we could have done (signifi­
cantly) otherwise." John Austin, in a famous footnote, flirts with thesis (1): 
Consider the case where I miss a very short putt and kick myself because I 
could have holed it. It is not that I should have holed it if I had tried: I did 
try, and missed. It is not that I should have holed it if conditions had been 
different: that might of course be so, but I am talking about conditions as they

precisely were, and asserting that I could have holed it. There is the rub. Nor 
does "I can hole it this time" mean that I shall hole it this time if I try or if 
anything else; for I may try and miss, and yet not be convinced that I could 
not have done it; indeed, further experiments may confirm my belief that I 
could have done it that time, although I did not.> 
(In later sections we discuss at length the ways in which this particular quote can 
lead readers astray.) Meanwhile, Robert Kane, in The Significance of Free Will, 
eloquently proclaims the importance of our presumed ability truly to cause events, 
the ability that thesis (2) addresses: 
Why do we want free will? We want it because we want ultimate responsibility. 
And why do we want that? For the reason that children and adults take delight 
in their accomplishment from the earliest moments of their awakening as per­
sons, whether these accomplishments are making a fist or walking upright or 
composing a symphony.3 
Elsewhere in the free will debate, one often finds authors advancing definitions 
that confirm the relevance of possibilities and causes. Kane describes free will 
itself, for instance, as "the power of agents to be the ultimate creators . . .  and 
sustainers of their own ends and purposes."4 The key words here are power and 
creator. Intuition suggests that the term power is intertwined with possibility 
roughly as follows: agent A has the power to do X if and only if it is possible that 
A does (will do) X. And certainly, to be a creator, one has to be the cause of 
changes in the world; one has to "make a difference" in how the world runs. Kane 
provides some other significant concepts: 
Alternative Possibilities (AP): The agent has alternative possibilities . . .  with re­
spect to A at t [iff] at t the agent can (has the power or ability to) do A and 
can do otherwise.s 
Ultimate Responsibility (UR): An agent is ultimately responsible for some (event 
or state) E's occurring only if (R) . . .  something the agent voluntarily . . .  did or 
omitted and for which the agent could have voluntarily done otherwise . .  . 
causally contributed to E . . .  , and (U) for every X and Y . . .  [I]f the agent is 
personally responsible for X, and if Y is an arche (or sufficient ground or cause 
or explanation) for X, then the agent must also be personally responsible for 
y'6 
Carl Ginet in a similar vein proposes: 
Two or more alternatives are open to me at a given moment if which of them I 
do next is entirely up to my choice at that moment: Nothing that exists up to 
that moment stands in the way of my doing next any one of the alternatives.? 
Whether or not these definitions are entirely dependable, they are emblematic of 
the central role of the concepts of causation and possibility in our understanding 
of free will.

259 
In short, the acceptance of theses (1) and (2) lies at the heart of incompati­
bilism. Incompatibilists dread determinism because they suspect that a determin­
istic universe would lack the sorts of open possibilities that we cherish and deprive 
us of the ability to cause changes to the world in a meaningful way. Accordingly, 
they find heartening the discovery of indeterminacy in modern quantum me­
chanics, and they hope to discover indeterministic quantum events at the root of 
each free agent's decision-making ability. Kane ingeniously attempts a naturalistic, 
scientifically respectable account of indeterministic free will, and yet the arcane 
processes he describes are strangely dissatisfying as a new foundation for human 
freedom and dignity. Not only do they seem oddly "outside of our control," but 
they are so subtle that, very likely, scientists will be unable to confirm their rel­
evance to our mental life for the foreseeable future. 
To avoid the sort of impasse that Kane and other incompatibilists have ap­
parently reached, we propose to reexamine the foundations of possibilities and 
causes, to understand why theses (1) and (2) look so compelling. We will discover 
that the desires incompatibilists describe, to have powers and to effect changes, 
can be satisfied without any recondite appeals to quantum indeterminacy. The 
suspicions to the contrary lose their force once we begin to untangle, with the 
aid of a little formalism, the complexities of the underlying concepts. 
1 .  POSSIBLE WORLDS 
While a complete account of possible worlds would require many extra pages, the 
following paragraphs outline an approach, compatible with modern scientific 
methods, that avoids various modal pitfalls identified by Quine (such as talk of 
propositions, analyticity, essences, and so forth).8 Ideally, science strives for a de­
scription of the universe that is as thorough and comprehensive as possible, com­
posed in an orderly mathematical idiom. A simple example of such ideal state­
descriptions are the "Democritean" universes introduced by Quine.9 A 
Democritean universe is completely specified using a function f that assigns to 
each quadruple (x,y,z, t) a value of either 0 or 1. If f(x,y,z,t) = I, then at time t 
matter occupies location (x,y,z); otherwise point (x,y,z) is devoid of matter at t. 
Needless to say, modern physics has long since supplanted the tidy Democritean 
conception of reality, but even today the basic project of describing the world 
with (monstrously complex) functions remains intact. So despite its scientific 
shortcomings, the following definition provides a useful starting point as we strug­
gle to discipline unruly pretheoretical intuitions: 

260 
C O M P A T I B I L I S T  P E R S P E C T I V E S  ON F R E E D O M  A N D  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y 
A possible world is simply any function of the form described above (in 
mathematical notation, any function of the form f: JR4 E {O,l}). J O  
The set of all possible worlds we will denote by n a particularly noteworthy subset 
of n is <1>, which contains just the physically or nomologically possible worlds, in 
which no physical laws are violated. I I 
Given a possible world f, we of course have many ways to describe and make 
assertions about it. Often it will be natural to postulate entities within f: connected 
hypersolids in JR4 that yield coherent life-histories for objects like stars, planets, 
living creatures, and everyday paraphernalia. One will also want to set up a system 
of informal predicates that apply to these entities, such as "has a length of 1 meter," 
"is red," "is human."12 We may then form sentences like 
3x (x is human) 
and determine whether they apply in various different possible worlds (while rec­
ognizing that often enough one will encounter borderline worlds where incontes­
tible verdicts prove elusive). 
Worthy of special note are identification predicates of the form "is Socrates." 
"Is Socrates," we shall suppose, applies to any entity in any possible world that 
shares so many features with the well-known denizen of the actual world that we 
are willing to consider it "the same person." In the actual world, of course, "is 
Socrates" applies to exactly one entity; in others, there may reside no such being, 
or one, or conceivably several to whom the predicate applies equally well. Like 
other informal predicates, identification predicates suffer from vagueness and sub­
jectivity, but they do not cause unusual problems. 
With this machinery in place we can now explicate such sentences as: 
Necessarily, Socrates is mortal. 
We would propose the translation: 
In every (physically?) possible world f, the sentence "'r:/x (x is Socrates => x 
is mortal)" obtains. 
(2) 
Here "is Socrates" and "is mortal" are informal predicates of the sort just intro­
duced. Paraphrase (2) strikes us as both plausible and free of the logical confusions 
Quine decries. Of course, deciding whether (2) is true does present considerable 
challenges, stemming largely from the unavoidable blurriness of the predicates. 
Moreover, we are not specifying the set of possible worlds over which one should 
allow f to range; perhaps some readers will advocate set n (all worlds), others <I> 
(the physically possible worlds), and yet others a still more restricted set X. Logic 

W H O ' S 
A F R A I D  O F  D E T E R M I N I S M ?  
261 
alone cannot resolve this issue, but logical language does help us to pinpoint such 
questions and recognize the sorts of vagueness we face. However we choose, we 
can employ the notation 
Ox <1> 
to indicate that sentence 'P obtains for every world in set X. 
As the dual of necessity, possibility yields to a similar analysis. Hence 
Possibly, Socrates might have had red hair. 
means 
There exists (within some set X) a possible world f in which the sentence 
"3x (x is Socrates 1\ x has red hair)" obtains. 
(4) 
Analogous to the notation "Ox 'P" we introduce 
O x 'P, 
meaning that 'P holds for some world within X. The familiar sentence: 
Austin could have holed the putt 
(5) 
now becomes 
O x 3x (x is Austin 1\ x holes the putt). 
(6) 
Notice that in this case we need to restrict X to a narrow range of worlds, all 
quite similar to actuality, if we are to do justice to Austin's meaning. For sup­
pose that Austin is an utterly incompetent golfer, and that impartial observers 
are inclined to deny (5). If we let X range too widely, we may include worlds 
in which Austin, thanks to years of expensive lessons, winds up a championship 
player who holes the putt easily, thus validating (6) but distorting the presumed 
sense of (5). At the same time, as we shall see, there is no good reason to make 
X so small that only worlds identical to reality in the moments before the putt 
are included.

2 .  COUNTERFACTUALS 
Using possible worlds, one can also profitably interpret sentences of the form 
If you had tripped Arthur, he would have fallen, 
as David Lewis has shownY Roughly, (7) obtains if and only if in every world 
approximately similar to our own where the antecedent holds, so does the con­
sequent. In other words, 
(8) 
where 'P stands for "you tripped Arthur," t\J stands for "Arthur fell," and X is a 
set of worlds similar to our own. As an alternative notation, let us also write, 
Choosing an optimal value for X in (8) and (9) is not always easy, but we suggest 
the following loose guidelines: 
In sentences like (8) and (9), X ought to 
• contain worlds in which 'P holds, ]'P holds, t\J holds, and ğt\J holds 
• contain worlds otherwise very similar to the actual world (insofar as the 
preceding clause permits). 
(G) 
So when analyzing (7), choose X to contain worlds in which you trip Arthur, 
worlds where you refrain from tripping him, worlds where he falls, and worlds 
where he remains upright. In the case of (10): 
If the sun hadn't risen this morning, I would have overslept, 
(10) 
X will look quite different, since it includes strange worlds in which the sun fails 
to rise. 
In Counterfactuals, Lewis cleverly devises a single connective [ appropriate 
for all 'P and t\J, but in this chapter we settle for a family of connectives of type 
Yx. Doing so, we believe, forestalls various technical complications and accords 
equally well with intuition. Notice that for Lewis transitivity fails and, worse, so 
does the equivalence 

W H O ' S 
A F R A I D  O F  D E T E R M I N I S M ?  
263 
With each operator 0-7x, on the other hand, transitivity and contraposition suc­
ceed, provided we hold X fixed. Of course, X can vary, as observed in the previous 
paragraph, so that the two sentences: 
If Bill had tripped him, he would have fallen 
If he had fallen, he would have broken his glasses 
need not imply 
If Bill had tripped him, he would have broken his glasses. 
However, we can confidently assume that 
If Bill had tripped him, he would have fallen 
implies 
If he had not fallen, Bill would not have tripped him, 
since guidelines (G) yield the same set in each case. 
3. CAUSATION 
(11) 
(12) 
Fundamental as it appears, the language of causation has stirred up interminable 
debate and has (perhaps for that reason) been avoided by scientists. Many phi­
losophers apparently hope some day to unearth the one "true" account of cau­
sation, but given the informal, vague, often self-contradictory nature of the term, 
we think a more realistic goal is simply to develop a formal analogue (or ana­
logues) that helps us think more clearly about the world. Our preexisting hunches 
about causation will provide some guidance, but we should mistrust any informal 
arguments that masquerade as "proofs" validating or debunking particular causal 
doctrines. 14 
When we make an assertion like 
Bill's tripping Arthur caused him to fall, 
(16) 
a number of factors appear to be supporting the claim. In an approximate order 
of importance, we list the following: 

264 
C O M P A T I B I L I S T  P E R S P E C T I V E S  O N  F R E E D O M  A N D  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  
o Causal necessity. At least since Hume, philosophers have suspected that 
counterfactuals play some role in our causal thinking, and this factor and 
the next fall within the same tradition. Our assent to sentence (16) de­
pends on our conviction that in any world roughly similar to our own in 
which Arthur falls, Bill must have tripped him up. Using the notation of 
the previous section, we have tjJ Yx 'fl, where 'fl stands for "Bill tripped 
Arthur," tjJ represents "Arthur fell," and X is the set of worlds similar to 
our own in which (1) Bill trips Arthur, (2) Bill doesn't trip him, (3) Ar­
thur falls, or (4) he doesn't fall. As observed above, the sentence ] 'fl D 
Zx ]tjJ has the same logical force; in other words, had Bill not tripped 
Arthur, he would not have fallen. 
o Causal sufficiency. It may well be that whenever we affirm (16), we do so 
partly because we believe that (using the same notation as before) 'fl [x 
tjJ. In other words, we believe that Arthur's fall was an inevitable outcome 
of Bill's tripping: in any world where Bill places the obstruction in his 
path, Arthur goes toppling. (Or equivalently, if Arthur had not fallen, 
then Bill must in that case have refrained.) This second condition is logi­
cally entirely distinct from the first, and yet the two seem to get badly 
muddled in everyday thinking. Indeed, as we shall see, incompatibilist 
confusion often originates precisely here. Below we will discuss at greater 
length the relations between these two conditions. 
o Truth of 'fl and tjJ in the actual world. Although a relatively trivial require­
ment, it should be mentioned if only for completeness. 
o Independence. We expect the two sentences 'fl and tjJ to be logically inde­
pendent: there must exist worlds, however remote from reality, in which 
'fl obtains but not tjJ, and vice versa. Hence "Mary's singing and dancing 
caused her to dance and sing" has a decidedly odd ring. This condition 
also helps rule out ''1 + 1 = 2 causes 2 + 2 = 4." 
o Temporal priority. A reliable way to distinguish causes from effects is to 
note that causes occur earlier. 15 
o Miscellaneous further criteria. Although less critical than the preceding 
points, a number of other conditions may increase our confidence when 
we make causal judgements. For instance, in textbook examples of causa­
tion, 'fl often describes the actions of an agent, and tjJ represents a change 
in the state of a passive object (as in "Mary causes the house to burn 
down"). Further, we often expect the two participants to come into physi­
cal contact during their transaction. 16 
In order to understand these conditions better, let us try them out on a few 
test cases (some of which derive from Lewis)Y First consider the sharpshooter 
aiming at a distant victim. Scrutiny of the sharpshooter's past record shows that 

W H O ' S 
A F R A I D  O F  D E T E R M I N I S M ?  
265 
the probability of a successful hit in this case is 0.1; if it makes any difference, we 
might imagine that irreducibly random quantum events in the sharpshooter's 
brain help determine the outcome. Let us suppose that in the current case the 
bullet actually hits and kills the victim. We unhesitatingly agree then that the 
sharpshooter's actions caused the victim's death, despite their causal insufficiency. 
Accordingly, it appears that in such cases, people rank necessity above sufficiency 
when making judgments about causes. 
Still, sufficiency does retain some relevance. Suppose that the king and the 
mayor both have an interest in the fate of some young dissident; as it happens, 
both issue orders to exile him, so exiled he is. This is a classic case of overdeter­
mination. Let 'P I  stand for "the king issues an exile order," 'P2 stand for "the mayor 
issues an exile order," and tV, "the dissident goes into exile." In the current sce­
nario, neither 'P I nor 'P2 alone is necessary for tV: for instance, had the king failed 
to issue any order, the dissident would still have been exiled thanks to the mayor, 
and vice versa. In fact 'PI 1\ 'Pz satisfies the necessity requirement, but we are 
(perhaps unreasonably) reluctant to posit a disjunction as a cause.18 Instead, suf­
ficiency comes to the rescue and permits a choice between the two. After all, 'P2 
fails this test: it is easy to imagine a universe where the mayor issues his decree 
yet the dissident gets off (just change the king's order into a pardon). The king's 
order, on the other hand, is truly effective; whatever small changes we make to 
the universe (including changes in the mayor's orders), the dissident's exile follows 
from the king's command. Accordingly we may dub 'P I the "real cause" (if we 
feel the need to satisfy that yearning).19 
Consider next the tale of Billy and Susie. Both children are throwing rocks at 
a glass bottle, and as it happens Susie's rock, traveling slightly faster, reaches the 
bottle first and shatters it. Billy's rock arrives a moment later at exactly the spot 
where the bottle used to stand, but of course encounters nothing but flying 
shards. When choosing between 'P I  ("Susie throws rock S") and 'Pz ("Billy throws 
rock B"), we vote for 'P I as the cause of tV ("The bottle shatters"), despite the fact 
that neither sentence is necessary (had Susie not thrown her rock, the bottle 
would still have shattered thanks to Billy, and vice versa) and both are sufficient 
(Billy's throw suffices to produce a broken bottle, whatever his playmate does, 
and likewise with Susie's). Why? The general notion of temporal priority (intro­
duced above in connection with distinguishing cause from effect) strikes us as 
one critical consideration. As with priority disputes in science, art, and sports, we 
seem to put a premium on being the first with an innovation, and since rock S 
arrived in the vicinity of the bottle earlier than did rock B, we give credit to Su­
sie. Further, it is clear that, although the bottle would still have shattered without 
Susie's throw, the shattering event would have been significantly different, occur­
ring at a later time with a different rock sending fragments off in different direc­
tions. We can choose set X to reflect this fact (in keeping with guidelines (G)): 

266 
C O M P A T I B I L I S T  P E R S P E C T I V E S  ON F R E E D O M  A N D  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  
let it contain worlds in which either (1) the bottle doesn't shatter at all, or (2) it 
shatters in a way very similar to the way it shatters in reality. Then for every 
world in X, 
obtains; wherever in X the bottle shatters, we find Susie throwing her rock first. 
On the other hand, 
may well fail in X; X can certainly contain worlds where the bottle shatters but 
Billy refrains. In short, 'PI is "more necessary" than 'P2' provided that we choose 
X right. The vagueness of X, though sometimes irksome, can also break deadlocks. 
Not that deadlocks must always be breakable. We ought to look with equa­
nimity on the prospect that sometimes circumstances will fail to pinpoint a single 
"real cause" of an event, no matter how hard we seek. A case in point is the 
classic law school riddle: 
Everybody in the French Foreign Legion outpost hates Fred, and wants him 
dead. During the night before Fred's trek across the desert, Tom poisons the 
water in his canteen. Then, Dick, not knowing of Tom's intervention, pours out 
the (poisoned) water and replaces it with sand. Finally, Harry comes along and 
pokes holes in the canteen, so that the "water" will slowly run out. Later, Fred 
awakens and sets out on his trek, provisioned with his canteen. Too late he 
finds his canteen is nearly empty, but besides, what remains is sand, not water, 
not even poisoned water. Fred dies of thirst. Who caused his death?20 
4. DETERMINISM AND POSSIBILITY 
( T HESIS 1 )  
Now that we have some formal machinery in place, we can reconsider the spu­
riously "obvious" fear that determinism reduces our possibilities. We can see why 
the claim seems to have merit: let 'P be the sentence "Austin holes the putt," let 
X be the set of physically possible worlds that are identical to the actual world at 
some time to prior to the putt, and assume both that Austin misses and that 
determinism holds. Then in fact 'P does not hold for any world in X (  <> x 'P), 
because X contains only one world: the actual one. Of course, this method of 
choosing X (call it the narrow method) is only one among many. We should note 

W H O ' S 
A F R A I D  O F  D E T E R M I N I S M ?  
267 
that the moment we admit into X worlds that differ in a few imperceptibly mi­
croscopic ways from actuality at to, we may well find that 0 x 'P, even when 
determinism obtains. (This is, after all, what recent work on chaos has shown: 
many phenomena of interest to us can change radically if one minutely alters the 
initial conditions.) So the question is: when people contend that events are pos­
sible, are they really thinking in terms of the narrow method? 
Notice that Austin evidently endorses the narrow method of choosing X when 
he states that he is "talking about conditions as they precisely were" whenever he 
asserts he could have holed the putt. Yet in the next sentence he seemingly rescinds 
this endorsement, observing that "further experiments may confirm my belief that 
I could have done it that time, although I did not." What "further experiments" 
might indeed confirm Austin's belief that he could have done it? Experiments on 
the putting green? Would his belief be shored up by his setting up and sinking 
near-duplicates of that short putt ten times in a row? If so, then he is not as 
interested as he claims he is in conditions as they precisely were. He is content to 
consider "Austin holes the putt" possible if, in situations very similar to the actual 
occasion in question, he holes the putt.21 
We contend, then, that Austin equivocates when he discusses possibilities, and 
that in truth the narrow method of choosing X does not have the significance he 
imagines. From this it follows that the truth or falsity of determinism should not 
affect our belief that certain unrealized events were nevertheless "possible," in an 
important everyday sense of the word. We can bolster this last claim by paying a 
visit to a narrow domain in which we know with certainty that determinism 
reigns: the realm of chess-playing computer programs. 
Computers are marvels of determinism. Even their so-called random number 
generators only execute pseudo-random functions, which produce exactly the 
same sequence of "random" digits each time the computer reboots. That means 
that computer programs that avail themselves of randomness at various "choice" 
points will nevertheless spin out exactly the same sequence of states if run over 
and over again from a cold startY Suppose, for instance, you install two different 
chess-playing programs on your computer and yoke them together with a little 
supervisory program that pits them against each other, game after game, in a 
potentially endless series. Will they play the same game, over and over, until you 
turn off the computer? Perhaps; but if either chess program consults the random 
number generator during its calculations (if, for instance, it periodically "flips a 
coin" to escape from Buridan's ass difficulties in the course of its heuristic search), 
then in the following game the state of the random number generator will have 
changed. Accordingly, different alternatives will be "chosen" and a variant game 
will blossom, resulting in a series in which the games, like snowflakes, are no 
two alikeY Nevertheless, if you turned off the computer and then restarted it, 
running the same program, exactly the same variegated series of games would 
spin out.

This gives us a toy model of a deterministic Democritean universe, in which 
zillions of bits are flipped in sequence, governed by a fixed physics. Rewinding 
and replaying the tape of life is really possible in such a toy world. Suppose we 
create such a chess universe involving two programs, A and B, and study the 
results of a lengthy run. We will find lots of highly reliable patterns. Suppose we 
find that A (almost) always beats B. That is a pattern that we will want to explain, 
and saying, "Since the program is deterministic, A was caused always to beat B" 
would fail to address that curiosity. We will want to know what about the struc­
ture, methods, and dispositions of A accounts for its superiority at chess. A has 
a competence or power that B lacks, and we need to isolate this interesting factor.24 
When we set about exploring the issue, availing ourselves of the high-level per­
spective from which the visible "macroscopic" objects include representations of 
chess pieces and board positions, evaluations of possible moves, decisions about 
courses to pursue, and so forth, we will uncover a host of further patterns: some 
of them endemic to chess wherever it is played (for example, the near certainty 
of B's loss in any game where B falls a rook behind) and some of them peculiar 
to A and B as particular chess players (for example, B's penchant for getting its 
queen out early).25 We will find the standard patterns of chess strategy, such as 
the fact that when B's time is running out, B searches less deeply through the 
game tree than it does when in the same position it has more time remaining. In 
short, we will find a cornucopia of explanatory regularities, some exceptionless (in 
our voluminous run) and others statistical. 
These macroscopic patterns are salient moments in the unfolding of a deter­
ministic pageant that, looked at from the perspective of microcausation, is to a 
large extent all the same. What from one vantage point appear to us to be two 
chess programs in suspenseful combat, can be seen through the "microscope" (as 
we watch instructions and data streaming through the CPU) to be a single de­
terministic automaton unfolding in the only way it can, its jumps already pre­
dictable by examining the precise state of the pseudo-random number generator. 
There are no "real" forks or branches in its future; all the "choices" made by A 
and B are already determined. Nothing, it seems, is really possible in this world 
other than what actually happens. Suppose, for instance, that an ominous mating­
net looms over B at time t but collapses when A runs out of time and terminates 
its search for the key move one pulse too soon; that mating net was never going 
to happen.26 (This is something we could prove, if we doubted it, by running the 
same tournament another day. At exactly the same moment in the series, A would 
run out of time again and terminate its search at exactly the same point.) 
So what are we to say? Is our toy world really a world without prevention, 
without offense and defense, without lost opportunities, without the thrust and 
parry of genuine agency, without genuine possibilities? Admittedly, our chess pro­
grams, like insects or fish, are much too simple agents to be plausible candidates 
for morally significant free will, but we contend that the determinism of their

269 
world does not rob them of their different powers, their different abilities to avail 
themselves of the opportunities presented. If we want to understand what is hap­
pening in that world, we may, indeed must, talk about how their choices cause 
their circumstances to change, and about what they can and cannot do. 
Suppose we find two games in the series in which the first twelve moves are 
the same, but with A playing White in the first game and Black in the second. At 
move 13 in the first game, B "blunders" and its pattern goes downhill from there. 
At move 13 in the second game, A, in contrast, finds the saving move, castling, 
and goes on to win. "B could have castled at that point in the first game," says an 
onlooker, echoing Austin. True or false? The move, castling, was just as legal the 
first time, so in that sense, it was among the "options" available to B. Suppose 
we find, moreover, that castling was not only one of the represented candidate 
moves for B, but that B in fact undertook a perfunctory exploration of the con­
sequences of castling, abandoned, alas, before its virtues were revealed. Could B 
have castled? What are we trying to find out? Looking at precisely the same case, 
again and again, is utterly uninformative, but looking at similar cases is in fact 
diagnostic. If we find that in many similar circumstances in other games, B does 
pursue the evaluation slightly farther, discovering the virtues of such moves and 
making them-if we find, in the minimal case, that flipping a single bit in the 
random number generator would result in B's castling-then we support ("with 
further experiments") the observer's conviction that B could have castled then. 
We would say, in fact, that B's failure to castle was a fluke, bad luck with the 
random number generator. If, on the contrary, we find that discovering the rea­
sons for castling requires far too much analysis for B to execute in the time 
available (although A, being a stronger player, is up to the task), then we will 
have grounds for concluding that no, B, unlike A, could not have castled. To 
imagine B castling would require too many alterations of reality; we would be 
committing an error alluded to earlier, making X too large. 
In sum, using the narrow method to choose X is useless if we want to explain 
the patterns that are manifest in the unfolding data. It is only if we "wiggle the 
events" (as David Lewis has said), looking not at "conditions as they precisely 
were" but at nearby neighboring worlds, that we achieve any understanding at 
allY Once we expand X a little, we discover that B has additional options, in a 
sense both informative and morally relevant (when we address worlds beyond the 
chessboard). The burden rests with incompatibilists to explain why "real" possi­
bility demands a narrow choice of X-or why we should be interested in such a 
concept of possibility, regardless of its "reality." 
As we have seen, possibilities of the broader, more interesting variety can exist 
quite comfortably in deterministic worlds. Indeed, introducing indeterminism 
adds nothing in the way of worthwhile possibilities, opportunities, or competences 
to a universe. If in our sample deterministic world program A always beats pro­
gram B, then replacing the pseudo-random number generator with a genuinely 

270 
C O M P A T I B I L I S T  P E R S P E C T I V E S  O N  F R E E D O M  A N D  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  
indeterministic device will not help B at all: A will still win every time. Though 
pseudo-random generators may not produce genuinely random output, they come 
so close that no ordinary mortal can tell the difference. A superior algorithm like 
Ns will hardly stumble when faced with so inconsequential a change. And anal­
ogous conclusions could well apply in meatier universes like ours. To put it graph­
ically, the universe could be deterministic on even days of the month and inde­
terministic on odd days, and we would never notice a difference in human 
opportunities or powers; there would be just as many triumphs, and just as many 
lamentable lapses, on October 4 as on October 3 or October 5. (If your horoscope 
advised you to postpone any morally serious decision to an odd-numbered day, 
you would have no more reason to follow this advice than advice to wait for a 
waning moon.) 
5. SOME RELATED FEARS 
In passing we mention a number of other misguided worries about determinism, 
clustered about the basic fear of lost possibilities. Some thinkers have suggested 
that the truth of determinism might imply one or more of the following disheart­
ening claims: all trends are permanent, character is by and large immutable, and 
it is unlikely that one will change one's ways, one's fortunes, or one's basic nature 
in the future. Ted Honderich,28 for example, has maintained that determinism 
would somehow squelch what he calls our life hopes: 
If things have gone well for a person, there is more to hope for in what follows 
on the assumption that the entire run of his or her life is fixed . . . .  If things 
have not gone well, or not so well as was hoped, it is at least not unreasonable 
to have greater hopes on the assumption that the whole of one's life is not 
fixed, but is connected with the activity of the self . . . .  Given the sanguine 
premiss of our reasonableness, there is reason to think that we do not tend to 
the idea of a fixed personal future. (Honderich 1988; p. 388-89) 
Clearly such anxieties originate in a vague sense that true possibilities (for an 
improved lot, say) disappear under determinism. 
One readily sees the baselessness of such fears by referring again to the field 
of computer science. Programmers have already demonstrated how deterministic 
computer algorithms can adapt themselves to changes in the environment and 
learn from their mistakes.29 Chess programs A and B from the previous section 
could well incorporate such talents. If initially mediocre B possesses these abilities 
and A does not, then we may ultimately find B emerging victorious. And if B has 
this sort of structure in a deterministic world, its enviable capacity will not im-

W H O ' S 
A F R A I D  O F  D E T E R M I N I S M ?  
271 
prove with the introduction of a genuinely indeterministic random-number gen­
erator. Nor will adding indeterminism to the universe help it if it lacks this ability. 
In general, there is no paradox in the observation that certain phenomena are 
determined to be changeable, chaotic, and unpredictable, an obvious and impor­
tant fact that philosophers have curiously ignored. Honderich finds disturbing the 
notion that we might have a "fixed personal future," but the implications of this 
notion are entirely distinct from the implications of having a "fixed personal 
nature." The latter is cause for dismay, perhaps, but not the former, for it could 
very well be one's fixed personal future to be blessed with a protean nature, highly 
responsive to the "activity of the self." The total set of personal futures, "fixed" 
or not, contains all sorts of agreeable scenarios, including victories over adversity, 
subjugations of weakness, reformations of character, even changes of luck. It could 
be just as determined a fact that you can teach an old dog new tricks as that you 
can't. The question to ask is, Are old dogs the kinds of things that can be taught 
new tricks? We rightly care about being the sorts of entities whose future trajec­
tories are not certain to repeat the patterns found in the past. The general thesis 
of determinism has no implications about such issues-for answers to these ques­
tions, we must turn to specific fields like biology and social science (which them­
selves might be either deterministic or indeterministic domains).30 And as the next 
section will show, creativity, the ability to author something of "originative value," 
is similarly independent of determinism. 
6. DETERMINISM AND CAUSATION 
( THESIS 2 )  
The hunch that determinism would eliminate some worthwhile type of causation 
from the universe has even less merit than the claim that it eliminates possibilities. 
We suspect this fear stems from the conflation of causal necessity with causal 
sufficiency-as we have seen, our language makes this confusion all too easy. 
Determinism is essentially a doctrine concerned with sufficiency: if 0'0 is a (mind­
bogglingly complex) sentence that specifies in complete detail the state of the 
universe at to and 0'1 similarly specifies the universe at a later time tl' then deter­
minism dictates that 0'0 is sufficient for 0'1 in all physically possible worlds. But 
determinism tells us nothing about what earlier conditions are necessary to pro­
duce 0'1' or any other sentence tV for that matter. Hence, since causation generally 
presupposes necessity, the truth of determinism would have little bearing on the 
validity of our causal judgments.31 

272 
C O M P A T I B I L I S T  P E R S P E C T I V E S  O N  F R E E D O M  A N D  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y 
For example: according to determinism, the precise condition of the universe 
one second after the big bang (call the corresponding sentence 0"0) causally sufficed 
to produce the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963 (sentence 1jJ). Yet there 
is no reason at all to claim that 0"0 caused 1jJ. Though sufficient, 0"0 is hardly 
necessary. For all we know, Kennedy might well have been assassinated anyway, 
even if some different conditions had obtained back during the universe's birth.32 
More plausible causes of the event would include "A bullet followed a course 
directed at Kennedy's body"; "Lee Harvey Oswald pulled the trigger on his gun"; 
perhaps "Kennedy was born"; conceivably "Oswald was born."33 But conspicu­
ously absent from this list are microscopically detailed descriptions of the universe 
billions of years prior to the incident. Incompatibilists who assert that under 
determinism 0"0 "causes" or "explains" IjJ miss the main point of causal inquiry. 
In fact, determinism is perfectly compatible with the notion that some events 
have no cause at all. Consider the sentence "The devaluation of the rupiah caused 
the Dow Jones average to fall." We rightly treat such a declaration with suspicion; 
are we really so sure that among nearby universes the Dow Jones fell only in those 
where the rupiah fell first? Do we even imagine that every universe where the 
rupiah fell experienced a stock market sell-off? Might there not have been a con­
fluence of dozens of factors that jointly sufficed to send the market tumbling but 
none of which by itself was essential? On some days, perhaps, Wall Street's be­
havior has a ready explanation; yet at least as often we suspect that no particular 
cause is at work. And surely our opinions about the market's activities would 
remain the same, whether we happened to adopt Newton's physics or Schro­
dinger's. 
Of course, one might wonder why it is that causal necessity matters to us as 
much as it does. Let us return for a moment to chess programs A and B. Suppose 
our attention is drawn to a rare game in which B wins, and we want to know 
"the cause" of this striking victory. The trivial claim that B's win was "caused" by 
the initial state of the computer is totally uninformative. Of course the total state 
of the toy universe at prior moments was sufficient for the occurrence of the win; 
we want to know which features were necessary, and thereby understand what 
such rare events have in common. We want to discover those features, the absence 
of which would most directly be followed by B's loss, the default outcome. Perhaps 
we will find a heretofore unsuspected flaw in 1\s control structure, a bug that has 
only just now surfaced. Or perhaps the victory is a huge coincidence of conditions 
that require no repair, since the probability of their recurrence is effectively zero. 
Or we might find an idiosyncratic island of brilliance in B's competence, which 
once diagnosed would enable us to say just what circumstances in the future might 
permit another such victory for B. 
Rationality requires that we evaluate necessary conditions at least as carefully 
as sufficient conditions. Consider a man falling down an elevator shaft. Although 
he doesn't know exactly which possible world he in fact occupies, he does know 

W H O ' S 
A F R A I D  O F  D E T E R M I N I S M ?  
273 
one thing: he is in a set of worlds all of which have him landing shortly at the 
bottom of the shaft. Gravity will see to that. Landing is, then, inevitable (un­
avoid-able) because it happens in every world consistently with what he knows. 
But perhaps dying is not inevitable. Perhaps in some of the worlds in which he 
lands, he survives. Those worlds do not include any in which he lands headfirst 
or spreadeagled, say, but there may be worlds in which he lands in a toes-first 
crouch and lives. There is some elbow room. He can rationally plan action on the 
assumption that living is possible, and even if he cannot discover sufficient con­
ditions to guarantee survival, he may at least improve the odds by taking whatever 
actions are necessary. 34 
In closing, let us return to the human desire pinpointed by Kane that moti­
vates so much of this debate: the desire to be able to take full credit as the creators 
and causes of change in the world. Consider for instance the wish that we (Taylor 
and Dennett) have to be acknowledged as the authors of this essay. Suppose that 
determinism turns out to be true. Would that in any way undercut our claim that 
our activity nevertheless played an essential role in this essay's creation? Not in 
the least, even after we factor in the earlier deeds of our parents and teachers. 
Without our efforts, it is safe to say that no essay exactly like this (or even closely 
similar) would have been produced.35 Hence we are entitled to claim some "orig­
inative value" for our unique accomplishment. The thirst for originality and causal 
relevance is not to be quenched by abstruse quantum events: all that we require 
is the knowledge that without our presence, the universe would have turned out 
significantly different. 
A p PENDIX : VAN INWAGEN'S 
CONSEQUENCE ARGUMENT 
Peter van Inwagen (1975) hopes to bolster the incompatibilist sense of lost causal 
powers with the following basic argument: 
1. Let q:> be some event that actually occurs in agent J\s life (missing a putt, 
say). Also let 0"0 be a comprehensive description of the universe's state at 
some time in the remote past, and let A be a statement of the laws of 
nature. 
2. Then, assuming determinism, A 1\ 0"0 :::} q:> applies in every possible 
world. Equivalently,  q:> :::} 
 (A 1\ 0"0)' 
3. If A has the power to cause a and a :::}  obtains in every possible 
world, then A has the power to cause . 

274 
C O M P A T I B I L I S T  P E R S P E C T I V E S  O N  F R E E D O M  A N D  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  
4. So if A has the power to cause 
 'P , then A has the power to cause the 
falsity of either A or 0'0' which is absurd. 
5. Therefore A lacks the power to cause 
'P . 
This argument illustrates nicely the confusion that causal necessity and sufficiency 
engender. As we have argued, counterfactual necessity is the single most crucial 
condition for causation, and accordingly we would recommend that van Inwagen's 
"power to cause a" be rendered as follows: 
A has the power to cause a iff for some sentence y describing an action of 
A and a world f close to actuality, y 1\ a holds in f and a =::} y in every 
world similar to f. 
In other words, within some cluster of nearby worlds, there is a possible action 
of A (called y) that is a necessary condition for a to occur. But under this defi­
nition, line 3 has no warrant whatever. Line 3 hypothesizes that a =::} y in a cluster 
of nearby worlds, and that a =::}  in every world; if we could deduce that  =::} 
y in this cluster, we would be home free. But of course in Logic 101 we learn that 
a =::} y and a =::}  do not entail  =::} y, and so line 3 fails, and van Inwagen's 
argument with it.

10. The average educated person's casual working assumptions about the cosmos 
still resemble the Democritean account, and philosophers traditionally rely on nothing 
more sophisticated when exploring the implications of determinism and indeterminism, 
causation and possibility. 
Our suggestion that possible worlds simply are functions of the appropriate form 
may seem disturbingly reductive, particularly when one contemplates the particular 
function(s) that correspond to the actual world; accordingly David Lewis takes pains 

W H O ' S 
A F R A I D  O F  D E T E R M I N I S M ?  
275 
to distinguish possible worlds from their mathematical "handles." However one wishes to 
address these ontological scruples, nothing in the following discussion hinges on them. 
11. Since we are restricting ourselves to the scientifically old-fashioned Democritean 
worlds, we would have trouble specifying the contents of <P precisely-and besides, of 
course, we do not yet know all the laws of nature-but we can pretend that we know, 
and hence we can pretend that in most cases one can judge whether or not a particular 
world f accords with natural law. 
John Horton Conway's Game of Life can be viewed as a particularly simple pseudo­
Democritean universe, eliminating one spatial dimension and quantizing time. (See 
Dennett 1991: 27-51 or Idem 1995, for an introduction to Life.) The set of all possible 
sequences of bitmaps is then 0, and the single (deterministic) rule of Life "physics" ap­
plied to every "initial" state gives us the subset <P of O. Every variation on Conway's 
"physics" generates a different subset <P. 
12. Of course, these predicates unleash a horde of problems concerning vagueness, 
subjectivity, and (in such cases as "believes that snow is white") intentionality, but diffi­
culties along these lines do not imperil the basic approach. 
13. Lewis (1973a), passim. 
14. See, for example, (Tooley 1987). 
15. A vast amount of ink his been spilled arguing that the direction of causation is 
either independent of or logically prior to the direction of time, and to address the mat­
ter here would require too lengthy a digression. So we merely note the issue and tenta­
tively take the direction of time as a given (originating ultimately in the Second Law of 
Thermodynamics) from which the direction of causation derives. 
Gasking (1955) raises a number of interesting cases in which cause and effect appear 
to be simultaneous: for instance, if a piece of iron attains a temperature of (say) 1000°C 
and thereupon starts to glow, we still distinguish the former as cause and the latter as 
effect. But this apparent exception to the rule has a ready explanation that Gasking him­
self hints at: when a speaker refers to the iron "reaching 1000°," she is envisioning this 
event as the endpoint in a lengthy heating process. The heating process does precede the 
glowing, and so the latter is considered an effect. 
Another category of "exceptions" includes diseases and their symptoms (say, a cold 
and sneezing), which might sometimes arise simultaneously. Yet often enough diseases 
do precede their symptoms, while symptoms (by definition) never appear before their 
diseases. Accordingly we grant diseases the status of "cause." 
16. Notice that we do not in the previous clauses make any provision to ensure 
the transitivity of causation. Lewis (2000: 191-95), among others, feels it important to 
guarantee transitivity by making "causation" the ancestral of "causal dependence." But 
Lewis himself provides many examples of transitivity's counterintuitive consequences. 
For instance, suppose that agent A wants to travel to New York. Agent B, hoping to 
thwart A, lets the air out of the tires on ks car. In consequence, A takes the train in­
stead and reaches New York only slightly behind schedule. If causation is transitive, than 
B has "caused" ks successful arrival, despite the fact that the two sentences "B lets the 
air out of ks tires" and "A arrives in New York" satisfy none of our more crucial condi­
tions. Lewis finds the awkward implications of transitivity acceptable; we remain unper­
suaded. 
Hall (2000) goes to even greater lengths to defend transitivity. His account seems to 
imply that a pebble on the train tracks south of Paris that minutely alters the course of 

276 
C O M P A T I B I L I S T  P E R S P E C T I V E S  O N  F R E E D O M  A N D  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y 
the Orient Express is a "cause" of the train's arrival in Istanbul several days later. Paul's 
"Aspect Causation" (2000) suggests a possible diagnosis for Hall's willingness to counte­
nance such bizarre conclusions, as stemming from an overeager acceptance of the prem­
ise that causation is a relation between "events" (however this problematic term may be 
defined). At any rate, notice that on our account one can consistently consider false the 
sentence "Pebble p's lying on the tracks south of Paris caused the train's arrival in Istan­
bul," while accepting "Pebble p's lying on the tracks south of Paris caused the train's 
arrival in Istanbul via a minutely altered course in France." 
17. Lewis (2000). 
18. Obviously, a sentence like "Drugs or aliens caused Elvis's premature demise" ab­
breviates the cumbersome "Drugs caused Elvis's premature demise or aliens caused El­
vis's premature demise" -a disjunction of two separate causes, not a single disjunctive 
cause. 
19. Invoking causal sufficiency in this way solves, to our satisfaction, all of the anal­
ogous problem cases raised by Shaffer (2000). Note that Shaffer rather misleadingly sug­
gests that "counterfactual accounts of causation" must always be formulated solely in 
terms of necessity (ibid.: 176). We, on the contrary, consider our account essentially 
"counterfactual" even though it allows for sufficiency along with necessity. 
Lewis's formulation (Lewis 2000) of "Causation as Influence" can be viewed as an 
indirect way of introducing sufficiency into an originally necessity centered account. For 
present purposes we consider our approach more illuminating, but both strategies point 
in the same general direction. 
20. A doubly elaborated version of the example due originally to McLaughlin 
(1925), first elaborated in Hart and Honore (1959). The Hart and Honore version has 
one less twist: "Suppose A is entering a desert. B secretly puts a fatal dose of poison in 
Ns water keg. A takes the keg into the desert where C steals it; both A and C think it 
contains water. A dies of thirst. Who kills him?" 
21. When Austin speaks of further experiments, could he be referring to experi­
ments in the high-tech labs of physicists and microbiologists, experiments that would 
convince him that his brain amplifies indeterministic quantum events? Given the ex­
treme impracticality of such experiments, and Austin's overall skepticism about the rele­
vance of science in these contexts ("[A modern belief in science] is not in line with the 
traditional beliefs enshrined in the word can," Austin 1961: 166), this interpretation 
seems unlikely. But this is precisely the direction in which Kane and some other incom­
patibilists have headed. See also Dennett (1984: 133-37). 
22. We are restricting our attention to programs that do not require or accept in­
put from the external world, which could, of course, be random in any of several senses. 
The easiest way to ensure that there is variation in subsequent runs of a program is to 
have it call for inputs of these sorts: the time taken from the computer's clock, the pres­
ence or absence of a pulse from a Geiger counter, the last digit in the latest Dow Jones 
Industrial Average as taken off the Internet, and so on. 
23. All this is independent of whether or not either chess program can "learn from 
its experience," which is another way their internal state could change over time to 
guarantee that no two games were the same. 
24. Another case in which we could know all the deterministic microdetails but be 
baffled about how to explain the causal regularities is Dennett's example of the two 
black boxes (1995: 412-22).

26. Compare the comet plunging toward earth that is intercepted at the last minute 
by the other comet, unnoticed till then, that had been on its collision trajectory since its 
birth millions of years ago (Dennett 1984: 124). 
27. If we exclude such variation, then trivially, castling in the second game was not 
"open to B," to use Ginet's terminology. Recall that Ginet requires that "nothing that 
exists up to that moment stands in the way of my doing next any one of the alterna­
tives." The narrow method has the effect of treating the precise state of B's contempla­
tion of the option of castling as something external, as something that can itself "stand 
in the way" at the moment of choosing, guaranteeing that nothing about B could explain 
B's choice, whatever it is. As Dennett notes, "If you make yourself really small, you can 
externalize virtually everything" (1984: 143). 
28. Honderich (1988). 
29. They have also demonstrated, all too often, the possibility of programs losing 
competence over time by accumulating deleterious effects from bugs. At any rate, just 
how significant are the many examples of "machine learning" that have been produced 
to date? The answer is contested, and it is true that the best chess programs today do 
not include substantial "unsupervised" learning capacities. Still, the feasibility of genuine 
learning in computer programs has not been in doubt since the self-improving checkers 
program created by Arthur Samuel in the 1950S. (See Dennett 1995: 207-12 for details.) 
John McCarthy has posed the question of what the minimal life-world configuration is, 
in which occupants learn the physics of their own world (ibid.: 175). One might also 
ask, Which variations on Conway's physics generate possible worlds in which occupants 
can know or learn anything at all? 
30. This paragraph is drawn, with revisions, from Dennett 1988. 
31. See the appendix to this chapter for an additional example of the conflation of 
necessity and sufficiency (in van Inwagen's Consequence Argument). 
32. Imagine that we take a snapshot of the universe at the moment of Kennedy's 
assassination, then alter the picture in some trivial way (by moving Kennedy 1 mm to 
the left, say). Then, following the (deterministic) laws of physics in reverse, we can gen­
erate a movie running all the way back to the Big Bang, obtaining a world in which (Jo 
subtly fails. 
33. Of course, the last two options fail the sufficiency test so badly that we prefer 
not to countenance them as causes. As explained earlier, sufficiency does have some rele­
vance in assigning causes, but not the overwhelming importance that incompatibilists 
imply. 
34. The dependence of this concept of possibility on epistemic considerations has 
been suggested before (see Dennett 1984: 147ff.) but mischaracterized. It is true that if 
determinism held, and if the man knew exactly which world he inhabited, he would al­
ready know his fate. 
35. Similarly, Deep Blue, in spite of its being a deterministic automaton, authored 
the games of chess that vanquished Kasparov. No one else was their author; Murray 
Campbell and the IBM team that created Deep Blue cannot claim credit for those games; 
they did not see the moves. The vast exploratory activity of Deep Blue itself was the 
originating cause of those magnificent games.
