Introduction
You’re not a dummy, even if you think you are. But accounting by itself
can be a challenge — and then, when you add the computer part to it . . .
well, the whole thing can seem so overwhelming that you avoid it. (What?
Never crossed your mind?)
Okay, now that you’re looking at this book, you probably decided that you’ve
avoided it long enough, and now you’re going to do it — bite the bullet and
computerize your accounting with Peachtree. We want to help you get the job
done as quickly as possible with the least amount of pain. You’ve got other
things to do, after all.
About This Book
Accounting isn’t exactly a fun subject — unless, of course, you’re an accoun-
tant . . . and even then it might not really be all that much fun. Some people
think that going to the dentist is more fun than playing with accounting soft-
ware. We’re here to help you get past the ugly part so that you can start
enjoying the benefits quickly.
What benefits? Well, computerizing your accounting can save you time and
effort — and can actually be easier than doing it by hand and cheaper than
paying somebody else to do it. Oh, we don’t mean that you don’t need your
accountant, because you do. But you can save money by doing daily stuff for
yourself — and spend money paying your accountant for advice on making
your business more profitable.
Peachtree For Dummies, 3rd Edition, shows you how to set up your company
in Peachtree and then use Peachtree to pay bills, invoice customers, pay
employees, produce reports about your financial picture, and more. But it’s
also a real-life-situation kind of book. We show you how to work in Peachtree
by using everyday, real-life situations as examples. You know, the stuff you
run into in the so-called real world that you need to figure out how to handle.
What You Can Safely Ignore
Throughout the book, we include Accounting Stuff tips — you can probably
ignore those unless you’re interested in that kind of stuff.

Oh, and the gray boxes that you see throughout the book? Those are side-
bars, and they contain extra information that you really don’t have to know
but that we thought you might find useful and interesting. So feel free to skip
the sidebars as well.
Foolish Assumptions
We’ll be honest — we had to assume some things about you to write this
book. So, here’s what we assume about you:
 You already know a little something about the day-to-day stuff that you
need to do financially to run your business — you know, write checks,
bill customers, pay employees, and so on. We don’t assume that you
know how to do all that on a computer.
 You have a personal computer (that you know how to turn on) with
Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, or Windows Vista. We wrote this
book by using Windows Vista.
 You bought Peachtree and installed it on your computer.
A free trial of Peachtree is available from www.peachtree.com/trial.
The Flavors of Peachtree
Peachtree comes in five versions, listed here from basic to advanced:
 Peachtree First Accounting
 Peachtree Pro Accounting
 Peachtree Complete Accounting
 Peachtree Premium Accounting
 Peachtree Quantum Accounting
In addition, Peachtree Premium is available in manufacturing, distribution,
construction, non-profit, and accounting industry-specific versions. In this
book, we cover Peachtree Premium Accounting.
Peachtree Quantum has all the features you find in all other versions of the
software; it uses a slightly more advanced database and allows for larger file

sizes. In addition, in a network environment, ten users can use Peachtree
Quantum simultaneously, whereas Peachtree Premium and Peachtree
Complete allow for five simultaneous users. You can’t use other versions of
Peachtree in a network environment.
Here are some of the other differences between the five flavors:
 Peachtree Premium contains all the features in Peachtree First Account-
ing, Peachtree Pro Accounting, and Peachtree Complete Accounting,
plus a few additional features, such as the capability to store unlimited
budget information instead of the two years available in the other 
products.
 Peachtree Premium and Peachtree Complete include a Time & Billing
feature that you don’t find in Peachtree First Accounting or Peachtree
Pro Accounting.
 Peachtree Premium Accounting, Peachtree Complete Accounting, and
Peachtree Pro Accounting allow you to customize reports and forms and
prepare payroll, but Peachtree First Accounting does not.
 Peachtree Quantum, Peachtree Premium, and Peachtree Complete con-
tain a job-costing feature, but you find only a job-tracking feature in
Peachtree First Accounting and Peachtree Pro Accounting. (If you don’t
know the difference between job costing and job tracking, you probably
don’t need either one.)
Peachtree Quantum and two of the industry-specific versions of Peachtree
Premium — Peachtree Premium for Construction and Peachtree Premium for
Distribution — contain more extensive job-costing features than Peachtree
Premium, such as tracking Bill of Material revisions. Because we cover
Peachtree Premium, we don’t cover those extensive features in Chapter 12
where we discuss job costing, but we want you to know that they exist.
Throughout the book, when we refer to the product as Peachtree, we mean
Peachtree Premium. If we talk about one of the other flavors, we give you the
full product name.
How This Book Is Organized
Every great book needs a plan. We divided this book into four parts, each
made up of two to eight chapters so that you can easily find the information
that you need.
3
Introduction

Part I: Getting Started
If you’re new to Peachtree, you probably want to read this part. We explain
how to get around in Peachtree, how to create a company in Peachtree, how
to build an effective chart of accounts, and how to set up default information
that saves you lots of time later.
Part II: The Daily Drudge
In this section, we cover the stuff that you do on a regular basis:
 Buy and pay for goods to sell to your customers. (Yep, we cover 
inventory.)
 Bill the customers and collect your money (or you won’t be able to pay
the employees and the vendors).
 Pay the employees (or they won’t work!).
Stuff like that. We also cover paying for services that keep your business run-
ning, and we cover a couple of more esoteric topics, such as billing cus-
tomers for time that you spend working and tracking project costs.
Part III: The Fancy Stuff
In this section, we cover a variety of topics that you typically don’t do every
day. First, we show you how to customize forms and produce and modify
reports. After all, you put information into Peachtree, so you should be able
to get it out and see the effects of your business habits. Then we cover recon-
ciling the bank statement and the stuff that you do monthly, quarterly, or
annually. We also show you how to easily keep your accounting information
safe — a very important chapter. Why? Because you spend so much time
putting stuff into Peachtree that it would be criminal to lose it just because
your hard drive crashes or your office is robbed. And Chapter 19 presents
ways to handle real-life situations in Peachtree, such as handling customer
prepayments and paying for purchase orders using a credit card.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
If you’ve ever read a For Dummies book, you’ve seen the Part of Tens. This
part contains a collection of ten-something lists. Our Part of Tens comprises
the following:

 Ten common error messages that you might see — and what they mean
 Ten things that you can get from the Web — not just Peachtree stuff like
support and additional information, but fun stuff, too, just in case you’ve
had a bad day and need a laugh
The Peachtree For Dummies Web Site
This book’s Web site, www.dummies.com/go/peachtreefd, features useful
information that’s not necessarily mainstream knowledge. You can find the
following Bonus Chapters:
 Bonus Chapter 1, in which you find out how to tailor Peachtree to sup-
port how you work.
 Bonus Chapter 2, in which we discuss how to use the Peachtree money
management tools to analyze your business and help you manage cash,
receivables, and payables.
 Bonus Chapter 3, in which we describe how to set up Peachtree to work
in a network environment.
 Bonus Chapter 4, in which we list as many companion products for
Peachtree as we can find. These products can enhance how you work in
Peachtree.
 Bonus Chapter 5, in which we discuss who’s to blame for the whole
debit/credit thing and also how debits and credits work.

Part I
Getting Started

In this part . . .
E
very project has a beginning point. If you are just 
getting acquainted with Peachtree, this part is the
place to start. In this part, you find out how to navigate
through the Peachtree screens and how to set up your
existing company records in Peachtree. If you’ve been
using Peachtree for a while, you might want to review
Chapters 3 and 4 in this part because they talk about
designing the Chart of Accounts and setting up defaults 
to make using Peachtree easier.

 Navigating the Peachtree screen
I
f you’ve been keeping your financial records by using manual methods,
you know how time-consuming it can be. Keeping books manually also
provides too many opportunities for human error. Using Peachtree saves you
both time and money; in addition, you can know at any moment in time your
complete financial status. We know you’re eager to get started. Operating a
business is a non stop process, but to computerize your accounting, you
have to put first things first.
To work effectively, take some time to get comfortable with some of the fea-
tures unique to Peachtree. In this chapter, you find out how to navigate in the
software as well as open and close companies as needed. If you’re ready, it’s
time to dig in.
Starting the Program
You have a choice: You can start Peachtree the easy way or the hard way. We
prefer the easy way. When you installed Peachtree, it placed a Peachtree icon
(with your permission) on your Windows desktop. Assuming (we know, we’re
not supposed to assume) that you haven’t thrown that icon into the Recycle
Bin, you can simply double-click the Peachtree icon (the one with the peachy
little peach on it), and the program starts.
To make sure that Peachtree always starts in a full-sized (maximized)
window, right-click the Peachtree icon and choose Properties. In the resulting
dialog box, on the Shortcut tab, click the drop-down arrow in the Run box,
choose Maximized, and then click OK to accept the changes.

If you did throw the icon away or you have so many icons on your desktop
that you can’t find it, okay, you can start Peachtree the hard way. Choose
Start➪All Programs and locate your Peachtree Accounting folder.
Choosing opening options
After you start Peachtree, what do you do with it? The Peachtree Start Screen
appears as seen in Figure 1-1, beckoning you to do one of several things. You
can select any of the following options:
 Open an Existing Company: Use this option to open a company already
existing in Peachtree.
 Create a New Company: Select this option to set up your business with
the New Company Setup Wizard. (Chapter 2 covers this wizard.)
 Explore a Sample Company: Use this option to explore one of several
fictitious companies. One company, Bellwether Garden Supply, is a retail
and service company that uses most of the features of Peachtree, includ-
ing inventory and job costing. Depending on the Peachtree edition that
you’re using, you might have additional sample companies to investi-
gate. You explore Bellwether Garden Supply in the steps in the following
section.
 Convert from Another Accounting Program: If you’ve finally come to
your senses and want to transfer to Peachtree from that other software
(meaning QuickBooks or DacEasy), click this choice. Peachtree makes
the conversion pretty painless.
Figure 1-1:

Part I: Getting Started 

Exploring a sample company
You can best explore Peachtree’s features by opening the Bellwether Garden
Supply sample company and finding out how to move around in Peachtree.
To open a sample company, follow these steps:
1. Click Explore a Sample Company.
If you’re using Peachtree First Accounting or Peachtree Pro Accounting,
Bellwether Garden Supply immediately opens.
If you’re using Peachtree Complete Accounting or above, the Explore a
Sample Company dialog box opens.
2. Select the radio button next to the sample company that you want to
explore.
For this example, select Bellwether Garden Supply.
3. Click OK.
The name of the currently open company appears at the top of the
window in the Peachtree title bar.
Getting around town
When you first open a company, it might appear a little bit intimidating. On the
left side, Peachtree displays the Navigation Bar. You click a Navigation Bar topic
as one method to get into the seven various Peachtree Navigation Centers such
as the Business Status Center shown in Figure 1-2 or the Employees and Payroll
Center. The Navigation Centers show the work flow of the selected center and
quickly take you to a window where you can perform relevant tasks. Each
Navigation Center also displays key information relative to the selected center.
For example, in the Employees and Payroll Center you can see a list of employ-
ees and 1099 vendors as well as quick links to recently used employee reports
while in the Customers and Sales Center, you can see a list of customers.
Under the Navigation Bar is the Shortcuts section. The Shortcuts section con-
tains links you can click to quickly jump into Peachtree windows that you use
in your business on a day-to-day basis. See Bonus Chapter 1 on this book’s
Web site, www.dummies.com/go/peachtreefd, for instructions on cus-
tomizing the Shortcuts so they include the features you use most often.
The large section on the right is where Peachtree displays the various Peachtree
centers. By default, when you open your company, you see the Business
Status Center. You can find out how to customize the Business Status Center
in Bonus Chapter 2 on this book’s Web site.
11
Chapter 1: Mastering Peachtree Basics

At the top of the open center you see the Button Control Bar that displays,
among other things, the current system date and the current accounting
period. (See Figure 1-3.)
Like many applications today, Peachtree provides a variety of ways to use the
software. You can perform your Peachtree duties by using the Button Control
Bar, the Shortcuts section, or — a more traditional method — menu commands.

Part I: Getting Started 

Choosing menu commands
The pull-down menus should be a familiar sight from your other Windows
programs. Even though all the menu choices are important, you’re likely to
spend the majority of your time in Peachtree using the following four main
menu choices:
 Maintain: Using the choices on this menu, you can set up and edit the
information records that form the foundation for transactions in your
Peachtree company. For example, you can store vendor, customer,
inventory, and employee information, including names, addresses, and
phone numbers.
A record is all the information about one person, product, event, and so
on. Every record in a database contains the same fields. A field is one
item of information in a record, such as an ID, a name, or a transaction
number. To explore the kinds of information that you store in Peachtree,
see the “Exploring fields and records” section, later in this chapter.
 Lists: This menu displays lists of . . . well, just about everything stored in
Peachtree — customers, vendors, checks, journal entries, and so on. Any
list can be sorted and customized (see Bonus Chapter 1 on this book’s
Web site) to better help you locate desired information. Figure 1-4 illus-
trates a list of Inventory Adjustments made during a specified period.
 Tasks: Use this menu to do your normal day-to-day work. You can bill your
customers, buy materials, and pay your workers by using the Tasks menu.
 Reports and Forms: This menu is where it all comes together and you
can see the results of all your hard work.

Chapter 1: Mastering Peachtree Basics

Opening a Company
Maybe you need to keep numbers for more than one business. Peachtree
enables you to account for the financial information of more than one com-
pany. Although you can open only one company at a time, you can switch
back and forth between companies very easily.
The steps to open a company differ, depending on whether you’re opening a
company while already in a Peachtree company or whether you’re opening a
company from the Peachtree Start Screen.
Opening a Peachtree company 
from within Peachtree
If you’re already in a Peachtree company and want to open a different one,
follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Open Company (or press Ctrl+O).
You get an annoying little message telling you that you’re closing the
current company. Peachtree allows only one open company at a time.
Select the Do Not Display This Message Again check box to permanently
disable the message box.
2. Click OK to acknowledge the message.
The Open dialog box appears.
3. From the Open dialog box, click the company name and then click OK.
The newly opened company name appears at the top of the screen. No
matter which company you open, the menu choices remain the same.
Opening a recently used 
Peachtree company
If you find yourself frequently switching back and forth between several com-
panies, Peachtree provides an easier method, the Open Previous Company
option. This option lists up to ten previously opened Peachtree company
names from which you can select.
Choose File➪Open Previous Company. From the list of previously opened
companies that appears, choose the one you want to open. If the annoying
14
Part I: Getting Started 

little message appears, click OK, and Peachtree opens the company you
selected.
Opening a company from the 
Peachtree Start Screen
If you’re opening a company from the Peachtree Start Screen, a different
dialog box appears. To open a company from the Peachtree Start Screen,
follow these steps:
1. Click Open an Existing Company to display the Open an Existing
Company dialog box.
This dialog box lists the companies that you recently opened in
Peachtree. If the company name that you want to open doesn’t appear,
click the Browse button and make your selection from the Open
Company dialog box.
2. Click the company name that you want to open and then click OK.
The selected company opens.
Exploring Peachtree’s Windows
Most windows in Peachtree are similar. They have places for you to fill in infor-
mation and buttons that you use to take actions in that particular window. The
Maintain Customers/Prospects window is typical of many other windows that
you use in Peachtree. For an example, open Bellwether Garden Supply and
choose Maintain➪Customers/Prospects. Take a stroll around this window.
Managing window sizes and placement
Depending on your screen size and resolution, you might not see enough of a
window to suit your needs. Some windows, such as the Sales/Invoice window,
display more lines when made larger. If you resize the window manually,
Peachtree remembers that setting and uses it each time. You can also click
the Windows Maximize button (as shown here in the margin), and Peachtree
remembers that you like the window maximized.
To manually resize a window, place your mouse pointer around the border of
any window until the pointer appears as a double-headed arrow. Click and
drag the border until the window is the appropriate size.
15
Chapter 1: Mastering Peachtree Basics

Exploring fields and records
The main part of a Peachtree window consists of fields. Stop for a moment
and ponder these components. When we refer to fields, we’re not talking
about the places where corn grows. Fields are pieces of information that fit
into a record, which is a type of electronic 3 x 5 index card. A record is all the
information about one customer, vendor, employee, or inventory part, but a
field is one piece of the record such as the ID, name, or phone number. In
Figure 1-5, the record is all the information about Archer Scapes and Ponds,
and Nancy Archer is in the Contact field.
Looking up information
Some fields, such as Customer ID, have either a magnifying glass or an arrow
for a drop-down list next to them. These fields contain lookup lists that dis-
play a list of your customers (or vendors, accounts, employees, inventory
items, and so on). You can choose a record from a lookup list. Depending on
the global options that you set, a lookup list might automatically appear as
you type any character in the field, or you can click the lookup list button
(the magnifying glass or down arrow, as shown in the margin here) to display
the list that’s relevant to the current field. (See Figure 1-6.) See Bonus Chapter
1 at www.dummies.com/go/peachtreefd for more information on setting
global options.
Optionally, on most lookup list fields you can display the list by either click-
ing the right mouse button in the lookup list field or pressing the Shift key
along with the question mark (?).
Figure 1-5:
Each record
has many
different
fields.
16
Part I: Getting Started 

You can do any of the following while in a lookup list:
 Select a customer (vendor, item, and so on) and then click OK.
Peachtree displays the highlighted record and closes the lookup list.
 Click Cancel to close the lookup list without selecting a record.
 Use the Find feature to search for a string of characters. The search
covers any text that you can see in the displayed list. The Find feature is
not case sensitive. Press Enter after you type the lookup text in the
entry box. Peachtree highlights the first item that matches your request.
 Click Next to find the next instance of the previously entered Find
text. If no next instance exists, the Find feature skips to the first instance
in the lookup list. If no instance exists, the Next feature does nothing.
 Click Sort to sort the displayed list alphabetically by either the ID or
the name. Numbers come before letters.
 Use the Help option.
 Use the New button. This is available only in the Task lookup windows,
to add customers, vendors, employees, or inventory items on the fly,
which means Peachtree adds the record right in the middle of entering a
transaction.
Just browsing
Similar to buttons that you use with a Web browser, Peachtree includes
Browse buttons (like the ones here) to quickly scan the next record or the
previous record. If you’re in a maintenance window such as Maintain
Customers/Prospects or Maintain Inventory Items, the Browse buttons move
between the records in the order of customer ID or inventory item ID.
If you’re in a Task window, the Browse buttons move between the previous
transaction and the next transaction.
Figure 1-6:

available
choices in a
lookup list.

Chapter 1: Mastering Peachtree Basics

Making a date
Many Peachtree windows have date fields where you need to enter information
based on the calendar. If you’re a keyboard-type person, you can simply type
the date. Dates need to be typed as numbers. If you want, you can type the
date by using the / (slash) key, but the slash isn’t necessary. For example, to
enter September 16, 2007, type 091607 or 09/16/07. Be aware that Peachtree
doesn’t allow you to use a hyphen (-) in a date.
In most Peachtree date fields, you can get away with entering just the first
four digits of a date. Peachtree then enters the year. The year is based on the
system date displayed on the Button Control Bar.
Now if you’re like us, we need a calendar in front of us to select dates.
Fortunately, Peachtree fields that require you to select a date also include a
calendar, as shown in Figure 1-7, so you can click that to select a date. To
select a date from the calendar, follow these steps:
1. Click the calendar icon next to a date field to display the current
month.
2. Click the left-pointing arrow next to the month name to display a 
previous month or click the right-pointing arrow to display a future
month.
3. Click the date that you want for the date field.
The small calendar closes, and the date appears in the field.
Using the window toolbar
Most Peachtree windows include a toolbar located across the top of the
window. You use the Peachtree toolbar across the top of the window to com-
plete the various tasks involved with the selected window.
Figure 1-7:
Click a date
to insert 
it into a
Peachtree
date field.
18
Part I: Getting Started 

The exact buttons vary slightly from window to window, but most of them
have a Close button, as shown here. To get out of a Peachtree window, you
can use the Close button or the Windows Close button (X).
If you position the mouse pointer over any button on the toolbar, a small
yellow box — a Tool Tip — appears to explain the use of the button. Tool
Tips are great for those CRS moments when you look at a button and cannot
remember its function. CRS (Can’t Remember Stuff) is a widespread disease
that affects people of all ages, races, religions, genders, and hair colors.
You also use the Save button frequently. The Save button, as shown here,
appears on the toolbar if you’re modifying data records, such as customers,
from the Maintenance menu or if you’re using a transaction entry window
under the Tasks menu, such as Payroll Entry or Inventory Adjustments. You
click the Save button to save the displayed transaction — and if you’re using
the real-time posting method, Peachtree also posts the transaction to the
General Ledger (GL). (See Chapter 2 for an explanation of posting methods.)
Post is one of those words with many different meanings. It can be a noun,
such as the place you tie your horse, or it can be a verb and mean to send. Of
course, the latter is how the word post is used in accounting, and it means to
save and send. In Peachtree, you’re sending transactions to the GL; then,
when you want to find out whether you’ve made any money this month,
Peachtree is able to show you.
Multitasking
Mothers have long been known for their multitasking skills. You’ve seen them —
balancing the baby on a hip, stirring the soup, and answering the telephone
all at the same time. You can multitask in Peachtree also.
In almost all Peachtree windows, you can stop and open another window with-
out having to close the first one and then return to the first window whenever
you’re ready. For example, suppose that you’re in the middle of entering a
new customer invoice and your boss needs to quickly know how much you
paid for the green widgets you ordered last month. You can just open another
window such as a List window. Besides a button for the Main Peachtree screen,
each open window appears in the Windows Taskbar. Take a look at Figure 1-8
where you can see four different Peachtree window buttons open. Click any
button to display the selected Peachtree window.

Setting Up Your Company
In This Chapter
 Supplying your company information
 Specifying an accounting method
 Identifying accounting periods
P
eachtree tracks all kinds of information, including the names and
addresses of your customers, vendors, or employees, as well as any
business transactions that you’ve made with them. But before Peachtree can
do any of that, you have to tell the software about your company. You need 
to tell it the usual stuff such as your name and address. (That’s so you don’t
forget who you are. . . .) You also need to tell it when you want to pay Uncle
Sam taxes on the money that you earn and spend. (Sorry, but never is not an
option.)
Keep this important fact in mind: Two of the options that you determine when
setting up a Peachtree company are written in stone — no going backward:
 Whether you run your business on a cash or an accrual basis
 The time frame of your accounting year
We talk about these issues in the accounting method and accounting period
sections of this chapter.
Starting the New Company Setup Wizard
When you want to create a new company, or convert Peachtree Complete
Accounting for DOS or Quicken data, the New Company Setup Wizard simpli-
fies the task for you. It asks you the basic questions in the order that Peachtree
needs to set up your business. (If you’re not setting up a new company but
are simply changing settings, see Chapter 4.)

You start the New Company Setup Wizard when you click Create a New
Company from the Peachtree Start Screen. Like most wizards, the New
Company Setup Wizard guides you through the process. You’ve probably
used wizards dozens of times (not to mention when you’ve installed most
applications, such as Peachtree), so we’ll keep things short and sweet.
If you want to convert from QuickBooks or DacEasy, do not use the New
Company Setup Wizard. Instead, choose the Convert from Another Accounting
Program option that appears on the Start Screen. If you’re already in Peachtree
and want to create a new company, choose File➪New Company to start the
New Company Setup Wizard.
After you’re done checking out the opening screen, click Next to move to the
next screen.
The following sections walk you through each step of the New Company
Setup Wizard.
Introducing Your Business to Peachtree
The left half of the New Company Setup Wizard screen is pretty self-explana-
tory. Fill in your business name, address, city, two-letter state abbreviation,
and (optionally) country. Notice that we say country, with an r — not county!
Many people misread this line. You see country fields in other places in
Peachtree. Use the Tab or Enter key to move through the fields.
The first item on the right side of the screen asks for your business type. To
fill in this side of the screen, follow these steps:
1. Click the drop-down list to display and choose a Business Type.
Options are Corporation, S Corporation, Partnership, Sole
Proprietorship, or Limited Liability Company. Selecting a type of busi-
ness tells Peachtree how to set up equity accounts.
Equity is what’s left after you subtract the company’s liabilities from the
assets. The equity is the value of a company to its owners. In a corpora-
tion, the equity is divided among the stockholders. If the business is a
sole proprietorship or partnership, though, the equity belongs to the
individual owner or owners, respectively. If you’re not sure what type of
business you have, talk with your accountant.
2. Enter your information in the Federal Employer, State Employer, and
State Unemployment IDs fields.
If your state doesn’t use employer IDs or unemployment IDs, leave these
fields blank.

3. Click Next to move to the screen where you select an option for how
you want to build your Chart of Accounts.
4. Select an option (see Figure 2-1) and then click Next.
If you’re not sure which option to select, read the section “Selecting a
Chart of Accounts,” later in this chapter.
The last option shown here appears only if you’re using Peachtree
Premium or a higher version.
What you see next depends on the option that you select. For example, if
you choose to set up a new company based on one of the several sample
companies, a list of business descriptions appears. Don’t worry if the
accounts that you select don’t match yours completely; you can edit
them after you’re done with the New Company Setup Wizard. (Chapter 3
shows you how to customize the Chart of Accounts.)
If you choose to copy settings from an existing Peachtree company, a list
of existing Peachtree companies appears. Peachtree asks whether you
want to copy default information from these other companies. Usually,
you do want to copy default information.
5. Select the sample Chart of Accounts that most closely matches your
business or click the company from which you want to copy a Chart of
Accounts; then click Next.
The Accounting Method screen appears.
6. Select an accounting method and then click Next.
For important information on choosing an accounting method, see the
“Selecting an Accounting Method” section later in this chapter.
The accounting method is one of the two items that you can’t change
after you finish creating your Peachtree company. Be sure you select the
correct method before proceeding.

7. Select a posting method and then click Next.
To understand posting methods, see the “Selecting a Posting Method”
section later in this chapter.
The Accounting Periods screen appears.
8. Select an accounting period structure option and then click Next.
See the “Selecting Accounting Periods” section, later in this chapter, if
you’re not sure which option to select.
The accounting period is the second of the two items that you can’t
change after you finish creating your Peachtree company. Be sure of
your accounting periods before proceeding.

Selecting a Chart of Accounts
The New Company Setup Wizard also asks you to choose how you want to
set up your Chart of Accounts. If you’re a new business, you might want to
choose one of the samples provided by Peachtree, or you might already have
a Chart of Accounts supplied by your accountant.
The Chart of Accounts lists the names that you use to classify transaction
information and also categorizes the accounts so that they appear in appro-
priate places on financial statements. If you’re not sure which Chart of
24
Part I: Getting Started 

Accounts to select, you can choose one of the sample Charts of Accounts
that are supplied by Peachtree. Peachtree lists dozens of business types (80
to be exact), and each one includes accounts typical to the selected business
type. For example, the accounts that a shoe store uses are different from
those that a drugstore, dentist, or taxicab company uses.
Accounts are the systematic arrangement of numbers and descriptions to
organize the records of the business that your company transacts. Each time
you buy or sell something, you record the transaction and assign it to one or
more accounts. Accounts help you organize information by grouping similar
transactions together.
Peachtree has several Chart of Accounts options (refer to Figure 2-1):
 Use A Sample Business Type That Closely Matches Your Company
(Most Companies Choose This): This option allows you to select from
one of the predefined Charts of Accounts that comes with Peachtree,
many of which are industry-specific such as florist, auto repair, beauty
shop, or video rental businesses.
 Copy Settings from an Existing Peachtree Accounting Company: This
option copies the Chart of Accounts from a Peachtree company that’s
already set up. Use this option if you’re starting your Peachtree com-
pany books over or starting another company with a similar Chart of
Accounts.
 Convert a Company from Another Accounting Program: Select this
option if you’re switching from Peachtree Complete Accounting for DOS
or from Quicken.
If you want to convert from QuickBooks or DacEasy, choose the Convert
from Another Accounting Program option that appears on the Start
screen.
 Build Your Own Company: Use this choice if your accountant has sup-
plied you with an account list or you’re starting Peachtree after having
used a manual system that uses account numbers.
 Consolidate Existing Peachtree Accounting Companies: If you’re using
Peachtree Premium or a higher version, you can select this option to
combine the Charts of Accounts of other existing Peachtree companies
to create a new consolidated Chart of Accounts.
Selecting an Accounting Method
At the beginning of this chapter, we mention that you enter two pieces of 
permanent information in the New Company Setup Wizard. Selecting your
accounting method is one of those two pieces of info. Your business can be
accrual-based or cash-based.

Chapter 2: Setting Up Your Company

Because you must report your accounting method to the IRS, don’t just arbi-
trarily pick one. If you’re not sure, ask your accountant. Doing so might just
keep you out of jail.
Selecting a Posting Method
The posting method determines how Peachtree processes or transfers the
transactions that you enter from the individual journals to the General
Ledger (GL). You have two options: real-time or batch posting. You can
switch posting methods at any time.
Journals are electronic or paper records of accounting transactions.
Peachtree has many different types of journals. For example, the Cash
Receipts journal stores transactions of money that you receive, and the Cash
Disbursements journal stores transactions of the money that you spend.
Through posting, the journals ultimately go into the GL, where Peachtree
sorts the information and reports it to you on financial statements.
If you choose real-time posting, Peachtree posts the transactions to both the
individual journals (such as Cash Receipts) and to the GL as you enter and
save transactions. This posting method immediately updates the company’s

Accrual or cash: What’s the difference?
An accrual-based business recognizes income
in the month an invoice was issued to a cus-
tomer, regardless of when that customer
decides to pay. Also, accrual-based businesses
recognize a purchase as an expense in the
month that you make the purchase and receive
the bill, not whenever you write the check to
your supplier.
A cash-based business declares income in the
month that you receive the payment from your
customer and expenses in the month that you
actually write the check to your supplier. Dates
of customer invoices and vendor bills play no
role in a cash-based business.
Say, for example, that you sell a $20,000 service
to Smith and Sons on December 13, 2007. You
invoice them right away, but they don’t pay you
until April 2 of the next year. Do you declare that
$20,000 as part of your sales for December? If
the answer is yes, you’re running an accrual-
based business. If that $20,000 doesn’t show up
on your income statement until April 2008,
you’re running a cash-based business.
100 235

financial information. For example, if an accrual-based business using real-
time posting enters an invoice to a customer and then prints an income state-
ment, that invoice is included in the income totals.
Real-time posting can save you a lot of time and extra steps. We recommend
that you use the real-time posting method.
If you choose batch posting, Peachtree saves the transactions and then posts
them in a group when you initiate the posting process. When you use batch
posting, you can print registers and check the batch of transactions before
posting them to the journals.
While using batch posting, Peachtree prompts you to post journals when nec-
essary. For example, before you enter a customer receipt, you need to have
all the invoices posted.
Selecting Accounting Periods
According to a calendar in our office (the one with the Yorkshire terriers all
over it), a new year starts on January 1. Some businesses, however, start
their business years — or fiscal years — at other times. Maybe you can’t
watch Dick Clark as the new fiscal year rolls in, but we guess if you want, you
could have champagne and throw confetti. (For details on closing a fiscal
year, see Chapter 17.)
Setting up the fiscal periods correctly in Peachtree is very important because
it’s the second of the two permanent items you set in the New Company
Setup Wizard. After you create fiscal periods, you can’t change them.
You can choose from two options on this screen:
 Twelve Monthly Accounting Periods: Each accounting period’s starting
and ending dates match those of the 12 calendar months. On the next
screen, you can choose the month to start your fiscal year.
 Accounting Periods That Do Not Match the Calendar Month: Select this
option if you want to set up a custom fiscal year structure. For example,
you might want four accounting periods per year or possibly 13 four-
week accounting periods per year.
On the next screen, Peachtree prompts you to choose the year and month
that you want to begin entering data. If you choose to set your own fiscal 
27

calendar month, Peachtree also asks you to enter the number of accounting
periods that you want to use. Most businesses use 12 accounting periods,
based on the calendar months.

 Modifying the Chart of Accounts
W
e know you’re eager to start using the software. But before you dive
in, we need to tell you a little about the Chart of Accounts, which
serves as the foundation for all your reports. To make sure that you get the
reports you want, you might find that a little planning at this stage is wise.
Some of the material in this chapter might seem a little dry because it deals
with accounting principles and information that you need for your big picture
financial tracking, but understanding this information helps you set up the
Chart of Accounts that produces the business reports that you want.
Understanding the Chart of Accounts
You use accounts to keep records of the business that your company trans-
acts. Each time when you buy or sell something, you assign the transaction
to appropriate accounts. Accounts help you organize information by keeping
similar transactions together. In today’s world, for example, you probably get
several different telephone bills for your regular phone, your fax phone, your
cellular phone, your pager, and so on. But when you think of the big picture,
all the bills are related to telephone expenses. So when you pay these bills,
you record all the transactions in the Telephone Expense account.
The Chart of Accounts is nothing more than the list of all your accounts. The
Chart of Accounts doesn’t show any amounts — just titles and numbers that
you assign to each account. Like any list, though, you can — and should —
organize the Chart of Accounts to make the best use of it. So where do you
get a list of your accounts and their balances? Use the General Ledger Trial
Balance report. See Chapter 15 for details.

Understanding account types
Good accountants and bookkeepers are typically very organized people.
They would hate what they do (and probably wouldn’t do it for long) if they
weren’t. So, it should come as no big surprise that they’ve invented a method
to help them organize things further.
To organize the Chart of Accounts, Peachtree uses account types. Usually,
accounts are broken down into five general categories of account types:
 Assets: Things that you own. Money in checking and savings accounts,
computers, trucks, and money that others owe you are all examples of
assets.
 Liabilities: Debts that you owe to others. Bills from your vendors and
bank loans are examples of liabilities.
 Equity: Also known as net worth, equity represents the amount that
owners have invested in the company. Some people prefer to think of
equity as the owner’s claim against the assets of the company (as
opposed to liabilities, which are outsiders’ claims against the business).
Basically, if you used your assets to pay off your liabilities, what you’d
have left is equity.
 Income: The sales that you make to your customers. Income and rev-
enue are interchangeable terms.
 Expenses: The cost of staying in business to do business. The wages
that you pay your employees and the money that you spend advertising
are expenses.
You can break down these account types even further to organize them. In
Table 3-1, you see the account types that are available in Peachtree, their gen-
eral categories, and what they represent. The sidebar “Accounting terms for
account types” gives the accounting details on these types.

these accounts to produce an aging report of customers’ outstanding bal-
ances or of bills that are due to vendors. See Chapter 2 for more on account-
ing methods.
32
Part I: Getting Started 

Keep a couple of notes in mind about the account types and equity accounts
in your Chart of Accounts: The account type that you choose for an account
determines the financial report on which the account appears and the place-
ment on the financial report. Consider the three main financial reports: the
Income Statement, the Balance Sheet, and the Trial Balance. Income and
Expense accounts appear on the Income Statement, but not on the Balance
Sheet. The Balance Sheet shows all Asset, Liability, and Equity accounts, but
no Income or Expense accounts. The Trial Balance shows all account types,
in the following order: Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Income, and Expenses.
The account type also determines how Peachtree handles the account when
you close your year. For example, Peachtree zeros-out Income and Expense
accounts but doesn’t zero-out Asset or Liability accounts. Keep in mind the
following points about equity accounts:
 You can have only one Equity–Retained Earnings account.
 You should show the initial investment in the business as either Paid-In
Capital, if your business type is a corporation, or Owner’s Contributions,
if your business type is a proprietorship (sole or partnership) or an LLC
(Limited Liability Company). These are Equity–Doesn’t Close account
types.
 You should track withdrawals from the initial investment by using a
Dividends Paid (corporation) or Owner’s Draw (proprietorship) account;
these accounts are Equity–Gets Closed account types.
The sum of the Equity–Retained Earnings account and any Equity–Doesn’t
Close accounts (you can have more than one Equity–Doesn’t Close account
types) equals the net worth of the company prior to the current year.
33
Chapter 3: Designing the Chart of Accounts
Accounting terms for account types
Nonworking capital is something that you own
and don’t sell to customers, but you could sell it
to turn it into cash. Certificates of deposit (CDs)
are an example of nonworking capital. The
length of time before the CD matures deter-
mines whether it’s an other current asset or 
an other asset. If your company owns CDs or
bonds that don’t mature for at least one year,
you have other assets.
Income and revenue are interchangeable
terms.
Some people call cost of sales, cost of goods
sold — same thing.

Numbering accounts
As we describe in the preceding section, account types help you organize the
appearance of accounts on financial statements. The account numbers that
you use can also affect the information that you can present on financial
reports.
Peachtree places very few restrictions on the numbering scheme that you
use. Be aware of the following points when you develop your account num-
bering scheme:
 Peachtree sorts Account IDs alphabetically. That means numbers first,
and you need to use leading zeros to get numbers to sort in numerical
order. (We know that sounds stupid, but it’s true.) For example, to get
the numbers 1, 27, 100, and 1000 to sort in the order just listed, you’d
need to enter them as 0001, 0027, 0100, and 1000.
 Account IDs can contain any printable character except an asterisk (*), a
plus sign (+), or a question mark (?).
 Account IDs can’t contain leading or trailing blanks, but you can use
blanks in the middle.
Most people use numbers — not letters — for Account IDs, and they use let-
ters for the account’s description. The description appears on all reports; the
Account ID appears on only some reports.
Because Peachtree places so few restrictions on the Account ID, you can use
any scheme you want, but we strongly suggest that you keep it logical. For
example, many companies number all asset accounts in the 10000 range, 
liability accounts in the 20000 range, equity accounts in the 30000 range,
income accounts in the 40000 range, cost of sales accounts in the 50000
range, and expense accounts in the 60000 range or higher.
Handling departments or locations
Suppose that your business has multiple geographic locations, and each 
location generates income and expenses. Or suppose that you don’t have
geographic locations but you do have multiple departments, and each depart-
ment generates income and expenses that you want to track. Of course, you
want to produce a company-wide income statement, but how do you want it
to look?
Perhaps you want a detailed Income Statement that’s broken down by depart-
ment, like the one in Figure 3-1. Or maybe you want an Income Statement that
summarizes the information for all departments, like the one in Figure 3-2. Or
maybe you want to be able to produce Income Statements for individual
departments, like the one shown in Figure 3-3.

Chapter 3: Designing the Chart of Accounts

Because we show you all three formats, it’s safe to assume that Peachtree
enables you to produce any of these reports. But to do so, you must correctly
set up the numbering of your Chart of Accounts.
Setting up departmental account numbers
To produce these reports, Peachtree uses a concept called masking that enables
you, through the use of account numbers, to easily limit the information that
appears on reports. To use masking, you divide your account number into
segments; assign the account number — say, 40000 — to the first segment,
and then assign a digit or two to the second segment of the number to repre-
sent the department or location. That is, 40000-01 might be income for
Department 1, and 40000-02 could be income for Department 2.
The implication here is that the first segment of the account (40000) appears
several different times in your Chart of Accounts, but the second segment
contains a different department number. You also set up a 00 level for the
account (that is, 40000-00) that Peachtree uses to display the sum of all the
departments and represent the company as a whole. You record sales and
purchases or payments by using the account number that represents the
department responsible for the sale, purchase, or payment. You would never
record a transaction in the 00 level account. Your expense accounts work the
same way if you want to track costs separately for each department.
If your situation is more complex, and you want to track expenses for multi-
ple locations and for multiple departments at each location, your account
number should include both a location segment and a department segment.
To track sales for Location 1, Department 1, your Sales account number
might be 40000-01-01, where the first 01 tracks the Location and the second
01 tracks the Department. Table 3-2 shows the various possible combinations
for Sales accounts that you would find in your Chart of Accounts if you had
three locations and three departments:
Table 3-2
Sample Combinations for Accounts

Sales for Location 3, Department 2
40000-03-02
Sales for Location 3, Department 3
40000-03-03
Don’t forget to allow the maximum number of characters that you need for
your departments and locations and keep future growth in mind. For exam-
ple, if you have ten or more departments, you need two digits for your
department number. Don’t forget to use a leading zero for department num-
bers less than ten (for example, 01, 02, 03, and so on).
You can create up to five account segments, but the total number of characters
you can use for an account number is 15, including the segment separators.
If you’re using any version of Peachtree other than Peachtree Premium or
higher and you want to use masking, do so when creating your Chart of
Accounts by simply setting up the appropriate account numbers. If you’re
using Peachtree Premium or higher, you can add masking to your existing
Chart of Accounts by setting up account segments. Follow these steps to
identify your account segment structure in Peachtree.
1. Choose Maintain➪Default Information➪General Ledger.
Peachtree displays the General Ledger Defaults dialog box, as shown in
Figure 3-4.
Figure 3-4:

Chapter 3: Designing the Chart of Accounts

2. Click the Account Segments tab.
3. Click in the Segment Description field and type a description of the
portion of the account number that you want to define.
4. Click in the Length field and type the value that represents the
number of digits you want to assign to this segment of the account
number.
5. Click the Separator drop-down list arrow and select a character to sep-
arate portions of the account number.
6. Repeat Steps 3–5 for each segment that you want to define.
7. Click OK.
If you’re identifying segments for an existing Chart of Accounts, Peachtree
displays a message that tells you how many accounts you currently have that
don’t match the segment structure that you defined when you clicked OK.
Simply click OK when you see the message and edit your Chart of Accounts
to provide the new segment numbers as appropriate by using the information
in the next section. Remember, you don’t need to assign numbers for any 
segment other than the first segment of your account number — the other
segments are optional. Many people use them only for Income and Expense
accounts.
Consolidating departmental figures
With Peachtree Premium or higher, you can extend the department/location
scenario from the preceding section one step further. Suppose that you find
yourself in the situation where you have two or three geographic locations
that each need to use Peachtree — and you’re not networked. You can set up
separate companies in Peachtree, but at the end of an accounting period, you
won’t have a consolidated financial statement to show the true financial pic-
ture of your company. Then, you can consolidate the companies to produce
reports.
In Peachtree Premium or higher, you can consolidate companies by creating
a new company that contains — or consolidates — companies that you
select. The New Company Wizard gives you the option to create a company
that consolidates other companies, and then lets you select the companies to
consolidate. The companies that you consolidate must have the same fiscal
year and accounting method. See Chapter 2 for details on creating a new
company.
If you segment the Chart of Accounts in each company in the same way, con-
solidating is quick and painless and lets you produce departmental as well as
company-wide financial statements.

Modifying the Chart of Accounts
After you understand account types, numbering, and so on, you can dive in
and make additions, changes, or deletions to the Chart of Accounts. To make
any changes to the Chart of Accounts, use the Maintain Chart of Accounts
window, as shown in Figure 3-5.
Adding new accounts
To add an account, follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Chart of Accounts.
2. In the Maintain Chart of Accounts window, type a number for the new
account in the Account ID field.
Peachtree opens the account list and shows you the number of the
account that most closely matches the number you typed. Make sure
that you type a new number — one that doesn’t already exist. You 
can print a copy of your existing Chart of Accounts by clicking the
Reports button, as shown here in the margin, and choosing Chart of
Accounts.

If you create an account number that doesn’t match the segmenting 
scheme, you see a message. You can click OK and create the account despite
the message.
Editing accounts
You can edit an account’s Account ID, description, or account type by follow-
ing these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Chart of Accounts.
Peachtree displays the Maintain Chart of Accounts window (refer to
Figure 3-5).
2. Click the drop-down list arrow beside the Account ID field or type the
first few characters of the Account ID.
Peachtree displays the account list.
3. Highlight the account and click OK.
4. Retype the description or change the account type.

Deleting accounts
You can delete accounts that have no activity — that is, you haven’t used
them in any transactions. Choose Maintain➪Chart of Accounts to display the
Maintain Chart of Accounts window. Select the account by using the drop-
down list arrow or by typing the account number; then click the Delete
button on the toolbar, as shown here in the margin.
If you try to delete an account that you’ve used in transactions, Peachtree
tells you that it can’t delete the account. You can, however, set the status of
the account to Inactive and then set Peachtree options to hide inactive
accounts. If you choose to hide inactive accounts, they don’t appear in the
list of any transaction window. In addition, hidden accounts don’t appear on
any report except the Chart of Accounts report. Only people who know the
account’s number are able to use it. To make an account inactive, display it in
the Maintain Chart of Accounts window, select the Inactive check box, and
click the Save button. You find out how to hide inactive accounts in Bonus
Chapter 1 on this book’s Web site, www.dummies.com/go/peachtreefd.
When you make an account inactive, you make it eligible for deletion when
you purge. See Chapter 17 for information on purging.
Identifying the rounding account
Peachtree can round numbers on financial statements to either whole dollars
or whole thousands of dollars. So, occasionally, when you prepare financial
statements, Peachtree needs to round numbers. Also, Peachtree needs a
place to store the difference caused by rounding. Although the account you
select can be any account, Peachtree recommends that you use the Retained
Earnings account.
To make sure that Peachtree uses the Retained Earnings account for round-
ing, follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Default Information➪General Ledger.
Peachtree displays the General Ledger Defaults dialog box (refer to
Figure 3-4).
2. Click the Rounding Account tab.
3. Confirm that Peachtree has selected the single account that you’ve
designated as Equity–Retained Earnings.
If necessary, click the magnifying glass next to the account number to
display the list. In the unlikely event that Peachtree chooses the wrong
account, change it to Equity–Retained Earnings.

And now is a good time to talk about timing. How do you know when you should
go live with Peachtree? Well, ideally, start using a new accounting package on
the first day of your accounting year — January 1 (if your business operates on a
calendar year) or the first day of your fiscal year. If you can’t wait that long, then
start using Peachtree on the first day of a quarter. And if you can’t start using
Peachtree on the first day of a quarter, then start on the first day of a month.
Why these target dates? Well, you have the least amount of setup work to do.
For example, if your business operates on a calendar year and you start using
Peachtree on January 1, you don’t need to enter any beginning balances for
payroll or any of your income or expense accounts because the balances of
these accounts start at zero on January 1. If you start at the beginning of a quar-
ter and you’re willing to forego monthly reports preceding that quarter, you
can enter summarized information for preceding quarters. And, if you start on
the first day of a month, you don’t need to play catch-up by entering all trans-
actions for the month — which you’d need to do if you’d started mid-month.
Where do you get the numbers?
If you’ve been using some other accounting package, you can print an Income
Statement, Balance Sheet, and a Trial Balance as of the last month that you
intend to use that accounting package. You can use a combination of the
Balance Sheet and the Income Statement, or you can use the Trial Balance:
The numbers on these reports in your old software represent the beginning
balance numbers of your new Peachtree company.
If you’ve never used any other accounting package, contact your accountant.
Provide the date that you want to start your company and ask for a Trial
Balance, a Balance Sheet, and an Income Statement as of that date. Your
accountant probably can’t provide the information instantly, especially if 
you want to start on January 1, and you ask for the information in December
of the prior year. Your accountant needs to prepare these reports after
December 31 so that the reports include all the prior year’s transactions.
But don’t worry; you can start working in Peachtree without beginning bal-
ance numbers; in fact, you might as well start working in Peachtree without
beginning balance numbers. You just need to remember that year-to-date
reports aren’t accurate because they don’t show the entire picture until you
enter beginning balances.
42
Part I: Getting Started 

Entering beginning balances
After you get the numbers, entering them into Peachtree isn’t difficult. If
you’re going to start using Peachtree at any time other than the beginning of
your business year, we suggest you use the alternative method described in
the next section. If you’re going to start using Peachtree at the beginning of
your business year (calendar or fiscal), we suggest that you use the Chart of
Accounts Beginning Balances or Prior Year Adjustments window to enter
beginning balances.
The two windows look and operate identically except for the name that appears
in the title bar. You see the Chart of Accounts Beginning Balances window if
you haven’t posted any transactions in your Peachtree company. If you have
posted transactions, Peachtree displays the Prior Year Adjustments window.
Follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Chart of Accounts.
Peachtree displays the Maintain Chart of Accounts window (refer to
Figure 3-5).
2. Click the Account Beginning Balances button.
Peachtree displays the Select Period dialog box.
3. Select the period from the list.
Until you enter transactions, you can enter beginning balances in
Peachtree by month for the year preceding your first open year, for your
first open year, or for your second open year. If Period 1 for the company
is January 2008, Peachtree makes available each month in 2007, 2008,
and 2009; all balances prior to January 1, 2007, are lumped together into
Before 1/1/07.
4. Click OK.
Peachtree displays the Chart of Accounts Beginning Balances window or
Prior Year Adjustments window (see Figure 3-7).
5. Using the numbers that you’ve gotten either from your old accounting
system’s Trial Balance or from your accountant, enter the balances for
each account.
If you have an unusual balance in an account (for example, your cash
balance is a negative instead of a positive balance), enter a negative
number for the account balance.
After you finish, the Net Income number at the bottom of the window
represents your Net Income for the period. Look for the Net Income at
the bottom of your Income Statement.
6. Click OK to store your beginning balances.

Chapter 3: Designing the Chart of Accounts

You can find out more about posting transactions in Chapters 5–9.
An alternative method for entering beginning balances
If you start using Peachtree at any time other than the beginning of the busi-
ness year, we suggest that you enter one (or more) journal entries to repre-
sent your beginning balances instead of using the Chart of Accounts
Beginning Balances or Chart of Accounts Prior Year Adjustments window. We
find that using journal entries for midyear starts seems to be less confusing.
You’d enter the journal entries to provide balances as of the first day of the
first open month.
Because we’re trying to avoid using the d word and the c word this early in
the book (debits and credits), we save the discussion of journal entries for
Chapter 17 and Bonus Chapter 5.
The B word — Budgeting
Nobody likes to live on a budget, but for most of us, budgets are a fact of life.
In the business world, budgets can help you compare how your business is
actually doing to how you thought it would do.
You can create budgets for each account in Peachtree; you can then print
Budget vs. Actual reports to see how well you’re doing. Although we’d love to
walk you through the details on budgeting, the wicked editors refused to give
us enough space in this book. We know you’re a pretty smart reader, so
here’s a synopsis.

Part I: Getting Started 

Choose Maintain➪Budgets. In the Maintain Budgets window that appears,
select an Account ID for which you want to establish budget numbers. Then
fill in budget amounts for each month in the available fiscal years. You can
use the Autofill button, as shown here in the margin, to fill in the budget with
actual data from Peachtree or to copy amounts from another budget and save
yourself some typing. You can also start with a blank budget and import infor-
mation stored in a CSV file. In the Budget Name box, type a name for the budget
and, in the Description box, you can describe the budget in a way that’s mean-
ingful to you. Click Save, select the next account, and repeat the process.
If you don’t know what a CSV file is, you probably don’t have one to use to
import budget information. However, many programs can create comma-
separated value files (.csv) and, if you have budget information stored in
such a program, you can use that program’s features to create a CSV file that
you can then import into a Peachtree budget.
In Peachtree Premium or higher, you can create an unlimited number of bud-
gets for a four-year period.
Visit this book’s Web site, www.dummies.com/go/peachtreefd, for more
information on Peachtree.

Chapter 3: Designing the Chart of Accounts
If you’re out of balance . . .
You know that you’re out of balance if the Trial
Balance number in Figure 3-7 is not zero. In 
this case, Peachtree wants to post the differ-
ence to an Equity–Doesn’t Close account called
Beg. Bal. Equity. This account doesn’t appear in
the Beginning Balances window, but it does
appear on financial statements, General Ledger
reports, and in the Chart of Accounts list. The
chances are good that you’re out of balance
because of a typing mistake; double-check the
numbers that you’ve entered and make sure
you’ve entered all the numbers.
If you still can’t find the mistake, you can click
through Peachtree’s warning and let it create
the Beg. Bal. Equity account. Your company is
then in balance, and you can safely proceed to
enter transactions. If you have to use this
workaround, you need to live with the Beg. Bal.
Equity account until you find the source of the
problem. You can then correct it by clicking the
Beginning Balances button in the Maintain
Chart of Accounts window. Peachtree displays
the Beginning Balances window if you haven’t
posted any transactions. If you have posted
transactions, Peachtree displays the Prior Year
Adjustment window, which looks and operates
just like the Beginning Balances window. When
the Beg. Bal. Equity account has a zero balance,
you can delete the account.

Setting Up Background
Information
In This Chapter

 Setting up payroll preferences
 Choosing inventory preferences
I
f you set up preferences in Peachtree before you dive into the day-to-day
stuff of managing your company’s books, you save time because Peachtree
uses the default information as a model for the tasks you do daily. You know,
stuff like creating vendors, customers, employees, and inventory items, and
entering transactions (purchase orders, purchases, invoices, payroll checks,
and so on). You can alter this global information when a particular person or
item requires something other than the default.
Terminology alert: Peachtree switches back and forth between two terms
when referring to bills that vendors send you: a purchase and an invoice. For
the sake of clarity, we call a vendor bill a purchase; invoices are the things
you send to customers so that you can get paid.
Setting Purchasing Preferences
“What kind of information do I need to supply for vendors?” you ask. Well,
you set up standard terms. Terms describe how long the vendor gives you to
hold a bill before you need to pay it and how you want Peachtree to respond
if vendors offer you a discount for paying early. You also identify the default
account to assign to most vendor bills and vendor discounts. And you spec-
ify how you want Peachtree to age bills that you enter. Lastly, you can set up
custom fields for vendors so you can track information that you specify
about the people from whom you buy goods or services.

48
Part I: Getting Started 
Aging refers to how long you hold an invoice from the date it was issued.
Peachtree applies these preferences to all vendors you create and all pur-
chases you enter. If a vendor or a transaction is unusual in some way, you
make a change to the specific vendor or transaction. Using standardized
information in this way saves you time because you need to change the stan-
dard information only for exceptions to the rule. And face it — we all like to
save time. See Chapter 5 for information on setting up vendors.
Establishing default payment terms 
and accounts
Efficient bill paying is an art. You don’t want to pay your bills too early or too
late. For example, if your bank account earns interest, you don’t want to pay
a vendor’s bill too soon, because you lose interest from the bank. On the
other hand, if your vendor assesses late fees or finance charges for bills that
you don’t pay on time, you don’t want to pay a bill too late.
Using the Peachtree Vendor Defaults dialog box, you can establish a typical
set of terms to use for most vendors. Chapter 5 shows you how to create ven-
dors and how Peachtree automatically assigns these default terms to each
vendor. You need to change terms for only those vendors who don’t use the
typical terms.
To set default payment terms and accounts that most vendors use, follow
these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Default Information➪Vendors.
Peachtree displays the Vendor Defaults dialog box (see Figure 4-1).
Figure 4-1:
Use the
Vendor
Defaults
dialog box
to define
typical
settings for
vendors.
100 235
500
99
83

You can also choose Options➪Default Information➪Vendors to reach the
same screen and set the same options.
2. From among the Standard Terms option buttons, select the option that
best describes the terms most of your vendors offer you.
The terms shown in Figure 4-1 are 2% 10 Net 30, which means you can
discount the bill by 2 percent if you pay it within 10 days; otherwise, the
entire amount of the bill is due in 30 days.
3. Fill in the appropriate fields to the right of the terms you select in
Step 2.
As you select an option button on the left, the fields on the right change.
For example, if you select C.O.D. (cash on delivery) or Prepaid, only the
Credit Limit field on the right remains available, because none of the
other fields apply.
4. At the bottom of the Payment Terms tab, click the magnifying glass to
select the account that you use most often when you post purchases
from vendors.
If you don’t select an account, Peachtree prompts you for an account
each time you create a new vendor. If you do select an account,
Peachtree fills it in automatically when you create a new vendor.
5. In the Discount GL Account field, select the account to which you
want Peachtree to post discounts that vendors give you for paying in
the specified time.
To select the account, type its account number or click the lookup list
button (the magnifying glass) to the right of the account number to dis-
play a list. In the list, highlight the account number and then click OK.
6. Click OK to close the dialog box or leave it open to review additional
defaults in the sections that follow.
Keep two points in mind: First, you may never receive discounts from your
vendors, but Peachtree expects you to set up the account anyhow. Second,
you may want to increase the credit limit while you’re setting other vendor
defaults. If you exceed the credit limit when buying from a vendor, you can
still buy from the vendor, but you see an annoying message telling you that
you’ve exceeded the credit limit.
Aging vendor bills
When you age a bill, you hold onto it for a specified period of time before you
pay it. You can age purchases (that is, you can tell Peachtree to count the
number of days you hold the bill) from either the billing date or the due date.
49
Chapter 4: Setting Up Background Information

To set account aging defaults, choose Maintain➪Default Information➪Vendors.
On the Account Aging tab, select a method to age bills: Invoice Date or Due
Date. Optionally, you can change the number of days in each of the four
columns on the Aged Payables report.
You may find the difference between the two aging methods easier to under-
stand if you take a look at two Aged Payables reports, each prepared by using
one of the aging methods. In Figure 4-2, we set the Aging option to Due Date
and then prepared a customized Accounts Payable Aging report for only one
vendor, Akerson Distribution, as of March 31, 2007. In Figure 4-3, we switched
the Aging Option to Invoice Date and printed the same report for the same
vendor and time frame. (Note that invoice here refers to bills your vendors
send you — what we call purchases.)
Both reports show four outstanding bills for Akerson Distribution. Each bill,
along with its date and due date, is listed on a separate line.
Notice the third bill — the one for $5,962.50. It was posted as of February 1,
2007, with terms of Net 30; that is, the bill is due 30 days from the bill date of
February 1 — on March 3. On the first report, the bill appears to be some-
where between 0 and 30 days old, whereas on the second report, it appears
to be somewhere between 31 and 60 days old. In actuality, according to the
first report, on March 31, 2007, the bill is somewhere between 0 and 30 days
past the due date of the bill. According to the second report, on March 31,
2007, the bill is somewhere between 31 and 60 days past the invoice date of
the bill.
Figure 4-2:

50
Part I: Getting Started 

This report is not showing you what is overdue; it’s showing you the bill’s age
based on the number of days past either the due date or the invoice date.
Many people choose to age vendor bills by due date because the bills look
“less overdue” on the aging report.
Creating custom fields for vendors
Custom fields are a great way to store information about your vendors that
doesn’t fit elsewhere in Peachtree, such as details specific to your business
or industry. For example, many businesses track a workers’ compensation
certificate number for subcontractors to justify not covering the subcontrac-
tor on the company’s workers’ compensation insurance. On the Custom
Fields tab of the Vendor Defaults dialog box, you can create up to five fields
for each vendor. In the Enabled column, select the check box next to each
custom field that you want to use and then type the name of the custom field
in the Field Labels text box.
When you set up vendors in Chapter 5, you can fill in this information for
each vendor. On some reports in Peachtree, you can print this information.
1099 Settings
On the 1099 Settings tab of the Vendor Defaults dialog box, you can (if neces-
sary) change the way that Peachtree calculates 1099 payments. For each
Figure 4-3:
An Aging
report
showing
bills aged by
invoice
date.
51
Chapter 4: Setting Up Background Information

account on the Chart of Accounts, you can identify whether and how Peachtree
should calculate 1099 income. By default, Peachtree assumes that you will
establish the correct 1099 type for each vendor when you create the vendor, so
each account is set up to look at the vendor’s record. You can, however, specify
that a particular account should be used to calculate 1099 miscellaneous
income or 1099 interest income, or you can specify that the account should not
be used when calculating 1099 income. In most cases, you don’t need to
change the default settings.
Setting Sales Preferences
“What kind of information do I supply for customers?” you ask. Well, you set
up standard terms for customers like you do for vendors. This time, though,
you’re the one establishing when payment is due and whether you offer cus-
tomers a discount for paying early. Customer terms also tell Peachtree how
to respond if customers pay early. You also identify the default sales account
and discount account where you want Peachtree to assign most customer
invoices. You specify how you want Peachtree to age invoices that you pre-
pare. Like with vendors, you can set up custom fields for customers to track
specific information that may help you increase sales or offer perks. You also
can decide whether to apply finance charges to overdue invoices, and you
can set customers’ Pay Methods — cash, check, or credit card.
The concept of aging applies also to invoices you send to your customers. In
this instance, aging refers to the specified period of time the customer waits
before paying your invoice. You set payment terms that tell your customers
how long you expect them to wait before paying an invoice — and potentially
charge the customer finance charges for late payment.
Like with vendors, Peachtree applies these preferences to all customers you
create and all invoices you enter. If a customer or a transaction is unusual in
some way, you can make a change to the specific customer or transaction.
Establishing default payment terms 
and accounts
When customers don’t pay you in a timely fashion, you may experience cash
flow problems. That is, you have money going out of your business for
expenses but not enough money coming in to cover those expenses. To
encourage your customers to pay on time, you establish payment terms simi-
lar to the ones your vendors set for you.
52
Part I: Getting Started 

From the Peachtree Customer Defaults dialog box, you can establish a typical
set of terms to use for most customers. Peachtree automatically assigns
these terms when you create customers (see Chapter 7). When you create
customers, you can change preferences for those customers who don’t use
the typical terms.
To set default payment terms and accounts for most customers, follow these
steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Default Information➪Customers.
Peachtree displays the Customer Defaults dialog box (see Figure 4-4).
2. From among the Standard Terms option buttons, select the option that
best describes the terms that you offer most of your customers.
The terms shown in Figure 4-4 are 2% 10 Net EOM, which means your
customers can discount the invoice by 2 percent if they pay it within ten
days; otherwise, the entire amount of the invoice is due at the end of the
month. (EOM stands for end of month.) These terms are appropriate if
you typically invoice at the beginning of each month.
3. Fill in the appropriate fields to the right of the terms you selected in
Step 2.
The options for customer terms work like the options for vendor terms.
As you select an option button on the left, the fields on the right change.
For example, if you select C.O.D. or Prepaid, only the Credit Limit field
on the right remains available because none of the other fields apply.
Figure 4-4:
Use the
Customer
Defaults
dialog box

53
Chapter 4: Setting Up Background Information

You can use the Credit Status list to control Peachtree’s behavior in rela-
tion to the customer’s credit limit when you enter an invoice. The list
contains five choices. On one end of the spectrum, you can record
invoices without seeing any messages, regardless of the relationship
between the customer’s balance and credit limit. On the other end of the
spectrum, Peachtree will not allow you to enter an invoice for a cus-
tomer regardless of the relationship between the customer’s balance
and credit limit. In between these choices, you can have Peachtree dis-
play a warning or an error message when a transaction will cause a cus-
tomer’s balance to exceed the credit limit. And you can have Peachtree
display a warning whenever you record a transaction even if the cus-
tomer’s balance doesn’t exceed his or her credit limit.
4. Select the GL Sales Account that you use most often when you sell
goods or services to customers.
To select the account, type the account number or click the lookup list
identifier (the magnifying glass) to the right of the account number to dis-
play and select from a lookup list. If you don’t select an account, Peachtree
prompts you for an account each time you create a new customer.
5. Select the Discount GL Account you use to track discounts taken by
customers.
6. After you finish setting payment preferences, click OK to save those
preferences.
Even if you never offer discounts to your customers, Peachtree expects you
to set up the account anyhow. (If you haven’t set up a Discount General
Ledger account, see Chapter 3 for information on creating accounts.)
Aging customer invoices
We talk about aging a lot in our society, and now you’re getting a whole new
picture of wrinkled bills and invoices. Just as you can control the aging
process for vendor bills, you can age customer invoices from either the
invoice date or the due date. Unfortunately, you can’t control the wrinkles
from the other kind of aging. . . .
Accounts receivable aging works the same as accounts payable aging — that
is, you can choose to age by due date or by invoice date. Suppose that you
post an invoice as of February 20, 2007, with terms of 2% 10 Net 30.
If you set up accounts receivable aging to age by due date, the invoice is due 30
days from the invoice date of February 20, which is March 22. On the Accounts
Receivable Aging report, the invoice appears to be somewhere between 0 and
30 days old — that is, on March 31, 2007, the invoice is somewhere between 0
and 30 days past the due date of the invoice.
54
Part I: Getting Started 

Alternatively, if you set up accounts receivable aging to age by invoice date,
the same invoice appears on the Accounts Receivable Aging report to be
somewhere between 31 and 60 days old. That is, on March 31, 2007, the
invoice is somewhere between 31 and 60 days past the invoice date of the
invoice.
This report shows you all invoices, including those not yet due as well as those
that are overdue. Although most people use this report to identify overdue
invoices, the report’s actual purpose is to show you the age of invoices based
on the number of days past either the due date or the invoice date.
Many people choose to age customer invoices by invoice date because the
aging report then reflects how old the invoice is. Others prefer to age invoices
by due date so that they can see how many days the invoice is overdue.
Creating custom fields for customers
On the Custom Fields tab of the Customer Defaults dialog box, you can enter
labels for up to five fields for each customer. Use these fields to store extra
information about customers, such as noting new customers who found your
business on the Web. In the Enabled column, select the check box next to
each custom field that you want to use and then type the name of the custom
field in the Field Labels text box. When you set up customers, you can fill in
this information for each customer. On some reports in Peachtree, you can
print this information.
Suppose that you’ve established a label and filled in information for cus-
tomers. If you reopen the Customer Defaults dialog box and change the label,
you won’t affect the information you stored for each customer; you must edit
each customer’s record and make a change to match the new label you’ve
established. If you simply don’t want to show the information you’ve already
entered, you can hide the stored information by deselecting the Enabled
check box in the Customer Defaults dialog box. However, the information
reappears if you enable the custom field once again.
Setting up finance charges
Finance charges are fees that you charge customers who pay late. Many busi-
nesses don’t charge finance charges; others believe that finance charges
encourage customers to pay on time and therefore improve cash flow. Still
others believe that charging these fees is necessary if customers continu-
ously ignore payment terms.
55
Chapter 4: Setting Up Background Information

If you want to be able to charge finance charges, follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Default Information➪Customers and click the
Finance Charges tab of the Customer Defaults dialog box.
2. Select the Charge Finance Charges check box.
3. Complete the remaining information to tell Peachtree how to calcu-
late finance charges.
Peachtree charges an interest rate that you specify on invoices that are
overdue by the number of days you indicate. You can charge a higher
rate on balances that exceed an amount you stipulate, or you can spec-
ify a minimum finance charge amount.
4. (Optional) Select the Charge Interest on Finance Charges check box.
Selecting the Charge Interest on Finance Charges check box tells
Peachtree to calculate interest on any unpaid balance as well as unpaid
finance charges. Check with your accountant before you select this
check box; in some states, it is illegal to charge interest on interest.
5. Use the lookup list button to select a GL account for finance charges.
6. From the Appears on Invoices and Statements As list, select the
description for the finance charge (either Late Charge or Finance
Charge).
7. (Optional) Provide a warning message that Peachtree can print on
invoices.
The Finance Charge Warning message at the bottom of the Finance
Charges tab is printed on the bottom of invoices you send to customers.
If you’re not charging finance charges, you may want to change the mes-
sage to something like Happy Holidays or See our exhibit at the Business
Expo March 16–19.
8. Click OK.
This information becomes part of your standard terms.
Enabling finance charges does not make Peachtree automatically assess
finance charges. And you don’t need to assign finance charges to all your cus-
tomers. See Chapter 8 for information on assessing finance charges.
Establishing payment methods
Payment methods are exactly what they sound like — the various methods of
payment that your company accepts. You establish these default settings on the
Pay Methods tab of the Customer Defaults dialog box. Choose Maintain➪Default
Information➪Customers and click the Pay Methods tab. Then, in the fields pro-
vided, type the names of the payment methods your company accepts.
56
Part I: Getting Started 

These payment methods are available when you record payments you
receive from customers. You can include the Payment Method field on
reports. For example, you can add this field to the Cash Receipts journal and
filter the journal to see transactions of only one particular payment method.
Adding a new payment method after you already recorded transactions in
Peachtree doesn’t affect previously recorded transactions. The new payment
method is simply available for new transactions.
On the Pay Methods tab, you also can tell Peachtree to automatically assign
deposit ticket IDs in either the Receipts window or the Select for Deposit
window. Deposit ticket IDs help you group payments you receive from cus-
tomers. To help you reconcile your bank statement, you typically use the
same deposit ticket ID for all customer payments that you plan to deposit in
the bank at the same time. See Chapter 8 for more information on recording
receipts and using deposit ticket IDs.
Setting Payroll Preferences
You have three ways to handle payroll preparation in Peachtree. For a fee,
you can use the Peachtree Payroll Service and let Peachtree do everything
for you, or you can do your payroll in-house. If you choose to do payroll in-
house, you can (again, for a fee) subscribe to the Peachtree Payroll Tax
Update Service (which we recommend) or you can manually update payroll
tax tables yourself.
Peachtree does not come with tax tables that calculate federal taxes. To sub-
scribe to the Peachtree Payroll Tax Update Service, visit the Peachtree Web
site at www.peachtree.com. Because the service sends you updates when-
ever laws change that affect payroll taxes, we suggest that you subscribe to
this service to ensure that you’re always using the most up-to-date tax tables.
In addition, if you subscribe to the service, you’ll be able to use the Print &
Sign payroll tax forms to prepare 941 Quarterly Reports and W-2s. You can
read more about these forms in Chapter 17.
For an additional fee, you can let Peachtree file federal and state payroll tax
returns, make payroll tax deposits, and produce and mail W-2s for you. Also,
with any in-house payroll solution, you can subscribe to Peachtree’s Direct
Deposit service.
If you decide to use the Peachtree Payroll Service and let Peachtree do pay-
roll for you, you can skip this entire section. If you decide to use Peachtree
features to prepare payroll, you need to identify some basic information,
such as the state where your company operates. Understanding payroll is dif-
ficult even when you aren’t worried about setting up payroll in an accounting
57
Chapter 4: Setting Up Background Information

program. On the Good News front, though, Peachtree uses a wizard to walk
you through establishing the defaults for preparing payroll checks and tax-
related forms (W-2s, Federal Form 940, and Federal Form 941).
You can use the Payroll Setup Wizard to help you set up payroll when you
first create a company or later, after you’ve been using Peachtree for a while.
No problem — take your choice. We suggest that you use the Payroll Setup
Wizard after you subscribe to the Payroll Tax Update Service. In the para-
graphs that follow, we show you how to use the wizard to set up basic payroll
information.
Using the Payroll Setup Wizard
The Payroll Setup Wizard helps you set up basic information about payroll,
including payroll fields that Peachtree then uses to calculate payroll checks.
Payroll fields are things such as gross wages and federal income tax (FIT) —
one of those many mysterious abbreviations that appear on your payroll
check stub. Chapter 19 describes how to set up a payroll field for some
common payroll deductions (or additions, for those lucky enough to get a
bonus) that you want to include on a paycheck.
The Payroll Setup Wizard can be useful after you’ve set up payroll as well. For
example, suppose that your company didn’t have a 401(k) plan when you
originally set up payroll but later decided to add one. The Payroll Setup
Wizard makes implementing this change easy. Similarly, you can set up pay-
roll and then decide to track vacation and sick leave. See Chapter 19 for infor-
mation on setting up a 401(k) plan; you use the same basic technique to set
up vacation and sick leave that you use to establish a 401(k) plan.
The Payroll Setup Wizard asks you for the General Ledger account numbers
that you intend to use for payroll. If you base your Chart of Accounts on one
of the standard companies when you create your company, the Payroll Setup
Wizard suggests payroll accounts. If you haven’t defined payroll accounts
when the wizard asks for them, you can define them on the fly. Refer to
Chapter 3 for details on setting up accounts.
Some people create separate payroll liability accounts for each payroll tax lia-
bility. To make your life easier when using Peachtree, we recommend that
you create payroll liability accounts that correspond to the taxing authorities
you pay. For example, you pay FIT, FICA, and Medicare to the same taxing
authority, so set up only one payroll liability account for all three taxes. If you
pay state and local taxes to the same taxing authority, set up only one liabil-
ity account for state and local taxes. Check with your accountant if you’re
unsure. We recommend this approach because it makes writing your payroll
tax liability checks easier.

Part I: Getting Started 

To start the Payroll Setup Wizard, follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Default Information➪Payroll Setup Wizard.
The Peachtree Payroll Solutions window appears, listing the options
available to process payroll in Peachtree.
2. Click the Payroll Setup Wizard link on the left side of the screen.
The first screen of the Payroll Setup Wizard appears, on which you
select an in-house solution. You can select
• Peachtree Payroll Tax Update (to subscribe to the service)
If you have already subscribed to the Payroll Tax Update service,
select the Check This Box If You Have Already Ordered the Tax
Service check box.
• Payroll Tax Information Will Be Manually Maintained
3. Select an option and then click Next.
The Initial Payroll Setup screen appears (see Figure 4-5).
4. Fill in the necessary information in the Initial Payroll Setup screen.
a. Select the state in which you pay most of your employees.
Depending on the state you select, Peachtree may ask you for a
locality and locality rate.
Figure 4-5:

Chapter 4: Setting Up Background Information

b. Provide your unemployment compensation rate as a percentage.
When you enter rates into Peachtree, you must express them as
percentages, but many state forms express rates in decimals. For
example, suppose the state form shows that your unemployment
rate is 0.008. That’s a decimal. To express it as a percentage (0.8%),
you’d type 0.8 into Peachtree. Yeah, entering these numbers
requires that high school math stuff, where you have to multiply
a decimal by 100 to get the percentage equivalent. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. . . .
c. Indicate whether you record employee meals and tips.
If you choose to record meals and tips, Peachtree tracks the
amounts for reporting and tax calculation, but it won’t post any
entries to the General Ledger. For more information on recording
meals and tips, refer to IRS Publication 15, Circular E, Employer’s
Tax Guide. You can download a copy of Circular E at the Web site
of the IRS:
http://www.irs.gov/formspubs
d. Identify default General Ledger accounts.
5. Click Next.
The 401(k) Setup screen appears. We’ll assume that you don’t have a
401(k) plan in place; if you do, see Chapter 19 for details on setting up
Peachtree to support your plan.
6. Select the Not Offered option and click Next.
The Vacation and Sick Time Tracking Setup screen appears. We’ll
assume that you don’t want to track vacation and sick leave.
7. Select the Vacation Time Not Tracked option and the Sick Time Not
Tracked option and click Next.
The final screen of the wizard appears.
8. Click Finish.
The Payroll Setup Wizard creates general employee defaults for you.
Establishing general employee defaults
After you run the Payroll Setup Wizard, you can change the payroll settings 
from the Employee Defaults dialog box (choose Maintain➪Default
Information➪Employees). You can use the General tab to change your state or
set a locality if necessary and to establish custom fields for storing miscella-
neous information about each employee. To make a custom field available,
select the Enabled check box next to the field. You also can decide whether you
want to display employees’ names First Name First or Last Name First.

Part I: Getting Started 

Peachtree automatically assigns payroll fields to the various boxes on the
W-2 form, employee-paid taxes, or employer-paid taxes. You can, however,
edit the assignments by clicking the appropriate button in the Assign Payroll
Fields For section.
Setting pay levels
Pay levels are names you set for various types of hourly and salary pay.
Choose Maintain➪Default Information➪Employees and click the Pay Levels
tab. By default, Peachtree automatically establishes the pay levels that
appear on the tab. Hourly wage pay levels appear on the left, and salary pay
levels appear on the right.
You can create up to 20 hourly pay levels and 20 salary pay levels, and you
can assign different pay levels to different General Ledger accounts. Just type
the name for the pay level in the Field Name list and assign the pay level to a
GL account.
You can override these defaults as necessary when you set up your employ-
ees. For example, suppose that you need to keep track of wages by depart-
ment. You can set the default GL account to the department with the largest
number of employees and then, on an individual employee record, change it
to the GL account of the department for that employee.
To make your General Ledger and income statement more meaningful, your
accountant may want you to use a different set of pay levels, pointing some
or all pay levels to different General Ledger accounts. For example, you can
use pay levels based on your workers’ compensation categories as one
method of letting Peachtree help you determine your workers’ compensation
liability.
Employee fields and employer fields
Peachtree categorizes the payroll fields created by the Payroll Setup Wizard
into employee-related fields or employer-related fields. On the EmployEE
Fields tab (see Figure 4-6), you see payroll fields belonging to employees.
These include FIT and the employee’s share of Social Security (FICA) and
Medicare. On the EmployER Fields tab, you can view payroll fields paid by
the company, including Federal Unemployment Tax (FUTA), state unemploy-
ment taxes, and the employer’s share of FICA and Medicare. You can see the
General Ledger account and payroll tax table Peachtree associated with each
of the fields.

Chapter 4: Setting Up Background Information

On the EmployEE Fields tab, you can do the following:
 Change the GL account for a payroll field.
 Change the tax table Peachtree uses to calculate a particular payroll
field. Click in the Tax Name column to display a lookup list button that
enables you to choose from a list of available tax tables.
 In the Memo column, select a check box next to a field, such as Tips, to
tell Peachtree to calculate that field without updating your General
Ledger or including the amounts in employees’ pay. Note that Peachtree
can use fields marked as memos to calculate taxes.
 Place a check in the Run column next to a field to tell Peachtree not to
set the balance for this field to zero at the end of the payroll year. For
example, if you allow your employees to retain unused vacation from
year to year, set up your Vacation field by selecting the Run check box.
 For fields that Peachtree calculates, you can click the Adjust button
beside the field to display the Calculate Adjusted Gross dialog box and
check the fields you want Peachtree to add when calculating Adjusted
Gross Wages. For example, you may want Adjusted Gross Wages to
include gross wages, FICA, and Medicare, but not FIT when calculating an
auto expense deduction.
 For fields that Peachtree doesn’t calculate using a tax table, you can
supply a default amount. For example, if most employees pay the same
amount for medical insurance, you can type that amount in the Amount
column, and on the individual employee’s records, supply the appropri-
ate amount for employees who don’t pay the standard amount.
If you’re entering an amount you want deducted, enter it as a negative
amount.

EmployEE
tab, you see

Part I: Getting Started 

Although you’re allowed to edit the names of payroll fields, don’t change the
name of a payroll field and don’t change the order of the payroll fields after
you enter payroll transactions. You’ll get inaccurate information on the pay-
roll earnings reports and W-2 forms. We recommend that you retain the
names of payroll fields Peachtree creates for you because they are often used
in payroll tax tables.
On the EmployER Fields tab, you can set these preferences:
 Change the General Ledger Liability and Expense accounts for a payroll
field.
 Change the tax table that Peachtree uses to calculate a particular payroll
field. Click in the Tax Name column to display the lookup list button and
then select from a list of available tax tables.
 For fields that Peachtree calculates, you can click the Adjust button
beside the field to display the Calculate Adjusted Gross dialog box and
check the fields you want Peachtree to include when calculating
Adjusted Gross Wages.
The same warning applies to EmployER field names that applies to EmployEE
field names. Don’t change the name of a payroll field and don’t change the
order of the payroll fields after you enter payroll transactions. These alter-
ations create inaccurate information on the payroll earnings reports and W-2
forms. And the names of payroll fields are often used in payroll tax tables.
Setting Inventory Preferences
Before you start filling your virtual shelves in Peachtree, you need to set up
the preferences that help track all those wonderful items as they come and
go. Inventory items, in Peachtree terms, are typically things that you buy from
vendors or sell to customers. It’s important to understand that Peachtree
inventory items don’t necessarily have to be things that you keep on hand or
that add value to the balance sheet. The item class of the inventory item
determines whether it adds value to your balance sheet. In the “Inventory
items and General Ledger accounts” section later in this chapter, you can
read about item classes.
You can set preferences for inventory items by using the Inventory Item
Defaults dialog box, which you open by choosing Maintain➪Default
Information➪Inventory Items. The dialog box contains six tabs. On the
General tab, you can specify whether to permit duplicate values in the
UPC/SKU field and in the Part Number field of inventory items. Read on to
find out about the other defaults you can set.
63
Chapter 4: Setting Up Background Information

Inventory items and ordering defaults
The Ordering tab of the Inventory Item Defaults dialog box, as shown in
Figure 4-7, helps you control issues related to, well, ordering inventory items.
For example, you can choose to have Peachtree include items on purchase
orders when it calculates the quantity available.
You can have Peachtree display an Out of Stock warning when you’re enter-
ing a sales order, an invoice, or a receipt for an inventory item that is out of
stock based on either the quantity on hand or the quantity available.
In the last section of the Ordering tab, you can enable the auto-creation of
purchase orders for drop-ship transactions and non–drop-ship transactions.
If you enable real-time posting and assign a preferred vendor to each inven-
tory item, Peachtree automatically creates purchase orders for you when you
convert a drop-ship quote to a sales order or to an invoice. Peachtree also
creates purchase orders when you enter a drop-ship sales order or a drop-
ship invoice containing inventory items.
If your transactions are not drop-ship transactions, you can have Peachtree
automatically create purchase orders for you when the quantity of an item
you specify causes the quantity available as of the transaction date to fall
below the minimum stock levels you set for the item. Again, for this feature to
work, you must enable real-time posting and assign a preferred vendor to
each inventory item.
See Chapter 5 for details on automatically creating purchase orders and
Chapter 7 for details on drop shipments.

Part I: Getting Started 

Inventory items and General 
Ledger accounts
Peachtree uses item classes to organize inventory items. You assign each
inventory item to a class when you create the item. You can choose the vari-
ous accounts affected by inventory items in each of these item classes. For
stock, master stock, and assembly items, you can also choose an inventory
method. Chapter 11 includes information on how to create inventory items.
For the purpose of setting defaults, an item’s class determines how Peachtree
records the cost of the item.
All 11 of the item classes available in Peachtree Premium and higher appear
in the following list. Peachtree Complete supports nine of these item classes,
Peachtree Pro supports six of these item classes, and Peachtree First sup-
ports four of these item classes.
 Stock: For inventory items that you track for quantities, average costs,
vendors, low stock points, and so on.
In many cases an item class cannot be changed, so choose carefully. For
example, when you assign an item to the Stock item class, you can’t
change the item’s class. To change the item class, you must mark the
item inactive and then create a new item with the proper item class.
 Master Stock: For items that consist of information shared by a number
of substock items. For example, you might sell blue jeans, which consist
of a number of attributes, such as size and style (straight leg, relaxed fit,
classic fit, and so on). After you create a master stock item and define its
attributes, Peachtree automatically generates substock items based on
the attributes of the master stock item.
 Serialized Stock: Available only in Peachtree Premium or higher. Use
this item class when the inventory items have serial numbers that you
plan to track.
 Non-stock: For items that you sell but do not put into your inventory,
such as service contracts. Peachtree prints quantities, descriptions, and
unit prices on invoices but doesn’t track quantities on hand. You must
assign a Cost of Sales GL account, but it’s not affected by a costing
method.
 Description Only: When you track nothing but the description. For
example, you can add comments to sales or purchase transactions by
using description-only items.
 Service: For services you can apply to your GL salary and wages
account to bill a customer for services provided by your employees.
65
Chapter 4: Setting Up Background Information

 Labor: For third-party labor costs that you pass on to a customer. You
can apply these costs to your GL salary and wages account and set the
GL Cost Sales account to a Cost of Sales account for third-party labor.
 Assembly: For items that consist of components that must be built or
dismantled.
 Serialized Assembly: Available only in Peachtree Premium or higher.
Use this item class for assembly items that also have serial numbers.
 Activity: Available only in Peachtree Complete or higher. When using the
Time & Billing feature, this item records how time is spent when per-
forming services for a customer or job.
 Charge: Available only in Peachtree Complete or higher. When using the
Time & Billing feature, this item records the expenses of an employee or
vendor when working for a customer or job.
See Chapter 10 for more information on the Time & Billing feature.
Follow these steps to set or review the account assignments for the inventory
item classes:
1. Choose Maintain➪Default Information➪Inventory Items.
Peachtree displays the Inventory Item Defaults dialog box.
2. Click the GL Accts/Costing tab.
3. Move the mouse pointer over any white box to see the lookup list

6. In the Costing column, choose FIFO, LIFO, or Average as your costing
method.
Check with your accountant to help choose the correct method for your
business. Just so you know what we’re talking about, turn to the sidebar
in Chapter 11.
7. If necessary, change the GL Freight Account using Steps 3 and 4.
You use the GL Freight Account to assign freight charges to an invoice.
8. When you’re finished, click OK or click another tab and read the
related information in the next section.
Taxes and shipping
Ah, taxes. The government needs to get its cut when you sell something —
and so, when appropriate, you must collect sales tax and pass it on to your
state’s taxing agency. Like you would expect with anything connected with
the government, sales taxes are not straightforward. The government
requires that you charge tax on some things but not other things. To take that
concept a step further, some organizations (notably governmental and chari-
table agencies) don’t pay taxes. And, of course, it’s up to you — the seller —
to keep straight who pays tax and for what.
If necessary, choose Maintain➪Default Information➪Inventory Items to dis-
play the Inventory Item Defaults dialog box. Click the Taxes/Shipping tab. On
the left side of the Taxes/Shipping tab, you can define up to 25 item tax types.
(You have our sympathy if you need all of them.) You use item tax types to
organize the sales taxes that you remit and report to your state sales tax
agency. Typically, you want to set up item tax types that match the categories
that you must report on your state’s sales tax return.
After you establish item tax types, you assign an item tax type to each inven-
tory item you create — see Chapter 11 for more information. When you sell
the item, Peachtree notes the item tax type. When you pay your sales tax,
you use a report that segregates your sales by item tax type. So that’s why
you want to set up item tax types that match the categories you report on
your state sales tax return. See Chapter 7 for information on setting up sales
taxes and Chapter 6 for information on paying sales taxes.

Chapter 4: Setting Up Background Information

You also can use the right side of the Taxes/Shipping tab to create up to ten
shipping methods. Remember that shipping methods don’t have anything to
do with inventory items; you assign shipping methods to customers and ven-
dors. The shipping methods you assign appear on quotes, sales orders,
invoices, purchases, and purchase orders. Find out more about setting up
vendors in Chapter 5 and setting up customers in Chapter 7.
Custom fields
Although you don’t assign shipping methods to inventory items, you may
assign custom fields to inventory items — for example, you may want to
store alternate vendors in custom fields. Choose Maintain➪Default
Information➪Inventory and click the Custom Fields tab. In the Enabled
column, select the check box next to each custom field that you want to use
and then type the name of the custom field in the Field Labels text box.
Price levels
Peachtree Complete and higher support multiple prices — price levels, so to
speak — that can be calculated for inventory items. You can set up to ten price
levels for each inventory item, assigning an easy-to-remember level name such
as Retail, Wholesale, and Discount5 (for Discounted 5%), and then use the vari-
ous price levels to establish pricing schemes. For example, you might establish
Price Level 1 as your full retail price, Price Level 2 as a 5% discount off the
retail price, and Price Level 3 as a 10% discount off the retail price. You start by
identifying which of the ten price levels you want to use on the Price Levels tab
of the Inventory Item Defaults dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-9. To use a price
level, select the check box in the Enabled column next to the price level.
Figure 4-9:
Identify the
price levels
you want to
use by
selecting
the check
boxes in the
Enabled
column.
68
Part I: Getting Started 

You also can set default price calculations for each price level. The calculation
can be based on the last cost of an item or on Price Level 1. After selecting the
basis for the calculation, you can increase or decrease the price by either a per-
centage or an amount. You set default price calculations by clicking the button
in the Edit column next to the appropriate price level. Peachtree displays the
Default Price Level Calculation dialog box (see Figure 4-10).
The calculations you establish in the Inventory Item Defaults dialog box are
the defaults for all items. You also can establish a selling price for each indi-
vidual item by using the Maintain Inventory Items window. Any prices you
establish for an individual item override prices you set in the Inventory Item
Defaults dialog box. See Chapter 11 for details.
The price level feature is powerful. Even after you establish defaults and then
override them by setting price levels for individual items, you can override
individual item price levels on invoices as you create them. See Chapter 7 for
more information.
Peachtree also enables you to assign price levels directly to customers; sup-
pose, for example, that you always discount all merchandise for a particular
customer to Price Level 3. In the Maintain Customers/Prospects window, you
can assign a customer to Price Level 3 so that all items on all invoices for the
customer default to Price Level 3. Again, see Chapter 7 for more information.
You’re probably wondering about how to change prices. After all, nothing
stays the same price forever (unfortunately). Yes, you can easily raise (or
lower, if you are so inclined) prices without editing individual items. See
Chapter 11 for more information.

dialog box

Chapter 4: Setting Up Background Information

Setting Preferences for Printing
Statements and Invoices
You can control the information printed on statements and invoices; you set
these preferences by choosing Maintain➪Default
Information➪Statement/Invoices.
Suppose, for example, that you don’t use preprinted invoices or statements
but you do want your company’s name, address, and phone numbers to
appear on the top of the invoice or statement. In the Statement/Invoices
Defaults dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-11, simply select the last check box
to print your company’s name, address, and phone numbers as they appear
in the Maintain Company Information window.
Use the rest of the fields on the Statement Print Options tab to control which
customers are selected when Peachtree prints statements:
 If you select the Any Activity Since the Last Statement Was Printed
check box, Peachtree prints a statement for any customer who has pur-
chased something from you since the last time you printed statements.
 If you select the Balances At Least check box and supply a minimum
balance number, Peachtree prints statements for customers with bal-
ances equal to or greater than the minimum balance.
Figure 4-11:
Use this
dialog box
to control
the
information
that prints

70
Part I: Getting Started 

 If you select the At Least One Invoice X Days Past Due check box and
then type a number of days overdue, Peachtree prints statements for
any customers who have an invoice overdue by at least the number of
days you entered.
 Use the Negative Balances list to specify whether Peachtree should
print statements for customers with credit balances — the people to
whom you owe money. You can choose Always, Never, or Only When the
Above Options Apply.
 Use the Zero Balances list to specify whether Peachtree should print
statements for customers whose balance is $0. You can choose Always,
Never, or Only When the Above Options Apply.
Strangely enough, these check boxes are yes-or-no questions, but the check
boxes in this section of the dialog box work together. If a customer meets any
condition that you have selected, Peachtree prints a statement. For example,
suppose that you select the Any Activity Since the Last Statement Was
Printed check box and also the Balances At Least check box, and you supply
$1.00 as the minimum balance. Peachtree prints statements for all customers
who have bought something from you and all customers whose balance is
greater than $1.00. So, even if you do not want customers with $0 balances,
Peachtree prints statements for those customers if they bought something
and paid for it. Be sure to examine the logic of all the check boxes you
choose to select.
Peachtree can print balance forward statements, similar to the way informa-
tion appears on a MasterCard or Visa credit card bill, where an invoice
appears only once on a statement, and its balance subsequently becomes
part of the Previous Balance line. Or Peachtree can print open item state-
ments, where all outstanding invoices — the ones that aren’t paid in full —
appear on the statement.
Using the Dunning Messages tab, you can specify four gentle or not-so-gentle
reminders to appear on statements that an account may be overdue. You
enter each message and then determine the invoices on which it will appear
by entering a number of days overdue. The message that appears on a cus-
tomer statement depends on the length of time a customer’s account is over-
due; Peachtree displays the message associated with the customer’s oldest
overdue invoice.

Whether you handle the day-to-day accounting
responsibilities associated with your business or have
someone in your office do them for you, you’ll find this
part valuable.
In this part, we show you how to keep up with tasks such
as billing your customers and collecting money from
them, purchasing and paying for goods and services used
in your business, and paying employees. We also cover
job costing and time and billing tasks.

uying things is part of doing business. Some businesses buy goods from
vendors and keep them in inventory to resell to customers. Some busi-
nesses buy goods to use in the manufacturing of a product to sell to cus-
tomers. And all businesses buy the goods and services that they use to stay
in business, such as office supplies and utilities.
So, no matter how you look at it, you can expect to receive bills in the mail.
Paying bills isn’t fun, of course, but at least Peachtree can make the process
easier and save you time — time you can spend earning more money.
This chapter describes the typical actions you take to record and track ven-
dors’ bills.
Terminology alert: Peachtree tends to switch back and forth between two
terms when referring to bills that vendors send you: a purchase and an
invoice. For the sake of clarity, we call it a purchase unless the window on-
screen calls it an invoice. For our purposes, invoices are things you send to
customers so that you can get paid.
Working with Vendors
If you buy goods or services from a particular vendor on a regular basis, you
can save time in the long run if you set up that vendor in Peachtree. In fact, if
you don’t set up the vendor, you’ll find it difficult to track how much you
spend with that vendor. There — you have two good reasons to set up ven-
dors with whom you do business on a regular basis.

76
Part II: The Daily Drudge 
Adding vendors
When you set up a vendor, you supply name and address information, a
Purchase account to use each time you record a purchase from the vendor,
and custom field information. You also can view historical information about
your purchases from the vendor for the previous 12 months.
To add a new vendor, follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Vendors.
Peachtree displays the Maintain Vendors window (see Figure 5-1).
2. Fill in the Vendor ID and the Name field.
The ID is the number you use to select the vendor when you want to
record a purchase or payment, so try to make it meaningful. The ID can
be up to 20 characters and numbers long and is not case sensitive. By
default, Peachtree sorts the vendor list and reports by the vendor ID,
and numbers sort before letters. To get Peachtree to sort the vendor list
in alphabetical order by default, use characters from the vendor’s name
as the ID.
3. On the General tab, fill in contact information — your account number
with the vendor and the vendor’s address and phone numbers.
The account number you supply appears by default on checks you print
from the Payment window. Find out more about the Payment window in
Chapter 6.
Figure 5-1:
Use this
window to
add, edit, or
delete
vendors.

4. If you mail your payments to the address you supplied in Step 3, click
the Copy to Remit To Address 1 button.
If you don’t mail your payments to the address Peachtree displays by
default, see the next step.
5. If you need to store more than one address for the vendor, click the
Addresses tab and enter the addresses, one per line.
You can store up to 20 Remit To addresses and you can select the
default address for payments, purchase orders, and shipments.
6. Use the Vendor Type field to group similar vendors together.
For example, you may want to distinguish between vendors who supply
you with inventory and vendors who provide overhead services such as
telephone. The text you enter in the Vendor Type field can be up to eight
characters long; note that this field is case sensitive. Entering a vendor
type is useful because you can limit some reports to specific vendor
types.
7. If appropriate, identify the vendor’s 1099 type by selecting an option
from the 1099 Type drop-down list.
According to IRS rules, you must issue a 1099 to a vendor who is an inde-
pendent contractor if the contractor is not incorporated and you pay
$600 or more per year to that vendor. Peachtree can print 1099s at the
end of the year for vendors that you designate as 1099 vendors. Sales
representatives might be considered 1099 vendors, based on the IRS def-
inition of employees and independent contractors. If you have Peachtree
Complete or higher, you can filter several Peachtree reports by 1099
Type; see Chapter 14 for more information on printing and filtering
reports. See Chapter 9 for more on paying sales representatives who are
also employees.
8. In the Expense Account list, select the account.
Select the account that you’ll typically assign to purchases from this
vendor. You can override this account as needed when you enter pur-
chases.
9. If appropriate, supply an e-mail and a Web address for the vendor.
Both e-mail and Web addresses are interactive — if you supply an e-mail
address and then click the icon next to the E-mail field, Peachtree opens
your e-mail program and starts a message to the vendor. Similarly, click-
ing the button next to the Web Site field launches your browser and
directs it to the vendor’s Web site.
To generate e-mail messages from within Peachtree, you must have a
MAPI-compliant, default e-mail application installed on your computer. If
your default e-mail system is AOL, you won’t be able to send e-mail
alerts from Peachtree because AOL is not a fully MAPI-compliant e-mail
application.

Chapter 5: Buying Goods

MAPI is one of those techno acronyms and refers to a method by which
programs like Peachtree can initiate e-mail messages. If you’re not sure if
your e-mail program is MAPI compliant, just click the e-mail icon. You’ll
either see a gobbledygook message about MAPI, or you’ll have a blank
e-mail cued up for you.
10. In the Customizable Fields section, fill in the information you estab-
lished in the Vendor Default dialog box.
11. Click the History tab, which shows you (after you begin to record
transactions for the vendor) your total payments and purchases
involving that vendor for each period.
You review information here instead of entering it.
12. Click the Beginning Balances button.
Peachtree displays the Vendor Beginning Balances window, where you
can enter, one per line, unpaid bills you received from vendors before
you started using Peachtree. Click the Add button; then, for each bill,
supply the vendor’s invoice number, the date you received it, any pur-
chase order number associated with it, and the amount. If you use the
accrual method for your company, select an Accounts Payable (A/P)
account.
The total of the beginning balances you enter for all vendors must equal
the total amount you entered for all Accounts Payable accounts when
you set up your General Ledger beginning balances.
13. Click the Purchase Info tab (see Figure 5-2).

Part II: The Daily Drudge 

a. Select a default purchase representative.
An employee can serve as a purchase representative.
b. If the vendor is a 1099 vendor, supply the vendor’s tax ID number.
The tax ID number eventually appears on the 1099.
c. Select a shipment method and terms.
You need to select a default Ship Via method and terms only if —
for the vendor you’re creating — they differ from the defaults you
established in the Vendor Defaults dialog box. (See Chapter 4 for
details on global default purchase settings.) To change the default
terms, open the drop-down list under Terms and Credit and choose
Customize Terms for This Vendor. Peachtree displays the various
terms methods and the options for each.
d. Select form options for the vendor.
In the Form Options area, you can choose to e-mail forms (such
as purchase orders) to vendors or print them and mail them.
Regardless of the form delivery method you select, you can e-mail
a copy of the form to the purchase representative whenever you
e-mail the form to the vendor or whenever you prepare forms in
batches. To prepare forms in batches, select the form from the
Select a Report or Form window. Also regardless of the form deliv-
ery method you select, you can choose to replace, on purchase
orders, the item ID number you assign in Peachtree with the item’s
UPC/SKU number or part number.
14. Click the Save button (as shown in the margin) to save the vendor
information or the Save & New button (also shown in the margin) to
save the information and create another new vendor.
Changing vendor information
You can change any information you enter about a vendor, including the
vendor ID. If you need to make a change to a vendor’s information, follow
these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Vendors.
2. Type a few letters of the vendor ID or click the arrow next to the drop-
down list to display a list of vendors.
3. Highlight the vendor you want to change and then click OK.
The information you saved previously for the vendor appears.
79
Chapter 5: Buying Goods

4. Click the tab containing the information that you want to change.
5. Make the change(s).
6. If you need to change the vendor ID, click the Change ID toolbar
button, as shown in the margin.
Peachtree displays the Change Vendor ID dialog box. Type a new ID in the
New Vendor ID field and then click OK. Peachtree changes the vendor ID.
7. Click the Save button.
Viewing vendor history
After you record purchases and payments for vendors, Peachtree tracks
these transactions by month. Choose Maintain➪Vendors to open the
Maintain Vendors window. Type the vendor ID or select your choice from the
drop-down list and then click the History tab to view a history of your activ-
ity with the vendor.
“De-activating” a vendor
If a vendor has gone out of business or you decide that you just don’t want to
do business with a particular vendor, you can change the vendor’s status to
inactive. After you make a vendor record inactive, Peachtree displays a warn-
ing if you try to buy something from the vendor.
Although you see a Delete button in the Maintain Vendor window, you can’t
delete a vendor unless no transactions exist for the vendor. You know, you
put somebody in and then realize you don’t want them after all — and you
haven’t recorded any transactions. Then you can display that vendor on-
screen and click Delete. Otherwise, to get rid of a vendor, you must first make
the vendor inactive. After closing a fiscal year, you can purge inactive ven-
dors so that they don’t appear in lists. See Chapter 17 for information on clos-
ing a fiscal year and purging.
To make a vendor inactive, choose Maintain➪Vendors to open the Maintain
Vendors window. In the Vendor ID field, select the vendor you want to make
inactive. After the vendor appears on-screen, select the Inactive check box
beside the Vendor ID field and then click the Save button. The vendor is now
inactive. If you need to reactivate the vendor, deselect the Inactive check box.
An inactive vendor doesn’t appear in lists if you decide to hide inactive
records when you set the global options. You can find out how to hide inac-
tive records in Bonus Chapter 1 on this book’s Web site, www.dummies.com/
go/peachtreefd.

Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Working with Purchase Orders
A purchase order is a document you use to request merchandise from a vendor.
When you enter a purchase order, Peachtree doesn’t actually affect any of your
accounts. That doesn’t happen until you receive the merchandise — or, if
you’re using cash-based accounting, when you pay the vendor.
Peachtree takes note of the transactions. That is, you can print reports that
show you the accounts that the purchase orders will affect when they are
filled. However, the purchase orders don’t actually update the accounts when
you save the purchase orders.
Entering purchase orders
“If a purchase order doesn’t affect any of my accounts, why use it?” you ask.
Well, you don’t need to use purchase orders; Peachtree operates correctly if
you don’t use them. Most people use purchase orders as reminders, particu-
larly when ordering inventory, because the purchase order shows the items
that you’ve ordered but not yet received. Others use purchase orders for
non-inventory items, such as office supplies or contract labor, to help track
expected expenses.
Purchase orders provide you with a great way of remaining organized so that
nothing slips through the cracks. You can use the Purchase Order report to
help you stay on top of things. And we’re great fans of being organized!
You can’t enter purchase orders in Peachtree unless you’ve set up a vendor,
but you can set up a vendor while working in the Purchase Orders window.
To enter a purchase order, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Purchase Orders.
Peachtree displays the Purchase Orders window (see Figure 5-3).
You can customize the appearance of the Purchase Orders window to
better suit your needs; if you change these settings, your window won’t
look exactly the same as the window you see in Figure 5-3. See Bonus
Chapter 1 on this book’s Web site, www.dummies.com/go/peachtreefd,
for more information.
2. Type the vendor ID in the Vendor ID field or click the lookup list
button, as shown here in the margin, beside the Vendor ID field to
select the vendor from your list of vendors.
81
Chapter 5: Buying Goods

If you need to add a vendor, click the lookup list button and then click
the New button in the lookup list window. Peachtree displays the
Maintain Vendors window. Refer to the earlier section in this chapter,
“Adding vendors.” Close the Maintain Vendors window after you save
the vendor to return to the Purchase Orders window.
Peachtree fills in the vendor’s name and the Remit To address. Your
company’s name also appears in the Ship To address field. At the
bottom of the window, you see the vendor’s current balance as of the
system date, and you can click the button next to the balance to display
a Vendor Ledger report of the purchases and payments that comprise
the balance.
Click the Reports button, as shown here in the margin, on the window’s
toolbar to print any of the following reports for the selected vendor:
Buyer report, Inventory Stock Status report, Items Purchased from
Vendors report, Job Ledger report, or Vendor Ledgers report.
3. If necessary, change the date of the purchase order. If you don’t
supply a date, Peachtree uses your computer’s date.
4. Enter a date in the Good Thru field — the date after which the pur-
chase order should not be filled.
5. In the PO No. field, type a number for the purchase order if you don’t
intend to print it but just want to save it.
If you intend to print the purchase order, leave the PO No. field blank,
and Peachtree supplies a sequential purchase order number when you
print the purchase order.
Lookup List button

82
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

You can’t use the same purchase order number more than once for a
particular vendor. You can reuse a purchase order number as long as
you assign it to a different vendor.
6. If you intend to ship the goods directly to a customer, select the Drop
Ship check box and select the correct customer and ship to address.
These fields appear only if you select the Drop Ship check box.
Although you can change the A/P account, typically you shouldn’t.
Peachtree doesn’t affect any of your accounts when you save the purchase
order; however, when you later receive merchandise against the purchase
order, Peachtree uses the account information on the purchase order to
update your company’s books.
7. In the Quantity field, type the quantity you want to order.
For a whole number (such as three), type 3.0. If you set global options to
Automatic Decimal Entry and you type simply 3, Peachtree assumes you
want .03. See Bonus Chapter 1 on this book’s Web site, www.dummies.
com/go/peachtreefd, for details on setting global options.
8. Click in the Item field.
The lookup list button appears. Click it to select the item you want to
order from existing inventory items. Peachtree fills in the item descrip-
tion, the General Ledger account associated with the item, the item’s
unit price, and the amount (unit price times quantity).
Read about setting up inventory items in Chapter 11. If you want to order
something that you haven’t set up as an inventory item, skip the Item field
and fill in the Description, GL Account, and Unit Price fields. Peachtree 
calculates the amount. The Peachtree spell checker flags any spelling mis-
takes as they happen. See Bonus Chapter 1 at www.dummies.com/go/
peachtreefd for more information on spell-checking options.
9. If appropriate, click in the Job field to display the lookup list button
and choose a job from the list.
If you’re purchasing a stock item or an assembly item, you cannot assign
it to a job. If you’re purchasing any other type of item, however, you can
assign it to a job. You also can assign the line to a job if you don’t select
any item from the Item list. Chapter 12 covers setting up and assigning
job types.
10. Repeat Steps 7–9 for each item you want to order from this vendor.
11. Click either the Save button or the Print button, as shown here in the
margin.
If you want to continue entering purchase orders and then print them
later in a group (or skip printing them altogether), click the Save button.
Otherwise, click the Print button. To print your purchase orders in a
group, read about printing forms in Chapter 13.
83
Chapter 5: Buying Goods

You can preview the purchase order before you print it by clicking the
drop-down arrow on the Print button and selecting Preview.
But there’s an easier way . . .
This feature is available only in Peachtree Complete and above.
In Chapter 4, where we discuss setting up inventory options, you can enable
auto-creation of purchase orders for drop-ship and non–drop-ship transac-
tions. If you enable these options and real-time posting, you can let Peachtree
generate purchase orders for you, based on the information you supply when
you define your inventory items. (See Chapter 11 for details on inventory
items.)
To make this feature work, you need to assign a preferred vendor to each
inventory item. To make the feature work well, you also need to supply a min-
imum stock quantity and a reorder quantity for each inventory item.
If you’ve already done these things, choose Tasks➪Select for Purchase
Orders. The Select for Purchase Orders dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 5-4.
In the Select for Purchase Orders dialog box, you set up the selection criteria
that you want Peachtree to use to display a list of potential purchase orders
to create:

84
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

 In the Select Items With section of the dialog box, you can choose which
items to include by using the Item ID, Item Type, and Item Class options.
For example, in the sample company we’re using, you can select the All
option for the Item ID, the Supply option for the Item Type, and the
Stock option for the Item Class.
 In the And Items With section, you can narrow the selection by choosing
only certain vendors or buyers. (Buyers are employees, and you identify
buyers as well as vendors when you create inventory items; see Chapter
11 for details.)
 In the Display a List of Items section, you can indicate that you want
Peachtree to select items to order based on the how many items are
available or are on hand by selecting the Quantity Available or the
Quantity On Hand options as of a particular date. You can also order
based on the item’s stock status. In the And Set Order Quantity To sec-
tion, you can identify the quantity you want Peachtree to place on the
purchase order(s) it suggests.
After you click OK, Peachtree displays the Select for Purchase Orders window
shown in Figure 5-5, where you can review the proposed purchase orders
and, if necessary, exclude any you don’t want Peachtree to create by dese-
lecting the check box in the Order column of the proposed purchase order.
You can make changes to the white columns of the purchase orders before
Peachtree creates them. Click in the appropriate column and make your
change. For example, you can select a different vendor or change the Order
Qty or GL Account.

85
Chapter 5: Buying Goods

After you identify the purchases you want to create, you can preview them as
they will appear to the vendor by clicking the drop-down arrow on the Print
button (see Figure 5-5) and selecting Preview. If you want a hard copy of the
Select for Purchase Orders window, click the drop-down arrow on the Print
button and select Report.
To create purchase orders, click the Save button; if you prefer, you can click
the Print button or the E-mail button. If you click the Print button, Peachtree
prompts you to confirm the first purchase order number, prints the purchase
orders and asks you to confirm that they printed properly. If you click Yes,
Peachtree saves the purchase orders. If you click the E-mail button (shown in
the margin), Peachtree displays a dialog box where you can assign a pur-
chase order number (see Figure 5-6); after you click OK, your e-mail program
displays the e-mail messages it will send to the vendors, including the pur-
chase order in PDF format. After you send the messages, Peachtree displays a
dialog box that asks you to confirm that the purchase orders e-mailed prop-
erly. If you click Yes, Peachtree saves the purchase orders.
After you produce purchase orders from the Select for Purchase Orders
window, you can click the Refresh button on the toolbar. Peachtree updates
the information in the Quantity on POs column.
Editing and erasing purchase orders
You can change purchase orders, close purchase orders, and delete purchase
orders. Good accounting practices say you shouldn’t ever delete anything,
but because a purchase order doesn’t affect your accounts, the offense
doesn’t seem quite so serious. However, if you want to maintain an audit trail
Figure 5-6:

for canceled orders, simply close the purchase order. You close a purchase
order by displaying it on-screen and selecting the Close PO check box.
You can change or remove items from purchase orders if you haven’t yet
received the items. If you know you’ll never receive the items, you can close
the purchase order. If the purchase order was simply a mistake and you
haven’t received any items listed on it, why not just erase it? To edit or delete
a purchase order, choose Lists➪Vendors & Purchases➪Purchase Orders to
display the Purchase Order List window (see Figure 5-7).
You also can display this window while viewing the Purchase Orders
window. Just click the List button (as shown here in the margin) on 
the toolbar.
You can edit any purchase order, whether it’s open or closed. Look for the
check mark in the Open column of the Purchase Order List window. If the
Open column is blank, the purchase order is closed, meaning all the goods
have been received and entered, or you got tired of waiting and canceled it.
Select a purchase order to view and then click the Open button to display the
purchase order in the Purchase Orders window. You can make any of the fol-
lowing modifications to the purchase order; after you finish, save the pur-
chase order and then click the Close button on the toolbar, and Peachtree
redisplays the Purchase Order List window:
 Change the date entered in the Date or the Good Thru fields.
 Select a different shipping method from the Ship Via drop-down list.
 Enter a new amount in the Discount Amount field.
Figure 5-7:

Chapter 5: Buying Goods

 Change displayed terms in the Terms field.
 Change the account number in the A/P Account field.
 Adjust the quantity you ordered on any line of the purchase order —
even a line you’ve already received.
Find out how to receive items that you order in the “Receiving goods
against a purchase order” section, later in this chapter.
 Remove any line if you have not received those items.
Click anywhere in the line you want to delete and then click the Remove
button, as shown here in the margin.
 Close the purchase order.
Select the Close PO check box that appears immediately below the PO
No. field.
You cannot delete a purchase order if you have received any of the items
listed on the purchase order; the Delete button appears grayed out (unavail-
able). If you know you’ll never receive items remaining on a purchase order,
close the purchase order.
88
Part II: The Daily Drudge 
Searching for transactions
The Purchase Order List window, like the other
List windows in Peachtree, initially shows trans-
actions for the current period. Using the Date
Range drop-down list, you can select a differ-
ent date range or period. If you change the date
range, Peachtree displays information for the
new date range next time you open the window.
If you prefer, you can search your company data
for the transaction by using criteria that
changes from List window to List window. In the
Purchase Order List window, you can search for
purchase orders by using vendor ID numbers;
period; or purchase order dates, numbers, or
totals. After you select a search criterion, type
some information about the transaction into the
Search For box that matches the criterion you
selected. The vendor ID number and purchase
order dates, numbers, and totals are self-
explanatory. If you choose period as your
search criterion, set the Date Range box to All
Transactions and enter the period number in the
Search For box.
Finally, you can still search for transactions
by using the Find Transactions window; see
Bonus Chapter 1 on this book’s Web site, www.
dummies.com/go/peachtreefd, 
for
details. In the same chapter, you also find infor-
mation on customizing any List window to dis-
play the columns of information you prefer
to see.

Entering Bills
Scenario: A vendor with whom you do business on a regular basis sends you
a bill. (As we state earlier, remember that Peachtree uses the terms purchase
and invoice interchangeably to represent a vendor bill.) You don’t want to
pay the bill immediately, but you do want to pay the bill in a timely manner.
Enter the bill into Peachtree as a purchase, and Peachtree tracks the bill’s age
so that you pay it
 When it’s still eligible for a discount
or
 Before the vendor charges you a late fee.
Do you receive a bill on a regular basis from a vendor? Chapter 6 shows you
how to create a recurring purchase or payment for things such as monthly
utility bills or lease payments.
Purchasing without using a purchase order
Unlike purchase orders, purchases update your company’s accounts.
Whenever any transaction updates your company’s books, at least two
accounts are affected because of the double-entry bookkeeping concept that
you can read about in Bonus Chapter 5.
Every purchase you enter automatically updates Accounts Payable. The
other account Peachtree updates depends on whether you record a bill for
an inventory item. If you select inventory items in the Purchases/Receive
Inventory window, you tell Peachtree to update inventory for the other side
of the transaction. If you don’t select an inventory item, then you probably
select an Expense account, such as your Telephone Expense account. In that
case, Peachtree updates Accounts Payable and the Expense account.
Peachtree assumes that you wouldn’t enter a bill from a vendor for merchan-
dise without having first received the merchandise — and entering a bill for
merchandise does update quantities on hand, so don’t enter a bill until you
receive the goods. You might, however, receive the goods without yet receiv-
ing the bill. In this second case, you enter a purchase and make sure that you
select the Waiting on Bill check box.
89
Chapter 5: Buying Goods

If you’re curious about the accounts Peachtree is updating (yes, debiting and
crediting), read Chapter 17 to discover a neat way to find out what Peachtree
is doing.
Peachtree assumes that you wouldn’t bother to enter a bill from a vendor you
use only occasionally; instead, you’d just pay that bill. Therefore, you can’t
enter purchases in Peachtree unless you’ve set up a vendor. For one-time or
occasional purchases from vendors you don’t expect to use often, use the
Payments window to pay the bill directly. See Chapter 6 for more information
on paying bills.
To enter a purchase (a vendor’s bill) that doesn’t reference a purchase order,
follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Purchases/Receive Inventory.
Peachtree displays the Purchases/Receive Inventory window (see 
Figure 5-8).
You can customize the appearance of the Purchases/Receive Inventory
window to better suit your needs; if you do, the window won’t look the
same as the window you see in Figure 5-8. See Bonus Chapter 1 on this
book’s Web site, www.dummies.com/go/peachtreefd, for more 
information.
Figure 5-8:
Use this
window to

Part II: The Daily Drudge 

2. Enter the vendor ID in the Vendor ID field or click the lookup list
button and select a vendor from the list.
After you select a vendor, Peachtree fills in the vendor’s name and Remit
To address. Your company’s name also appears in the Ship To address
field. At the bottom of the window, you see the vendor’s current balance
as of the system date. You can click the button next to the balance to
display a Vendor Ledger report of the purchases and payment that make
up the balance.
If you’ve previously entered purchase orders for this vendor, Peachtree
displays the Apply to Purchase Order tab. If you want to receive goods
against one of these POs, skip to the next section.
3. In the Invoice No. field, type a number for the vendor’s bill.
If you have vendors who don’t provide you with an invoice number, your
company might have a standard solution for this problem, such as enter-
ing a combination of the vendor ID plus the date or the primary PO
number. This usually helps avoid duplications (but not always).
You can’t use an invoice number more than once for a particular vendor.
You can reuse an invoice number as long as you assign it to a different
vendor.
4. If necessary, change the date of the purchase.
Yes, you can change the A/P account, but typically you shouldn’t. Doing
so can cause your accounts to get out of whack.
5. In the Quantity field, type the quantity for which you’re being billed.
For a whole number such as three, type 3.0. If you set global options to
Automatic Decimal Entry and you type simply 3, Peachtree assumes that
you want .03.
6. You have two options for entering items that appear on the bill:
• If you’re recording a bill for an item that you haven’t and don’t
intend to set up as an inventory item, skip the Item field and just
fill in the Description, GL Account, and Unit Price fields. By default,
Peachtree flags any spelling mistakes as they happen. For more
information on the Peachtree spell-checking options, see Bonus
Chapter 1 on www.dummies.com/go/peachtreefd.
• If you’re recording a bill for an inventory item, select the item in
the Item list. Peachtree fills in the Description, GL Account, the
Unit Price, and the Amount (unit price times quantity) fields.
7. If you’re purchasing a serialized item, click the Serial No. button, as
shown here in the margin.
91
Chapter 5: Buying Goods

You can record serial numbers for inventory items if you’re using
Peachtree Premium or higher.
Peachtree displays the Serial Number Entry dialog box, as shown in
Figure 5-9, where you can add the serial numbers of the items you’re
purchasing. Type the serial number for the first item and then click Add.
Repeat the process for each serialized item you’re purchasing. If the
serial numbers are consecutive, select the Add Consecutive Serial
Numbers check box and specify the number of items you’re purchasing.
After you finish, click OK.
8. Click in the Job field to display the lookup list button and choose a
job from the list.
If you’re purchasing a stock item or an assembly item (serialized or
unserialized), you cannot assign it to a job. If you’re purchasing any
other type of item, however, you can assign it to a job. You can also
assign the line to a job if you don’t select an item from the Item list. You
can read about setting up jobs in Chapter 12.
If you assign a line to a job, Peachtree allows you to include it on a cus-
tomer’s bill as a reimbursable expense. Chapter 12 covers information
about including reimbursable expenses on customer invoices.
9. Repeat Steps 5–8 for each item you want to order or that appears on
the bill you’re recording.
10. Click the Save button to save the transaction.

If you have a document on your computer related to the purchase you just
created, you can attach the document to the purchase. Redisplay the pur-
chase in the Purchases/Receive Inventory window and then click the Attach
button. In the window that appears, click Add and then navigate to the docu-
ment you want to attach. Click OK to close the Attachments window. From
the Attachments window, you can print or rename the attachment. Renaming
the attachment affects only the name shown in Peachtree, not the file name
on your computer.
Receiving goods against a purchase order
Scenario: You order merchandise by using a purchase order, and the mer-
chandise arrives. Maybe the bill comes with the merchandise, and maybe it
doesn’t. Either way, you need to update your company’s accounts to reflect
the receipt of the merchandise so that you know they’re available to sell.
You use the Purchases/Receive Inventory window to receive goods against a
purchase order. You can, simultaneously, indicate whether you received the
bill. Follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Purchases/Receive Inventory.
Peachtree displays the Purchases/Receive Inventory window.
2. Type the vendor ID in the Vendor ID field or click that handy magnify-
ing glass to display the list of vendors.
After you select a vendor, Peachtree fills in the vendor’s name and Remit
To address. Your company’s name also appears in the Ship To address
field. At the bottom of the window, you see the vendor’s current balance
as of the system date. You can click the button next to the balance to
display a Vendor Ledger report of the purchases and payment that make
up the balance.
You can print a variety of reports related to vendors and inventory by
clicking the Reports button on the Purchases/Receive Inventory window
toolbar.
If you’ve previously entered purchase orders for this vendor, Peachtree
displays the Apply to Purchase Order tab.
3. On the Apply to Purchase Order No. tab, click the Apply to Purchase
Order No. drop-down list and then select the PO number that lists the
goods you ordered (see Figure 5-10).
Peachtree fills in the lines that appear on the purchase order.
93
Chapter 5: Buying Goods

4. In the Invoice No. field at the top of the window, type a number for
the vendor’s bill.
You can’t use an invoice number more than once for a particular vendor,
so if you get stopped by this, be sure you aren’t trying to enter an old
invoice.
If you have vendors who don’t provide you with an invoice number, your
company might have a standard solution for this problem, such as enter-
ing a combination of the vendor ID plus the date or the primary PO
number. This usually helps avoid duplications (but not always).
5. If necessary, change the date of the purchase.
6. If only the merchandise arrived but you haven’t yet received a bill
from the vendor, select the Waiting on Bill check box.
If you received both goods and a bill, leave the check box deselected.
Like with other transactions, you can change the A/P account, but 
typically you shouldn’t.
7. On each line of the Apply to Purchase Order tab, in the Received
field, type the quantity you received.
Remember that you have to put the decimal-zero after the whole number,
or Peachtree adds the leading decimal: To get six, type 6.0. Peachtree fills
in the Amount field by multiplying the unit price by the quantity.
If you’re purchasing a serialized item, click the Serial No. button, as shown
here in the margin, to add the serial numbers of the items you’re purchas-
ing. In the Serial Number Entry field that appears, type the serial number
for the first item and then click Add. Repeat the process for each serialized
Figure 5-10:

item you’re purchasing. If the serial numbers are consecutive, select the
Add Consecutive Serial Numbers check box and specify the number of
items you’re purchasing. After you finish, click OK.
8. Click the Save button to save your work.
When the bill arrives . . . finally
If you entered vendor receipts against a purchase order but didn’t have a bill at
the time you entered the vendor receipts, you should have selected the Waiting
on Bill check box in the Purchases/Receive Inventory window. When the waiting
is over and you have the vendor’s bill, follow these steps to tie up the loose ends:
1. Choose Lists➪Vendors & Purchases➪Purchases.
Peachtree opens the Purchase List window.
2. Find the vendor’s name in the Vendor Name column, and then look
for a Y in the Waiting on Bill column.
Use the Invoice No. column to further help you identify the correct 
purchase.
3. Select the correct purchase and then click Open.
Peachtree displays the purchase in the Purchases/Receive Inventory
window.
4. Deselect the Waiting on Bill check box.
5. Click the Save button.
By making this status change, you indicate to Peachtree that you consider
the bill eligible for payment. See Chapter 6 for information on paying bills.
Shipping Directly to Customers
Suppose that you need to buy something — maybe a special order for a cus-
tomer — and you want to ship it directly to the customer. No problem. You
can specify a customer’s address in the Ship To field on either a purchase
order or a purchase. Choose Tasks➪Purchase Orders to display the Purchase
Orders window or Tasks➪Purchases/Receive Inventory to make a purchase.
In either window, follow these steps:
1. Type the vendor ID in the Vendor ID field or click the lookup list
button to display the list of vendors.
2. Select the Drop Ship check box.
Peachtree displays a Customer ID field next to the Vendor ID field.
95
Chapter 5: Buying Goods

3. Select the customer from the Customer ID list.
Peachtree supplies the customer’s address and enables you to select a
different shipping address if you click the Ship To drop-down list arrow.
You can type the recipient’s name and address if you haven’t set up the
recipient in the Customer List.
4. If you’ve already entered an invoice to the customer into Peachtree,
you can enter the invoice number in the Customer Invoice No. field. If
you’ve entered a sales order but not an invoice, enter the sales order
number in the Customer SO No. field.
Both of these fields are informational only; they don’t tie to invoice or
sales order transactions. You’ll find them most useful, however, if you
enter numbers that represent real transactions because they can help
you track drop shipments on reports.
You don’t need to create the customer invoice before you set up the
drop shipment, but don’t forget to bill your customer. For more informa-
tion about creating invoices for customers, see Chapter 7.
5. Click the Save button.
To help you track drop shipments, you can add the Drop Shipment, Customer
ID, Customer SO No., and Customer Invoice No. fields to the Purchase Journal,
the Purchase Order Journal, and the Purchase Order report. You also can
filter the Purchase Order report so that it displays only drop shipments 
created in the Purchase Orders window.
Entering Credits
Suppose that you have a purchase transaction that you no longer need. Should
you just erase it? If you want to practice good accounting, the answer is a
definite no. Deleting purchases removes the audit trail — that thing accountants
mean when they talk about the list of transactions you enter because your busi-
ness does business. When accountants can trace transactions from beginning
to end, they’re really happy campers.
Having said that, you need to understand that Peachtree allows you to delete
any unpaid purchase, even though your accountant won’t like it. Display the
purchase in the Purchases/Receive Inventory window and then click the
Delete button.
However, Peachtree won’t allow you to delete a purchase if you’ve applied any
transactions to it. Suppose, for example, that you accidentally paid a purchase
that you later determined you should not have paid. If you try to delete the
purchase, the Delete button in the Purchase window is unavailable. In this
case, you need to void the check you wrote that paid the purchase, and then
you need to enter a vendor credit memo in Peachtree to cancel the effects of
96
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

the purchase. (See Chapter 6 to find out how to void a check.) After you void
the check, follow the steps in this section to finish canceling the purchase.
Besides fixing errors in purchases, don’t forget about the times when a
vendor issues a credit memo to you for merchandise you return. To reduce
the balance you owe the vendor, you need to enter the vendor credit memo
into Peachtree and match it to the original purchase. Although you can enter
a vendor credit memo without having previously entered a purchase, typi-
cally you enter vendor credit memos for existing purchases.
In the following steps, we assume that you’re returning any merchandise for
which you receive a credit:
1. Choose Tasks➪Vendor Credit Memos.
Peachtree displays the Vendor Credit Memos window.
2. Enter the vendor ID in the Vendor ID field. You can use the lookup list
button to select the vendor from your list of vendors.
After you select a vendor, Peachtree fills in the vendor’s name and Remit
To address. You can see the vendor’s current balance as of the system
date, and you can click the button next to the balance to display a Vendor
Ledger report of the purchases and payment that make up the balance.
3. Enter a date in the Date field and then enter a credit number in the
Credit No. field.
For the Credit No. field, we suggest that you enter the original invoice
number followed by CM to indicate credit memo. This numbering
scheme helps you tie the credit memo to a particular purchase.
4. On the Apply to Invoice No. tab, click the Apply to Invoice No. drop-
down list and select the invoice number of the purchase for which
you’re recording a credit memo.
Peachtree fills in the lines that appear on the purchase (see Figure 5-11).
5. On each line of the Apply to Invoice No. tab, in the Returned field,
type the quantity you want to return.
If you plan to return everything, you can click the drop-down list arrow
on the Return button, as shown here in the margin, and select All to
have Peachtree fill in all the amounts for you.
If you’re using Automatic Decimal Entry, remember that you have to put
the decimal-zero after the whole number, or Peachtree adds the leading
decimal: To get nine, type 9.0. Peachtree fills in the amount (unit price
times quantity).
If you’re returning a serialized item, click the Serial No. button to display
the Serial Number Selection dialog box and identify the serial numbers
of the items you’re returning. Select the check box next to the
number(s) you’re returning and then click OK.
97
Chapter 5: Buying Goods

6. Click the Save button to save the transaction.
Peachtree records the transaction; if you print your Aged Payables
report, you see that the purchase no longer appears on the report.
You may become be aware of a vendor credit before you receive the vendor’s
credit or the vendor’s bill. You can enter the credit by using the Apply to
Purchases tab of the Vendor Credit Memos window and making sure that the
credit memo affects the same things (vendor, General Ledger accounts, and
inventory items) that the purchase affects. If you receive a credit for an exist-
ing purchase that doesn’t involve returning items — for example, the items
were damaged, and the vendor tells you not to return them — record the
credit on the Apply to Purchases tab and don’t select inventory items so that
you avoid affecting inventory. You also can apply a credit for freight or tax by
using the Apply to Purchases tab.
Reporting on Purchasing
To keep things short and sweet, Table 5-1 provides you with a description of
the reports that pertain to buying goods. Chapter 14 covers the details on
how to print reports.

 Paying one bill at a time

 Remitting sales tax
A
lthough we wish things were different, the facts are simple: You can’t
hold those bills indefinitely — eventually, you have to pay them. If you
prefer to let the bills pile up awhile, you can enter them gradually and pay all
bills due by a certain date on your bill-paying day. Occasionally, you might
need to pay only one or two bills or write a check to cover an unexpected
expense — you know, the UPS person is standing there waiting for a check to
cover the COD package being delivered.
Peachtree helps you pay groups of bills all at once or pay individual bills on
the spur of the moment. You can make repetitive payments easily. And when
you have to void checks or pay sales tax on all those goods you sell,
Peachtree helps you keep all the amounts in the right accounts.
Terminology alert: Peachtree tends to switch back and forth between two dif-
ferent terms when referring to bills that vendors send you: a purchase and an
invoice. For the sake of clarity, we use the term purchase (or bill) unless the
window on-screen uses the term invoice. For our purposes, invoices are
things you send to customers so that you can get paid.

102
Part II: The Daily Drudge 
Paying a Group of Bills
For a fee, you can subscribe to the Peachtree Online Bill Pay service and pay
bills electronically. You don’t have to enter information twice — once at the
financial institution’s Web site and once in Peachtree — and you use the
same procedures we describe in this chapter. See Bonus Chapter 4 on this
book’s Web site, www.dummies.com/go/peachtreefd, for a few more
details about this service.
Most people sit down on a regular basis — say, every two weeks — and pay
all bills due by a certain date. They hold the bills that are due later until the
next bill-paying day. In Peachtree, you can select all bills due by a certain
date, or you can select bills that are past due by a number of days you spec-
ify (and you can specify the balance due on those bills). You can also select
bills for certain vendors. Then you can simply tell Peachtree to write the
checks and you can bid your bundle of bills bye-bye (nice alliteration, huh?).
Before you start paying your bills, you might want to print the Aged Payables
report and the Cash Requirements report to get a handle on the outstanding
purchases you entered into Peachtree. (See Chapter 14 for information on
printing reports.) By reviewing these reports, you can determine whether
you need to pay a group of bills or just a few bills. To pay a group of bills, you
use the Select for Payment window. (To pay just a few bills or to pay a bill
from an occasional vendor that you don’t want to set up in Peachtree, see
“Paying One Bill at a Time,” later in this chapter.)
Using the Select for Payment window, Peachtree looks for purchases you
entered that are eligible for payment based on the criteria you provide. You
can use this window only to pay bills you entered as purchases. (See Chapter
5 for help entering bills.) To pay a group of bills, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Select for Payment➪Paper Checks.
You also can display this dialog box from the Vendors & Purchases
Center in the Navigation Bar. Click the Pay Bills button and then choose
Pay Multiple Bills.
The Select for Payment – Filter Selection dialog box appears, as shown
in Figure 6-1.
2. Set the Check Date.
Most people use today’s date.
You can enter just the month and the day; Peachtree automatically uses
the current year established by your computer’s clock. If you enter only
the day, Peachtree automatically uses the month and year established
by your computer’s clock.

3. Use the Invoices Due Before field to set a cutoff date for purchases
that you want to pay.
Peachtree does not select any purchases due after the date you enter in
this field.
Peachtree calculates the due date when you enter the bill by using the
terms you establish for the vendor. So the due date typically is not the
same as the date you enter the bill and usually is 30 days later. We suggest
that you set the Invoices Due Before date equal to a date that falls just
before your next bill-paying day. That way, you won’t be late paying bills.
4. Set a date for the Or Discounts Lost By field if any of your vendors
offer you discounts for paying by a specified date.
If your vendors don’t offer vendor discounts, this date doesn’t matter.
5. In the Include Invoices section, select the range of invoices to include.
If you set dates in the preceding steps, you typically select the All
Invoices option. However, you can select the Only Invoices X Days Past
Due Date option and specify a number of days. In the With Balances
Over field, you can also limit the invoices to only those more than a
specified amount.
6. In the Include Vendors section, make your choices regarding payees.
You might want to simply include All Vendors, but you can choose to
include only a range of vendors. You can enter the vendor ID in the From
and To fields or you can choose the vendor type from the Type Mask
drop-down list. You can also use both the ID and type.
Figure 6-1:

103
Chapter 6: Paying Bills

7. If you always take discounts offered by vendors — even if you’re
paying later than the discount date — select the Always Take
Discounts Regardless of Due Date check box.
8. Click OK.
Peachtree displays the Select for Payment window shown in Figure 6-2,
displaying purchases that meet the criteria you just specified.
Peachtree initially displays the bills in Invoice Date order, but you can 
change to Due Date order or Vendor Name order by using the Sort By list box.
Peachtree also selects a Cash account to use to pay the bills and a Discount
account to use for any discounts you take, but you can select different
accounts by using the lookup list button (the magnifying glass shown here 
in the margin) next to the appropriate fields.
When the entire line for a bill appears gray, that entry is a purchase for 
which you haven’t yet received a bill. (The Waiting on Bill check box remains
selected on the purchase.) Peachtree won’t let you pay for these purchases. 
If you think the entry should be eligible for payment, close the Select for
Payment window and edit the purchase to deselect the Waiting on Bill check
box. See Chapter 5 for more information on editing purchases.
Peachtree assumes that you want to pay all the bills it displays, but you can
choose not to pay any bill by deselecting the check box in the Pay column.

Part II: The Daily Drudge 

You also can change the amount you pay by clicking in the Pay Amount
column and typing a different number. If you allow Peachtree to calculate 
balances automatically, it updates the numbers that appear at the lower-right
corner of the window.
If you don’t allow Peachtree to recalculate balances automatically, you see
Uncalculated in the lower-right corner of the window. In this case, you can
recalculate balances in this window by clicking the Recalc button (as shown
here in the margin). For more information on setting recalculation options,
see Bonus Chapter 1 on this book’s Web site, www.dummies.com/go/
peachtreefd.
On the toolbar at the top of the window, you can click the arrow on the Print
button and select Report from the drop-down list to print a report of the bills
you selected to pay. The report sorts the bills by vendor. You also can preview
the checks as they will look when they print by clicking the arrow on the
Print button and choosing Preview from the drop-down list.
If you click any line in the window and double-click or click the Detail button,
as shown here in the margin, you can see but not edit the details for that line.
Click the Select button, also shown in the margin, to change the filter options
you set using the dialog box shown in Figure 6-1.
Printing Checks
As you might expect, Peachtree supports printing checks on your computer’s
printer. You must order check stock with the correct bank information on it.
You can order checks from Peachtree; look for the check ordering informa-
tion inside the box with your Peachtree software. You can also order checks
from Deluxe Forms (www.deluxeforms.com — see Chapter 21 for more
information), or you can ask your local forms supplier whether they have
purchase check forms that work with Peachtree and your printer.
Whoever supplies your checks can also supply window envelopes, or you can
buy them at any office supply store. Using these envelopes saves you lots of
time when paying bills because you don’t need to use labels or address
envelopes.
After you click the Print button in the Select for Payment window (see the
preceding section for details on displaying this window), Peachtree displays
the Print Forms: Disbursement Checks window (see Figure 6-3).
105
Chapter 6: Paying Bills

Follow these steps to print checks:
1. Confirm the starting check number.
Peachtree suggests a starting check number that you can change if
Peachtree suggests an incorrect starting number. Peachtree assigns the
starting number to the first check you print and subsequent numbers to
subsequent checks when Peachtree saves your checks. If you had num-
bers preprinted on your check stock, make sure that both the check(s)
you print and the check(s) that Peachtree saves use the same check
numbers.
2. If necessary, click the Select Form button to choose a check form.
Peachtree remembers the form you last used, so you may not need to
change forms.
Peachtree displays a list of available check forms; select one and then
click OK to redisplay the dialog box shown in Figure 6-3. The form you
select should match the type of check form you purchased. You can cus-
tomize Peachtree forms; see Chapter 14.
On the check stub, most of the Peachtree check forms print purchase
information, such as the invoice number, date, and amount, but you can
instead print the details of the items you bought (each line item that
appears on the purchase, including item description, quantity, ID, and
amount). To print details, choose the OCR Multi-Purp AP 1 Detail Cont or
OCR Multi-Purp AP Detail Laser form, depending on the type of paper
your printer uses. Use the first form with continuous-feed printers and
the second form with laser or inkjet printers. You also can replace the
Item ID with either the part number or the UPC/SKU number. Be aware
that using this check form can cause Peachtree to void checks because
it might need extra check stubs to print all the information.
Figure 6-3:
Use this
window to

and the

106
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

3. Specify the number of copies you want to print.
4. If necessary, select the correct printer by clicking the Printer Setup
button.
5. Place check stock in the printer tray.
6. Click Print.
You can click the Print Sample button to print a practice check. Peachtree
prints a check filled with Xs and 9s that you can use to determine whether
the form alignment is correct.
Peachtree prints the checks and a message appears on-screen asking
whether the checks printed correctly. If you click Yes, Peachtree assigns
the check numbers, saves the checks, and closes the Select for Payment
window. If you click No, Peachtree doesn’t assign the check numbers or
save the checks, and leaves the Select for Payment window open so that
you can print them again.
If you’re following these steps to print a “one-at-a-time” check (as described
in the next section), Peachtree doesn’t ask you whether the check printed
correctly; it simply assumes the check printed correctly. If the check didn’t
print correctly, read the “Voiding Checks” section later in this chapter.
Paying One Bill at a Time
Occasionally, you need to write only one or two checks. You know, you went
to the office supply store and bought a box of copy paper, and you paid for it
with a check. Now you need to record the check. You certainly don’t want to
enter a purchase and then pay the purchase by using the Select for Payment
window. To print or record a single check, use the Payments window.
Essentially, you use the Payments window in three situations:
 You don’t need to print a check — you just need to record that it was
written.
 You don’t have many checks to write.
 You need to write a miscellaneous check, such as a refund check to a
customer or a loan check to an employee.
From the Payments window, you can print checks that pay bills, print checks
without first recording bills, or simply record checks you wrote manually. For
example, suppose that it’s bill-paying day, and you have only two bills to pay.
Use the Payments window to print checks to pay the bills. Or suppose that
the UPS guy is waiting for a check for a COD purchase. You can print the
check from the Payments window without first recording a purchase. Or sup-
pose that you enter the telephone bill in the Purchases/Receive Inventory
107
Chapter 6: Paying Bills

window, intending to pay it on bill-paying day. Then you change your mind
because you’re going to be at the phone store anyhow, and you want to bring
a check to pay the bill. Use the Payments window to print the check you want
to take to the phone store.
You can use the Write Checks window to produce a single check, but do not
use this window to write a check that pays a bill. If you enter a bill for a
vendor, pay the bill by using either the Select for Payment window or the
Payments window. We’re not overly fond of the Write Checks window,
because you won’t see any warning if you select a vendor for whom a pur-
chase exists. If you go ahead and write the check, you’ll pay a bill without
applying the check to the bill. For this reason, we strongly recommend that
you use either the Select for Payment window to pay a group of bills or the
Payments window to pay a few bills or write miscellaneous checks, and just
ignore the existence of the Write Checks window. Really. We mean it. You’ll
avoid a lot of trouble.
From the Payments window, you can pay vendors that you set up, or you can
write a check to someone you haven’t set up in Peachtree. You also can use
this window to issue an employee loan or (heaven forbid) write a refund
check to a customer. Follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Payments.
Peachtree displays the Payments window.
2. Select a vendor by using the lookup list button or type a name in the
Pay to the Order Of field.
If the vendor doesn’t have any unpaid purchases, or if you don’t select a
vendor but instead type a name in the Pay to the Order Of field,
Peachtree displays the Apply to Expenses tab shown in Figure 6-4. If
appropriate, fill in the quantity and select an item. If you don’t select an
item, you should fill in the description, supply the GL account, and, if
appropriate, type a unit price. Peachtree calculates the amount. Finally,
if appropriate, assign the line to a job.
You can include payments that you assign to jobs as reimbursable
expenses on customers’ bills. See Chapter 7 for more information.
If you select a vendor and the vendor has outstanding purchases,
Peachtree displays the Apply to Invoices tab, listing all unpaid pur-
chases for the vendor (see Figure 6-5). Select the check boxes in the Pay
column next to all purchases you want to pay. Peachtree displays the
dollar amount of the check on the check face.
You can partially pay the purchase by typing an amount in the Amount
Paid column on the line of the purchase you want to pay.
You can display the purchase shown on any line. Double-click the purchase
in any gray column, and Peachtree displays it in the Purchases/Receive
Inventory window where you can edit it.
108
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

3. If you don’t intend to print the check, type the check number in the
Check Number field at the top of the screen.
For example, if you’re recording that check you wrote at the office
supply store for the box of copy paper, you have no reason to print the
check, but you must enter it. In this situation, enter the check number.

109
Chapter 6: Paying Bills

By default, Peachtree supplies a check number for any check you print. If
you enter a check number in the Payments window for a check you
intend to print, Peachtree prints the word Duplicate on the check face —
and you don’t want that to happen. Therefore, leave the check number
blank if you intend to print the check. If you’re a Type A personality who
insists on completing all empty fields on a screen, you can suppress the
printing of the word Duplicate by customizing the check form. See
Chapter 13 for details.
4. Supply a date for the check.
5. In the upper-right portion of the window, select the Cash account
from which you want to write the check.
6. Depending on whether you enter a check number in Step 3, continue
by clicking Save or Print.
If you enter a number in the Check Number field, click the Save button
(as shown here in the margin) to save the check.
If you don’t enter a number in the Check Number field, click the Print
button (as shown here in the margin) to print the check immediately.
Peachtree displays the Print Forms dialog box, which we describe in the
“Printing Checks” section earlier in this chapter. Select Print; after you
finish printing checks, Peachtree assigns the check numbers and saves
the checks.
If you prefer to keep working and print a batch of checks later, click the Save
button to post your checks without assigning check numbers to them. See
Chapter 13 for details on printing checks in batches.
Editing Payments
From an accounting perspective, there’s little reason to edit a payment. In the
real world, however, you’ll come up with a reason. For example, when you
entered that check for office supplies, you typed the wrong amount, which
you notice when you are about to file the receipt. In this case, the amount of
the check you actually wrote doesn’t match the amount you recorded in
Peachtree — and the actual check is, of course, right.
You edit payments the same way as you edit purchase orders and purchases,
which we describe in Chapter 5. Choose Lists➪Vendors & Purchases➪Payments
to display the Payment List window, which lists all payments you recorded.
Click the check you want to edit and then click the Open button, as shown in
the margin, to display the check in the Payments window, where you can
make changes and then save the check. You also can delete checks. We talk
more about that in the section on voiding checks later in this chapter.
110
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Handling Repeat Bills and Payments
Suppose that you pay a bill — such as your rent or your health insurance —
every month for the same amount. Peachtree lets you set up recurring pur-
chases or payments. You enter the purchase or payment once and tell
Peachtree how often to record the transaction. Recurring transactions save
you data-entry time.
You set up recurring purchases and recurring payments in the same way; the
only difference is the window you use. To set up a recurring payment, start in
the Payments window.
Recurring transactions affect the General Ledger. In accrual-basis companies,
both recurring purchases and recurring payments affect the General Ledger.
In cash-basis companies, only recurring payments affect the General Ledger.
Therefore, if you enter a recurring transaction, Peachtree updates the
General Ledger in the appropriate period. If you print future period reports,
you see the effects of the transactions in those future period reports. As you
would expect, though, Peachtree displays each period’s balances accurately
for that period.
Use recurring purchases when you expect to print a check to pay a bill. If you
don’t expect to print a check — perhaps your health insurance company
automatically deducts its payment from your checking account — use recur-
ring payments.
To set up a recurring purchase, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Purchases/Receive Inventory.
Peachtree displays the Purchases/Receive Inventory window.
2. Set up the purchase (select the vendor and so on, as described in
Chapter 5), but don’t assign an invoice number.
You might want to select the Waiting on Bill check box so that you don’t
accidentally pay a future bill before it becomes due.
3. Click the Recur button on the toolbar.
Peachtree displays the Create Recurring Purchases dialog box (see
Figure 6-6).
4. From the How Often Do You Want to Recur This Transaction list,
select the frequency you want.
5. In the First Transaction Date field, enter or select the date for the first
transaction.
You can click the small calendar beside the field to select the date from
an on-screen calendar.
111
Chapter 6: Paying Bills

6. Select a date for the last transaction.
You can select the End On option and enter an ending date, or you can
select the End After option and specify the number of times you want
the transaction to recur. You can also select the No End Date option and
Peachtree creates recurring transactions indefinitely.
7. In the Begin With Number field, assign a starting reference number
for the recurring purchase.
Peachtree assigns the number you supply to the first recurring purchase
and increments subsequent transactions by one.
8. Click OK.
You might hear some activity on your hard drive while Peachtree creates
the transactions. Then Peachtree redisplays the Purchases/Receive
Inventory window, ready for you to enter your next purchase.
If you open a recurring purchase, take a minute to notice a few interesting
things:
 You can see multiple entries for the recurring transaction in the
Purchase List window. For example, if on April 1 you set up the payment
to recur weekly for seven weeks, look for at least four or possibly five
entries in April. If you set up the purchase to recur monthly, you need to
use the Date Range list in the Purchase List window to display All
Transactions or a future period. To make viewing the transaction easier,
limit the transactions you display to just the vendor for whom you set
up the recurring transaction.
 When you display the recurring purchase in the Purchases/Receive
Inventory window, look at the bottom of the window for an entry telling
you how many more entries exist.

Part II: The Daily Drudge 

 After you edit and then save a recurring transaction, Peachtree prompts
you to save the change for only the current transaction or the current
transaction and all remaining transactions.
 In the Payments window, after you select a vendor for whom you set up a
recurring purchase, you see lines for all recurring purchases, regardless of
the period. Remember: You can double-click the gray portion of any line
and view or edit the purchase in the Purchases/Receive Inventory window.
 When you click the List button in the Payments window to display the
Payment List window, you see that recurring payments don’t have check
numbers. Peachtree leaves the number blank so that you can print a
check for the payment. If you write the check by hand, edit the payment
and assign a check number.
Voiding Checks
If you write a check and then discover a problem with the check, you can void
it. After you void a check, Peachtree creates a negative check for the same
amount as the check you void, but the value of the voided check increases
your Cash account. Remember that the original check reduced your Cash
account. In other words, if you add the two transactions, you get 0 (that’s
what accountants mean when they say the transactions “net to 0”), and a $0
transaction causes no change in your cash balance. The voided check transac-
tion that Peachtree creates has the same number as the original check, but
Peachtree appends a V to the number; that is, if you void check 101, Peachtree
creates check 101V. You can view and edit the voided check in the Payments
window the same way you can view and edit any other payment.
To void a check, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Void Checks.
Peachtree displays the Void Existing Checks window, as shown in 
Figure 6-7.
Figure 6-7:
Use this
window to
identify the
check you
want to
void.
113
Chapter 6: Paying Bills

2. If necessary, click the lookup list button to select the Cash account
from which you wrote the check that you now want to void.
3. Enter the Void Date for the check.
Be sure this date falls in the period that you want the Cash account
increased, which is not necessarily the same period that the check was
written.
4. Click the check you want to void.
You can sort the checks in the Void Existing Checks window in different
ways to help you find the check you want to void. Click any of the
column headings in the window (Number, Date, Amount, and so on) to
sort checks by that column heading.
5. Click the Void button.
Peachtree displays a message asking whether you’re sure you want to
void the check.
6. Click OK.
Peachtree creates a voided check transaction.
After you void a check, you can see both the original check and the voided
check transaction in the Account Reconciliation window when you balance
your checkbook. Peachtree has already marked them both as cleared. For
more information on balancing your checkbook, see Chapter 16.
After you void a check that paid a vendor bill, Peachtree changes the status
of the bill from Paid to Unpaid. That is, Peachtree assumes you still want to
pay the bill. If you do want to pay the bill, simply use the Payments window
or the Select for Payment window to write a check. If, however, you don’t
want to pay the bill, enter a vendor credit memo for the bill. Chapter 5 has
more information on creating vendor credit memos.
If you accidentally void the wrong check, open the Payment List window
(choose Lists➪Vendors & Purchases➪Payments) and select the check. You
can find the voided check in the window — the check number ends with a V
for Void. Click that transaction and then click the Open button to display it in
the Payments window. Then delete it by clicking the Delete button, also
shown in the margin.
Paying Sales Tax
Most states expect customers to pay a sales tax on goods they purchase. In
some states, customers also pay sales tax on services. In addition, the county
or local government might also assess a tax on customers’ purchases. If your
114
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

business sells taxable goods, you collect the sales tax for at least one taxing
authority. Then, of course, you’re expected to remit the sales tax to the
taxing authority, along with a sales tax return (so that they can make sure
that you’re not cheating them out of any of the sales taxes you collect).
Paying sales tax in Peachtree is no different than paying any other bill; you can
enter a purchase to remind yourself that you owe the money or you can
simply write the check. The tricky part? Finding out how much to pay, because
not all sales are taxable in every state. And when the sales are taxable, local
taxes might apply as well. To complicate the issue further, if you operate your
business close to a border between jurisdictions, your business might be col-
lecting taxes for more than one jurisdiction — and at different rates.
If you set up your sales taxes correctly (see Chapter 7 for more information),
you can use the Taxable/Exempt Sales report (see Figure 6-8) to help you pre-
pare the sales tax return and remit your sales taxes. Choose Reports &
Forms➪Accounts Receivable to display the Select a Report window; then
print the Taxable/Exempt Sales report, which breaks down the taxes you owe
by taxing authority.
For detailed instructions on printing reports, see Chapter 14.
If you set up multiple exempt categories (as described in the section describ-
ing Inventory Preferences in Chapter 4), you can customize this report to add
a column for the Taxable Type, as we did in Figure 6-8, so that the report lists
and identifies the totals for each exempt category that you need for the sales
tax return. See Chapter 14 for help customizing reports.

W
hat incredible assets we have in our customers! Well, most of them
anyway. After all, we wouldn’t be in business without them, would we?
Peachtree operates under the assumption that you might generate a quote to
a customer, convert that quote into a sales order, and then turn that sales
order into an invoice after you produce the goods or service. You do not,
however, have to use quotes or sales orders to use the Peachtree invoicing
feature.
Even if you don’t use quotes or sales orders, we suggest that you read this
entire chapter. The steps for creating and editing quotes, sales orders, and
invoices are almost identical. Therefore, to eliminate redundancy, we explain
most of the details in one place (the “Bidding with Quotes” section). We show
you the differences between entering quotes, sales orders, and invoices in
the individual sections of this chapter.
In addition to talking about the forms you use to sell things to your customers,
we start by talking about another important selling issue — sales taxes.
Working with Sales Taxes
Everyone hates to pay sales tax; taxes make us feel like we’re paying more for
our purchase than we should. Like it or not, though, most states expect cus-
tomers to pay sales tax — usually on goods, but occasionally on services or
freight as well. If you run your business in a locality that charges sales taxes,
you, as the seller, are obligated to collect the sales tax from your customer.

118
Part II: The Daily Drudge 
Yielding to the agencies
If your business sells taxable goods or services, you collect the sales tax for
the taxing agency. That’s the term Peachtree uses to identify which govern-
ment entity has the right to tell you to collect sales tax from your customers.
That agency could be only your state government, but frequently other local
agencies are involved as well.
For example, suppose that your state, along with several counties in your
state, charges a sales tax. In this case, you need to set up sales tax agencies
for your state and for each county as well.
Most states base the tax amount on the total invoice amount, but some states
base their sales tax on the individual line item amount. Peachtree provides
the ability to calculate sales taxes by using a variety of methods. Table 7-1
illustrates the different scenarios in which your state might calculate sales
tax. (Of course, if your state doesn’t have sales taxes, feel free to avoid this
table completely.)
Table 7-1
Sales Tax Scenarios
Scenario
What It Does
Single tax rate
Applies the standard tax rate on all sales regardless
of amount.
Maximum dollar sales 
Applies the standard tax rate up to a ceiling amount.
After that, no more tax is calculated. For example, if
the tax is 3% on the first $4,000 of a sale and the
sale is $5,000, only $4,000 is taxed at the 3% amount.
The remaining $1,000 is untaxed.
Minimum dollar sales
Applies the standard tax rate only when sales reach
a specified amount. For example, if the minimum
taxable sale amount is $500, a sale of $450 is not
taxed.
Maximum dollar tax
Applies the standard tax rate until the tax reaches a
maximum amount, and then no more tax is calcu-
lated on that sale. For example, if the tax rate is 2%,
with a maximum dollar tax of $20, sales up to $1,000
are taxed at the 2% rate, but sales of $1,000 and
more are taxed a flat $20.

Scenario
What It Does
Maximum percent sales 
Applies the standard tax rate to a specific maximum 
amount
percentage, less than 100%. For example, the tax
rate might be 3%, but it applies to only 75% of the
sales price.
Each taxable line item
Calculates the tax rate on each line item instead of
applying the previous tax rates to the grand total of
the order.
Suppose that your business is located in the state of Georgia and that the
state charges 6 percent sales tax. You pay the tax to the Georgia Department
of Revenue. If you have a branch of your business located in Brown County,
Georgia (which has its own local tax), you have to charge those customers
the additional local tax — say, 1 percent — which, in turn, you pay to the
Brown County Treasurer’s office. In this situation, you have two taxing agen-
cies: the State of Georgia and Brown County.
Before you set up a sales tax agency, you must set up a vendor to whom you
remit the sales tax. You can find out how to set up a vendor in Chapter 5. To
follow this exercise, you must have a vendor set up; we use Georgia
Department of Revenue as the vendor name in this example.
To set up sales taxes, Peachtree provides a helpful wizard to guide you
through the process. The steps you see depend on the method your state
uses to calculate sales taxes. We take a look at two of them.
Single rate sales tax
If your state charges a 6% tax and your local county charges a 1% tax, for a
total of 7%, you’re using a single rate sales tax. Just follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Sales Taxes.
The Set Up Sales Taxes Wizard appears. You begin with this screen to
create a new sales tax as well as modify an existing sales tax.
2. Select the Set Up a New Sales Tax option and then click Next.
The Set Up New Sales Tax screen in Figure 7-1 is asking you for the total
tax percentage for the sales tax you’re creating. For our example, we
enter 7 as the total tax percentage.
119
Chapter 7: Selling Products and Services

If one or more of your agencies charge tax based on a calculation instead
of a flat rate, see the next section.
3. Choose how many individual rates make up the total rate.
In our example, the answer is two.
4. Click Next.
The Add Sales Tax Agency screen appears. Here is where you begin set-
ting up your agencies. See Figure 7-2.
Figure 7-2:

5. Create an agency ID, or if you previously created the agency ID, select
it from the drop-down list.
You can use up to eight letters or numbers (alphanumeric characters).
Our example uses GA STATE.
6. Type a descriptive name for the agency.
You can type up to 30 characters. We use Georgia State Sales Tax for our
example.
7. In the Which Vendor Do You Send the Taxes You’ve Collected To?
field, type or select the vendor ID to which you remit this sales tax.
For our example, we chose the Georgia Department of Revenue.
8. Click in the Rate field and enter the percentage this agency charges.
We enter 6 here.
9. Select or enter the GL Liability account to which you want to post the
sales tax you collect.
10. Click Next and repeat Steps 5–9 for each additional agency for this tax.
In our example, we need to set up an additional agency for Brown
County.
Peachtree displays at the top of the screen how many total agencies you
specify in Step 3.
11. Click Next.
After you set up the agencies, you’re ready to finalize setting up the
sales tax.
12. Create an ID and a name for the sales tax.
Use a maximum of eight alphanumeric characters for the ID and 30 for
the name. We suggest you use some type of description that indicates
the reason for the sales tax. For our example in Figure 7-3, we use
GABrown as an ID with the description Georgia, Brown County.
13. Select whether your state charges sales taxes on freight.
14. Click Finish.
Peachtree saves your sales tax setup and the Set Up Sales Tax Wizard
redisplays its opening screen.
15. Set up another sales tax if needed or click Cancel to close the Sales
Tax Wizard.
121
Chapter 7: Selling Products and Services

Sales tax formulas
If your state uses a sales tax method other than a flat single rate, Peachtree
can manage the calculation for you. For example, say your business is in
Green County. In addition to the Georgia 6% state sales tax, Green County
also charges 2% on the first $500 of your purchase, and then charges 1% on
$500 and higher.
1. Follow Steps 1–7 in the previous section except that in Step 2, leave
the percentage field at zero. Refer to Figure 7-1.
2. Click the How Are Sales Taxes Calculated for This Agency? drop-down
list and then choose By Formula, as shown here in the margin.
The screen changes to the one shown in Figure 7-4.
3. In the Which Amount Should Be Used to Calculate Sales Taxes? drop-
down list, select whether the tax should be calculated on total taxable
sales or on each line item.
4. Create the formula for your state’s calculation.
In our example, we stipulate that the county charges 2% tax on the first
$500 of our purchase and then charges 1% on the remainder.
5. Click Next and continue setting up agencies and sales taxes as
described in the previous section.

Working with Customers
Before you can generate quotes, sales orders, or invoices, you need to set up
your customer defaults and enter the individual customers. In Chapter 4, we
show you how to create the defaults you use here. Peachtree identifies each
customer by a unique ID that allows Peachtree to track any transactions
related to the customer.
Adding customers
When you set up a customer, you supply the customer’s name and address, a
Sales account to use each time you post a sale to the customer, credit infor-
mation, and any custom field information you set up in your defaults. You
also can view historical data about your sales to and receipts from your cus-
tomers over the previous 12 months.
To add or modify customer information, choose Maintain➪Customers/
Prospects. Peachtree displays the Maintain Customers/Prospects window,
as shown in Figure 7-5. The following sections examine what you can do with
each tab in this dialog box.
Figure 7-4:
Use this

Chapter 7: Selling Products and Services

The General tab
On the General tab, supply basic customer identification information, such as
ID, name, address, and phone numbers. You use the ID as the identification to
select the customer when you create a customer transaction. Try to make it
meaningful and easy to remember; in fact, we suggest you use part of the cus-
tomer name as the ID.
You can enter up to 20 alphanumeric characters (except the characters *, ?,
and +) for a customer ID. Peachtree sorts most customer reports by cus-
tomer ID, and numbers sort before letters.
Customer IDs are not case sensitive.
From the Maintain Customers/Prospects window, fill in the General tab by fol-
lowing these steps:
1. Type a customer ID and the customer’s name.
You may enter up to 30 alphanumeric characters for the customer’s
name.
2. If you do not want this customer ID included on any customer reports,
select the Prospect check box.
A prospect is a potential customer: one who has not actually bought any
goods or services from you. If you generate an invoice for the prospect
or deselect this check box, the prospect becomes a regular customer,
and Peachtree includes the ID on customer reports.

3. Fill in the customer name and contact information, billing address,
phone numbers, and (if applicable), e-mail and Web site addresses.
If you enter an e-mail address and then click the icon next to it (as
shown here), Peachtree opens your e-mail program and generates a mes-
sage to your customer.
Clicking the button next to the Web address (as shown here) launches
your Web browser and directs it to the customer’s Web site. If you plan
to e-mail forms (quotes, sales orders, or invoices) to your customers, fill
in the e-mail address. See Chapter 13 for information on e-mailing forms.
If you have Microsoft Outlook installed on your system, Peachtree can
synchronize with your Outlook contacts folder. Click the Outlook button,
as shown in the margin, on the toolbar.
If you don’t see the Outlook button, widen the Customer/Prospects
window.
4. If you charge sales taxes, select a Sales Tax applicable to this
customer.
5. If desired, enter or select a customer type.
Use the Customer Type field to group similar customers. You can then
limit the information on most A/R reports to a specific customer type.
For example, you might want to distinguish between wholesale cus-
tomers and retail customers. The Customer Type field is case sensitive.
6. Enter any desired information in the Customizable fields.
When you set up default customer information (see Chapter 4), you
create the custom fields for the Maintain Customers/Prospects window.
7. Click the Save button (as shown in the margin).
If you have any supplementary documentation — such as, Word or Excel
files, images, PDF files, and so forth that pertain to the customer — click the
Attachments button (as shown here). If you don’t see the Attachments
button, widen the Customer/Prospects window. You can then individually
add the files you want attached to the customer record.
The Addresses tab
On the General tab, you enter the customer billing address. In the Addresses
tab, you can store up to 20 shipping addresses for each customer. Whenever
you create a quote, sales order, or invoice, you can choose from the stored
shipping addresses, thereby saving data-entry time.
If the customer shipping address is the same as the billing address, you can
click the Copy button (as shown in the margin) and copy the billing address
to one of the shipping address lines.
125
Chapter 7: Selling Products and Services

The History tab
When you first set up a customer, the History tab doesn’t have any informa-
tion. However, after you record customer sales transactions, the History tab
gives you a month-by-month summary of both sales and receipts.
The History tab also shows you how long you’ve been doing business with
the customer. In fact, the Customer Since date is the only editable piece of
information on this screen. Everything else is provided for a quick overview
of the customer’s history.
The History tab also has a Customer Beginning Balance button, which you
use in the upcoming section, “Where to begin? Beginning Balances.”
If you no longer do business with this customer, select the Inactive 
check box.
The Sales Info tab
On the Sales Info tab, you can store several additional key pieces of customer
information. Peachtree relates many of the fields on this window to the inven-
tory and payroll modules.
1. Select a default sales rep for this customer by typing the sales rep ID
or selecting one from the lookup list.
See Chapter 9 for information on creating sales reps. If you don’t use
sales reps, keep this field blank.
2. Define a GL Sales account for the customer if it’s different from the
default account established in the Customer Defaults dialog box.
For more information about customer defaults, see Chapter 4.
When you create an inventory item, you specify a Sales account for the
item. When you generate an invoice, the Sales account associated with
inventory items overrides the customer Sales account. You can find out
how to set up inventory items in Chapter 11.
3. In the Open PO Number field, enter a purchase order number if your
customer has given you a standing purchase order number to use for
all purchases from you.
This purchase order number appears by default in the Customer
Purchase Order field on the Quotes, Sales Orders, and Sales/Invoicing
windows.
126
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

4. In the Ship Via field, choose a preferred shipping method.
Determine shipping methods in the Maintain Inventory Item Defaults
window. If necessary, you can override the preferred method when you
generate a customer invoice. You set up shipping methods in Chapter 4.
5. If the customer does not have to pay sales tax, enter the resale
number.
Most states require customers to provide you with their resale number
for tax-exempt purchases.
6. Choose the pricing level most often associated with this customer.
Pricing levels are tied to inventory items. See Chapter 11 for details on
how to assign up to ten prices to each inventory item. Peachtree then
automatically charges the customer the price shown in the pricing level
you specify here.
7. Select a preferred form delivery method and options.
Forms include Sales Orders, Packing Slips, Invoices, and Statements.
To use the e-mail delivery method in Peachtree, you must use a MAPI-
compliant, default e-mail application, such as Outlook or Outlook Express.
If your default e-mail system is AOL, you won’t be able to send e-mail from
Peachtree because AOL is not a fully MAPI-compliant e-mail application.
The Payment & Credit tab
All things not being equal, Peachtree provides the ability to assign different
credit terms to different customers. You use the Payment & Credit tab to
establish the specific terms for the current customer. If you accept credit
cards from your clients, this tab provides a place to store the customer’s
credit card number and expiration date.
Options in the Receipt Settings area are time-savers. If the Use Payment
Method and Cash Account from Last Saved Receipt check box is selected,
Peachtree uses the payment method and Cash account you selected on the
last receipt you saved for the selected customer. You might want to change
this setting if, for example, the selected customer always pays by credit card,
but the majority of your other customers pay by check.
Peachtree assumes that each customer uses the default terms you establish
when you set up customer defaults. If your customer uses terms different
than the default terms, click the arrow next to Use Default Terms and then
select Customize Terms for This Customer. You can then edit the terms, indi-
cating whether to charge finance charges, change the customer’s credit limit,
or determine whether or how Peachtree should notify you about the cus-
tomer’s credit limit status. See Figure 7-6 for an example.
127
Chapter 7: Selling Products and Services

Use the Credit Status field to place a customer on credit hold. If a customer’s
status is Always Hold, Peachtree displays a warning message and does not
allow you to save an invoice for that customer.
After making any changes, be sure to click the Save button.
After you save the customer record, if you determine that you want to use a
different customer ID, click the Change ID button (as shown here). Type the
new ID in the Enter New Customer ID field, click OK, and then click the Save
button again.
Where to begin? Beginning balances
Chances are that you’ve been selling your goods and services for a while. You
probably haven’t been paid yet for all the work you did and the products you
sold. You probably gave your customers a specified amount of time to pay
their invoices to you. You specify your terms when you set up your default
customer information in Chapter 4.
Although some invoices aren’t due yet, others might be past due. Either way,
the customer owes you money. When you begin using Peachtree, you need to
tell Peachtree about those unpaid invoices. Enter these invoices as customer
beginning balances.
Figure 7-6:
Use this
window to
record

128
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Entering invoices as beginning balances does not affect the General Ledger.
To enter customer beginning balances, follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Customers/Prospects.
2. From the History tab, click the Customer Beginning Balances button
(as shown in the margin) to display the Customer Beginning Balances
dialog box.
3. Double-click the first customer for which you need to enter a begin-
ning balance invoice.
Did you think you’d have to re-create your invoices? You don’t. Simply
provide Peachtree with a few key pieces of information.
4. Enter the invoice number and the date of the original invoice.
The date is needed so that Peachtree can age the invoice properly.
5. (Optional) Enter the customer’s purchase order number for the
invoice.
6. Enter the invoice amount.
7. Enter the A/R account number.
The A/R account is the Accounts Receivable account. Notice we say
Accounts Receivable. We’re not talking about the Sales account. It’s a
common mistake to enter the Sales account number.
8. Repeat Steps 4–7 for each outstanding invoice for the selected 
customer.
Figure 7-7 shows a sample list of outstanding invoices.

Technically, Peachtree has no limit to the number of beginning balance
invoices you can enter for an individual customer. However, if you
exceed 100 invoices, you can enter but not edit or delete the 101st
invoice and subsequent invoices.
9. Click the Save button.
10. Click the Customer Balances tab and then select the next customer for
whom you want to enter beginning balances.
11. After you finish entering beginning balances, click the Close button, as
shown in the margin.
We recommend that you print both an Aged Receivables report to verify the
invoice information and dates and a Trial Balance report to make sure that
the Aged Receivables balance matches the GL balance.
Bidding with Quotes
Many businesses let their customers know how much a product or service
costs by producing a quote before the customer decides to buy. Peachtree
allows you to create a quote; after the customer determines he or she does
want to buy from you, you can convert that quote to a sales order or an
invoice.
Quotes are optional in the Peachtree sales process.
Entering quotes
The top part of the quote window contains header information, such as cus-
tomer name, address, quote number, date, and other such information. Enter
the actual products or services you supply in the body of the quote. In Bonus
Chapter 1, located at www.dummies.com/go/peachtreefd, you can find
out how to modify the appearance of the Quotes window by using templates.
The steps to create, edit, and print quotes are almost identical to the steps
for sales orders and invoices.
To create a quote in Peachtree, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Quotes/Sales Orders/Proposals➪Quotes to display the
Quotes window, as shown in Figure 7-8.
130
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

2. Type or select the customer ID.
You can’t enter a quote in Peachtree unless you set up a customer.
Peachtree displays the customer’s current balance and credit limit in the
lower-left corner.
If you begin typing the customer ID only to find you haven’t yet entered
the customer into Peachtree, press the plus (+) key while the insertion
point is in the ID field. Peachtree displays the Maintain Customers/
Prospects window, allowing you to create the customer record. After you
close the Maintain Customers/Prospects window, Peachtree redisplays
the Quotes window. This procedure works for any lookup list you open
in Peachtree. Pressing the plus (+) key opens the appropriate Maintain
window: Vendors, Customers/Prospects, Inventory, Employees/Sales
Reps, or Chart of Accounts.
3. Type the recipient Ship To address, or click the arrow next to the Ship
To field and then select one of the addresses you entered when first
setting up the customer.
Peachtree doesn’t store a manually entered Ship To address perma-
nently in the customer record. However, Peachtree does store the
custom address with the current quote and transfers the address to the
resulting sales order or invoice, or both.
Optionally, click the Copy button to copy the billing address into the
Ship To fields.
4. Enter the date you want printed on the quote in the Date field and a
Good Thru date for the quote.
Peachtree assumes that the quote is valid for a period of 30 days and prints
the ending date on the quote form. If you’re giving your customer a longer
or shorter period of time, choose a different date in the Good Thru field.
Figure 7-8:
Quotes

131
Chapter 7: Selling Products and Services

Peachtree doesn’t do anything to the quote if the customer doesn’t
respond in the specified number of days. The date is simply printed on
the quote form.
5. (Optional) Enter a quote number in the Quote No. field.
If you’re going to print the quote (and usually you do), don’t enter a
quote number because Peachtree assigns the number when it prints the
quote. If you already assigned the quote a number, perhaps from a
verbal quote, enter the quote number.
If you plan to have your vendor ship the item directly to your customer,
select the Drop Ship check box.
It’s unlikely that your customer has given you a purchase order number
for a quote. After all, if you’re quoting it, the customer hasn’t yet
decided to buy. You can leave the Customer PO field blank.
6. (Optional) Type a shipping method or select a shipping method from
the Ship Via drop-down list.
7. (Optional) Change the terms for this order.
By default, Peachtree displays the terms you chose when you set up this
customer in Maintain Customers/Prospects.
8. (Optional) Select a sales rep ID from the Sales Rep lookup list.
Take a look at Chapter 9 for information on how to set up a sales
representative.
If your company is cash based, the A/R Account field displays <Cash
Basis>, and you can’t access the Account field. If your business is
accrual based, you can select the A/R account from the lookup list for
this potential sale although typically you shouldn’t change the default. If
you elect to hide General Ledger accounts in A/R, you won’t even see an
A/R Account field. See Bonus Chapter 1 on this book’s Web site for more
information on hiding or showing GL accounts.
9. In the body of the quote, enter the quantity for the first item on the
quote.
If you’re quoting a service or product that doesn’t have a quantity, you
can leave the quantity blank.
10. If you’re selling an inventory item, select the item ID.
Peachtree fills in the item description, the GL Sales account, the item’s
unit price, and the tax status. Then Peachtree multiplies the quantity
times the unit price for the amount. Read about setting up inventory
items in Chapter 11.
132
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

11. If you’re quoting or selling a non-stock item or you don’t use inven-
tory, leave the Item field blank and fill in the Description, GL (Sales)
Account, and Unit Price fields.
Peachtree calculates the amount. If you did not enter a quantity in Step
9, you must enter an amount rather than a unit price. Peachtree flags
any spelling errors as they occur. See Bonus Chapter 1 on this book’s
Web site for information on spelling options.
Quotes don’t affect the General Ledger, but whenever the quote
becomes a sale, Peachtree uses the GL account numbers to update your
financial information.
If you have globally hidden General Ledger accounts, Peachtree does not
display GL Account fields in the Quotes window. To modify GL accounts
used for this transaction, you must click the Journal button (as shown
here) on the window toolbar.
12. If you’re quoting a non-inventory item, select the tax type in the Tax
field.
The Tax field refers to the tax types you determine when setting inven-
tory defaults. Peachtree uses default tax types of 1 for Taxable and 2 for
Exempt. If you’re using inventory items, Peachtree determines the tax
type from the inventory item.
13. You probably won’t have a job number assigned yet because this is
still a quote, so skip the Job field.
14. Repeat Steps 9–13 for each item you want to quote.
15. If you’re going to charge shipping charges, enter the estimated
amount in the Freight field.
16. (Optional) Click the Note button, as shown here in the margin, to store
one of three different notes:
• A customer note, which prints on the actual Quote form
• A statement note, which prints on the customer statement
• An internal note, for internal reference only
If you later convert the quote to a sales order or invoice, the notes carry
over as well.
We’re assuming that you need to print the quote; however, if you don’t need
to print the quote, click the Save button (as shown here). Peachtree saves the
quote for future reference. To print or e-mail your quote, click the Print button
or the E-mail button. See Chapter 13 for more information about printing forms.

Converting a quote to a sales 
order or an invoice
Congratulations! You got the sale! Now you’re ready to generate a sales order
or an invoice from the original quote.
To convert a quote to make the sale, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Quotes/Sales Orders/Proposals➪Quotes which displays
the Quotes window.
2. Click the List button (as shown in the margin) to display a list of previ-
ously created quotes.
3. Choose the quote you want to convert and then click the Open button.
You might have to change the date range to display quotes from a differ-
ent time period.
If you don’t remember what month you created the quote, try this: In the
Date Range list, select All Transactions (at the top of the list). Then click
in the Search For field and enter a few characters of your customer’s
name. Click the drop-down list next to the Search For field and then
select Customer/Prospect Name. Click the Search button, and Peachtree
locates quotes for only the customer you specify.
4. Change the date on the quote to the sales order date or invoice date
you want to use.
5. Click the Convert button (as shown in the margin) to display the
Convert Quote dialog box shown in Figure 7-9.
6. Select a conversion option.
The options, which appear depending on your selection, are as follows:
Figure 7-9:

Part II: The Daily Drudge 

• Sale/Invoice: Select this to convert your quote to an invoice. You
get a field prompting you for an invoice number. If you elect not to
enter an invoice number, the quote still converts to an invoice, but
you’ll need to print the invoice at a later time.
• Sale/Invoice and Print Now: Select this to convert your quote to an
invoice. After you click OK, Peachtree prompts you for a beginning
invoice number and other print options and then prints the invoice.
• Sales Order: Select this to convert your quote to a sales order. A
field appears with the next sales order number displayed. You can
change this sales order number if desired.
• Proposal: Select this to convert your quote to a proposal. A field
appears with the next proposal number displays. You can change
the proposal number if you wish.
Proposals are similar to sales orders except that with a proposal,
you can bill the customer for a percentage of the amount due, for
specific lines of the proposal, or for the remaining unbilled portion
of the job. See Chapter 12 for more information on proposals.
7. Click OK.
After you convert a quote, the transaction is no longer available as a
quote if you click the List button in the Quotes window. You can, how-
ever, see it as a sales order, proposal, or invoice in the Sales Order List
window, Proposal List window, or the Sales/Invoicing window.
Working with Sales Orders
Why should you use sales orders? Why not just create an invoice? Well, this
choice is really a matter of timing. If your business receives a customer order
and ships the product or provides the service within a day or two, you could
skip the sales order step and wait to enter the invoice. If a lapse exists between
the time when you take the order and when you provide the product or ser-
vice, however, you might find the sales order feature helpful. The sales order
feature lets you enter items for a customer and then invoice and ship the
items as they become available, tracking the back orders in the system.
By viewing inventory and sales order reports, you know the number of items
back-ordered for your customers, which can help you plan purchases from
your vendors.
Sales orders are optional in the Peachtree sales process.
135
Chapter 7: Selling Products and Services

Even though you reference GL accounts when you create a sales order,
Peachtree doesn’t update the General Ledger from a sales order.
You might find entering data in the Sales Order window similar to creating a
quote. To create a sales order, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Quotes/Sales Orders/Proposals➪Sales Orders to dis-
play the Sales Orders window.
2. Fill in the customer information or select the customer ID from the
lookup list.
If you enter a customer ID not set up in Peachtree, the ID field flashes.
When you later save or print the transactions, Peachtree prompts you to
save the customer information.
The lower-left corner displays the customer’s current balance, credit
limit, and credit status. Click the arrow to display the customer ledger.
3. Type the Ship To address, or click the arrow next to the Ship To field
and then select one of the addresses you entered when first setting up
the customer.
Peachtree doesn’t store a manually entered Ship To address perma-
nently in the customer record. However, Peachtree does store the
custom address with the sales order and later transfers the address to
the resulting invoice.
4. Enter the date you want for the sales order and a ship-by date.
The ship-by date can appear on several sales order reports to help you
better track your customer orders.
Peachtree automatically assigns the next sales order number, but you
can change it if you want.
5. If you want your vendor to ship the item directly to your customer,
select the Drop Ship check box.
If you activate the default inventory option in Peachtree Premium or
higher to create purchase orders automatically, Peachtree creates a pur-
chase order for the item. See Chapter 4.
Read the earlier section, “Entering quotes,” to review entering line items.
6. Fill in the body of the sales order, keeping the following variations 
in mind:
• A sales order does not have a Good Thru field.
• Your customer might not supply you with a customer purchase order
number.
100 235
500

136
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

• If you don’t enter a quantity, enter an amount.
• If you’re using the Peachtree job costing feature, you might have
already assigned a job number to the customer order. If so, be sure to
indicate the job ID, and optionally, the phase code and cost code to
each sales order line item. Read about setting up jobs in Chapter 12.
Peachtree can play a visual trick on you here. When you click the
Job field, it expands backward and covers up part of the Amount
field (see Figure 7-10). At first glance, it might appear that some of
or all the amount has disappeared, but it’s only hidden. When you
move the insertion point past the Job field, Peachtree redisplays
the Amount field.
• If you’re going to charge shipping charges and you know the amount,
enter it in the Freight field.
• The Shipped quantity field is unavailable for you to edit. When you
ship the ordered goods (whether partially or completely) and bill
them on an invoice, Peachtree tracks the quantity shipped and
enters it in this column of the sales order.
7. (Optional) Click the Note button to store one of three different notes:
• A customer note, which prints on the actual Sales Order form
• A statement note, which prints on the customer statement
• An internal note, for internal reference only
If you have an electronic copy of the customer’s original order, you can
click the Attach button to link the original order to the Peachtree sales
order.
8. After you finish entering the sales order, click the Save button to save
the transaction or the Print button to print it.
See Chapter 13 for instructions on printing sales orders.

Chapter 7: Selling Products and Services

Generating an Invoice
Finally! Your company has produced the product or performed the service,
and you’re now ready to collect your money. Most businesses generate an
invoice as proof of the sale to give or send to their customers.
If you read the previous sections on creating quotes or creating sales orders,
you know quite a bit about creating an invoice. Like with quotes and sales
orders, you enter the invoice header and body information. The difference is
that when you do use sales orders, you enter the information a little differ-
ently from the way you enter data if you don’t use sales orders.
Invoicing against a sales order
In a single transaction, only one sales order can apply to an invoice. However,
you can create multiple invoices from a single sales order. To create an
invoice and apply it to a sales order, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Sales/Invoicing to display the Sales/Invoicing window.
The Sales/Invoicing window is similar to the Quotes and Sales Order
windows.
2. Type or select the customer ID.
You can’t create an invoice in Peachtree unless you set up a customer
through Maintain Customers/Prospects.
With the insertion point in the ID field, you can press the plus (+) key to
display the Maintain Customers/Prospects window.
Here’s where things get a little different. See Figure 7-11. After you select
your customer ID, Peachtree looks for any open sales order for that cus-
tomer. If an open sales order exists, Peachtree automatically displays the
Apply to Sales Order No. tab.
If the invoice you want to enter does not apply to a sales order, click the
Apply to Sales tab and proceed to the information in the next section,
“Invoicing against sales.”
If your customer has both open sales orders and open accepted propos-
als, Peachtree alerts you with a message window. Click OK. See Chapter
12 for information on progress billing against a proposal.
138
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

3. On the Apply to Sales Order No. tab, click the arrow to display a drop-
down list of open sales orders.
4. Select the sales order you want to invoice.
Peachtree fills in the information you supplied when you created the
sales order, including Ship To, Customer PO, Sales Rep, and the items
ordered.
5. Enter the invoice date and change any header information.
Leave the invoice number blank if you want Peachtree to assign an
invoice number when you print the invoice.
Inventory item numbers on a sales order can’t be edited from an invoice.
To change item numbers, you must edit the original sales order. You 
can, however, change the quantities or item description. To add addi-
tional items or charges to the invoice, click the Apply to Sales tab and
add the items there.
6. In the Shipped column, enter the quantities shipped. Or if the entire
order has been filled, click the Ship toolbar button and then choose
All (both shown in the margin).
If you click the All button, Peachtree fills in the remaining quantities of
the order.
Figure 7-11:
Create an
invoice
for your
customers.
139
Chapter 7: Selling Products and Services

7. Enter the Freight amount.
If you entered freight information when you created the sales order,
Peachtree automatically displays it on the invoice only if you use the
Ship All feature in the previous step. If you make a partial shipment and
need to charge freight, enter the freight amount manually.
If you’re going to ship the product via UPS and plan to use the shipping
feature available in Peachtree Complete and above, click the Freight link.
See “Shipping the UPS Way,” later in this chapter, for information on the
shipping feature.
8. (Optional) Click the Note button to store one of three notes:
• A customer note, which prints on the actual invoice
• A statement note, which prints on the customer statement
• An internal note, for internal reference only
9. Click the Save button or the Print button (both as shown in the
margin).
You probably want to print the invoice. If you’re not going to print it or if
you want to continue entering invoices and print them later in a batch,
though, click the Save button to save the invoice. To print your invoices,
see Chapter 13.
When you save or print the invoice, if the current invoice total plus any
unpaid invoices for this customer exceed the credit limit determined
when you set up the customer, Peachtree might warn you and poten-
tially stop you from proceeding with the invoice.
Invoicing against sales
Your business doesn’t use sales orders? You can create an invoice without a
sales order. To create an invoice, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Sales Invoicing to display the Sales/Invoicing window.
2. Enter the invoice header information.
To review how to enter the header information, see the “Bidding with
quotes” section, earlier in this chapter. The header information com-
prises the invoice date, shipping address, customer’s purchase order
number (if available), shipping method, terms, and sales rep ID.
3. If you want your vendor to ship the item directly to your customer,
select the Drop Ship check box.
If you activate the default inventory option in Peachtree Premium or
higher to create purchase orders automatically, Peachtree creates a pur-
chase order for the item. See Chapter 4 for more about setting inventory
defaults.
140
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

4. Fill in the line items for the invoice, starting by entering a quantity for
the first item on the invoice.
You can leave the Quantity field blank when invoicing a service or prod-
uct that doesn’t have a quantity. Then, enter the information for the fol-
lowing if they apply:
• If the product is an inventory item, select the item ID.
Peachtree fills in the item description, the GL account, the item’s
unit price, and the tax type. Then Peachtree multiplies the quantity
times the unit price for the amount.
You can tell Peachtree to warn you if you don’t have enough stock
to sell the item. Read more about this in Chapter 4.
• If your product is a non-inventory item or you don’t use inventory, leave
the Item field blank and enter a description, GL account, and unit price.
The Tax field refers to the tax types you determine when setting
inventory defaults. If you’re using inventory items, Peachtree
determines the tax type from the inventory item.
• If you don’t enter a quantity, enter an amount.
• (Optional) If you’re using the Peachtree job-costing feature, select a job.
Click in the Job field to display the lookup list button and then
select a job from the list.
• If you’re going to charge shipping charges and you know the amount,
enter it in the Freight Amount field.
If you’re going to ship the product via UPS and plan to use the shipping
feature available in Peachtree Complete or Peachtree Premium, click the
Freight link. This saves the invoice and opens the Shipping window with
the customer information already entered. See “Shipping the UPS Way,”
later in this chapter, for information on the shipping feature.
5. (Optional) Click the Note button to store one of three different notes:
• A customer note, which prints on the actual invoice
• A statement note, which prints on the customer statement
• An internal note, for internal reference only
6. Click the Save button or the Print button.
You probably want to print the invoice; however, if you’re not going to
print it or if you want to continue entering invoices and print them later
in a batch, click the Save button to save the invoice. To print your
invoices, see “Printing Forms” in Chapter 13.
Like with sales orders, if the current invoice total plus any unpaid
invoices for this customer exceed the credit limit you established when
you set up the customer, Peachtree might warn you and potentially stop
you from proceeding with the invoice.
141
Chapter 7: Selling Products and Services

Shipping the UPS Way
This feature is available only in Peachtree Complete and higher.
What happens when you mix brown and peach? No, we’re not referring to
disintegrating fruit. You get UPS (brown) integration with your Peachtree
(peach) software! You might deliver your goods to your clients in many differ-
ent ways. You might hand-deliver them, the customer might pick them up
from your warehouse, or you might ship them by using a common carrier
such as a freight line or a parcel delivery service. If you ship your goods
through UPS, you can generate and track the shipment information directly
through the Peachtree Shipments feature.
A shipment generated through the Shipments feature doesn’t have to be for
goods you sell. It could be for any document or package you want to ship to
anyone, anywhere.
You must have an Internet connection for the Shipments feature to work.
Before you can use the Shipments feature, you must have an account number
registered through UPS. Contact UPS at 1-800-PICK-UPS (1-800-742-5877) or
www.ups.com to initiate an account. Don’t lose the account number, because
you need it to register through the Shipping Registration Wizard.
After you have an account number assigned but before you can ship your
first package, you must use the Shipping Registration Wizard to activate the
link between UPS and Peachtree. Choose Tasks➪Shipments➪Shipping
Registration Wizard. Follow the steps, which include entering your shipping
address, a contact name, your UPS account number, and the billing method
you want UPS to use.
The contact person entered in the Shipping Registration Wizard must be set
up as an employee in Maintain Employees even if you don’t use Peachtree to
process payroll. See Chapter 9 for setting up employees.
When you have UPS packages to ship, follow these easy steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Shipments➪Shipments.
Peachtree opens the Shipping window.
2. (Optional) In the Ship to Type list, select whether you’re shipping to a
customer, a vendor, or an employee.
3. Select the ID. If you’re not shipping to a customer, a vendor, or an
employee, leave this field blank.
If you clicked the Freight link in the Sales/Invoicing window, you see the
Shipping window with the customer information and invoice number
already entered.
142
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

4. Enter a shipment number.
This is a required data-entry field. After you create a shipment number
(say, 101), Peachtree remembers the sequence for the next shipment
and numbers it (102). Optionally, you could use the customer invoice
number as the shipment reference number.
5. Select the level of UPS service you want.
You can select the service level as well as any extras, such as delivery
confirmation or COD charges.
6. (Optional) In the Shipment Description field, enter a brief description
of the contents of the shipment.
7. Enter the package information, including package type and weight.
8. (Optional) Enter the package value and then select whether you want
the package to have special handling.
Each package going to this recipient must be listed with its own package
type, weight, and dimensions. Peachtree lists the standard UPS-provided
packages as well as a custom field, where you enter your own dimen-
sions. The length should be the longest dimension in the package.
9. If you want a cost estimate before shipping this order, click the
Estimate button and follow the on-screen instructions.
The UPS Estimate Settings field prompts you for the method you plan on
using to get the package to UPS and then displays a list of the UPS serv-
ice level options and their published rates.
10. Click the Process button.
Peachtree registers the shipment with UPS and assigns a UPS tracking
number.
If you’re billing the total to the customer invoice and the customer invoice
already has an invoice number assigned, Peachtree thinks the invoice 
is already printed and warns you that proceeding will change the invoice’s
total amount due.
A confirmation message appears, stating the total estimated charges,
and prompts you to print the shipping labels. Print the shipping label on
plain paper and attach it to the package, usually in a special UPS window
envelope.
11. Click OK twice and then click Yes after the label prints.
Your UPS account does not get billed until the actual package is scanned
by a UPS representative. If you decide to not ship the package, you can
void the shipment by locating it through the List button and then click-
ing the Void button.
You can track the status of your shipment by choosing Tasks➪Shipments➪
Track a Package and entering the UPS tracking number.
143
Chapter 7: Selling Products and Services

Editing a Sales Transaction
Like most transactions you enter in Peachtree, quotes, sales orders, and
invoices are not written in stone. Peachtree makes it easy for you to modify
anything on the transaction — even after it has been printed.
Choose Lists➪Customers & Sales and then choose the type of document you
want to edit: Quote, Proposal, Sales Order, or Sales/Invoicing. Locate the doc-
ument you want and then click the Open button. Make any desired changes
to the transaction by using the steps described in appropriate preceding sec-
tions in this chapter. Then click the Print button to reprint the transaction or
click the Save button to save the transaction without reprinting it.
Voiding an Invoice
If you generate an invoice and then discover that the invoice needs to be can-
celed, use the Void Invoice feature. See Chapter 8 if you need to issue a credit
memo to the customer.
Although technically, you could delete an invoice to get rid of it, deleting an
invoice is not good accounting practice. When you delete transactions, you
lose your audit trail of the actions you took. If the original invoice occurred in
a previous month, you could hurt the integrity of your reports. Your accoun-
tant would not be a happy camper.
When you void an invoice, Peachtree creates several transactions. First,
Peachtree creates another invoice with the same invoice number as the origi-
nal except that it appends a V to the invoice number. That invoice amount is
a negative dollar amount equal to the amount of the original invoice. For
example, if you generate invoice number 1234 for $150.00 that you must
cancel, Peachtree generates another invoice 1234V for –$150.00 to void the
original.
If the original transaction involves inventory items, Peachtree restores to
inventory the items sold. In the General Ledger, Peachtree creates a reversing
entry, affecting Sales and Accounts Receivable accounts and (if applicable)
Cost of Sales and Inventory accounts. If the original invoice does not come
from a sales order, the reversing entry contains negative values for the quan-
tities sold. However, if the original invoice does come from a sales order, the
reversing entry contains negative values for the quantities shipped.
Peachtree then reopens the sales order.
Next, Peachtree creates a zero-dollar receipt to pay both the original and
voided invoices. This receipt clears both transactions from the Aged
Receivables report. In other words, if you add the two transactions together,
100 235
500
99
83
144
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

you get zero, and a $0 transaction causes no change in your cash balance.
You can view the zero-dollar receipt by clicking the Open button in the
Tasks➪Receipts window and then selecting the appropriate receipt.
To void an invoice, follow these steps:
1. Choose Lists➪Customers & Sales➪Sales Invoices.
2. Locate the transaction you want to void and then click the Open
button, as shown in the margin.
The transaction must appear on the screen before you can void it.
Optionally, choose a different period from the Date Range drop-down list
to find the invoice you want.
3. Click the Delete button and then choose Void (both as shown in the
margin).
Peachtree opens a Void Existing Invoice dialog box, such as the one in
Figure 7-12.
4. Type the date you want — usually the current date — in The
Following Invoice Will Be Voided As Of field.
5. Click OK.
Peachtree lists the word Void beside both the original and reversing
invoices and uses the invoice number as the receipt reference number.
Recurring Invoices
In some businesses, you have customers that you bill the same amount every
month for the same products or services. By setting up recurring entries, you
can save a great deal of time entering these invoices. Even if the amount dif-
fers next time, it’s helpful to have all the other information filled out for you.
Then, you have to change only the amount.
Figure 7-12:
Peachtree

145
Chapter 7: Selling Products and Services

If you’re using Peachtree Premium or higher and your company is set up for
auto-creation of purchase orders, Peachtree does not automatically create
POs for recurring customer invoices. (See Chapter 4.)
Recurring entries can’t be created if you generate the invoice by using a sales
order.
You also can create recurring purchases, payments, and general journal
entries. You can adapt the following steps for these other tasks.
To create recurring invoices, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Sales/Invoicing to display the Sales/Invoicing window.
2. Enter the invoice information as you usually would, but do enter an
invoice number or click the Save or the Print button.
3. Click the Recur button (as shown here) to display the Create
Recurring Sales Invoices dialog box, as shown in Figure 7-13.
4. From the How Often Do You Want to Recur This Transaction? drop-
down list, select a time frame for the recurring invoice.

Peachtree displays a field to enter a beginning invoice number. All trans-
actions are numbered incrementally. A number of our clients use a
system that includes the current year as the first two or four digits of
the number, followed by a dash and then the beginning invoice number.
Peachtree doesn’t automatically print recurring invoices. If you leave the
invoice number blank, you can print the recurring transactions when
you use the batch printing method or edit the transaction and then click
Print. Chapter 13 discusses how to print batches of forms.
7. Click OK.
Peachtree saves all transactions in the appropriate periods.
If you need to edit or delete a recurring transaction, Peachtree prompts you
with the Change Recurring Journal Entries dialog box. You can edit only the
current invoice or the current invoice and all future occurrences. Editing a
recurring transaction does not affect previous transactions.
Broadcasting Invoices
In the preceding section, you can read about generating recurring invoices
for when your customer buys the same product or service on a regular basis;
monthly, for example. Suppose, however, that you provide a service for a
number of customers, all being charged the same amount. It might be a one-
time service for many of these customers, so creating a recurring invoice
won’t work for you.
The Peachtree broadcast invoicing feature (available in Peachtree Premium
and higher) allows you to create one invoice for multiple customers. This can
be quite a time-saver compared with creating the invoices one at a time for
each customer.
The following steps show you how to broadcast an invoice:
1. Create the invoice that you want to broadcast to multiple customers.
Don’t enter information in the customer ID, date, or invoice number
fields. Peachtree fills this in for you later.
You cannot broadcast an invoice that contains serialized inventory
items.
2. Click the Broadcast button, as shown in the margin.
The Select Customers for Broadcast Invoicing - Filter Selection screen, as
shown in Figure 7-14, appears.
147
Chapter 7: Selling Products and Services

3. Choose from the following options to filter to the list of customers you
want to use. You can choose a combination of options:
• ID: To filter by customer ID, select the option button and then
choose the beginning and ending customer IDs.
• Name: To filter by customer name, select the Name button; then,
choose the beginning and ending customer name.
• Active/Inactive: To filter by whether the customer is active or inac-
tive, click the arrow and then select an option.
• Customers/Prospects: To filter by whether the invoice should go to
customers, prospects, or both, click the arrow and then select an
option.
After you create an invoice for a prospect, the prospect is automat-
ically changed to a customer.
• ZIP Code: To filter by Zip code, select All to include customers in all
Zip codes or select Mask if you want customers in specific Zip
codes. For example, if you want to select customers with Zip code
46239, enter 46239 in the Zip Code field. If you want to filter cus-
tomers whose Zip code begins with 462, enter “462**” in the Zip
Code field.
• Type: To filter customers by type, select Range; then, select the
customer types you want. Choose All if you don’t want to filter by
customer type.
• Delivery Method: To filter customers based on the customer’s form
delivery method, select Print Only, E-mail Only, or Print and E-mail.

• Sales Rep ID: To filter customers assigned to a particular sales rep,
select All or Range and then select the sales reps you want.
• Custom Fields: To filter customers with a particular value in a
custom field, select the value from the From and To lists for the
appropriate custom field.
4. Click OK.
The Create Broadcast Invoices screen appears with a grid displaying a
list of customers that meet the filter criteria. If you need to change the
filter criteria, click the Return to Filter Screen button (as shown here).
5. Verify and, if needed, change the Broadcast Invoice Date.
You might see warning messages in the grid next to some customers: for
example, if the customer were over the credit limit. Review the mes-
sages and decide whether you want to continue sending an invoice to
this customer.
6. Deselect any customer to whom you don’t want to send the invoice.
Peachtree displays in the lower-right corner the number of invoices you
selected and the estimated invoice totals.
7. Click the Create button (as shown in the margin).
Peachtree creates the invoices for each selected customer and then dis-
plays a confirmation screen.
8. Click the Print Invoices button (as shown here) if you want to print
the invoices now. Or, click the Close button if you plan on printing the
invoices later.
Click the View Summary button (as shown here) to see a list of the
invoices you just created. You don’t have the option to view this report
any other time.
After you finish, you can review the invoices and (if desired) edit them
by choosing them from the Lists➪Customers & Sales➪Sales Invoices.
Reviewing Customer Reports
Peachtree offers several useful reports that you can use for listing customer
information, compiling tax information, and tracking quotes that you want to
turn into sales. In Tables 7-2, 7-3, and 7-4, we provide you with a description
of the reports that pertain to selling your goods and services. You can sort
the report data in a variety of ways, and you can control how much and
which information you want to display on the report. See Chapter 14 to find
out how to customize and print reports.

Collecting the Money
In This Chapter
 Receiving your customers’ money
 Tracking accounts receivable
 Issuing credit memos
 Charging finance charges
 Printing statements
O
ne of our favorite sayings is, “As much fun as I’m having doing what I’m
doing . . . I’m still doing it for the money.”
Most people do find that their preferred part of being in business is collecting
the money. Peachtree not only provides you with an easy way to track the
money your customers owe you, but it also provides you with a few ways to
encourage your customers to pay up.
Peachtree refers to the money you receive from your customers as receipts.
That sounds logical enough, doesn’t it?
Recording Receipts
The Receipts feature allows you to enter all checks, cash, and credit card
slips you receive and post them to your checking account. Peachtree pro-
vides two ways to account for receipts. The method you use is mostly deter-
mined by timing.
One method is used when you receive the customer’s money at the time of
the sale. You enter the receipt right on the invoice and then when you print
the invoice, it can also show the funds received.
The other and more commonly used method is to apply the receipt to an
invoice through the Receipts window. You can use this method either if the
customer pays you at the time of the sale or at a later date.

Applying receipts to an invoice
To apply a receipt to a customer invoice, begin by taking a look at the
Receipts window:
1. Choose Tasks➪Receipts to display the Receipts window.
The Receipts window appears as shown in Figure 8-1.
2. If necessary, enter a deposit ticket ID.
What appears in the Deposit Ticket ID field of the Receipts window
depends on your choice of method for generating these IDs in the Pay
Methods tab in the Customer Defaults dialog box (see Chapter 4). If you
opted for the Receipts window, Peachtree displays the current date; oth-
erwise this field is blank. If you leave the Deposit Ticket ID field blank,
Peachtree can automatically suggest deposit ticket IDs in the Select for
Deposit window. We recommend you leave the Deposit Ticket ID field
blank and let Peachtree assign a group of deposits together when you
actually make the bank deposit.
For more information about deposit ticket IDs, see “Laughing All the Way
to the Bank,” later in this chapter.
3. Select the customer ID.
If this customer has unpaid invoices, Peachtree lists them on the Apply
to Invoices tab. If the customer has no outstanding balance, Peachtree
displays the Apply to Revenues tab.
Figure 8-1:
Use the
Receipts
window to
record

received
from your
customers.
154
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Double-click any unpaid invoice to see the transaction details.
4. Enter a reference number in the Reference field that helps identify
the receipt.
You must enter a reference number, usually the customer’s check
number. If the receipt was transmitted electronically, you might enter
the electronic confirmation number or the date.
5. Enter the date of the receipt in the Date field.
Use this field to record the date you received the check, not the date on
the check.
6. Select a payment method: Cash, Check, Charge, and so on.
You set up payment methods in the Customer Defaults dialog box. You
can find out how to set customer defaults in Chapter 4. You can run
some reports based on payment methods. Chapter 14 shows you how to
filter reports.
If the customer is paying by credit card, you can store the credit card
information or use the Peachtree credit card service to process the
credit card. See “Handling Credit Card Receipts,” later in this chapter.
7. In the Cash Account field, verify the bank account into which you’re
depositing the receipt.
Always confirm the Cash account. Peachtree remembers which account
you last used in this window.
8. Select the check box in the Pay column beside each invoice being
paid by this receipt.
If the amount of the receipt doesn’t match the invoice amount, enter the
actual amount received in the Amount Paid column.
If, based on the customer terms, the invoice is eligible for a discount,
Peachtree automatically displays the discount amount. You can accept
that amount, delete it, or enter a different amount. If you offer — and the
customer took — discounts, verify the Discount account number at the
bottom of the window.
If the amount paid is less than the amount due, Peachtree assumes that
the customer still owes the difference. The next time you open the
Receipts window for the customer, Peachtree displays the remainder
due on the invoice.
If the amount paid is less than the amount due and you’re going to write
off the difference, enter the full amount of the invoice in the Amount
Paid field and then click the Apply to Revenues tab and enter a negative
amount for the amount you’re writing off. (Make sure the amount you’re
155
Chapter 8: Collecting the Money

writing off is not taxed.) Choose your write-off account for the GL
account. This process clears the invoice from A/R, posts the correct
amount to cash, and charges the unpaid balance on the invoice to the
write-off account.
If you’re not sure whether you’re going to write off an over- or underpay-
ment, go ahead and apply the actual amount received on the Apply to
Invoices tab. You can write a credit memo to your client later. See
“Giving Credit Where Credit Is Due,” later in this chapter.
If you don’t see a field to select the GL account, it means the field is
hidden. (See Bonus Chapter 1 on this book’s Web site for more informa-
tion about displaying the GL account fields.) You can click the Journal
button, as shown here in the margin, at the top of the window and enter
the account numbers you want to use.
If the amount paid is more than the invoice amount, Peachtree automati-
cally creates a credit balance against the specified invoice. The next
time you display the Receipts window for this customer, you see a credit
balance. If you’re going to absorb the overpayment (usually for small
amounts), click the appropriate check box in the Pay column, which
marks the invoice as paid in full. Then click the Apply to Revenues tab
and enter the overpayment amount as a positive number. This clears the
transaction from Accounts Receivable.
If you make a direct sale that doesn’t require an invoice, click the Apply
to Revenues tab and specify a Sales account and an amount. Optionally,
enter a quantity, item ID, or description.
The amount Peachtree displays in the Receipt Amount field should
match the total amount received from your customer.
9. Click the Save button, as shown in the margin, to record the receipt.
You could also click the Print button, as shown in the margin, to print a
receipt that you can give to your customer. Printing the receipt saves the
receipt.
The Receipts window also gives you a handy way to write off an entire
invoice as a bad debt. In the Receipts window, enter a unique reference
number that helps identify the receipt as a write-off. For example, we typi-
cally use the letters WO (for write-off) or BD (for bad debt) and the original
invoice number as the reference number (BD12345). Click the Cash Account
field to select the Bad Debt Expense account. Select the check box in the Pay
column for the invoice you want to write off as a bad debt and then click
Save. Peachtree clears the transaction from Accounts Receivable and
increases the Bad Debt Expense account. Be sure to change the Cash account
back to the regular Checking account before closing the window.
156
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Entering receipts from non-established
customers
Occasionally, you receive money from a customer you haven’t invoiced. Even
if the customer isn’t set up in your customer list, you can still record a
receipt. You can also use this procedure if you receive money from other
sources, such as a product rebate or utility deposit refund.
The procedure is the same as applying receipts to an invoice, except you
won’t enter a customer ID. Skip this field and enter the payer’s name in the
Name field. Because you haven’t entered an invoice, Peachtree displays the
Apply to Revenues tab. Select the Sales account (or expense account for a
refund), enter the receipt amount, and then click the Save button or the Print
button. Again, optionally, enter a quantity, item ID, or description.
Make sure the Tax type field shows the appropriate sales tax type.
Applying receipts at the time of sale
You can apply a receipt also by recording it at the time of sale as you create
the invoice. (You see how to create an invoice in Chapter 7.) Using this
method allows Peachtree to print the amount received on the invoice.
To apply a receipt at the time of the sale, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Tasks➪Sales/Invoicing window to display the invoice
window.
2. Create an invoice for the customer.
3. At the bottom of the invoice, click the Amount Paid at Sale arrow
button, as shown here in the margin, to display the Receive Payment
dialog box, as shown in Figure 8-2.
4. Enter the payment information.
Also, be sure to verify the Cash account into which you’re depositing the
money.
5. Click OK to close the Receive Payment dialog box.
6. Save or print the transaction. In this situation, you’re printing the 
customer invoice.
157
Chapter 8: Collecting the Money

Handling Credit Card Receipts
If your business accepts credit card payments from customers, you can enter
and track these transactions in Peachtree. Assuming (we know, there we go
assuming again) you have to wait for that time lapse before you receive the
money from the credit card financial institution, you can go ahead and record
the credit card transactions in Peachtree, but first you need the following items:
 A GL account in your Chart of Accounts to use for the credit card receiv-
able amount. Create an account in the Accounts Receivable area of your
Chart of Accounts, giving it an ID and a description to identify it, such as
Credit Cards Receivable. Choose Accounts Receivable as the account
type. If necessary, create additional accounts by using the same method.
(Chapter 3 shows you how to create accounts.)
 A vendor ID for the credit card financial institution that processes the
credit card transactions. This way, you can record and track processing
fee expenses.
To record a credit card transaction, you must follow two sets of steps — one
when the transaction occurs and another when you know that the credit card
financial institution has deposited the money in your account:
1. In the Receipts window or the Receive Payments window, record
receipt information but don’t save or print the transaction yet.
You can apply the customer credit card receipts to open invoices or to
revenue.
Use the techniques shown in the “Applying receipts to an invoice,”
“Entering receipts from non-established customers,” or “Applying
receipts at the time of sale” sections, earlier in this chapter. However,
you must use this exception: Enter the credit card receivable GL account
as the Cash account.
Figure 8-2:
Enter
receipt
information
in the
Receive
Payment
dialog box.
158
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

2. To keep the customer’s account accurate and up-to-date, record the
amount paid as the full amount of the credit card charge, regardless
of how the financial institution handles processing fees.
You enter the processing fees as an expense after your bank statement
arrives.
3. Click the Process Credit Card button, as shown in the margin.
The Credit Card Information window appears (see Figure 8-3). If you
stored the customer’s credit card information when you set up the cus-
tomer, the stored information automatically appears.
4. Enter the credit card number and other information pertaining to the
customer’s credit card, such as name and expiration date.
You can store default credit card information in the customer record.
See Chapter 7 for more on storing customer information.
5. If you subscribe to the Peachtree credit card service, click the
Authorize button, as shown in the margin, to connect with your online
merchant account provider.
When authorized, the provider automatically supplies the authorization
number. If you don’t subscribe to this service, enter the authorization
number manually in the Authorization Code field.
6. Click OK and then click either the Save button or the Print button, as
shown here in the margin.
After the credit card financial institution has notified you that the money has
been deposited into your account, you need to create another receipt that
transfers the funds from the credit card receivable account to your bank
account.
Figure 8-3:
You can
store the
credit card
information

159
Chapter 8: Collecting the Money

Create a receipt in the Receipts window just as you create any other
Peachtree receipt, with the following exceptions:
 Skip the Customer ID field and enter the credit card company name in
the Name field. Because you’re not using a customer ID, Peachtree auto-
matically displays the Apply to Revenues tab.
 On the line item GL Account field, enter the credit card receivable GL
account number.
 Enter the amount actually transferred to your account.
Laughing All the Way to the Bank
When you enter receipts, you decide whether to assign a deposit ticket ID or
let Peachtree assign one when you go to the bank. Peachtree lets you group
deposited items together by using the Select for Deposit window to greatly
speed up the bank reconciliation process.
What’s a deposit ticket ID, you ask? Well, Peachtree uses deposit ticket IDs to
make account reconciliation easier to manage. You should assign the same
deposit ticket ID to all transactions that you deposit on the same deposit
ticket. All receipts that use the same deposit ticket ID appear as one lump
sum in account reconciliation, making it easier for you to match the deposits
the bank records with the deposits you record in Peachtree. (See Chapter 16
for steps to use account reconciliation in Peachtree.)
More often than not, you receive checks daily and enter them into Peachtree
daily, but you don’t go to the bank until you accumulate several days’ worth
of checks. The following example lists five checks you receive on three differ-
ent days but want to lump together into a single bank deposit:
Date
Check Amount
March 16
$125.75
March 16
$28.41
March 17
$722.01
March 18
$549.10
March 18
$100.05
When you go to the bank, you make one deposit of $1,525.32, and that amount
appears on your bank statement. Although in Peachtree you have five differ-
ent receipts, assigning a single deposit ticket ID to these transactions makes
the deposit total of $1,525.32 appear in the Account Reconciliation window. If
each of these five transactions has its own unique deposit ticket ID, the
160
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Account Reconciliation window would list all five of them independently,
making it extremely difficult for you to match Peachtree deposits to the ones
listed on your bank statement. You’d have to sit and figure out which
Peachtree transactions add up to the ones listed on your bank statement. If
you have lots of receipts with separate deposit ticket IDs, you’d spend lots of
time trying to reconcile receipts to your bank statement. Therefore, we recom-
mend that you make your bank account reconciliation process easier by not
assigning a deposit ticket ID on the Receipts window.
You use the Select for Deposit window to combine multiple customer receipts
into a single bank deposit. To select receipts to include in a bank deposit,
follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Select for Deposit.
The Select for Deposit window appears, as shown in Figure 8-4. The
window displays the receipts that don’t yet have a deposit ticket ID
assigned.
To review, modify, or print an existing deposit, click the Open button, as
shown here in the margin. Existing deposits include receipts that already
have a deposit ticket ID associated with them. If you entered a deposit
ticket ID when you recorded the receipt, that ID appears in the Deposit
Ticket ID field.
2. If needed, select a different Cash account from the Account ID drop-
down list.
If you don’t see a receipt that you plan to deposit, you might have
entered a deposit ticket ID on the receipt or you might have entered a
different Cash account when you recorded the receipt. Edit the receipt
to make the correction so that you can include it with the deposit.
Figure 8-4:

161
Chapter 8: Collecting the Money

3. Enter the date on which you will make the deposit in the Deposit
Ticket Date field.
4. Enter or accept the currently suggested deposit ticket ID.
Peachtree maintains a numbering scheme based on the last deposit
ticket ID entered. Deposit ticket IDs can be alphanumeric and up to eight
characters. We recommend using the deposit date and -1, -2, and so on.
For example, 031507-1 would be the first deposit made on March 15.
5. Select the check box in the Deposit column next to the receipts you
want included in the current deposit or select all the receipts simulta-
neously by clicking the All button with the check mark, as shown here
in the margin.
If you want a receipt to appear as a separate transaction when you rec-
oncile your checking account, select it by itself as its own deposit. You
can find out more about account reconciliation in Chapter 16.
6. Click the Print button to print and save the deposit record, or click
the Save button, also shown in the margin, to save the deposit without
printing it.
Peachtree calls the form a deposit ticket, but it does not contain the bank
routing information needed to get the money into your account. You
might ask your bank whether you can simply attach the report to an
actual deposit slip to save you time and effort. It’s also helpful to print a
copy for your records and attach your bank receipt to it.
Boing! Handling Bounced Checks
One of those nasty facts of life, now and then, is that customers write bad
checks, sometimes by accident and sometimes not. In Peachtree, you handle
checks returned for nonsufficient funds (NSF) in two simple steps:
1. Create a new invoice to charge the customer the NSF fees.
2. Create a receipt and apply a negative amount for the same amount as
the original check.
For example, suppose the original (bounced) check is for $147.63. In the
example shown in Figure 8-5, we created an NSF invoice number, NSF
CK# 13942, for $20.00, which is the amount of the NSF fees. Then, in the
Receipts window, we apply a negative $147.63 (which represents the
original returned check amount) against the open invoice.
3. Click the Save button.
Peachtree updates the customer balance to reflect the money that the
customer once again owes against the original invoice and corrects your
bank account balance.
162
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Later, after your customer writes you a second check or instructs you to
redeposit the original check, you will have a second receipt for audit trail
purposes. If the customer writes a second check for the original amount plus
the NSF fee, Peachtree clears the invoice in full. If, however, the customer
instructs you to redeposit the original check, enter only the amount of the
check. After all, the customer still owes you the NSF fee.
We really hope you don’t have to use this section of our book.
Giving Credit Where Credit Is Due
Unfortunately, products are returned sometimes, or you need to make an
adjustment to a customer invoice. In these situations, you need to create a
credit memo to reduce the amount of money your customer owes.
If you owe money to a customer for overpayment or because you applied a
credit memo to an invoice, you can write a check to the customer for the
refund amount you owe.
Creating a credit memo
You can create a credit memo that refers to an unpaid original invoice, or 
you can create an open credit. Additionally, you can create credit memos for
Figure 8-5:
Create a

receipt to
adjust your
bank
balance.
163
Chapter 8: Collecting the Money

inventoried items or other goods or services. The following steps show you
how to use the Peachtree Credit Memo feature:
1. Choose Tasks➪Credit Memos to display the Credit Memos window.
2. Enter or select the customer ID.
After you select a customer, Peachtree fills in the customer name and
address. In the lower-left corner of the window, you can see the cus-
tomer’s current balance as of the system date. You can click the arrow
button next to the balance to display a Customer Ledger report of the
invoices and receipts that make up the balance.
3. Select a date and enter a Credit No.
For the Credit No., we suggest that you use the original invoice number
preceded or followed by CM to indicate credit memo. This numbering
scheme helps you tie the credit memo to a particular sale.
4. If the credit memo is for an unpaid customer invoice, click the arrow
to open the drop-down list on the Apply to Invoice No. tab. Then
select the invoice number to which you want to apply the credit
memo.
Peachtree fills in the lines that appear on the original invoice.
If you’re creating a credit memo for which there’s no existing invoice,
click the Apply to Sales tab and enter the information for the items to be
credited, including quantity, item, price, and (if applicable) job.
5. In the Returned field on each line of the Apply to Invoice No. tab, type
the quantity the customer returned.
Enter the returned quantity as a positive number. Peachtree under-
stands that this is a return (see Figure 8-6).
To quickly fill in the original transaction quantities, click the Return
button and then select All.
If the customer is returning inventory items, Peachtree automatically
restores the item quantities to inventory. If the inventory items are dam-
aged, the customer is probably not returning them. Go ahead and record
the credit memo, but don’t enter any item IDs. This gives the customer a
credit for the damaged goods, but does not bring them back into your
inventory.
If a line item was originally assigned to a job, Peachtree also assigns the
credit to the same job.
If the customer is returning serialized inventory items, click the Serial
Number button, as shown here in the margin, and then select the serial
numbers being returned.
164
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

If you charge the customer a restocking fee, click the Apply to Sales tab
and enter it as a negative dollar amount.
6. Click the Save button to save the transaction, or click the Print button
to print and save the credit memo.
Peachtree applies the credit memo to the open invoice and closes both
transactions. If you created a credit memo without applying it to an
invoice, the credit memo appears on the Aged Receivables report. Then,
when the time comes that the customer makes another purchase, you
can apply the open credit against the future invoice.
Issuing refund checks for a credit memo
If you owe money to a customer for an overpayment, an open credit, or some
other reason, you can write a check to the customer for the refund amount
owed.
Issuing a refund check is a two-part process. First, you write the check from
the Payments window, and then you apply the check to the credit memo or
overpayment in the Receipts window. This process is based on the assump-
tion that you already created a credit memo or applied the overpayment. See
the preceding section for more information.

Chapter 8: Collecting the Money

Follow these steps to issue a customer refund check:
1. Choose Tasks➪Payments to display the Payments window.
Click the arrow next to the ID and then select Customer ID, indicating
that the check goes to a customer rather than a vendor (see Figure 8-7).
3. Choose the customer ID of the customer receiving the refund.
Like with generating checks to vendors, don’t enter a check number if
Peachtree will be printing the check for you. Enter a check number only
if you’re writing checks by hand (heaven forbid).
4. Verify the check date and the Cash account from which you’re writing
the check.
5. On the Apply to Customer Account tab, enter a description for the
refund.
Entering a description helps you remember later, when you’re staring at
your check register trying to figure out why you wrote a check to a cus-
tomer, that you issued a refund.
6. In the line item section of the check, enter or select the GL account to
which you want to post the refund amount.
Typically, this is your Accounts Receivable account.

7. Enter the amount of the refund.
8. Click the Print button or the Save button.
For details on printing checks, see Chapter 6. If you’re not going to print
the check or you plan to print a batch of checks later, click the Save
button.
When you create a check to a customer, Peachtree applies it to the customer
account and it appears as a balance due from the customer. To complete 
the process, you need to apply the refund check to a credit memo or an 
overpayment.
1. Choose Tasks➪Receipts.
2. Select the customer ID.
The credit memo appears in the invoice listing, along with the refund
check.
3. Select the check box in the Pay column for both the credit memo and
refund check.
The amount of the receipt displays zero (0.00). Therefore, no money is
being applied to the General Ledger. See Figure 8-8.

4. Enter a receipt reference number in the Reference field, such as the
check number you wrote to the customer.
5. Click the Save button.
Both transactions are cleared from Accounts Receivable.
Entering Finance Charges
Sometimes you want to nudge your customers to pay their bills on time by
charging them a late fee or a finance charge if they pay later than the due
date. Peachtree can calculate finance charges for all customers who haven’t
been excluded from finance charge calculations and who meet the filter crite-
ria you determine when it’s time to apply the finance charges. Chapter 4
shows you how to set up your default finance charge terms.
168
Part II: The Daily Drudge 
How do finance charges work?
To whom does Peachtree charge finance
charges? Well, only customers with past due
balances who have a check mark in the Charge
Finance check box, mentioned in the preceding
paragraph. Okay, that’s obvious, but what other
criteria does Peachtree use? After all, if a cus-
tomer isn’t late paying, you don’t want to charge
a finance charge.
Peachtree calculates finance charges by using
the following formula for each overdue invoice:
Finance Charge = Number of
Days Past Due multiplied
by the Daily Rate
multiplied by the
Outstanding Invoice Amount
The formula uses these definitions:
 Daily Rate is the percentage you set divided
by 365 days.
 Outstanding Invoice Amount is the balance
remaining unpaid on the invoice.
 Number of Days Past Due is the number of
days between the date that you calculate
finance charges and one of the following:
 The invoice date, if aging is set to Invoice
Date in the Customer Defaults dialog box
 The due date, if aging is set to Due Date in
the Customer Defaults dialog box
 The date of the last finance charge 
calculation
To clarify these definitions, consider an exam-
ple: Suppose that today is July 15, and you want
to calculate charges for an invoice dated 5/1
(due 5/31) in the amount of $200.00. Your com-
pany charges an 18 percent finance charge for
invoices 30 days overdue. You age your cus-
tomer invoices by due date.
The invoice is overdue by 44 days (from May 31
to July 15):
(.18/365) x 44 x 200.00 = 4.34
The .18/365 is the annual percentage rate
divided by 365 days. Multiply that by the 44 days
the invoice is past due, and then multiply that
times the $200.00 invoice amount. Therefore, a
finance charge applied on 7/15 would be $4.34.
100 235
500

83

If you don’t want to charge finance charges to certain customers, you must alter
the default terms for those customers. In the Maintain Customers/Prospects
window, click the Payment & Credit tab. Then click the arrow, as shown in the
margin, next to the Terms and Credit field and then select Customize Terms
for This Customer. Then deselect the Charge Finance check box.
Applying finance charges
Okay, now that you understand how the finance charge process works, you
can actually apply the charges.
When you decide to apply a finance charge, Peachtree creates but does not
print an invoice for the amount due. The charges do appear on customer
statements, so you need to apply finance charges before you print customer
statements:
1. Choose Tasks➪Finance Charge to display the Calculate Finance
Charges dialog box.
2. (Optional) Select a range of customers for whom you want to calculate
finance charges.
If you leave the customer range blank, Peachtree assumes you want to
calculate charges on all eligible customers (by way of the Charge
Finance check box and past due balances).
3. Enter the date you want Peachtree to use to calculate finance charges
and then click OK.
The Apply Finance Charges dialog box shown in Figure 8-9 appears.
4. If you’d like to review the finance charges before Peachtree applies
them, select No under Apply Finance Charges. If you’d prefer to just
go ahead and apply the charges, select Yes under Apply Finance
Charges.
5. Select a Report Destination (Screen or Printer), and then click OK.
The Finance Charge Report Selection dialog box appears. You don’t have
to print the report, but we recommend that you do.
6. Click OK to print the report in detail.
7. If you elected to review the charges before Peachtree applied them,
repeat Steps 1–6, but select Yes in Step 4.
Peachtree applies the finance charges to the customer.
169
Chapter 8: Collecting the Money

Peachtree generates the finance charges by creating an invoice to the cus-
tomer by using a reference number that begins with the letters FC (for
finance charge). Peachtree uses that transaction when recalculating finance
charges. Therefore, never enter a customer invoice with a reference number
that begins with FC and don’t change the reference numbers for the
Peachtree-generated finance charge invoices.
Producing Statements
Before you print statements the first time, you might want to determine state-
ment default preferences. Refer to Chapter 4 on how to set statement default
options.
To print statements, follow these steps:
1. Choose Reports & Forms➪Forms➪Customer Statements.
Peachtree considers a statement a form. See Chapter 13 for information
on customizing forms.
2. In the Forms section, click the statement form you want to use and
then click the Preview and Print button, as shown in the margin.
The Preview and Print Customer Statements dialog box, as shown in
Figure 8-10, appears.

3. Select any of the following options from the Statement dialog box:
• Statement Type: On balance forward statements, only the balances
left over from previous statements appear, similar to the way infor-
mation appears on a credit card bill. On open items, the detail for
all open (unpaid) items appears. Read Chapter 4 for information on
setting a default statement type.
• Include Items: Select a range of transaction dates for which you
want to print the statement.
• Through: Select the latest transaction date you want to print on
the statements.
• Print Detail For: Choose to print or not print the line item detail
information for invoices, credit memos, and receipts. If you don’t
select the line item detail option, the customer sees a single line
entry for each transaction, making the statement much easier 
to read.
• Use This Form: If you selected the wrong statement form in Step 2,
you can click this option and select a different form.
• Filter Customers By: Filter a customer range by specific customer
IDs or types. You can also choose the Delivery Method option,
which lets you choose how you want to deliver forms to the
defined range of customers: as paper copies only, as e-mail attach-
ments only, or as both paper copies and e-mail attachments. If you
choose either E-mail or Both, the E-mail tab becomes available, let-
ting you set up more form delivery options. See Chapter 13 for
details on printing and e-mailing forms.

Chapter 8: Collecting the Money

Peachtree displays a list of clients who could receive statements based
on your settings. You can deselect the check box next to any client to
whom you don’t want to send a statement.
5. Click Print/E-mail.
After the statements finish printing, Peachtree asks you whether the state-
ments printed correctly and whether it’s OK to update customer records. If
you click Yes, Peachtree stores the statement date in the customer record to
use it as the balance forward date the next time you print statements. If you
click No or Cancel after printing statements, Peachtree does not update cus-
tomer records and maintains no record of having printed a statement. That
means Peachtree continues to list invoices as open items on any statement
you print. If you’re using balance forward statements, it’s therefore important
that you click Yes after statements print successfully.
Reporting on Money Your Customers Owe
Although Peachtree can’t guarantee that you make a profit every month, it
does give you some ways to show you (or your investors) your various finan-
cial reports. We’re sure you like to track the money you’re taking in so that
you can plan your budget or keep your banker happy. So, in Table 8-1, we pro-
vide a description of the reports that pertain to collecting your money.

Paid Employees Are 
Happy Employees
In This Chapter
 Setting up employee defaults
 Writing and printing payroll checks
 Paying commissions or bonuses
T
hey call it work for a reason, some people say. And we can’t think of too
many people who are willing to work without being paid. If you aren’t
using an outside payroll service, you might want to consider using the
Peachtree payroll features.
The Peachtree payroll features mimic the functions you perform when you
prepare payroll checks by hand. However, after you set up basic background
information for each employee (yes, you still need to know the employee’s
gross wages and number of exemptions), we think that preparing payroll in
Peachtree is much easier and faster than preparing payroll checks manually.
You don’t need to look up payroll taxes in the Circular E flyer, also known as
IRS Publication 15; you don’t need to remember which employees have vari-
ous deductions; and you don’t need to subtract the taxes and deductions to
determine the net payroll check. Furthermore, you don’t need to keep track of
the payroll tax liability amounts that you, as the employer, must pay. Also, if
you allow Peachtree to print the checks, you don’t need to write them. In this
chapter, we show you how to set up your employees and produce paychecks.
Even if you prepare payroll in Peachtree, you’re going to have questions
about handling various situations. The Circular E booklet that you get from
the government every December is your bible for payroll questions. If you
don’t get a Circular E in the mail, you can download one from www.irs.gov/
publications/p15. If you don’t understand the Circular E, contact your
accountant. If you don’t understand your accountant, hire a new one.

174
Part II: The Daily Drudge 
If you use an outside payroll service, you might want to consider using the
Peachtree payroll features to keep your General Ledger up to date. That way,
you can accurately report your company’s financial picture. If your outside
payroll service provides you with journal entries, you can ignore the
Peachtree payroll features and simply enter the journal entries (see Chapter
17). However, if your outside payroll service doesn’t provide you with journal
entries, you might want to use the Peachtree payroll features to mimic the
payroll process and match your records with theirs.
Understanding Payroll Basics
Before you start setting up employees and paying them, you really need to
consider some basic information:
 Whom you pay
 When you should start using payroll in Peachtree
Peachtree uses payroll tax tables to calculate the amounts you deduct for
taxes (federal income tax, Social Security, Medicare, and so on). Sage
Software, the company that produces Peachtree, does not ship tax tables that
calculate federal taxes with the software. To accurately calculate payroll, you
must either subscribe to the Peachtree Payroll Tax Update service or create
your own tax tables. To order tax table updates, visit the Peachtree Web site,
www.peachtree.com, or call 877-231-3761.
Employees and sales representatives
In this chapter, we’re talking about paying people who work for you. You can
rule out vendors for this discussion. Vendors don’t work for you — they just
provide you with goods or services. You pay vendors from the Payments,
Write Checks, or Select for Payment window, as we describe in Chapter 6.
Both employees and sales representatives work for you. As you see in this
chapter, you pay employees from the Select for Payroll window or the Payroll
Entry window. Although employees are always employees, sales reps might
be employees or independent contractors. The windows in Peachtree that
you use to pay sales reps depend on their employment status: employee or
independent contractor.
If you’re uncertain about an individual’s status, check the IRS Web site at
www.irs.gov/publications/p15a or check with your accountant. The
individual’s status is important to the federal government, and choosing the
wrong status can cause you trouble that you just don’t need.

Employees work for you, so, in this chapter, we’re talking about them. And
sales representatives who are also employees work for you, so we’re talking
about them as well. We aren’t talking about sales representatives whom you
treat as independent contractors; you pay them as 1099 vendors from the
Payments window or the Select for Payments window. See Chapter 5 for infor-
mation on designating a vendor as a 1099 vendor. See Chapter 6 for informa-
tion on paying vendors.
Most sales reps, whether they’re employees or independent contractors,
earn commissions. If you want to track commissions in order to make paying
sales reps easier, you need to specifically identify sales reps in Peachtree.
Interestingly, Peachtree has you set up a sales representative in the same
window where you set up employees even though the sales representative
might be an independent contractor and not an employee.
Being the logical individual that you are, you ask, “If a sales rep isn’t an
employee, why should I set up a sales rep in the same window where I set up
employees?” Peachtree has you set up sales reps in the Maintain Employees
& Sales Reps window for two related reasons:
 If you set up sales representatives in the Maintain Employees & Sales
Reps window, you can include the sales rep on invoices.
 If you include a sales rep on an invoice, you can produce the Sales Rep
report, which shows commissioned and noncommissioned sales
amounts per sales rep.
Including a sales rep on an invoice does not automatically generate a commis-
sion amount for the sales rep. The inventory items sold on the invoice must
be subject to commission. In the “Writing and Printing Payroll Checks” sec-
tion, we tell you how to pay sales representatives who are also employees. In
the “Determining commission amounts” section, you see a sample of the
Sales Rep report. See Chapter 7 for more information about including sales
representatives on invoices. See Chapter 11 for information on making an
inventory item subject to commission.
When should you start to use payroll?
You can start using payroll at any time during a calendar year, but you might
find it easiest to start using payroll on January 1. If you start using payroll on
January 1, you won’t have to enter any beginning balance information —
information to account for paychecks that you already produced this year
that need to be included on payroll tax forms and W-2s at the end of the year.
If you can’t start using payroll on January 1, try to start on the first day of
any payroll quarter: January 1, April 1, July 1, or October 1. Payroll tax laws
require that you file payroll tax returns quarterly, and you need to include
175
Chapter 9: Paid Employees Are Happy Employees

information for only the current quarter. If you start using payroll at the
beginning of a quarter, you can enter beginning balance information as lump
sums for each quarter of the current year in which you produced payroll
checks.
As a final resort, if you can’t start using payroll on the first day of any payroll
quarter, start using payroll on the first day of a month. You need to enter
beginning balance information for the other months in the current payroll
quarter, but you can enter quarterly amounts for other payroll quarters of
the current year in which you produced payroll checks.
Working with Employee Information
In Chapter 4, we show you how the Payroll Wizard walks you through setting
up default payroll information for your company. After the default informa-
tion is in place, you need to set up your employees, establishing individual-
ized information for each of them. For example, different employees claim
different withholding exemptions. And some employees might participate 
in a company retirement plan whereas others do not. Or some might receive 
a health insurance benefit. To set up employees, choose Maintain➪
Employees/Sales Reps. Peachtree displays the General tab of the Maintain
Employees & Sales Reps window (see Figure 9-1).
Figure 9-1:
Just as 
you might
expect, you
supply

information

tab here.
176
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

At the top of the window — not associated with any of the tabs in the window —
you assign an ID and type in a name. You also can select the Inactive check
box after an employee leaves the company to avoid accidentally generating a
paycheck.
If you need to change an employee’s ID, click the Change ID button, as shown
here in the margin.
You can set up each person as an employee, a sales rep, or both. Typically,
you deduct payroll taxes for employees, and you don’t deduct payroll taxes
for sales representatives. If you select Sales Rep, three of the five tabs in the
window become gray, and the individual doesn’t appear in the Payroll win-
dows when you’re paying employees. Choose Both if the individual is both a
sales representative and an employee.
We discuss each of the five tabs of the Maintain Employees & Sales Reps
window individually.
General employee information
You use the General tab (refer to Figure 9-1) of the Maintain Employees &
Sales Reps window to give Peachtree general information about each
employee, such as the employee’s name, address, and Social Security
number. (You need those when you produce W-2s at the end of the year.) You
also can supply the employee’s telephone number, date of hire, and e-mail
address.
Peachtree provides the Type field to give you a way to group employees. If
your company pays workers’ compensation insurance, you might want to
store the workers’ compensation categories in the Type field to make it
easier to produce a report that helps you pay your workers’ compensation
liability.
Customizable fields appear at the bottom of the General tab, and you can
type the appropriate information for the employee in each field. Custom field
information is optional.
Below the Terminated drop-down list, you see the Employee Beginning
Balances button. Click this button if you start payroll on any day other than
January 1 and you already produced paychecks in the current year. Peachtree
displays the Employee Beginning Balances window (see Figure 9-2).
177
Chapter 9: Paid Employees Are Happy Employees

Use the fields in this window to enter the payroll amounts you already paid
this year before you started using Peachtree. Each column represents a pay
period that you specify: a week, a biweekly or semimonthly pay period, a
month, a quarter, or even multiple quarters. For example, suppose that you
want to start entering payroll as of July 1, which is the beginning of the third
payroll quarter. In the Employee Beginning Balances window, you can enter
one column of numbers that represents the sum of all the payroll amounts you
paid for the first six months (two quarters) of the year for each payroll field.
Although you can enter amounts for each pay period, we don’t recommend
that approach because it’s cumbersome and time consuming.
At the top of each column you intend to use, right-click to display a calendar
and then select the ending date of the timeframe represented by the
amounts. Then, in the fields below the date, type the appropriate amounts for
each payroll field, entering deductions as negative amounts and earnings as
positive amounts. Based on the information in Figure 9-2, we’re starting pay-
roll on May 1. In the first column, we include the quarterly amount for the
first quarter of the year. In the second column, we include the monthly
amount for April, the first month of the second quarter.
Click the Save button and the Close button (both, as shown here) after you
finish, and Peachtree redisplays the Maintain Employees & Sales Reps
window.
Payroll information
On the Pay Info tab of the Maintain Employees & Sales Reps window (see
Figure 9-3), you tell Peachtree the method and frequency you use to pay the
employee.
Figure 9-2:
Record
amounts for
paychecks

178
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

You can pay your employees by using any of five frequencies:
 Weekly
 Biweekly
 Semimonthly
 Monthly
 Annually
You don’t need to pay all your employees by using the same frequency; that
is, you can pay some employees weekly, some biweekly, and some monthly.
The choice is yours. Most companies tend to pay all employees at the same
time, but Peachtree doesn’t make you operate that way.
Pay methods tell Peachtree how to calculate wages. Open the Pay Method
drop-down list to choose Salary, Hourly – Hours per Pay Period, or Hourly –
Time Ticket Hours:
 Salary: Pay your employees a flat rate, regardless of the number of
hours they work in a pay period.
 Hourly – Hours per Pay Period: Pay your employees based on hours
they work in a pay period.
 Hourly – Time Ticket Hours: Pay your employees for hours they work in
a pay period as recorded on time tickets they submit.
Figure 9-3:
Tell
Peachtree
how often

179
Chapter 9: Paid Employees Are Happy Employees

You use time tickets when you intend to bill your customers for the time that
your employees or your vendors work on projects for them. You can, but
don’t have to, pay employees based on the time tickets they submit. To find
out more about this pay method, see Chapter 10.
If you choose Hourly – Hours Per Pay Period, Peachtree displays the standard
number of hours associated with the frequency you select:
 Frequency: Standard hours
 Weekly: 40
 Biweekly: 80
 Semimonthly: 88
 Monthly: 176
 Annually: 2112
You can change the value that appears in the Hours Per Pay Period field. For
example, you can set the number of hours to zero to ensure that you don’t
accidentally pay an employee for time not worked.
You indicate the amount, per pay period, that you want to pay the employee.
In Figure 9-3, we’re paying the employee time-and-a-half for overtime and
double-time for special occasions (maybe holidays). For salaried employees,
you typically don’t see an Overtime field, but you do see the employee’s
annual salary as well as the salary amount for each pay period.
If you plan to use time tickets to bill your customers for the time an employee
works on projects — even if you don’t pay the employee based on time 
tickets — supply an amount in the Rate Used to Bill Customer field.
Peachtree Premium and higher users can track an employee’s raise history.
Click the Raise History button, and Peachtree displays a dialog box where
you can record the following:
 The raise date
 The pay rate to which the raise applies (Regular, Overtime, or Special for
hourly employees; or Salary, Bonus, or Commission for salaried employees
in our sample company).
 The base amount associated with that pay rate and either the raise
amount or the raise percentage (you enter one and Peachtree calculates
the other).
 Any notes you might want to make about the raise. For example, you
might want to note that the raise was based on the employee’s annual
performance review or was an out-of-cycle raise because of the ongoing
stellar performance of the employee.
180
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

The window also shows the calculated new amount for that pay rate, but
Peachtree doesn’t change the amount that appears on the Pay Info tab. You
must make that change manually.
Withholding information
On the Withholding Info tab, you provide — you guessed it — tax-withholding
information, such as the employee’s marital status and the number of exemp-
tions he or she claims for federal, state, and local withholding (see Figure 9-4).
You also can supply additional federal, state, and local withholding amounts
as appropriate, along with the 401(k) deduction percentage if the employee
contributes to a company 401(k) plan. Enter the 401(k) deduction amount as
a positive percentage — for example, to enter 4 percent, as shown in Figure 9-4,
enter 4.0.
Peachtree reserves the Special 1 and Special 2 fields for you to use in payroll
tax formulas where a value in the calculation is unique for each employee.
Don’t forget to select the Employee Has Retirement Plan Such as a Simple
IRA, 401(k), 403(b), Etc. check box if your employee participates in a 401(k)
or other retirement plan. Select the Statutory Employee check box if IRS
guidelines qualify the employee as an employee based on the law. Four cate-
gories of independent contractors qualify by law as employees. If you don’t
know or aren’t sure whether you have independent contractors whom you
must, by law, treat as employees, ask your accountant.

Chapter 9: Paid Employees Are Happy Employees

Employee and Employer fields
You really need to understand only one aspect of the Employee Fields tab of
the Maintain Employees & Sales Reps window. You use that tab to indicate
anything about the employee that doesn’t follow the payroll defaults you set
up for the company as we describe in Chapter 4.
For example, you might change the GL account to send wages to a different
account than the default account. Or, if an employee doesn’t participate in
the company’s dental plan, deselect the check box in the Use Defaults
column. If a check appears in the Calc column, deselect it as well. You dese-
lect the check box in the Use Defaults column so that Peachtree allows you to
deselect the check box in the Calc column. What’s the Calc column? Well,
when you select a check box in the Calc column, Peachtree expects to use a
payroll tax table to calculate the amount for the field. You deselect the check
box in the Calc column under two conditions:
 When you’re not going to use a calculation to figure the amount for the
employee, but want to supply a fixed amount in the Amount column
instead
 When you don’t want to calculate the field for the employee
If the employee’s calculation is different from the calculation used by default
for all employees, and you deselect the check box in the Use Defaults column
but don’t deselect the check box in the Calc column, you can select a differ-
ent calculation for the employee. Simply click in the Tax Name column to use
the lookup list.
If you don’t intend to calculate the field for the employee, you must deselect
the check boxes in both the Use Defaults column and the Calc column.
Otherwise, Peachtree still calculates an amount based on the formula in the
payroll tax table.
The Employee Fields tab and the Employer Fields tab in the Maintain Employees
& Sales Reps window closely resemble the same tabs in the Employee Defaults
dialog box. That makes sense because Peachtree gets the information it dis-
plays in the Maintain Employees & Sales Reps window from the information
you enter in the Employee Defaults dialog box.
The Employer Fields tab, like the Employee Fields tab, is used to indicate any-
thing about the employer fields that doesn’t follow the defaults you set up for
the company.

Writing and Printing Payroll Checks
Now you come to the part that your employees like most — the part where
you produce paychecks. You can pay employees en masse or one at a time;
we walk you through both methods. Typically, you pay groups of employees
at the same time, so we think you can make more use of the group method.
We recommend that you let Peachtree print paychecks for you. You can save
lots of time and reduce the possibility of introducing errors because you
won’t be typing in information.
In this section, we show you how to produce and print paychecks and how to
pay commissions and bonuses — two other common payroll needs.
Paying a group of employees
Paying a group of employees is similar to paying a group of vendors. If you
write your checks by hand or use an outside payroll service, plan to print the
paychecks that Peachtree produces on plain paper because Peachtree posts
the information to the General Ledger when you print the checks.

Chapter 9: Paid Employees Are Happy Employees
Using the Direct Deposit service
For an additional fee, Peachtree supports use of
a direct deposit solution in all versions of
Peachtree except Peachtree First Accounting.
With direct deposit, you still create paychecks
in Peachtree the same way that we describe in
this chapter, identifying employees who partic-
ipate in direct deposit as you create the pay-
checks. You don’t actually print the paychecks
to give to employees; instead, through the
Direct Deposit service, money is electronically
transferred from your bank account to each
employee’s bank account on payday. You can
print a stub for your employees as you create
the paychecks. With the Direct Deposit service,
employees can select one or more bank
accounts into which money can be deposited.
Employees can identify fixed amounts or per-
centages to deposit to each account. Directly
deposited paychecks appear in the Account
Reconciliation window in lump sums that should
match your bank statements. Checks processed
through the Direct Deposit service become
read-only in Peachtree, and you cannot edit
them. For more information or to sign up for
Direct Deposit, visit www.peachtree.com.

Follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Select for Payroll Entry.
Peachtree displays the Select Employees – Filter Selection dialog box, as
shown in Figure 9-5, so that you can select the majority of employees
you want to pay.
Try to make the selection include everyone you want to pay even if the
selection includes more people than you intend to pay. After you make
choices in this dialog box, you have another opportunity to exclude
employees.
2. From the Pay End Date field, select the date that represents the last
day of the pay period.
3. In the Include Pay Frequencies section, select all the check boxes that
represent the pay frequencies that you want to include.
For example, include employees that you pay weekly. As shown in the
dialog box, you can include all pay frequencies. If you don’t have any
monthly or annual employees, you can leave the check boxes selected
without affecting anything.
4. In the Include Pay Methods section, choose to pay hourly employees,
salaried employees, or both.
5. Use the Include Employees section to limit the range of employees 
you pay.
If you want to pay all employees who meet the other criteria you estab-
lish in this dialog box, simply choose All Employees. Otherwise, in the
From field, select the first employee you want to include. Then, in the To
field, select the last employee you want to include.
Figure 9-5:
Identify the
employees
you want 
to pay.
184
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

We suggest that you include all employees because you have another
opportunity in the next window to exclude an employee.
If you enabled direct deposit, the Employees drop-down list contains
two additional choices besides All and Range; you see Direct Deposit
Only and Manual Check Only.
6. Click OK.
Peachtree displays the Select Employees to Pay window (see Figure 9-6).
If you don’t like the selection you see, click the Select toolbar button (as
shown here) to redisplay the Select Employees – Filter Selection dialog
box (refer to Figure 9-5).
The Select Employees to Pay window has some options you should keep
in mind:
 You can avoid paying an employee by deselecting the check box in the
Pay column.
 You can change the Cash account from which the checks are written by
using the Cash Acct field in the upper right of the window.
 An asterisk next to an employee’s name signifies that you set up the
employee’s pay method as Hourly – Time Ticket Hours, and that the
employee’s paycheck is based on the number of time ticket hours in the
current pay period. Find out more about time tickets in Chapter 10.
 If you enabled direct deposit, you see an extra column AD to the right of
the Pay column in the Select Employees to Pay window. A red check
mark in this column identifies employees who are set up to use direct
deposit. You can remove the check mark, but you cannot add a check
mark to anyone who isn’t set up to use direct deposit.

Chapter 9: Paid Employees Are Happy Employees

 You can change the number of hours worked for hourly employees or
the salary amount for salaried employees by clicking in those columns
and typing. Peachtree recalculates the taxes and net check amount.
 You can change the number of weeks in the pay period. Typically, you
see 1, 2, 12, or 52 in the #Weeks column; these numbers indicate the fre-
quency with which you pay each employee (weekly, biweekly or semi-
monthly, monthly, or annually). Changing the number of weeks in the
pay period affects the pay period beginning date on the paycheck stub.
Peachtree calculates the beginning date by subtracting the number of
weeks from the pay period ending date.
You can print the pay period beginning date on a paycheck stub. You
need to customize the payroll check form to add the field. See Chapter
13 for information on customizing forms.
Viewing the details
You can view and make changes to the details of any employee’s check. Click
the employee and then click the Detail button on the toolbar. Peachtree dis-
plays the Select Employees to Pay – Detail window. After you finish viewing or
changing details, click OK to redisplay the Select Employees to Pay window.
Don’t change Social Security or Medicare amounts. If you do, you’ll find dis-
crepancies on your payroll tax reports, and the 941 quarterly payroll tax
return won’t be accurate. You can, however, change the federal income tax
and state income tax amounts with no side effects. Make changes to the
hours/salary first and the taxes second; if you make the changes in the oppo-
site order, Peachtree recalculates the taxes and ignores your tax changes.
Allocating time to jobs
If you use jobs and want to allocate an employee’s time to various jobs,
follow the steps in “Paying a group of employees” to display the Select
Employees to Pay window. Then follow these steps:
For more information on jobs, see Chapter 12.
1. In the Select Employees to Pay window, click the employee.
2. Click the Jobs button, as shown here in the margin, to display the
Labor Distribution to Jobs window (see Figure 9-7).
3. Click in a blank field in the Job column to display a lookup list button
and then select a job.
4. In the Hourly Field column, select the type of pay you want to allocate:
Regular, Overtime, or Special.
5. In the Hours column, assign hours to that job.
Peachtree assigns the hours to the selected job and adjusts the unas-
signed hours accordingly.
186
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

6. Repeat Steps 3–5 as needed to continue distributing hours or dollars.
7. Click OK after you finish to redisplay the Select Employees to Pay
window.
If you’re distributing labor for a salaried employee: you select a type of Salary
Field instead of a type of Hourly Field in Step 4; and you enter dollars, not
hours, in Step 5.
Listing the checks that you plan to print
Wouldn’t it be nice to know how many checks Peachtree is planning to print?
(You might have noticed that you don’t see that number in the window any-
place.) Well, if you click the drop-down arrow on the Print button and then
click Report (both, as shown here), Peachtree prints a report that shows you
the details of checks you’re printing. At the end of the report, you also find
the number of checks you’re printing. To preview checks on-screen, click the
drop-down arrow on the Print button and then choose Preview. See Chapter
13 for details on printing forms. (Checks are considered forms in Peachtree.)
Printing checks
If you click the Print button (not the drop-down arrow beside the Print
button) in the Select Employees to Pay window, Peachtree displays the Print
Forms: Payroll Checks window. From this window, you can confirm (or
change) the first check number, select a check form, identify the number of
copies to print of each check, and select a printer.
If you click the Print Sample button, you can print practice checks to see Xs
and 9s on the form where words and numbers will appear. Click the Print
Figure 9-7:

button, and Peachtree prints the checks and displays a dialog box asking you
to confirm that the checks printed properly. Click Yes to post the checks; click
No if you need to reprint the checks for any reason — such as a printer jam.
Paying employees individually
If you need to pay only one or two employees, use the Payroll Entry window
and follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Payroll Entry.
Peachtree displays the Payroll Entry window (see Figure 9-8).
2. Use the lookup list button (as shown here) next to the Employee ID
field to select an employee to pay.
Peachtree fills in the employee’s regular payroll information.
On the left side of the window, Peachtree displays pay level information,
such as hours worked or salary amount. On the right of the window,
Peachtree displays payroll fields (such as the employee’s taxes and
deductions) as well as other payroll liabilities you incur (such as federal
unemployment tax).
Figure 9-8:

Part II: The Daily Drudge 

3. If necessary, change the information.
Set the Pay Period Ends date and the Cash Account.
If an hourly employee doesn’t work all the hours in the pay period,
adjust the number of hours on the left of the window.
Don’t change Social Security or Medicare amounts. If you do, you’ll find
discrepancies on your payroll tax reports, and the 941 quarterly payroll
tax return won’t be accurate. You can, however, change the federal
income tax and state income tax amounts with no side effects. Make
changes to the hours/salary first and the taxes second; if you make the
changes in the opposite order, Peachtree recalculates the taxes and
ignores your tax changes.
4. To assign the employee’s hours to a job, click the Jobs button (as
shown here) at the top of the screen.
For details, see “Allocating time to jobs,” earlier in this chapter.
5. Click the Print button, as shown in the margin, to print the check.
Peachtree displays the Print Forms: Payroll Checks window.
You can preview checks before printing them from the Payroll Entry
window by clicking the drop-down arrow on the Print button and choos-
ing Preview. In the Print Forms: Payroll Checks window, click Print
Preview.
Don’t assign a check number before clicking the Print button. If you do,
Peachtree prints “Duplicate” on the check because it assumes you
already wrote the check. Leave the Check Number field blank, and
Peachtree assigns the check number to the check when you print it.
Read Chapter 13 to find out how to eliminate the Duplicate message.
6. Confirm (or change) the first check number, select a check form, iden-
tify the number of copies to print of each check, and then select a
printer.
For details on selecting and printing a form, see Chapter 13. If you click
the Print Sample button, you can print practice checks to see Xs and 9s
on the form where words and numbers will appear.
7. Click the Print button.
Peachtree prints and posts the checks, updating the employee’s record
and the General Ledger.
If you don’t print checks — say, because you’re entering after-the-fact
payroll information provided by a payroll service — you can click the
Save button to save the check. If you save the check instead of printing
it, assign it a check number.

Chapter 9: Paid Employees Are Happy Employees

Paying commissions, bonuses, 
or other additions
Many companies pay employees bonuses at the end of the year. And employ-
ees who act as sales representatives usually earn commissions. It might seem
strange to you that we’re talking about two different situations in the same
breath, but Peachtree handles both situations the same way. In fact, you can
use the technique we show you here to handle any form of additional lump-
sum income that you must pay through payroll, such as jury duty or mater-
nity leave. We refer to these lump-sum income amounts as payroll additions.
Setting up payroll addition items
You can use a pay level to record a bonus or commission, but we recommend
that you use the technique we describe here for three reasons:
 You can control whether to include the payroll addition in gross pay
when calculating payroll taxes or other payroll fields, such as retirement
contributions. (Peachtree automatically includes pay levels in gross pay
when calculating payroll fields.)
 The payroll addition appears as a separate item on payroll reports,
making the payroll addition easier to track.
 Setting up a payroll addition item is less work than setting up a pay
level.
Follow these steps to set up a payroll addition item for commissions:
1. Choose Maintain➪Default Information➪Employees.
Peachtree displays the Employee Defaults dialog box.
2. Click the EmployEE Fields tab and scroll down to find a blank line.
3. In the Field Name column, type the name of the payroll addition.
The name you use appears on the paycheck stub.
4. Assign the line to a General Ledger account — usually your Wage
Expense account.
Because commissions (and bonuses, jury duty pay, maternity leave pay, and
so on) vary from employee to employee, you don’t select a check box in the
Calc column and create a payroll tax table to calculate the amount. You also
don’t need to supply an amount in the Amount column. You need to tell
Peachtree only whether to include additional pay when Peachtree calculates
gross wages for each tax. For example, you might want Peachtree to include
commission pay in gross wages when calculating FIT, Social Security, and
Medicare. At the same time, you might want Peachtree to exclude commission
pay in gross wages when calculating a pension plan deduction.
190
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Suppose that you want Peachtree to include additional pay in gross wages
when calculating federal income tax. Follow these steps:
1. If you closed the Employee Defaults dialog box from the preceding set
of steps, choose Maintain➪Default Information➪Employees.
2. On the EmployEE Fields tab, scroll up to find the Federal Income Tax
entry.
It’s probably called Fed_Income.
3. In the Adjust column, click the button beside Fed_Income.
Peachtree displays the Calculate Adjusted Gross dialog box (see 
Figure 9-9).
4. If necessary, scroll down in the EmployEE Field Names area on the left
side of the dialog box until you see Commission.
5. Select the check box in the Use column next to Commission to have
Peachtree add commission pay to gross wages before calculating fed-
eral income tax.
If you’re not sure whether you want Peachtree to include a payroll addi-
tion when calculating adjusted gross wages, ask your accountant.
6. Click OK to redisplay the Employee Defaults dialog box.
You need to repeat these steps for each payroll field for which the calcu-
lation of adjusted gross wages should include the payroll addition — at a
minimum, Social Security and Medicare.
Figure 9-9:

amounts

191
Chapter 9: Paid Employees Are Happy Employees

If you adjust the gross wage calculation for Social Security and Medicare,
be sure that you click the Adjust button for these payroll fields on both
the EmployEE Fields tab and the EmployER Fields tab.
7. Click OK to close the Employee Defaults dialog box.
You can include an employee’s commission (or bonus or other addition) on
his or her paycheck. Simply fill in the amount in the field when you create the
paycheck, and Peachtree adjusts appropriate taxes, based on settings you
established in the various Calculate Adjusted Gross dialog boxes.
Don’t change the Social Security or Medicare amounts on paychecks. If you
do, you might find discrepancies on your payroll tax reports and the 941
quarterly payroll tax return won’t be accurate. You can, however, change the
federal income tax and state income tax amounts on paychecks with no side
effects.
The W-2 form and commissions
If you want, you can show commissions in Box 14 on the W-2. The assignment
is optional; that is, Peachtree includes the commission wages in Boxes 1
(gross wages), 3 (Social Security wages), and 5 (Medicare wages) automati-
cally. Showing the wages in Box 14 simply identifies the component of Gross
Wages (Box 1) that were commissions.
To include commissions in Box 14, follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Default Information➪Employees.
Peachtree displays the General tab of the Employee Defaults dialog box.
2. Click the W-2s button.
Peachtree displays the Assign Payroll Fields for W-2s dialog box (see
Figure 9-10).

3. In the text box next to number 14, type the name of the payroll field.
4. From the drop-down list, select the appropriate field to print in Box 14.
In the example, we use Commission.
5. Click OK twice to save the changes.
Determining commission amounts
With respect to commissions, one burning question pops immediately to
mind: How do you know how much commission to pay an employee?
When you produce an invoice that contains items that are subject to commis-
sion and you assign a sales rep to the invoice, the Peachtree Sales Rep report
shows you the commissioned sales for each sales rep. Choose Reports &
Forms➪Accounts Receivable. From the Report List on the right, select Sales
Rep Reports. You can print this report (see Figure 9-11) for any date range.
See Chapter 7 for more information on invoicing and Chapter 14 for more
information on printing reports.
In Figure 9-11, Colista Swinton (CSWINTON) made three sales that contained
both commissioned and non-commission inventory items and two sales that
contained only non-commission inventory items. As her employer, you’d mul-
tiply the commissioned amount by Colista’s commission rate and pay her the
resulting number.
Peachtree doesn’t provide a way to actually calculate commissions. However,
you can send the Sales Rep report to Excel and set up the calculations.
Figure 9-11:
Use the
Sales Rep
report to
help you
identify
commission
amounts 
to pay.
193
Chapter 9: Paid Employees Are Happy Employees

Customer returns usually affect commissions due. We have a few recommen-
dations concerning paying commissions:
 Print the Sales Rep report only once each month and pay commissions
only once each month for the preceding month — to make sure that you
process all invoices for the month.
 Add the Amt Recvd field to the report, as we did in Figure 9-11, and sum-
marize the report by customer so that you see the invoices that have
been paid and pay commissions only on paid invoices. See Chapter 14
for information on how to summarize a report and add a field to a
report.
 Understand that the Total Sales column on the report does not include
sales tax, but the Amt Recvd column does include sales tax. When you
calculate the commission amount, be sure to calculate it on the Total
Sales column.
 Hold back a specified amount from each rep’s commission and pay that
amount when the sales rep decides to leave your company. This practice
protects you if you pay a commission for a sale that you later determine
you won’t collect. Be sure to include this policy in your employee infor-
mation packet because you can be sure your employees are tracking the
commissions due them.
 Remember that reversing a commission for a merchandise return isn’t a
problem. Simply enter a credit memo and assign the sales rep to the
credit memo. Reversing a commission for a return where you don’t get
any merchandise back is a little trickier. We suggest that you set up a
non-stock inventory item that you assign to your Sales Returns and
Allowances account, making sure to set the item up as subject to com-
mission. When you issue the credit memo, use the non-stock, subject-to-
commission inventory item.
For more information on entering credit memos, see Chapter 8. For more
information on setting up inventory items, see Chapter 11.
Dates for credit memos should be in the period when you enter the credit
memo — which is not necessarily the period in which you sell the item. That
way, you’re always able to pay commissions for a specified period, and you
pay a net amount.
Writing the Payroll Tax Liability Check
You have to pay the payroll tax liability, and the IRS frowns greatly if you
don’t pay it in a timely fashion. The IRS classifies each employer as either a
194
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

semiweekly or monthly depositor, and your classification determines when
your payroll tax deposit is due after a payday. You make your federal tax
deposit at any bank, and you complete Form 8109 as your deposit ticket. On
Form 8109, you specify the amount of the deposit, the type of tax (such as
941), and the period for which the tax applies (first quarter, second quarter,
third quarter, or fourth quarter).
For simplicity’s sake, we strongly urge you to write your federal payroll tax
liability check and make your payroll tax deposit at the same time that you
generate paychecks. That way, you can’t get into trouble regardless of
whether you’re a semiweekly or monthly depositor. You also can sign up to
pay your payroll taxes online at www.eftps.gov.
You write your payroll tax liability check from the Payments window. The
only tricky part is determining how much you owe.
Use the Payroll Tax Liability report to easily determine the amount of your
payroll tax liability. Choose Reports & Forms➪Payroll. From the Report List
on the right, choose Tax Liability report and then click the Options button, as
shown here in the margin. Peachtree displays a dialog box where you can
select printing options; to set up this report, focus your attention on the
Filter section.
If you print the default version of the report, you see each tax name listed
and each employee under that tax name, along with the amount withheld and
the liability amount for one month. We like the summary version of this
report for determining the amount of the tax liability check. For monthly
depositors, the summary version is easier to read than the 941 Worksheet.
Semiweekly depositors don’t need to mess with the 941B form anymore;
simply use the Tax Liability report for the specified time frame.
Although Peachtree prints all taxes on the report by default, you also can
print the Tax Liability report for only one kind of tax: federal, state, or local.
Use the Tax drop-down list (it’s on the Filter tab when you set up printing
options for the report) to choose to print only federal, state, or local taxes. If
you leave the Tax list set to print all taxes and then select the Print Report in
Summary Format check box, you can produce a report that looks like the one
shown in Figure 9-12.
Use the totals in the Tax Liability column for each tax to determine the
amount of money you owe for each of your payroll tax liabilities. Then open
the Payments window and write a check to your local bank. Set the GL
account on the Apply to Expenses tab at the bottom of the window to your
payroll tax liability account(s) (not your payroll tax expense accounts) and
the Cash account to the account from which you’re writing the check. You
might use a payroll checking account (if you have a separate account) or an
operating checking account.
195
Chapter 9: Paid Employees Are Happy Employees

Paying your payroll tax liability doesn’t affect the numbers that appear on the
Tax Liability report. The report shows what you should pay and doesn’t con-
sider what you already paid, which is another good reason to pay your tax lia-
bility at the same time you generate paychecks.
Exploring Payroll Reports
Besides the Payroll Tax Liability report we describe in “Writing the Payroll
Tax Liability Check,” Peachtree offers several reports that you can use for a
variety of tracking needs. Table 9-1 shows you a description of the reports
that pertain to payroll. See Chapter 14 to learn how to print reports.

Billing for Your Time
In This Chapter
 Setting up time and expense items
 Entering time and expense tickets
 Paying employees for hours worked
 Using tickets to create customer invoices
You’ve probably heard the saying, “Time is money.” Some companies
(particularly those employing service-oriented professionals such as
accountants, consultants, lawyers, and architects) bill their customers for
the time spent to complete projects. These companies often have employees
track time and expenses, such as travel, for each of their projects. Then the
employer bills the customer for the employee time and expenses. In some
cases, the companies also pay employees based on time worked.
In this chapter, we show you how Peachtree Complete and higher support these
billing functions — complete with a clock that lets you time your activities.
See Chapter 12 to find out how you can use jobs in Peachtree to create reim-
bursable expenses — expenses you incur that might have nothing to do with
time spent by anyone but that you want to include on an invoice. Using time
and expense tickets provides an alternative — and possibly better — method
for creating reimbursable expenses if you don’t need jobs for any other
reason. (Chapter 12 lists information concerning the restrictions imposed if
you use Peachtree jobs.) If you find that your time and billing needs are more
extensive than can be met by the features provided by Peachtree, you might
consider Timeslips, which links with Peachtree. See Bonus Chapter 4 on this
book’s Web site, www.dummies.com/peachtreefd, for details on TAL, the
program that links Peachtree and Timeslips.
Time and billing functions are not available in Peachtree First Accounting or
Peachtree Pro Accounting.

Part II: The Daily Drudge 
Creating Time and Expense Items
If you plan to use the time and expense features in Peachtree, you need at
least two (but probably more) inventory items. (Yeah, we know that it’s weird
to use inventory items for time and expense features, but it’s true.) You use
inventory items with an item class of Activity Item to enter time-related activ-
ities, and you use inventory items with an item class of Charge Item to enter
expense activities.
See Chapter 11 for details on inventory in Peachtree.
To create inventory items to use on time activities, follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Inventory Items to display the Maintain Inventory
Items window (see Figure 10-1).
2. In the Item ID field, type a label that identifies the item.
3. From the Item Class drop-down list, select Activity Item for a time
activity or Charge Item for an expense activity.
4. In the Description field below the Item ID field, supply a description.
This description appears on reports but not on invoices to your 
customers.
5. In the Description field on the General tab, fill in the description that
you want to appear on customer invoices for time spent on this activity.
Figure 10-1:
Set up at
least one
activity item
and one
charge item
if you intend
to record
both time
and
expenses.

The description in this longer description field appears on the cus-
tomer’s bill unless you choose to display the description from the time
ticket. For details on the time ticket’s description block, see the
“Entering Time Tickets” section.
6. Enter up to ten billing rates for the activity by clicking the button
beside the Billing Rate field.
You might assign more than one billing rate to an employee or a vendor
so that you can bill the same employee’s or vendor’s work at different
rates for, say, different customers or different situations.
7. Use the lookup list button, as shown in the margin, to select a GL
Income Account for the activity.
8. Use the lookup list button to select an Item Tax Type for the activity.
UPC/SKU, Stocking U/M, Item Type, and Location are all optional fields.
9. Click the Save button, as shown here in the margin.
Entering Time Tickets
The Peachtree Time Tickets feature eliminates the need for timecards and
old-fashioned push-in, punch-out tracking of employee hours. You can use
Peachtree time tickets to
 Record time spent by employees or vendors so that you can bill to a
customer or job.
 Track the cost of employee time spent on jobs.
 Provide employees with a method to track time so that you can pay
them based on time worked.
Chapter 9 provides information about one pay method, Hourly – Time Ticket
Hours, which you can use to pay your employees based on the hours entered
on time tickets. If you pay an employee based on time worked, you also need
a way to account for employee time that you don’t intend to charge to a cus-
tomer or job — such as overhead time spent doing marketing or bookkeep-
ing. Although you won’t be billing the time to a customer, you need to include
overhead hours on the employee’s paycheck, or the employee will get angry.
Peachtree allows you to enter overhead time tickets and marks any overhead
time you record as non-billable. And, as you might expect, you aren’t able to
include that time on a bill.
If you don’t pay your employees based on time tickets, you don’t need to
assign time to overhead activities.

Chapter 10: Billing for Your Time

Follow these steps to enter a time ticket:
1. Choose Tasks➪Time/Expense➪Time Tickets to display the Time
Tickets window (see Figure 10-2).
2. In the upper-left drop-down list, select either Employee or Vendor,
and then click the lookup list button and select an employee or
vendor.
3. In the Ticket Date field, enter the date you performed the work.
4. Next to the Activity Item field, click the lookup list button to select an
activity.
5. In the drop-down list below Activity Item, select Customer, Job, or
Administrative. If you select Customer or Job, select the appropriate
customer or job by using the lookup list button.
If you select Customer or Job, you can include the time ticket on a cus-
tomer invoice; if you select Administrative, Peachtree considers the time
ticket non-billable.
6. In the Ticket Description for Invoicing text box, you can enter up to
160 characters of text to display on the customer’s invoice instead of
the activity name.
7. In the Internal Memo text box, you can provide up to 2,000 characters
of descriptive information.
You can’t include the Internal Memo description on a customer’s
invoice, but Peachtree prints it on reports. Use it to provide details
about the work performed.
Figure 10-2:

To start a new paragraph while typing in the Internal Memo text box,
press Ctrl+J.
8. If you’re entering a time ticket for an employee, select a pay level.
Don’t mess with the Has Been Used in Payroll check box; let Peachtree
fill it in. If the check box is selected, you paid the employee for the time
ticket; deselected means that you haven’t included the time ticket on a
paycheck yet.
9. Select either the Manual Time Entry or Timed Duration radio button
and then do the following:
• Manual Time Entry: Supply a start and stop time as well as a break
time, if appropriate.
• Timed Duration: Click the Start button when you’re ready to start
timing.
Peachtree runs a timer. The Start button toggles to a Stop button.
Regardless of your choice, Peachtree calculates the duration of the time
ticket.
You can’t save a time ticket or close the time ticket window while the
timer is running.
10. Select a Billing Type:
• Employee Rate: Uses the Hourly billing rate you entered on the Pay
Info tab when you set up the employee in the Maintain
Employees/Sales Reps window
• Activity Rate: Uses the rate you entered when you set up the activ-
ity in the Maintain Inventory Items window
• Override Rate: Ignores both the employee and activity rates and
allows you to enter any rate you want
• Flat Fee: Ignores the duration (and value) of the time ticket and
allows you to establish an amount for the ticket
All billing types are available for employees, but only some are available
for vendors.
11. Select a Billing Rate.
The available rates depend on the choice you make for Billing Type in
Step 10. For example, you can establish only one employee rate, so if
you select Employee Rate as the Billing Type, you can’t change the
billing rate. However, you can establish up to five rates for an activity, so
you can choose a billing rate if you select Activity Rate as the Billing
Type. For Override Rate, you must type a Billing Rate.
203
Chapter 10: Billing for Your Time

12. Select a Billing Status: Billable, Non-Billable, Hold, or No Charge.
Billable and Non-Billable are self-explanatory. If you select Hold, you
can’t bill the ticket to a customer until you change the ticket’s status. If
you select No Charge, Peachtree changes the ticket’s value to $0, so you
can show your customer on the invoice that you performed work but
didn’t charge for it.
13. If you choose Flat Fee as the Billing Type (see the choices in Step 10),
enter a Billing Amount.
For all other Billing Types, Peachtree calculates the Billing Amount.
14. Click Save.
Whew! This process seems like a lot of steps to enter a ticket, but it goes
quickly. The daily Time Ticket window appears in Figure 10-2, but Peachtree
also provides a weekly view. You can enter time tickets in the weekly view,
and you can print the weekly timesheet by clicking the Print button (as
shown here) in the window.
The columns in the weekly view aren’t terribly wide, and most contain lookup
list buttons. As you enter information for a particular column, the fields
extend to cover up columns to the right of the current column. The visual
effect might make you think that columns have disappeared — but they
haven’t.
Entering Expense Tickets
Okay, good news here. Almost everything in the preceding section about 
time tickets applies to expense tickets as well. For example, you can enter
expense tickets for both employees and vendors. And you can assign 
an expense ticket to a customer or job so that you can recover the expense.
Or you can assign an expense ticket to overhead, making it non-billable.
If you assign an expense ticket to an employee, you also can select the
Reimbursable to Employee check box. Peachtree prints reimbursable
expense tickets on the Reimbursable Employee Expense report, making it
easy for you to pay employees for their expenses. If an expense is reim-
bursable and you don’t select this check box, the expense doesn’t appear on
the Reimbursable Employee Expense report.
Choose Tasks➪Time/Expense➪Expense Tickets to display the Expense
Tickets window. In the Ticket Description for Invoicing text box, you can type
up to 160 characters, which can print on the customer’s invoice. In the
Internal Memo text box, you can type up to 2,000 characters.
204
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Unit Price is tied to the charge item you select; you might see up to ten avail-
able unit prices. And you have the same four Billing Status options for
expense tickets that you have for time tickets: Billable, Non-Billable, No
Charge, and Hold.
Paying Employees
Suppose that you pay employees from time tickets. You can use either of the
payroll windows we describe in Chapter 9. Figure 10-3 shows the Payroll Entry
window (choose Tasks➪Payroll Entry). After you set the Pay Period Ends
date, Peachtree automatically calculates the paycheck by using time tickets
from that pay period that are assigned to Customer or Administrative (in that
unnamed list we mention in Step 5 in the “Entering Time Tickets” section).
If your employee assigned the time tickets to Job instead of Customer or
Administrative, you need to click the Jobs button when you’re paying the
employee to see and then select those time tickets.

Using Tickets to Bill Customers
If your employees or vendors assign time or expense tickets to customers or
jobs, you can bill the customers for those costs. Follow these steps to bill
customers by using tickets.
206
Part II: The Daily Drudge 
Repaying employees for reimbursable expenses
Peachtree doesn’t try to repay your employees
automatically for expense tickets. You must
print the Reimbursable Employee Expense
report for the specified pay period to identify
expenses for reimbursement. Choose Reports &
Forms➪Time/Expense. On the right side of the
Select a Report window that appears, select
Reimbursable Employee Expense and then click
the Preview button. See Chapter 14 for details
on printing reports.
Then you can repay the employee in one of two
ways:
 Use the Payments window (choose Tasks➪
Payments) to write a separate expense
reimbursement check to the employee. If
you want to track the reimbursable expense
checks to the employee, set the employee
up as a vendor.
 Include 
the 
reimbursement 
in 
the
employee’s paycheck by setting up a pay-
roll field as an addition. See Chapter 9 for
details on setting up additions. You need to
assign the reimbursement to a General
Ledger account but probably not to your
Wage Expense account. Also, because
reimbursements aren’t usually subject to
payroll taxes, you need to click the Adjust
button for each payroll tax and make sure
that you’re not including the reimbursement
item. When you pay the employee, type a
positive amount for the reimbursement to
add it to the paycheck.

To be sure you don’t forget to bill your customers for time or expense tickets,
print the Aged Tickets report before you create invoices.
1. Choose Tasks➪Sales/Invoicing to display the Sales/Invoicing window.
2. Complete most of your invoice as usual.
Select a customer by using the lookup list button next to the Customer ID
field and assign shipping information, terms, and line item information if
you’re invoicing this customer for other things besides reimbursable
time and expense tickets. For details on entering invoices, see Chapter 7.
3. In the lower left of the window, click the Apply Tickets/Expenses
button.
Peachtree displays the Apply Tickets/Reimbursable Expenses window
(see Figure 10-4).
You can view available time tickets on the Time Tickets tab and expense
tickets on the Expense Tickets tab. To find out more about the
Reimbursable Expenses tab, see Chapter 12.
4. To include a ticket on the invoice, select the Use check box next to the
ticket on the appropriate tab.
5. In the Invoice Amount column, verify or change the figure.
To build some profit into a ticket or a reimbursable expense, you change
the amount in the Invoice Amount column. To mark up costs or reduce a
group of tickets or reimbursable expenses, click the WriteUp button (as
Figure 10-4:

Chapter 10: Billing for Your Time

shown here) to display the Select Tickets to Write Up/Down dialog box.
You can adjust tickets up or down by a dollar amount or a percentage.
To mark up, supply a positive number; to mark down, supply a negative
number. Click OK after you finish.
If you change your mind and decide that you don’t want to mark tickets
up or down, click the Remove WriteUp button, as shown in the margin,
in the Apply Tickets/Reimbursable Expenses window.
6. At the top of the tab, select a description for the ticket to appear on
the invoice.
The first option, Use Ticket Description for Invoicing, tells Peachtree to
use the description supplied on the time ticket. The second option, Use
Item Description for Invoicing, tells Peachtree to use the description
supplied when you set up the item in inventory.
If you leave the Consolidate By list set at No Consolidation, Peachtree
creates separate lines on the invoice for each ticket you choose to bill. If
you select more than one entry containing the same activity item and
you choose to consolidate, Peachtree displays only one line for all
selected entries and reduces the number of lines on the invoice.
7. Click OK.
The reimbursable expenses appear on the customer’s invoice.
8. Supply GL accounts, select a job if appropriate, print, and post the
invoice as usual.
See Chapter 7 for details on completing an invoice.
When you print tickets as separate lines on the invoice, Peachtree prints the
description you supplied on the expense when you created it. You see either
ticket descriptions or item descriptions on the customer’s invoice, depending
on the selection you make in the Apply Tickets/Reimbursable Expenses
window. When you consolidate items, Peachtree prints the information asso-
ciated with the consolidate choice you selected. For example, if you consoli-
date by Employee/Vendor ID, Peachtree prints the employee name or the
vendor name.
If you choose Consolidate All in the Consolidate By list, Peachtree does not
supply a description on the invoice. Instead, Peachtree prints the name of the
GL account assigned to the items as the description on the invoice along with
the total of all the tickets. If you want, you can type a description on the line
for the consolidated tickets in the Sales/Invoicing window, and Peachtree
uses that description instead of the GL account name.
208
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Keep the following notes in mind when you work with tickets:
 You can delete tickets from the Apply Tickets/Reimbursable Expenses
window if you decide not to invoice the client for them. Select the No Bill
check box to the right of the ticket or expense. Deleting the ticket does
not delete the transaction that created the ticket; instead, deleting a
ticket in the Apply Tickets/Reimbursable Expenses window disconnects
the ticket and the customer.
 Be aware that using a ticket makes it disappear from the Apply
Tickets/Reimbursable Expenses window. If you subsequently delete the
line from the invoice, the reimbursable expense does not reappear in the
window. If you mistakenly use the ticket and post the invoice, delete the
invoice and reenter it to make the ticket available again.
 You can edit a ticket you intend to bill to a customer. You can find the
transaction by opening the Time Tickets window or the Expense Tickets
window and then clicking the Open button.
Tracking Ticket Traffic

The Reimbursable Employee Expense report, shown earlier in this chapter, is
one example of the reports Peachtree offers to help you keep track of time
tickets. Table 10-1 provides you with a description of the other reports that

Counting Your Stuff
In This Chapter
 Creating inventory items
 Entering beginning balances
 Creating and building assemblies
 Adjusting prices
 Understanding inventory in Peachtree
 Generating inventory reports
T
his chapter is about stuff. Many businesses sell stuff you can touch whereas
others sell stuff you can’t touch. Some stuff is made up of pieces of other
stuff. Peachtree lets you sell all these kinds of stuff. Okay — enough stuff.
Of course, we’re talking about inventory. And not just the goods you place on
your shelves but other kinds of nonphysical items, such as services, labor,
activities, and items you charge to your customer’s bill.
We’ll just warn you up front: The material in this chapter is rather dry, and
you probably won’t consider it too funny. However, inventory management is
typically a crucial part of keeping your books. Peachtree makes handling
inventory a lot easier than trying to track it all by hand.
Creating Inventory Items
When you create inventory items, you set up the goods and services you sell.
You set a price (actually, you can set up to ten prices) at which you want to
sell your product and the account that you want Peachtree to adjust when
you sell this item or service. However, before you can set up selling prices,
you need to supply basic information about the item.

212
Part II: The Daily Drudge 
To set up your inventory items, follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Inventory Items.
Peachtree displays the Maintain Inventory Items window, as shown in
Figure 11-1, with multiple tabs for each item. The header information
consists of the item ID, description, and class.
2. In the Item ID field, type an item ID.
Keep in mind that the item ID appears in lookup lists for sales transac-
tions and so on. Peachtree allows item IDs with up to 20 alphanumeric
characters.
Item IDs are not case sensitive, but they can’t contain an asterisk (*), a
question mark (?), or a plus symbol (+). And although technically you
can use the inch mark symbol ("), we STRONGLY recommend you don’t
use it in the item ID or any other field, including descriptions. If you ever
have to export or import your inventory items, the process will fail if
there are inch mark symbols in your inventory IDs, descriptions or any
inventory field.
3. Enter a description containing up to 30 characters.
This description appears in the item lookup lists. In the next section,
you can read about how to type descriptions that you can use for sales
or purchase transactions. For example, in the lookup description, you
might refer to a specific birdbath as Con PBB w/birds, but when you sell
this item, you should be a little more descriptive, such as Concrete bird-
bath with two bluebirds on pedestal base.
Figure 11-1:
Setting up 
a new
inventory
item.

If you discontinue an inventory item, you can mark it inactive; redisplay
the item in the Maintain Inventory window and then select the Inactive
check box.
4. Select an item class to identify the type of inventory item.
Selecting the right classes for your inventory items helps ensure that
Peachtree meets your business needs. Peachtree Premium and above
support 11 item classes, Peachtree Complete supports 9 item classes,
Peachtree Pro supports 7 item classes, and Peachtree First Accounting
supports 4 item classes. Chapter 4 provides more information on the dif-
ferent Peachtree inventory classes, but these are the basics:
• Stock: Inventory items you want to track for quantities, average
costs, vendors, low stock points, and so on. Stock items are avail-
able in Peachtree Pro Accounting and higher.
• Non-stock: Items such as service contracts that you sell but don’t
put into your inventory.
• Master Stock: Items that consist of information shared by a number
of substock items. See the “Whoa, Nellie! Working with Master
Stock Items” section. Peachtree Complete Accounting and higher
support master stock items.
• Serialized Stock: Items that have serial numbers that you plan to
track. Serialized stock items appear only in Peachtree Premium
and higher.
• Assembly: Items that consist of components that must be built or
unbuilt (dismantled). See the “Putting ’Em Together, Taking ’Em
Apart” section. Assembly items are available in Peachtree Pro
Accounting and higher.
• Serialized Assembly: Items that consist of serialized components
that you plan to build or unbuild. Serialized assembly items appear
only in Peachtree Premium and higher.
• Service: Services provided by your employees that you bill to your
customers.
• Labor: Charges that you bill to a customer for subcontracted labor
on that customer’s projects.
• Activity: Records of how time is spent when employees or vendors
perform services. Activity items appear only in Peachtree
Complete and higher. Chapter 10 gives you more information on
setting up activity and charge items.
• Charge: On-the-job expenses of an employee or vendor. Charge
items appear only in Peachtree Complete and higher. Chapter 10
gives you more information on setting up activity and charge items.
• Description Only: Time-saver when you track nothing but the
description.
213
Chapter 11: Counting Your Stuff

If you save an item as a stock item, an assembly item, an activity item, or
a charge item, you can’t change its item class. Although you probably
wouldn’t want to, Peachtree does allow you to interchange the item
class between non-stock, description, labor, and service items.
5. Select the Subject to Commission check box if you want to track the
sales of the item and have it reported on the Accounts Receivable Sales
Rep report.
When your company no longer carries a particular product, you can select
the Inactive check box.
General options
You enter basic item information such as descriptions, account numbers,
sales prices, and pricing methods on the General tab.
Why does Peachtree list different description lines? Well, the first description —
the one you enter in the header information (refer to Figure 11-1) — appears
when you open the inventory item lookup list.
Peachtree also provides a drop-down list where you can select the
Description for Sales and the Description for Purchases fields (up to 160 char-
acters for each field). The description you enter for sales appears on quotes,
sales orders, sales invoicing, and receipts. The purchases description
appears on purchase orders, purchases/receive inventory, and payments.
You can modify either the sales description or the purchases description
when you create a transaction.
Follow these steps to enter general inventory information:
1. Click the arrow next to the drop-down list under Description (as
shown in the margin) to select the description you want to enter.
2. Enter a description as you want it to appear on transactions.
Entering information in the Description for Sales and Description for
Purchases fields is optional. If you don’t specify a sales description,
Peachtree uses the lookup description when you enter a quote, a sales
order, an invoice, or a receipt. If you don’t specify a purchases descrip-
tion, Peachtree uses the sales description when generating purchase
orders, purchases, or payments.
3. Type the price you want to charge.
Peachtree refers to the amounts that appear on your quotes, sales
orders, and invoices as sales prices. The sales pricing levels correspond
with those you assign your customers in the Maintain
Customers/Prospects window (see Chapter 7).
214
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

If you charge only one price for this item, no matter which customer
makes the purchase, enter only Price Level 1. To enter additional sales
prices, click the arrow next to the Price Level 1 field (as shown here).
The Multiple Price Levels dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-2.
See Chapter 4 for information on renaming price levels and setting up other
inventory default options.
Be consistent when entering item sales price levels (for example, from
lowest to highest or highest to lowest). See Chapter 4 for information on
naming the price levels to something more specific for your business.
Items prices can be a static number you assign, or you can create a cal-
culation that uses the current price or the last cost as the foundation of
the formula. By default, Peachtree uses the pricing calculation you
entered when creating inventory defaults. (See Chapter 4.)
You can, however, click the arrow button in the Edit column (as shown
here) to display the Calculate Price Level dialog box and create a differ-
ent calculation. You can increase or decrease the price by a percentage
or an amount. After you finish, click OK twicwwe to close both the
Calculate Price Level dialog box and the Multiple Price Levels window.
4. (Optional) In the Last Unit Cost field, enter the last price you paid for
this item.
After you enter transactions against the inventory item, the Last Unit
Cost field becomes unavailable. Peachtree automatically updates the
Last Unit Cost field as you enter purchases, payments, adjustments, or
beginning balances, calculating the amount based on the costing
method you select in Step 5.
5. If necessary, select a different costing method.
The Cost Method is a very important field. You can’t change a costing
method after an inventory item is saved.
Figure 11-2:
Set up to ten
sales prices
for each
item.
215
Chapter 11: Counting Your Stuff

Costing methods apply only to stock items, master stock items, assem-
blies, serialized items, and serialized assemblies. In addition to tracking
serialized items and serialized assemblies by their specific unit cost,
Peachtree supports three other costing methods: average cost, LIFO
(last in, first out), and FIFO (first in, first out). The sidebar, “How do
inventory costing methods work?” gives you more information on what
these methods mean. Typically, you set all inventory items to use the
same costing method, so you probably determined a default method
when you set up the default inventory item information in Chapter 4. If
you’re not sure, check with your accountant for advice about different
inventory costing methods.
6. If necessary, change the GL accounts for the item.
You can read about setting up default GL accounts in Chapter 4.
7. Choose an item tax type.
The tax type you select applies when you enter the inventory item on
quotes, sales orders, invoices, or receipts. If you assign an exempt tax
type to an item, Peachtree never calculates sales tax for the item. If you
assign a taxable tax type to an item, you can still exempt the item from
sales tax in the Maintain Customers/Prospects window or when you
create an invoice.
8. (Optional) Enter a part number.
An example might be the part number your vendor uses. The Part
Number field is available only in Peachtree Premium and higher.
9. (Optional) Enter a UPC or SKU number for your barcoded items.
In Peachtree Premium or higher, when printing customer or vendor
forms, you have the option of replacing the item ID with the part number
or the UPC/SKU number.
10. (Optional) Enter an item type.
You’ll appreciate this field when you’re generating reports. Grouping
items on reports is much easier when they’re marked, for example, as
supplies or raw materials.
11. (Optional) Enter a storage location for the unit.
Someday you might need to know where the unit is located, such as Bin
17 or Shelf B3 or in Mom’s garage. The storage location is helpful when
doing a physical inventory as well.
12. (Optional) Select a unit of measure from the Stock U/M drop-down list.
You might sell your products on an individual basis (each), in pairs, per
dozen, per pound or kilogram, or per ounce.
Peachtree Premium for Distribution, Peachtree Premium for
Manufacturing, and Peachtree Quantum include the ability to purchase
and sell your products in different units of measure.
216
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

13. (Optional) Enter an item weight.
14. (Optional) In the Minimum Stock field, enter the quantity at which you
want Peachtree to remind you that it’s time to reorder the item.
When the quantity on hand reaches the minimum stock quantity,
Peachtree prints the item on the Inventory Reorder Worksheet.
Although entering a minimum stock point is optional, you need to enter
a minimum stock point if you want Peachtree Premium or higher to auto-
matically create a purchase order when the stock gets low. See Chapter
5 for more information about purchase orders.
15. (Optional) Enter a reorder quantity.
Reorder quantity is the quantity you generally purchase when you order
the inventory item. Entering a reorder quantity point is also optional,
but again ,you need to enter a reorder quantity if you want Peachtree
Premium or higher to automatically create a purchase order when the
stock gets low.
16. (Optional) Tell Peachtree where you prefer to buy this item by select-
ing the vendor ID in the Preferred Vendor lookup list.
Selecting a Preferred Vendor doesn’t mean that’s the only vendor from
whom you can purchase the item. It just means that this vendor is your
favorite vendor for this item. You must supply a Preferred Vendor if you
want Peachtree Premium or higher to automatically create purchase
orders for reorder or for drop-ship transactions and non–drop-ship
transactions.
17. (Optional) Select the employee who is the usual buyer for this item.
The information can appear on the Buyer report and can be used to
select items for automatic purchase orders.
18. If you’re not creating an assembly item, a master stock item, or a seri-
alized item and are ready to move on, click the Save button (as shown
here) to save the inventory item.
Later in this chapter, we show you how to set up serialized items.
Additionally, you see how to set up a bill of materials for an assembly
item and master stock items with their substock items.
If you enter the item ID incorrectly, after saving the item, click the Change ID
button (as shown in the margin) and enter a new inventory item ID.
Whew! That’s a lot of stuff to enter for one item! Fortunately, the rest of the
Maintain Inventory Items window is easy and doesn’t involve too many tough
decisions.
217
Chapter 11: Counting Your Stuff

Custom fields
If you use other Peachtree modules (such as Accounts Receivable, Accounts
Payable, Payroll, or Job Cost), you’ve seen custom fields. Use custom fields
to store miscellaneous pieces of information about the inventory item that
just don’t seem to fit anywhere else in the Maintain Inventory Items window.
Examples of such items are the product average shelf life and information
about an alternate vendor for the product. One of our clients uses a custom
field to store the chemical makeup of each item.
History
The History tab displays a summary of inventory transactions for stock,
assembly, and serialized items for past periods. Peachtree shows units sold
and received as well as sales and costs by accounting period. Peachtree does
not retain history for non-stock, service, and the remaining class items.
218
Part II: The Daily Drudge 
How do inventory costing methods work?
If you’re not sure which option to choose in the
Cost Method field, you might want to know how
Peachtree handles these options. Peachtree
supports three main inventory costing methods:
Average, FIFO (first-in, first-out), and LIFO (last-
in, first-out). (Those terms kinda remind us of
Jack and the Beanstalk — Fee Fie Foe Fum. . . .)
Peachtree also supports Specific Unit as a cost-
ing method. That method, though — available
only in Peachtree Premium and higher — applies
only to those items with a serialized inventory
class.
If you use the Average costing method,
Peachtree adds the total amount paid for the
items and divides that by the total units on hand.
The average is recalculated each time you 
purchase more of the item. Remember that
Peachtree calculates costs on a daily basis. For
example, say you have on hand five widgets for
which you paid $6 each and three more widgets
for which you paid $7 each. That’s a total of $51
for the eight widgets, or an average of $6.375
each.
If you use the FIFO costing method, Peachtree
calculates costs at the earliest purchase price,
inventory increase adjustment, build, sales
return, or assembly unbuild (for the component
item) for a particular item. FIFO produces the
lowest possible net income in periods of falling
costs, and the cost of the most recently pur-
chased item most closely approximates the
replacement of the item.
If you use the LIFO costing method, Peachtree
calculates costs at the most recent (last) pur-
chase price, inventory increase adjustment,
build, sales return, or assembly unbuild (for the
component item) for a particular item. LIFO pro-
duces the lowest possible net income in periods
of rising costs, and the cost of the most recently
purchased item most closely approximates the
replacement of the item.

Serial numbers
The Serial Number tab is one location where you can view the in-stock serial
numbers of the current item as well as determine whether you provide a war-
ranty with the item. The Serial Number tab becomes available only if you class
the inventory item as a serialized stock item or a serialized assembly item.
Only Peachtree Premium and higher support serialized inventory items.
Peachtree assigns a status that you cannot manually change, to each serial
number except by entering transactions such as buying or selling. Table 11-1
shows the different statuses and what they mean.
Table 11-1
Serialized Inventory Item Status Codes
Status
What It Is
Available
Serial numbers with this status are available for selection on
transactions.
Sold
Serial numbers with this status are no longer available because
the serial number for the item has been removed from inventory
by a transaction such as a sale.
Adjusted
Serial numbers with this status have been taken out of inven-
tory because of an inventory adjustment.
Returned
Serial numbers with this status have been returned to the
vendor by using a credit memo.
In Progress
Serial numbers with this status have been added to work tickets
that haven’t yet been closed. This status is available only in the
Peachtree Premium for Distribution, Peachtree Premium for
Manufacturing, and Peachtree Quantum editions.
New
Serial numbers with this status have been added to the system
by a transaction, but the transaction hasn’t been saved.
Error
Serial numbers with this status have been imported into
Peachtree with an on-hand quantity. However, the transaction
that added the serial number to the system (the originating
transaction) is missing.
The Peachtree Premium for Distribution, Peachtree Premium for
Manufacturing, and Peachtree Quantum editions also include work tickets to
help track the build progress of an assembled item. Work tickets contain
information about what’s needed to build an assembly and whether all the
items are available. Work tickets follow a build through its process, and you
can check off the build steps as they’re completed.
219
Chapter 11: Counting Your Stuff

Serial number statuses are displayed on the Serial Numbers tab in the Maintain
Inventory Items window, on the Serial Number Entry window, and on the
Serial Number Selection window. Serial number statuses are reported on 
the Serial Number History report.
Also on the Serial Numbers tab, you can indicate whether the current item
has a warranty and determine the length of the warranty period (see Figure
11-3). Peachtree allows up to 90 days, months, or years for a warranty period.
You can customize your invoice to display the warranty information and war-
ranty expiration date. See Chapter 13 for information on customizing forms
such as invoices.
Whoa, Nellie! Working with
Master Stock Items
If you have a lot of items and each of those items comes in a different flavor
such as color, size, or condition, you can end up with an out-of-control inven-
tory list. To help you harness your inventory list, Peachtree uses another
inventory class called master stock. You use master stock items when you
have several variations of similar items, such as T-shirts in various colors
and sizes, or both new and used lawn mowers (as shown in Figure 11-4).
Figure 11-3:
Enter the
serialized

220
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Master stock items are available only in Peachtree Complete and higher 
editions.
When you create a master stock item and designate its various attributes,
Peachtree creates substock items for each category you determine. In our
example, instead of creating new and used versions of each lawn mower, we
can set up one master stock item, assign it to either the new or used version
of the Sales and Cost of Sales accounts, and then use the Item Attributes tab
to create new and used versions of the item. The Item Attributes tab becomes
available only if you’re working with a master stock item. Use the following
steps to create a master stock item:
1. Click the Item Attributes tab.
2. In the Name field under Primary Attributes, type a name that
describes the distinction you’re making for the item.
In the example, we used New/Used.
3. In the ID field, type an ID that identifies the substock item.
Peachtree appends this ID to the ID of the master stock item.
4. In the Description field, type a description for the substock item.
We used N for the ID and New for the description for the first substock
item and U and Used for the second substock item.
5. Click the Add button, as shown in the margin.
The ID and description appear in the field immediately below the ID and
Description fields, and the full item ID appears in the bottom of the
window in the Created Substock Items list.
Figure 11-4:
Peachtree

ally creates

221
Chapter 11: Counting Your Stuff

6. Repeat Steps 2–5 for each substock item.
Peachtree creates separate entries for each substock item; you see these
entries if you click the lookup list indicator next to the Item ID field at
the top of the window. This method makes creating items with similar
characteristics quick and easy.
7. Click the Save button to save both the master stock items and each of
the substock items you created.
You can’t sell master stock items; instead, you sell one of the substock items.
Because you don’t sell master stock items, Peachtree doesn’t track the last
unit cost, the UPC/SKU, or any quantity information shown on the General
tab of the Maintain Inventory Items window.
During reporting, you can summarize report information for substock items
by filtering most inventory reports to show only master stock items. For
example, if you print the Inventory Profitability report and filter it for master
stock items, you see the master stock item and numbers that are the totals
for all associated substock items. On reports, you can’t filter for particular
substock items.
In the Beginning (Balance, That Is)
Chances are that you’ve been in business for some time and have a current
stock of inventory goods. If so and if you’re setting up your Peachtree com-
pany for the first time, you need to enter beginning balances for the items
you have on hand.
To enter inventory item beginning balances, follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Inventory Items.
The Maintain Inventory Items window appears.
2. From the General tab, click the arrow button next to Beginning
Balances (in the lower-right corner of the window), as shown here in
the margin.
The Inventory Beginning Balances dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 11-5.
3. From the list, select the inventory item.
The item appears at the top.
222
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

4. Enter the quantity and the unit cost (the price you paid for the unit).
If you bought the items at a lot (bulk) price and don’t know the cost of
each one, skip the unit cost and enter the total cost you paid for the
goods. Peachtree divides the total cost by the quantity and displays the
result in the Unit Cost field.
5. If the item is a serialized item, click the Serial No button, as shown in
the margin, and enter the serial number you want to add.
6. Repeat Steps 3–5 for each inventory item for which you have stock.
7. Click the OK button (as shown here) to update the inventory balance
and close the Inventory Beginning Balances window.
Putting ’Em Together, Taking ’Em Apart
Some stuff is made up of pieces of other stuff. Peachtree calls the pieces com-
ponents and the complete items assemblies. Maybe your company sells bird
feeders as a stand-alone product or as part of a package deal that includes a
post, a hook, and birdseed. The package deal is an assembly. Or maybe you
sell a “doobob.” (Elaine, that one’s for you!) This doobob is made up of sev-
eral thingamajigs and a couple of whatchamacallits. You don’t actually sell
thingamajigs or whatchamacallits (components) to your customers, but you
still need to keep track of their quantities so you know how many doobobs
(assemblies) you can make. In either situation, you create the assembled
items by building them out of a list of component parts, both in your physical
inventory and in your virtual store.
Figure 11-5:
Only stock

223
Chapter 11: Counting Your Stuff

Peachtree Premium for Distribution, Peachtree Premium for Manufacturing,
and Peachtree Quantum editions also offers work tickets to help track the
build progress of an assembled item. Work tickets contain information about
what’s needed to build an assembly and whether you have all the items avail-
able. You can use work tickets to follow a build through its process, and you
can check off the build steps as they are completed.
Creating a bill of materials
The bill of materials is a list of the individual parts that make up assemblies.
Before you can create an assembly item, you need to make sure that each
component part is set up in Peachtree.
Create a bill of materials by following these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Inventory Items to display the Maintain Inventory
Items window.
2. Create the assembly items inventory item ID, description, and other
information.
Make sure that you select Assembly as the item class.
3. Click the Bill of Materials tab to display a screen like the one in 
Figure 11-6.
Because assemblies are made up of other components, you need to use
the Bill of Materials tab to list the component items. Assemblies must
have at least one component (item ID) listed in the bill of materials.
Figure 11-6:
Assemblies
must have
at least one
item listed in
the bill of

224
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

4. Select or enter the first item ID you want to include in the assembly.
Peachtree automatically fills in the description, but you can change the
description.
5. Enter the quantity needed to build one assembly.
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 for each component item.
If you run out of lines on the Bill of Materials list and have additional
components, click the Add button. Peachtree inserts a blank line above
the current item.
7. If you want Peachtree to print the list of the individual components on
the invoice, select the Print Components on Invoice check box.
8. Click the Save button to save the assembly item.
After you use an assembly on a transaction, you can’t add or remove compo-
nent items from the bill of materials. You need to create a new assembly item
to change component parts unless you’re using Peachtree Premium for
Distribution, Peachtree Premium for Manufacturing, or Peachtree Quantum
editions. In these three products, you can revise the original bill of materials
with the following stipulations:
 Up to a maximum of 99 revisions per assembly item
 One revision per assembly item per day
Building assemblies
When you build an assembly item, Peachtree takes the individual compo-
nents and reduces their quantity on hand. Peachtree does not allow negative
component quantities when building assemblies — that’s only logical.
Therefore, you need enough component parts in stock to build the requested
number of assemblies.
Be sure to build assemblies before you sell them. Although Peachtree techni-
cally allows you to sell an assembly before you build it, you shouldn’t. Selling
the assembly before it’s in stock can greatly distort your inventory costing.
Follow these steps to build assemblies:
1. Choose Tasks➪Assemblies.
The Build/Unbuild Assemblies dialog box, as shown in Figure 11-7,
appears.
2. In the Item ID lookup list, select the assembly item ID.
Peachtree displays each assembly component along with the current
quantity on hand.
225
Chapter 11: Counting Your Stuff

3. In the Reference field, enter an optional reference number or any
piece of information to identify this transaction, perhaps your initials
and the date.
Many Peachtree windows don’t require reference numbers, but making
sure that every transaction you enter into Peachtree has some type of a
reference number is a good idea.
4. Choose the transaction date, which is typically the date the changes in
your inventory occurred.
5. Next to Action, select Build or Unbuild.
You might want to unbuild an assembly, for example, if you need to sell
the individual components.
6. Enter the build or unbuild quantity.
Whether you’re building or unbuilding, enter a positive number. As you
enter the quantity you want to build, the assembly New Qty on Hand
amount changes, as well as the component quantity required. If you’re
unbuilding assemblies, Peachtree shows the components quantity
returned to stock.
7. In the lower-right corner, enter a reason to build the assemblies.
You don’t have to enter a reason. Undoubtedly, you know exactly right now
why you’re building them, but will you remember six months from now?
Optionally, select an employee name from the Supervisor list. The super-
visor is the person overseeing the assembly build or unbuild.
Supervisors must be set up as employees. See Chapter 9 for information
on setting up employees.
8. Click the Save button to record the transaction.

Making Inventory Adjustments
Face it: Inventory counts get out of whack sometimes. Items get damaged,
lost, or stolen. Sometimes, for reasons unknown, you might find several prod-
ucts that you didn’t know you had, stashed away in a corner. So periodically,
you need to adjust your inventory.
Whether you take a physical inventory count of all your goods or just need to
adjust the quantity on hand of a single product, you use the Peachtree
Inventory Adjustment feature.
Follow these steps to make adjustments to your inventory:
1. Choose Tasks➪Inventory Adjustments to display the Inventory
Adjustments window you see in Figure 11-8.
2. Enter a reference number or any piece of information to identify this
transaction — perhaps your initials and the date.
Many Peachtree windows don’t require reference numbers, but making
sure that every transaction you enter into Peachtree has some type of a
reference number is a good idea.
3. Select a date for the inventory adjustment.
4. If you use the Peachtree job-costing feature, select the job (and option-
ally, the phase or cost code) to which you want to charge the adjustment.
Chapter 12 tells you all about job costing.
5. Choose the GL Source account you want to charge for the adjustment
cost.
Figure 11-8:
Make
inventory
adjustments
using this
window.
227
Chapter 11: Counting Your Stuff

If you decrease the item quantity, Peachtree debits the GL Source
account and credits the Inventory account you listed in the Maintain
Inventory Items window for the item. If you increase the item quantity,
Peachtree credits the GL Source account and debits the item’s Inventory
account.
6. Enter a unit cost.
The Unit Cost field defaults to the last purchase price you entered in the
system. If you use the Inventory Adjustment transaction to increase
your inventory count, you can change the unit cost. If you’re reducing
the quantity on hand, however, the Unit Cost field becomes disabled.
Peachtree determines the cost of the adjustment based on the item’s
costing method at the time of the adjustment.
The unit cost is very important! Not putting in a cost when increasing
inventory can throw off your entire inventory valuation.
7. In the Adjust Quantity By field, type a quantity to adjust.
Enter the quantity as a negative number if you need to decrease your
quantity on hand. Peachtree displays the new quantity on hand.
8. (Optional) In the Reason to Adjust field, describe why you’re creating
the transaction (for example, damaged or annual inventory).
You might know quite well why you’re creating this adjustment, but 
will you remember later when your accountant asks you about this
transaction?
9. Click the Save button to save the transaction.
Adjusting Prices
One day, you suddenly realize you haven’t raised the prices on your products
for a long time. Your costs have gone up, and you know you have to pass
some of that increase on to your customers. We know this isn’t a step you
take lightly. After all, you still want to be competitive, but you’re in business
to make money — not lose it — so you make the decision to increase your
prices.
Originally, you enter the sales prices when you create the inventory item in
the Maintain Inventory Items window. You could go back to the Maintain
Inventory Items window and pull each item up individually, change the sales
prices, and then save the inventory item again.

Part II: The Daily Drudge 

“Oh no!” you say. “I have too many inventory items to change the prices indi-
vidually. Isn’t there a faster way?” Yes. Peachtree provides an easy way to
update prices on all your inventory items, a range of items, or a single item. For
example, you can mark up sales prices for all your stock items by 10 percent.
You can even adjust the prices for only the products you purchase from a spe-
cific vendor. Peachtree allows you to adjust the item sales prices up or down.
Make a backup before you change item prices.
To adjust sales prices, follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Item Prices to display the Maintain Item Prices –
Filter Selection dialog box, as shown in Figure 11-9.
2. Enter any desired filter information.
This dialog box gives you lots of different ways to select the products
that need a price increase. If you don’t choose any settings, Peachtree
assumes you want to change the prices of all your products. However,
you can select just stock items, or stock items you purchase from
vendor JONES-01, or only the products that cost more than $10 but less
than $50, or . . . you get the idea. You can select any of these combina-
tions. In Figure 11-9, we changed the price on only our gardening books.
3. Click OK to display the Maintain Item Prices window, as shown in
Figure 11-10.
4. Because Peachtree assumes that you want to change all ten pricing
levels, you have to deselect the check box next to each price level that
you don’t want to change.
Now you have to make some decisions regarding your method of adjust-
ment. Do you want to adjust your price levels manually or through 
calculations?
Figure 11-9:
Adjust
inventory

for all or
some of
your items.
229
Chapter 11: Counting Your Stuff

5. Select an adjustment method:
• Level’s Current Calculation, and New Cost Information: Selected
price levels and items that use cost or Level 1 in calculating the
price are recalculated based on the current cost or the updated
Level 1 price.
• Level’s Default Calculation: Each price level and item selected are
recalculated using the calculation in the Inventory Item Defaults
dialog box. This method overrides any customized calculations
you might have set up for individual items in the Maintain
Inventory Items window.
• Calculation Selected Below: If you use a calculation for changing
your prices, select the Calculation Selected Below radio button.
Then click the arrow next to the Use drop-down list and select an
adjustment method: Current Price or Last Cost. Some companies
mark up their products by a flat percentage — say, 25 percent over
cost. In that case, they’d select the Last Cost option. If you want to
increase the current sales price — say, a $1 item that you now
want to sell for $1.15 — choose the Current Price option.
6. If you select the Calculation Selected Below method, follow Steps 7
and 8. If not, jump ahead to Step 9.
7. Choose a markup method and enter an amount or percentage to mark
up the item.
Peachtree allows you to change prices on the selected items by an
amount or a percentage. If you select Amount, enter the amount as a
positive or negative dollar amount. If you select Percent, enter the
amount as a positive or negative percentage (for example, enter 6 for a 6
percent markup).
Figure 11-10:
Peachtree
displays

selection.
230
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Enter a negative number if you want to mark down the current price.
8. From the Round New Value To drop-down list, select a method for
rounding the new prices:
• Next Dollar: Peachtree rounds the item prices up to the nearest
dollar amount. For example, if you increase the price of a product
you previously sold for $11.60 by 15 percent, the calculated price
is $13.34, but Peachtree rounds the new price up to $14.
• Specific Cent: Use this if you want to round all prices up to a speci-
fied cent level. For example, at a 95-cent price level, your products
would sell for $5.95, $7.95, $11.95, and so on. If you choose Specific
Cent, specify the cents (95, in our example) in the Amount field.
• Do Not Round: Select this if you don’t want the prices rounded.
9. Click the Recalc toolbar button (as shown here) to see the new item
prices.
You can also manually change individual prices by simply typing in a
new price in the appropriate price box.
Click the Detail button, as shown in the margin, to display additional
information about an item or click the Print button to print a report of
your proposed price adjustments.
10. Click the Save button to record the new prices.
11. Click the Close button to close the Maintain Item Prices dialog box.
When Does Peachtree Assign 
a Cost to Items?
We’ll be honest here. This section is Booooring with a capital B. You certainly
don’t have to read this information, but our experience shows that many
clients want to know how the Peachtree inventory system works — not just the
mechanics of entering items or transactions, but what’s happening behind the
scenes. We don’t give you any steps or tasks to accomplish — just some plain
old facts about inventory.
This whole inventory state of affairs can be confusing. You probably already
noticed that the Peachtree inventory module is perfect for a buy/sell situation —
where you purchase a product and then resell it — but it doesn’t work very well
231
Chapter 11: Counting Your Stuff

for tracking raw materials used in production, especially if scrap is involved.
Add that factor to all the different item transactions that can affect the cost, and
sometimes the entire picture becomes blurred.
Peachtree calculates the value of inventory items on a daily basis. To ensure
that increases to inventory are posted before decreases to inventory,
Peachtree posts transactions in the following order:
1. Purchases
2. Payments
3. Increase adjustments
4. Assembly builds (for an assembly item)
5. Sales returns
6. Receipts return
7. Assembly unbuilds (for a component item)
8. Purchase returns
9. Payment returns
10. Assembly unbuilds (for an assembly item)
11. Sales
12. Receipts
13. Decrease adjustments
14. Assembly builds (for a component item)
Peachtree creates three types of system-generated adjustments: the purchase
return adjustment, the assembly unbuild adjustment, and the system cost
adjustment. You can’t erase these types of adjustments. They appear in the
Inventory Adjustment Journal and on the Item Costing report. The reference
for a system cost adjustment is SysCost, the reference for a purchase return
adjustment is the reference number of the purchase transaction (usually the
invoice number), and the reference for the assembly unbuild adjustment is
the reference number of the assembly unbuild transaction.
Figure 11-11 shows an inventory adjustment journal with a system-generated
cost (SysCost) adjustment.

Reporting on Your Inventory
Here comes the spiel you see in many other chapters: Although it would be
nice to print a sample of every report Peachtree offers (especially in this
chapter because Peachtree has a number of valuable inventory reports),
there simply isn’t space in this book to do so. In Table 11-2, we provide you
with a description of the reports that pertain to maintaining your inventory.
(Chapter 14 describes how to print and customize reports.) Many inventory
reports offer only stock and assembly item information.

One report you should definitely know is the Inventory Valuation report,
which shows the quantity on hand, value, average cost, and percent of inven-
tory value for all in-stock items. To arrive at the percent of inventory value,
Peachtree takes the value of the item divided by the total value of items that
have a positive item value. The example in Table 11-3 shows you how the per-
cent-to-total value works.

In Table 11-3, Peachtree calculates the percent of inventory on the percent of
the positive item values (items 1 and 3), which equal $10 + $20, or $30.
Therefore, the 33.33% of inventory means that the $10 total value for those
items are one-third of the $30 total, and the 66.67% of inventory shows the
$20 total is two-thirds of the $30 total.

Chapter 12
Tracking Project Costs
In This Chapter
 Creating estimates and jobs
 Creating phase codes and cost codes
 Using jobs for invoicing
S
ome businesses lend themselves well to organizing work by projects. 
For the purposes of this discussion, project is synonymous with job. In 
particular, these companies perform the same general type of work for each
customer — that is, all their projects are similar. Companies that use job 
costing (assigning costs to jobs) in their business want to track expenses and
revenues for each job so that they can determine the net profit from the job.
These companies often bid for the services they sell by providing a proposal
that estimates the cost of performing the work. Then, if they get the work,
they want to compare the estimated costs with the actual costs so that they
can improve their estimating skills for future jobs and thus increase revenues.
In this chapter, we describe the job-costing features available in Peachtree
Complete and higher. In Peachtree Pro Accounting, you can create jobs but
not phases or cost codes, which are fields that enable you to capture more
details about jobs. Peachtree First Accounting doesn’t support job costing.
One of the vertical market Peachtree products, Peachtree for Construction,
contains even more job-costing features than described here.
Understanding Job Costing
What kinds of companies use job costing? Well, job costing is widely used in
the construction industry, but it also can be used by a variety of other busi-
nesses, such as convention planning, party planning, landscaping, cleaning
services, and printing (like when producing letterhead).
Do you need to use job costing? If the jobs you perform tend to stretch out
over time, particularly across accounting years, you’re more likely to use job
costing. However, if you complete a job in a short period of time — a week or

less — you probably don’t need to use the Peachtree job-costing feature
because the time you’d spend entering job information would exceed the
value you’d receive from that information.
Creating custom fields for jobs
In Chapter 4, we set up defaults for other areas of Peachtree; for jobs, you
can establish only custom fields because this feature has no other prefer-
ences to set. Choose Maintain➪Default Information➪Jobs to display the Job
Defaults dialog box. Place a check mark next to any of the five field labels to
enable the custom field. Then type a label description for each custom field.
Click OK when you’re finished.
Reviewing job examples
Before you dive in and start creating things, we think you’d benefit by exam-
ining a few examples that will help you better understand the order in which
we choose to create things after you read these examples.
Jobs are a method of organizing accounting information. Throughout this chap-
ter, we explain the various facets of jobs by using a running example: a company
that builds swimming pools. Consider each swimming pool that the company
builds as a separate job.
Phases
You can use phases to further break down the costs of a project. Phases are
optional; use them only if you want to organize your project in some way and
look at costs and revenues at a more detailed level. In the case of our swimming
pool builder, we might use five phases:
 Design

Peachtree allows you to assign each phase to a cost type: Labor, Materials,
Subcontract Labor, Equipment Rental, and Other.
238
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Cost codes
If you need a further breakdown of any of these cost types for a particular
phase — for example, if you need to track the costs of specific materials,
such as concrete and tile — you can create cost codes. If you choose to create
cost codes for a phase, you won’t assign a cost type to the phase. Instead,
you can assign a cost type to each cost code; Peachtree uses the same cost
types for cost codes and phases.
Cost codes, like phases, are optional. You might find that you need cost codes
for only one cost type, such as Labor. You can set up specific cost codes for
Materials — such as tile, lumber, and concrete — and then assign those cost
codes as needed to phases. For phases that don’t need a cost code, you can
simply use the phase — and its cost type.
If you use cost codes, we recommend that you try to use the same ones for
every project. That way, you can set up one set of cost codes and assign
them, as needed, to any phase of any project. You might also be able to use
the same phases (or a subset of phases) for each project.
Consider one more example. Suppose that you manage an apartment com-
plex, and you want to monitor the costs associated with each building on the
property. You could set up each building as a job. Then, as you make pur-
chases for a particular building, you can assign the purchases to that build-
ing. Your job reports show you the costs of each building in the complex.
Note that we haven’t suggested using phases or cost codes because they’re
optional.
Suppose, however, that you want to track costs for the complex at a more
detailed level — say, by apartment. In that case, you could set up the apartments
in each building as phases and assign expenses to particular apartments.
“So what’s your point? Why are you telling me all this now?” you ask. Well,
when setting up a job in Peachtree, you must decide whether the job uses
phases. Similarly, when setting up a phase, you must decide whether the
phase uses cost codes. You need to understand what each entity is so that
you know what to create and the order in which to create things.
Creating Cost Codes
After you understand what cost codes are, you can use the following steps to
create them if you need to use them:
1. Choose Maintain➪Job Costs➪Cost Codes.
Peachtree displays the Maintain Cost Codes window (see Figure 12-1).
239
Chapter 12: Tracking Project Costs

2. In the Cost Code ID text box, type an ID (up to 20 alphanumeric char-
acters).
You can change the ID later by using the Change ID button on the
window toolbar.
3. In the Description text box, type a description for the cost code.
4. Select a cost type for the cost code to categorize it in a general way.
You can select Labor, Materials, Equipment, Subcontractors, or Other.
5. Click the Save button (as shown here).
Repeat these steps to set up other cost codes you need for your phases.
If you no longer need a cost code, you can mark it inactive. To do so, redis-
play the cost code in the Maintain Cost Codes window and select the Inactive
check box.
Establishing Phases
If you decide to use phases for your jobs, use these steps to create a phase:
1. Choose Maintain➪Job Costs➪Phases.
Peachtree displays the Maintain Phases window (see Figure 12-2).
2. In the Phase ID text box, type an ID (up to 20 alphanumeric characters).
You can change the ID later by using the Change ID button on the
window toolbar.
Figure 12-1:
Create a
cost code.
240
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

3. In the Description text box, type a description for the phase.
4. Decide whether to use cost codes:
• If you don’t plan to use cost codes: Select the This Phase Uses the
Cost Type radio button and then select a cost type for the phase to
categorize it in a general way. You can select Labor, Materials,
Equipment, Subcontractors, or Other.
• If you plan to use cost codes for the phase: Select the This Phase
Uses Cost Codes option. Peachtree disables the ability to select a
cost type.
5. Click the Save button.
Repeat these steps to set up other phases you need for your jobs.
If you no longer need a phase, you can mark it as inactive. To do so, redisplay
the phase in the Maintain Phases window and add a check mark to the
Inactive check box.
Creating Jobs and Estimates
To use jobs in Peachtree, you need to set up at least one job. To set up a job,
follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Job Costs➪Jobs.
Peachtree displays the Maintain Jobs window (see Figure 12-3).
Figure 12-2:
Create a
phase that
uses cost
codes.
241
Chapter 12: Tracking Project Costs

2. Type the job ID.
You can use up to 20 alphanumeric characters, excluding an asterisk (*),
a question mark (?), and a plus sign (+). IDs are not case sensitive, so
POOL-1 is the same as pool-1. See the sidebar, “Job reports and masking”
for hints on assigning job IDs.
You can change the job ID later by redisplaying the job and then clicking
the Change ID button (as shown here). Peachtree displays the Change
Job ID dialog box, which shows you the current job ID and lets you enter
a new one.
3. In the Description text box, provide a description for the job.
4. If the job uses phases, select the Use Phases check box.
5. (Optional) On the General tab, fill in any pertinent information.
Peachtree doesn’t limit the number of jobs you can assign to customers,
but you don’t need to assign jobs to customers. If you don’t need jobs
for any reason other than charging customers for expenses, you can use
time and expense slips. See Chapter 10 for details.
6. If you work on the job before you enter it in Peachtree and you have
historical revenues and expenses for the job, do the following:
If you use phases and cost codes with your job, you can enter beginning
balances by phase and cost code instead of by job.
Figure 12-3:
Set up a job
in this
window.
242
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

a. Click the Job Beginning Balances button to display the Job Beginning
Balances window. Use the Job Entries tab of the Job Beginning
Balances window to enter beginning balances.
From the Job Balances tab of the window, you can view the begin-
ning balance of all jobs in the system.
b. To enter a beginning balance, enter a date for the balance you intend
to enter and a beginning balance in either the Expenses column or
the Revenues column.
You can enter balances for more than one date.
For reporting purposes, put the phase expenses on one line and
the phase revenues on another line.
7. When you finish entering beginning balances, click Save to redisplay
the Maintain Jobs window.
8. Click the Estimated Expenses & Revenue tab to enter estimated
expenses and revenues.
These estimates are optional. In Figure 12-4, you see the Estimated
Expenses & Revenue tab for a job that uses phases. If you don’t use
phases with your job, you see only two text boxes: one for total esti-
mated expenses and one for total estimated revenues.
9. Click Save to store the job’s information.

Chapter 12: Tracking Project Costs

When you complete a job, you can mark it inactive. To do so, redisplay the
job in the Maintain Jobs window and select the Inactive check box.
Assigning Jobs When You Buy
Suppose that you’re buying something to use on a job and you want to assign
the expense to the job. To do so, use the Purchase Orders window, the
Purchases/Receive Inventory window, or the Payments window. The method
is the same, regardless of the window you choose. In the following steps, we
show you the process in the Purchases/Receive Inventory window:
1. Choose Tasks➪Purchases/Receive Inventory.
Peachtree displays the Purchases/Receive Inventory window (see 
Figure 12-5).
2. Fill in the purchase information at the top of the window, like you
would for any purchase.
See Chapter 5 for details on completing a purchase.
244
Part II: The Daily Drudge 
Job reports and masking
Some job reports enable you to filter jobs using a job mask, which can be useful if you have several
different characteristics about each job that you want to track. For one type of information you want
to track, you can use the Job Type field. For the rest, you can use a coding scheme for the job ID.
Suppose, for example, that you work in three cities — Phoenix, Glendale, and Scottsdale — doing
design, planting, and maintenance. You also want to differentiate jobs for residential and commer-
cial customers. You can use the Job Type field to store the information about design, planting, and
maintenance. Then you can create a coding scheme for the job ID that will enable you to use mask-
ing to print reports that display information on a subset of jobs. In the example, you might want to
create a ten-character job ID that is composed of one character (P, G, or S) representing the city,
one character (C or R) representing commercial or residential, four characters representing the
customer’s name, and four characters representing a job number. On most job reports, you can
filter by Job Type and then mask for Phoenix jobs by typing P********* in the Job Mask field. You
could mask for commercial jobs in Scottsdale by typing SC******** or residential jobs in Glendale
by typing GR********. To use the mask, you supply asterisks for the characters that can change;
the total number of characters you type is equal to the length of the job ID.

3. In the bottom portion of the window, enter the information for the
item that you’re purchasing.
You can’t purchase a stock inventory item to use on a job. If you already
own a stock item that you want to use on a job, you can enter an inven-
tory adjustment (see Chapter 11), or you can place the item on the cus-
tomer’s invoice. If you invoice the customer, you don’t need to make the
inventory adjustment.
4. In the Job column, click the list indicator and make a selection to
assign the line to a job.
If the job uses phases or cost codes, you see a folder (as shown here) in
the list representing the job. You need to click the folder to open it and
select the appropriate phase or cost code.
As you can see in Figure 12-5, when you open the Job list, it partially
overlays the Amount box.
5. Continue entering lines as needed.
You can include lines that you assign to jobs and lines that you don’t
assign to jobs on the same purchase.
6. Click the Save button (as shown here) to save the purchase.

Chapter 12: Tracking Project Costs

Invoicing Customers’ Jobs
By default, Peachtree creates reimbursable expenses for purchases you
assign to jobs, and you can include these reimbursable expenses on an
invoice to a customer. You also can choose not to include these reimbursable
expenses on customer invoices.
Follow these steps to work with reimbursable expenses generated by assign-
ing jobs to purchases or payments:
1. Choose Tasks➪Sales/Invoicing.
Peachtree displays the Sales/Invoicing window.
2. Fill in the invoice information at the top of the window, like you
would for any invoice.
For details on filling in an invoice, see Chapter 7.
3. In the bottom portion of the window, enter one line of information for
each of the items that you’re selling.
4. In the Job column, click the list indicator to assign the lines to a job,
as appropriate.
5. To include a reimbursable expense on an invoice, click the Apply
Tickets/Expenses button in the lower left of the window.
Peachtree displays the Apply Tickets/Reimbursable Expenses window
(see Figure 12-6).
You won’t know whether reimbursable expenses exist for a customer
until you click the Apply Tickets/Expenses button.
Figure 12-6:
Bill the
selected
customer
for any or all
of these re-
imbursable
expenses.
246
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

6. Click the Reimbursable Expenses tab to see expenses you entered and
assigned to a job in the Purchases/Inventory window and the
Payments window.
If you ignored our advice and assigned an expense to a job in the Write
Checks window, that expense will also appear on the Reimbursable
Expenses tab.
7. To include a reimbursable expense on the invoice, select the Use
check box next to that reimbursable expense.
8. To build some profit into a reimbursable expense, change the amount
in the Invoice Amt column.
To mark up or down a group of reimbursable expenses, click the
WriteUp toolbar button (as shown here) to display the Select
Reimbursables to Write Up/Down dialog box, where you can identify
reimbursable expenses to mark up or down by either a dollar amount or
a percentage.
If you change your mind after marking up reimbursable expenses, you
can click the Remove WriteUp button (as shown here) that appears
immediately to the right of the WriteUp button. (We know it’s confusing
because they both seem to be called WriteUp, but you can point your
mouse at each button to display a ToolTip that describes each button’s
function. The Remove WriteUp button image is the universal No sign.)
When you use reimbursable expenses, keep these points in mind:
 You can delete reimbursable expenses from the Apply Tickets/
Reimbursable Expenses window if you decide not to bill the client for
them. Place a check mark in the Del check box to the right of the expense.
Deleting the reimbursable expense does not delete the transaction that
created the reimbursable expense. Instead, deleting in the Apply Tickets/
Reimbursable Expenses window breaks the tie between the reimbursable
expense and the customer.
You can’t undo deleting here. After you delete a reimbursable expense,
the connection between the reimbursable expense and the customer is
permanently broken unless you erase the purchase or payment that cre-
ated the reimbursable expense and reenter it.
 Be aware that deleting or using a reimbursable expense makes it disap-
pear from the Apply Tickets/Reimbursable Expenses window. If you use
a reimbursable expense and subsequently delete the line from the
invoice, the reimbursable expense does not reappear in the window. If
you mistakenly use a reimbursable expense and post the invoice, delete
the invoice and reenter it.
247
Chapter 12: Tracking Project Costs

 You can edit a reimbursable expense you intend to bill to a customer by
editing the purchase or payment that assigns the expense to a job. To
find the transaction, open the window where you first created it — for
example, the Purchases/Receive Inventory window — and click the List
button.
Progress Billing
In Peachtree Premium and higher, you use proposals when you want to bill a
customer based on the progress of a job. Proposals function in much the same
way that quotes and sales orders function: They are documents you prepare
prior to actually selling something and they do not update your General
Ledger accounts. See Chapter 7 for details on using quotes and sales orders.
Proposals differ from quotes and sales orders after a customer accepts a pro-
posal and you want to prepare the customer’s invoice. The proposal gives
you added flexibility that you don’t have when you invoice from a quote or a
sales order. When you invoice from a proposal, you can bill the customer for
a percentage of the amount due or for specific lines of the proposal; or, you
can bill your customer for the remaining unbilled portion of the job.
Initially, you prepare a proposal the same way that you prepare a quote. In
Figure 12-7, you can see a completed sample of an accepted proposal in the
Proposals window. To view this window, choose Tasks➪Quotes/Sales
Orders/Proposals➪Proposals.
Figure 12-7:
A typical
proposal.
248
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

You can assign lines of the proposal to jobs the same way that you assign
lines to an invoice, as described in the preceding section, “Invoicing
Customers’ Jobs.” In fact, if you intend to use jobs, you must include the job
line assignments on the proposal; you won’t have an opportunity after you
mark a proposal as accepted by a customer. You can, of course, wait to make
job assignments until you’re ready to mark a proposal as accepted. However,
make sure that you edit the proposal before you accept it to assign jobs to
lines of the proposal.
You can print or e-mail proposals the same way that you can print or e-mail
quotes or sales orders. If you intend to print a proposal, don’t assign a
number; Peachtree will assign the number when you print the document.
The two options of most interest on a proposal appear just below the pro-
posal number. You edit a proposal and select the Accept Proposal check box
when the customer agrees that you should provide the goods or perform the
services on the proposal. After you enable this check box, Peachtree makes
the proposal available for invoicing in the Sales/Invoicing window.
Select the Close Proposal check box after you complete invoicing the pro-
posal and it still contains goods or services that you won’t provide. If you
invoice for all the items listed on the proposal, Peachtree automatically
closes the proposal for you.
Like with other documents in Peachtree, you can display a list of proposals
either by clicking the List button in the Proposals window or by choosing
Lists➪Customers & Sales➪Proposals. We suggest that you add the Accept
Proposal column to the Proposal List window so that you can see at a glance
whether a proposal has been accepted. See Bonus Chapter 1 on this book’s
Web site for details on customizing a list window to add or remove columns.
To invoice for a proposal, open the Sales/Invoicing window and select the
customer for whom a proposal exists. You might see a message indicating
that the customer has open and accepted proposals; click OK.
If both proposals and sales orders exist for the customer, Peachtree displays
the Apply to Sales Order No. tab; otherwise, you see the Apply to Proposal
No. tab. Open the list box on the tab and select the proposal you want to
invoice (see Figure 12-8).
When both proposals and sales order exist, you can view proposals by clicking
the list box beside the tab name and selecting View Proposals; then reopen the
box and select the appropriate proposal number.
249
Chapter 12: Tracking Project Costs

After you select a proposal to view, Peachtree displays the Select Percentage
to Bill dialog box, as shown in Figure 12-9. If you select either of the first two
options in this dialog box, Peachtree fills in appropriate amounts for you on
the invoice. If you select the last option, you must manually fill in either a
percentage or an amount for each line of the proposal that you want to bill.
If you select the first option, Peachtree transfers the freight amount, if any,
from the proposal to the invoice.
Regardless of the option you select in the Select Percentage to Bill dialog box,
you cannot assign lines of the invoice to a job. You need to edit the proposal
before you accept it to assign jobs to lines of the proposal.

Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Adding Overhead to a Job
To run your business, you incur certain expenses that accountants call over-
head — expenses such as telephone, postage, and electricity. You can think
of overhead expenses as expenses you incur even if you don’t sell anything.
(Of course, you wouldn’t incur overhead for long if you didn’t sell anything —
because you’d go out of business! — but you get our drift.)
If your company uses job costing, you probably want to divide your overhead
and assign it to jobs. There’s no standard method to do this in Peachtree
unless you use the Construction version of Peachtree Premium or higher, but
you can do it. The method we describe assumes that you know the amount of
overhead to add to each job. It could be a percentage of the expenses you
incur or an hourly rate. If you don’t know, you need to ask your accountant to
figure out the overhead burden rate for you.
After you have the rate from your accountant, you need to know your
expenses by job so that you can apply the overhead burden rate to each job.
We suggest that you customize the Job Ledger report. Choose 
Reports & Forms➪Jobs, select the Job Ledger report, and click Options. 
In the Other Options section, click Columns. On the Columns tab, include the
following fields: Job ID, Job Description, Phase ID, Cost Code ID, Transaction
Date, Transaction Description, Actual Expenses, and Hours with Totals. 
When you print the report, you have all the information you need to apply
the burden rate to your expenses and then assign the overhead to various 
jobs. You might want to export the report to Excel and calculate the burden
amount there (you know, burden rate × expense amount). For more informa-
tion on customizing reports, see Chapter 14.
Okay. After you calculate the overhead amount, enter the amount into
Peachtree by using a journal entry.
For this task, you need a suspense account. We use a suspense account to
handle amounts that are temporary in nature. You can set up a suspense
account as any kind of account: asset, liability, income, or expense. We sug-
gest that you make it an account you’re likely to notice if it appears on
reports because, ultimately, your suspense account shouldn’t have a non-
zero balance. For help in creating an account, see Chapter 3.
Add your suspense account to the accounts you display in the Business
Status center so that you can see at a glance whether it has a non-zero bal-
ance. See Bonus Chapter 2 on this book’s Web site for details on adding an
account to the Business Status center.
251
Chapter 12: Tracking Project Costs

To assign overhead to a job, you make a journal entry. Don’t worry — it’s
easy. (For more details on entering journal entries, see Chapter 17.) Follow
these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪General Journal Entry.
Peachtree displays the General Journal Entry window (see Figure 12-10).
2. Supply a Date and a Reference number for the journal entry but
ignore the Reverse Transaction check box.
3. Supply two lines of the same amount for every overhead amount you
want to assign, choosing the Suspense account on both lines.
4. Assign the job to the Debit line, not the Credit line.
5. Click Save to save the entry.
This journal entry debits and credits the same account, which makes the
entry have no effect on your books. However, assigning the job to the debit
side of the transaction allocates the overhead expense to the job.
Reporting on the Job
Table 12-1 shows a list of the other reports that relate to job costing. You can
exclude balance forward information on the Job Ledger, the Job Profitability
report, and the Job Register. See Chapter 14 to find out how to print reports.

The Fancy Stuff

In this part . . .
I
n this part, we cover many of the tasks you don’t do
every day. First, we show you how to customize forms
and produce and modify reports. After all, you put infor-
mation into Peachtree, so you should be able to get it out
and see the effects of your business habits. Then we cover
reconciling the bank statement and the stuff you do
monthly, quarterly, or annually. This part also contains a
chapter that shows you how to easily keep your account-
ing information safe — a very important chapter. Why?
Because you spend so much time putting stuff into
Peachtree that it would be criminal to lose it just because
your hard drive crashes or your office is robbed.
Lastly, we provide some real-life situations encountered
by people just like you and suggest ways you might
handle similar situations.

Chapter 13
Working with Forms
In This Chapter
 Previewing and printing forms
 E-mailing your forms
 Customizing your forms
U
nderstanding the differences among the types of information you 
produce with Peachtree is important. Peachtree provides three types 
of documents: forms, reports, and financial statements. In this chapter, we
discuss forms, which Peachtree defines as documents you exchange with
your customers, vendors, or employees.
Reports are typically specific to a module such as Accounts Payable or Payroll
and provide feedback about one or more customers, vendors, employees, 
or inventory items. Financial statements tell you the overall value of your
company and whether the company as a whole made or lost money. You can
find out about reports in Chapter 14 and financial statements in Chapter 15.
You can print forms on preprinted forms or on blank paper. You can purchase
preprinted forms from your local printer, or you can use the offers you receive
in your Peachtree software box. Chapter 21 lists Web contact information on
Deluxe Forms, a great source for all types of forms and envelopes.
If you contact Deluxe Forms at 800-328-0304 and reference this book and 
discount code R03578, you’ll receive 20 percent off your first order.
Printing Forms
You use essentially the same steps for printing all forms whether you’re printing
a quote, purchase order, check, or customer invoice. Peachtree can print
your forms one at a time or together in a batch. Peachtree also provides

258
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 
forms for printing customer, vendor, and employee labels as well as collection
letters, 1099s, and various payroll forms, such as W-2s and 941 reports.
A variety of forms are available, and you can customize almost any form.
Previewing forms in the document window
Because Peachtree has several forms, you might want to see what your
quote, purchase order, check, or invoice would look like in each form. You
can use the Preview feature to examine the transaction:
1. Display the transaction you want to preview on the screen.
If necessary, click the List button, as shown in the margin, and then
select a previously posted transaction.
2. Click the drop-down arrow on the Print button (as shown here) and
then choose Print Preview.
The Preview Forms dialog box appears, listing the available forms (see
Figure 13-1). The forms listed vary depending on the transaction type.
3. If you want to change the form, do the following:
a. Click the Select Form button (as shown in the margin).
Peachtree assumes that you want to use the same form you used
the last time you printed, but the Select Form button lets you
select a different form. The Preview Forms dialog box appears.
b. Select the form you want to print and then click OK.
Form being used

Choose the
form that
best suits
your needs.

4. Click Print Preview.
5. Click anywhere on the form to enlarge the view; click a second time
to enlarge the view even more (see Figure 13-2).
No need to strain your eyes. Whenever the mouse pointer turns into a
magnifying glass, you can click to zoom in or out on the form.
You can click the Close button (as shown here) if you need to make
changes to the transaction. Peachtree redisplays the transaction
window.
6. To print the transaction on the selected form, click the Print button, as
shown in the margin.
Peachtree prints the form, saves the transaction, and returns you to a
blank transaction window.
Printing from the document window
In the preceding section, you discover how to preview and then print a docu-
ment from the preview window. If you don’t want to preview the document,
you can print directly from the data entry window.
Figure 13-2:
Click on the

259
Chapter 13: Working with Forms

To print a form, follow these steps:
1. With a document displayed in the window, click the Print button (or
press Ctrl+P).
You see the Print Forms dialog box, like the one shown in Figure 13-1.
2. Verify the transaction number, printer, number of copies, and form name.
If you didn’t manually enter a transaction number in the data entry
screen, Peachtree automatically uses the next number.
Peachtree maintains a different series of numbers for each form type.
For example, checks have a different numbering system from purchase
orders or customer invoices.
If you are using Peachtree Premium or higher and you want to replace
the inventory item ID on your form with either the item’s UPS/SKU
number or part number, select an option from the Replace Item ID With
drop-down list. See Chapter 11 for more information about inventory
item IDs and UPC/SKU and part numbers.
To test the form alignment, click the Print Sample button (as shown
here) to print practice forms. You see Xs and 9s on the form where
words and numbers will appear.
3. Click the Print button, as shown in the margin.
Peachtree automatically saves a transaction after printing. Saving a
transaction posts the transaction, and if applicable, updates the General
Ledger as well.
Printing forms in a batch
Sometimes, when you’re entering data such as invoices, you don’t want to
stop and go through the steps to print each invoice separately. In this case,
you might like the Peachtree batch printing feature.
If you want to print several invoices at the same time, create each invoice
without assigning an invoice number and then click the Save button.
Whenever you’re ready to print your transactions, Peachtree can print all
unnumbered invoices at the same time. You can batch print any form except
receipts and deposit tickets.
The following steps show you how you can batch print forms, such as state-
ments, quotes, sales orders, purchase orders, and checks:
1. Click Reports & Forms➪Forms and then select the form type you want
to print.
Peachtree displays the Select a Report or Form window.
260
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

2. From the Forms section, select the form you want to use.
A sample of the form previews on the right side of the dialog box.
3. Click the Preview and Print button, as shown in the margin.
The Preview and Print dialog box specific to the form you selected
appears. The appearance of the dialog box varies based on the form you
select.
4. Click the Refresh List button, as shown here.
A list of all the unprinted transactions matching your selection appears.
(See Figure 13-3.)
If you don’t want to print a specific transaction, deselect the check box
next to the transaction.
5. Verify the beginning transaction number and that the correct form
name appears in the Use this form box.
6. (Optional) In the lower-left portion of the dialog box, set any desired
filter options.
You can select a forms printing method from the Print dialog box as well
and select to send only e-mailed forms, only paper forms, or both.
Peachtree looks at the default method for sending forms assigned to
each vendor (Chapter 5) or customer (Chapter 7). The next section
shows you how Peachtree handles e-mailing forms.
Click the Refresh List button again to update the transaction list.
Figure 13-3:

7. Click the Print Setup tab, and if desired, change the printer or number
of copies.
8. (Optional) If you’re e-mailing forms, click the E-mail Options tab and
review the e-mail actions and options.
If you’re printing checks, the E-mail Options tab isn’t available.
9. Click the Print/E-mail button, as shown in the margin.
After printing the forms, Peachtree displays a dialog box asking whether
the forms printed properly.
10. Answer the dialog box by clicking Yes or No:
• Yes: Peachtree assigns the numbers to the forms.
• No: The forms remain unnumbered, and you need to reprint them.
11. Click the Close button.
The Select a Report or Form window closes.
E-mailing Forms
Some customers or vendors prefer that you e-mail their forms instead of
making the trek to the mailbox (or even worse, the post office). Many trans-
action windows allow you to send e-mail copies in place of or in addition to
paper forms. Peachtree provides a place to store an e-mail address in the
Maintain Customer or the Maintain Vendor screen. You have the option of
e-mailing the form to the stored address or to one you type in when e-mailing
the form.
Most forms are eligible for e-mailing. You can e-mail invoices, statements, col-
lection letters, sales orders, and purchase orders. You can’t e-mail deposit
tickets, receipts, customer or vendor labels, any payroll forms, and (for obvi-
ous reasons) vendor or payroll checks.
To generate e-mail in Peachtree, you use a MAPI-compliant, default e-mail
application such as Outlook or Outlook Express. If your default e-mail system
is AOL, you won’t be able to send e-mail alerts from Peachtree because AOL
isn’t a fully MAPI-compliant e-mail application.
During batch printing, if you’re e-mailing forms, Peachtree provides several
additional options. The E-mail Options tab, available with most forms,
addresses how you want Peachtree to manage the printing. To see the
options, click the E-mail Options tab of the Preview and Print option window.
(See Figure 13-4.)You decide: whether you want to e-mail only the form, both
e-mail the form and generate a paper copy, or print only a paper copy.
262
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

Additionally, you can assign a different e-mail numbering system to e-mailed
invoices and you can select the Show Me Each E-mail Before Sending option
which allows you to see and optionally manually edit the individual e-mail
messages before they are sent. We recommend you leave this option
checked.
If you’re not batch printing the forms you want to e-mail, you need to display
the transaction:
1. In a transaction window — for example, the Sales/Invoicing window —
click the E-mail button (as shown here).
The E-Mail Forms window appears so that you can confirm the transac-
tion number and the form name. You can assign a different numbering
sequence to e-mailed forms.
2. Click the Send button.
Peachtree launches your e-mail program and automatically inserts the
recipient information as stored in your Peachtree customer or vendor
file. If your Peachtree options specified to send a copy to a sales or
buyers representative, their e-mail information appears in the Cc line
(see Figure 13-5).
3. To change the recipients, type a different e-mail address, or if avail-
able, click the address book icon and then select a recipient from the
address book.
4. Click the Send button.
Figure 13-4:
Change
e-mail forms
options.
263
Chapter 13: Working with Forms

When e-mailing a form, Peachtree sends the form as a PDF (Portable Document
Format) attachment. To view or print the form, the recipient must have the
Adobe Reader software, which is a free download from the Internet at www.
adobe.com/reader. The e-mail body also contains a link to obtain the free
PDF reader.
Customizing Forms
You can customize any form to better meet your needs. You can move, add,
or delete fields; change fonts; and even add graphical images. You begin by
taking a standard form and customizing it the way you want. After customiz-
ing the form, you save it with a different form name. Peachtree protects the
original forms by not letting you save changes to the original form name.
Exploring the Form Design window
The Forms Design window enables you to create customized forms or edit
existing forms to match the needs of your business. To use the Forms Design
window, follow these steps:
1. Choose Reports & Forms➪Forms and select the form type you want to
modify.
The Select a Report or Form window appears.
2. In the Forms list, select the form you want to modify.
Figure 13-5:
Send forms
directly to
your
customer’s
e-mail
address.
264
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

3. Click once on the form you want to modify and then click the
Customize button, as shown in the margin.
The selected report appears in Forms Design view (see Figure 13-6).
If you accidentally double-click the desired form, Peachtree assumes you want
to print it, not modify its design. It displays a dialog box containing filter and
format options that you can set before printing. Click the Cancel button, and
be sure to click only once on the form that you want to modify. Then you can
click the Customize button.
Maximize the design window for optimal viewing.
The design window has two main parts: the toolbars and the design area, which
displays the fields and objects currently in use. The design area contains
Peachtree data field objects, text objects, and other objects such as rectangles
or pictures. Four of the five forms toolbars appear in the design window. Each
toolbar has a specific function:
Figure 13-6:
A customer

Forms
Design
view.
265
Chapter 13: Working with Forms

 Main toolbar: Located at the top of the Forms Design window. Use this
toolbar to accomplish many common steps, including saving the form
and closing the design window.
 Object toolbar: Use this toolbar, located on the left of your screen, to
select, insert, delete, align, or resize form objects.
Use the Select tool, the first tool on the Object toolbar, to select objects
that you want to move, modify, or delete.
 Properties toolbar: Use this toolbar to determine an object’s content,
size, order, position, and appearance. The Properties toolbar resides
along the bottom of the design window.
 Cursor Position toolbar: Located next to the Properties toolbar along
the bottom edge of the window. Use this toolbar to determine the mouse
pointer position. You find this helpful when sizing or aligning objects.
 Formatting toolbar: Use the Formatting toolbar to change the font,
color, or background of the selected form object. The Formatting toolbar
appears in the middle of your screen and might not be on by default.
You can turn on and off any toolbar at any time by selecting an option from
the Options menu.
Everything on a form is a type of object. You can find data field objects, text
objects, shaped objects, and even grouped objects. The two main object
types you find on a form are
 Data field object: This is the most common object you see. When print-
ing the form, Peachtree obtains information, either from the Maintain
window or from the Tasks window, and places it in the data field objects.
Peachtree displays data field objects with brackets around them, such
as <Customer Name and Address>. In Figure 13-6, you see the data
field <Company Name>.
 Text object: This is the second–most-common form object. This is text
that always prints the same specific words, such as Sold to or Thank you
for your business. You can easily identify text objects because you just
read them on the screen, and they don’t have brackets around them. In
Figure 13-6, you see the words Invoice Number which is a text object.
Modifying screen options
You can control how the Forms Design window appears. Click the Options
button on the Main toolbar, as shown here in the margin. The Forms Design
Options dialog box appears with two tabs. If you click the Display tab, you
can make the following choices:
266
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

 Ruler: Choose this option to display a ruler on the top and left sides of
the Forms Design window.
 Placeholder Text: Choose this option to display sample placeholder text
in the form of xXXXX for text fields, or -NNNN.nn for numeric fields.
 Fold Marks: Choose this option to print fold marks on the form, which
are small dashes that show you where to fold the printed form in order
for it to fit into a standard envelope.
 Commands: Choose this option if you want to display command objects
as a red C in a small gray box on the form you’re working with.
Commands do not print on the form. Command objects tell the printer
to read the next line of data or that you are finished with the form and
are ready to print the next form.
 Margin Cropping: Choose this option to trim objects outside the mar-
gins of the form. We don’t recommend you use this option. Instead, if an
object hangs over the margin, resize or move the object.
 Outline OLE Objects: Choose this option to place a non-printing border
around graphic OLE objects, such as logos.
 Order Number: Choose this option if you want to display the order num-
bers next to each object. Order numbers appear as red numbers in a
yellow block and represent the order in which the fields appear on the
form.
Click the Grid/Copies tab to manage the ruled grid that appears on the
window. You can also enter the default number of copies to print.
Selecting objects
You can select multiple form objects to perform a common task in a single
step. For example, you might want to copy a group of objects, move them,
align them, change their font, or change their color. Peachtree provides two
ways to select multiple objects:
 With the Selection tool: Click the first object with your mouse pointer,
and then hold down the Ctrl key and click a second object. Each
selected object displays a blue outline with blue boxes or size handles
around it. Continue holding down the Ctrl key and select as many
objects as you want; then release the Ctrl key.
 With the Selection tool: Click and drag an imaginary box around the
group of objects you want. When you release the mouse button, all the
objects within your marquee border are selected.
267
Chapter 13: Working with Forms

If you want to select all the objects on your form, press Ctrl+A or choose
Edit➪Select All. If you select the wrong object, click anywhere in a blank area
of the window to deselect the object.
Moving form objects
You won’t throw your back out moving form design objects. You can move an
object by selecting it and dragging it to a new location.
You can move an object also by selecting it and using your arrow keys to
move it to a new position. This technique works well when you want to move
the object only a little bit.
Deleting form objects
Deleting objects is easy, too. If you want to get rid of something on a form,
click the object to select it and then press the Delete key. Poof . . . it’s gone!
For example, if you don’t want the word Duplicate to print on a check to
which you assign a check number, delete the Duplicate Check Message field
in the check form that you use.
If you delete the wrong object, immediately choose Edit➪Undo or press
Ctrl+Z to reverse the last step you took.
Adding data field objects
If you want to add data field objects to a form, you need to tell Peachtree
where you want to place the field and which field you want to add. To do so
1. Click the Add button on the Object toolbar, as shown in the margin.
A submenu appears.
2. Choose Data from Peachtree.
3. Click OK at the Add Data Confirmation dialog box.
The Add Field dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-7.
268
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

4. From the Field Type drop-down list, select the type of data you want
to add.
You might have to look at the available field names for each data type
until you find the item you want.
5. From the Field Name list, click the data field you want to add and then
click OK.
Peachtree adds the data field along the top of the form.
6. Move the data field object into the desired position.
See “Moving form objects,” earlier in this chapter.
Adding text objects
Data field objects contain variable information that . . . well, varies, or
changes from one document to the next. Text objects are static. The informa-
tion doesn’t change; the same words appear on each and every document
that uses this form. Follow these simple steps to create a text object:
1. Click the Add button on the Object toolbar.
2. Choose Text and then click OK at the confirmation message.
A text box with a blinking cursor appears at the top of the form.
Select Do Not Display Again to disable the confirmation message.
3. Type the text that you want to appear on the form.
Figure 13-7:
Select the
field type
and field
name you
want added
to your form.
269
Chapter 13: Working with Forms

The text box expands to accommodate the text you enter, as shown in
Figure 13-8.
4. After you finish typing, click anywhere outside the text box.
5. Click and drag the data field object to move it into the desired position.
Resizing an object
If an object is too long, too short, too narrow, or too wide, resize it with your
mouse:
1. Select the object you want to resize; then position the mouse over one
of the object’s sizing handles.
As you do so, the mouse pointer turns into a double-headed black arrow.
2. Drag the handle in the direction you want to resize the object.
As you drag the handle, you see the box boundaries resize.
3. When you reach the desired size, release the mouse button.
To quickly change an object to its default height and width, right-click the
object and then choose AutoSize.
Peachtree also provides an easy way to make multiple objects the same size.
You can make them the same height, the same width, or both. You must have
at least two objects selected. To select multiple objects, hold the Ctrl key and
then click each object you want to modify as a group. Then, from the Object
toolbar, click the Resize button (as shown here) which displays a menu of
sizing options from which you can select.
Formatting field properties
How do you know which font and other attributes are assigned to the form
objects? Well, you examine the object’s properties. The properties tell you
what field each object represents as well as its size and appearance. You can
modify properties for both data field objects and text objects.
Figure 13-8:
Add your
personalized
text in a 
text box.
270
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

To view or modify object properties, you must first select the object you
want to modify. With the object selected, click the Properties button (as
shown here) on the Properties toolbar. Peachtree then displays a dialog box
that varies depending on the object type you select. In Figure 13-9, you can
see the Data Field Options dialog box for the Invoice Amount field.
From this dialog box, you can choose a specific font, size, alignment, border,
and color for each object.
If you’re working with a data field object and want to control how the numbers
appear, click the Advanced button, as shown in the margin. This expands the
dialog box, as shown in Figure 13-10, so you can change how you want numbers
to print.

271
Chapter 13: Working with Forms

In the Number Formatting field located at the bottom of the dialog box, you
see a series of upper- and lowercase Ns. Peachtree designates numbers that
appear before the decimal point with a capital N and numbers that appear
after the decimal point with a lowercase n. Suppose that you want standard
decimal points and commas. If you use NNN,NNN.nn as your template, one
thousand prints as 1,000.00, and ten thousand prints as 10,000.00. To change
the number format for the selected field, change the contents to match the
appearance you want. There are several key notes you should know about
managing numeric formats:
 You can place plus or minus signs either before or after the numbers.
 If a minus sign (–) is used, it appears only if the number is negative.
 If the plus sign (+) is used, a minus sign appears if the number is nega-
tive and a plus sign appears if the number is positive.
 If parentheses (( )) or angle brackets (< >) are used, they appear only if
the number is negative.
 If the sign is doubled before the number — for example, two minus signs
(––) or two dollar signs ($$) — the sign appears right next to the
number. When you use a single sign, a space appears between the sign
and the number.
In Table 13-1, we show the values 1234.56 and –1234.56 in various formats.

Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

Aligning objects
When you select multiple objects in the Forms Design window, Peachtree can
align those objects in relation to each other. You can align their top, bottom,
left, or right edges together, or you can choose to align the centers vertically
or horizontally. To align multiple objects
1. Click the Selection tool and then select the objects you want to align.
You must have at least two objects selected. To select multiple objects,
hold the Ctrl key and then click each object you want to align. To select
contiguous objects, hold down the Shift key and then click the first and
last objects you want to modify.
2. From the Object toolbar, click the Line Up button and then select an
alignment choice.
You can line up the objects’ left, right, top, or bottom edges; or you can
center them vertically or horizontally. Peachtree aligns the objects to
the one you selected last — we call it the “foundation” object.
Adding a logo
Adding your company logo or any other graphic image to your form is as
easy as A-B-C. The forms use images in a bitmap, JPEG, or GIF format, which
are all common graphic formats. Just follow these steps:
1. Select the Add button on the Object toolbar.
2. Select Logo or Image from the Add submenu.
An Open dialog box similar to the one shown in Figure 13-11 appears.
Figure 13-11:
Personalize
your forms

273
Chapter 13: Working with Forms

3. Locate and select the logo or image file you want.
4. Click Open.
The image should appear on the form.
5. (Optional) Resize the image by using the image sizing handles, and
then move the graphic to the desired location on the form.
Creating a grouped data table
When you have a series of rows of data, such as the body lines of an invoice,
customer statement, or purchase order, instead of creating each field individ-
ually, use the Column Data command to list data fields displayed in a table
format using columns and rows.
To create a table object, follow these steps:
1. Select the Add button on the Object toolbar and then choose Column
to Table.
The Add Field dialog box opens on top of the Column Data Options
dialog box. See Figure 13-12.
2. From the Columns tab of the Add Field dialog box, select the first field
that you want to add.
You might have to look through the various Field Type options to locate
the field you want.
Figure 13-12:
Select the
fields you
want to add
to your
table.
274
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

3. Click OK.
The field now appears in the list of fields on the Column Data Options
dialog.
4. Click the Add Field button, as shown in the margin, and repeat Steps 2
and 3 to add additional fields as needed. See Figure 13-13.
5. Set any desired table options. From the Column Data Options dialog
box, you can:
 Select a field and change its order in the table. Click the Move Up button
(as shown here) or the Move Down button.
• Change the field heading that appears at the top of the column.
Select the existing heading text and replace it with your own, or
leave it blank.
 Change the number format. Click the # button (as shown here) on the
numeric field you want to modify and make any desired changes. See
“Formatting Field Properties.”
• Set field heading and data font options. Select the options in the
Fonts section of the dialog box.
• Modify the column width. Change the field width to the desired
value.
• Add a border or grid around the table. Select any desired setting
from the Border section.
• Set advanced options such as Row Spacing or Column Margins. Click
the Advanced button to reveal the options. By defining the Row
Spacing, you determine the spacing between rows of data in the
table. For example, if you use a 10-point font for data and you want
the data rows double-spaced, enter 10 in the Row Spacing field.

Chapter 13: Working with Forms

6. Click OK to close the Column Data Options dialog box and place the
table on your form.
Double-click the table or click the Properties button to redisplay the Column
Data Options dialog box.
You can move or resize the entire table as you would a text object, data field
object, or graphic object.
Saving forms
After you modify a form, you’ll want to save it. In fact, we recommend that
you save the form as you’re modifying it. Then resave it again every few steps
or so. To save a form:
1. Click the Save button to display the Save As dialog box.
2. Enter a name for the form.
You can’t use the same name as one of the Peachtree standard forms.
You must give your form a unique name.
3. (Optional) In the Description field, type a description of the form.
4. Click Save to save the form for future use.
Peachtree identifies custom forms by a blue tool on the form icon.
Delete any customized form by highlighting the form name in the Select a
Report window and then clicking the Delete button, as shown in the margin.
We would have loved to include a discussion of Shapes, Commands, Field
Order, and OLE objects. Unfortunately, these topics are beyond the scope of
this book, but you can find information about them in your User Manual
available under the Help menu.

Making Reports Work for You
In This Chapter
 Viewing and modifying reports
 Choosing report styles
 Creating mail merge documents
 Sending reports to Excel
 Making report groups
P
eachtree includes over 100 standard reports, ranging from a list of your
Chart of Accounts to a Check Register to a Job Profitability report. In
each chapter in Part II, you can find a list of the standard reports that
Peachtree supplies, appropriate to the subject of the chapter. In this chapter,
we show you how to show the reports on-screen, or print them to your
printer, a PDF file, an e-mail, or an Excel workbook. We also show you how to
modify and save reports. We even show you how to merge information with
Microsoft Word.
Previewing Standard Reports
Save a tree! You might find that you want to take only a brief look at your
information. Peachtree allows you to preview any report to the screen before
or instead of printing it.
To preview reports on your screen, follow these steps:
1. Choose Reports & Forms and then select the report area you need,
such as Accounts Payable.
The Select a Report or Form window (see Figure 14-1) appears with an
alphabetical listing of available reports.

278
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 
2. Click the report to view.
3. Click the Display button (as shown in the margin).
The selected report appears on your screen using any default options
determined on the report.
In most displayed reports, you can drill down to view the details of a transac-
tion. When you move the mouse pointer over a transaction, the pointer
changes to a magnifying glass that contains a Z (for zoom). Double-click that,
and Peachtree displays the transaction in the window where you entered it.
You can make changes to the transaction and save it; Peachtree automati-
cally updates the report to reflect the changes.
Printing Reports
After you preview your report on the screen, you might decide that you want
a paper copy or need to send the report to someone.
Peachtree provides several ways to transmit a report. You can print it, send it
by e-mail, or print it to a PDF file. You access these different methods through
the report toolbar, which is shown in Figure 14-2.
Figure 14-1:
Select
reports to
preview.

To print the report, click the Print button. You see a dialog box where you
can select which printer you want to use as well as which pages to print and
how many copies to print.
To print the report to a PDF file, click the PDF button. The Save As dialog box
appears. You can specify the PDF filename and location.
PDF stands for Portable Document Format. To view or print the report in PDF,
you must have the Adobe Reader software, which is a free download from the
Internet at www.adobe.com/reader.
To e-mail the report, click the E-mail button. A window from your default
e-mail program appears with the report as a PDF attachment (see Figure
14-3). Peachtree fills in the e-mail Subject line, and also the message body
with information pertaining to the creation date and report title. Enter the
recipient’s e-mail address and then click Send.
You can additionally send a report to an Excel file. See the section, “Excel
with Peachtree,” later in this chapter.

Chapter 14: Making Reports Work for You

Finding the Facts
Some reports can be quite lengthy, and locating a specific number can look
like a total blur. While previewing a report, you can click the Find button (as
shown here) to search for specific text or numbers. Peachtree then displays
the Find on Report dialog box, as shown in Figure 14-4.
You can make several search option selections:
 Find What: Use this text box to enter the information for which you
want to search.
 Search Forward: Select this option if you want to search down the
report, from the location of the selected line, which is the line with the
thin blue border around it.
 Search Backward: Select this option if you want to search backward in
the report, based on the location of the selected line.
 Match Case: Select this check box if you want your search to be case
sensitive. Peachtree will search only for text that matches the case of
whatever you enter in the Find What text box. For example, if you enter
SMITH and select Match Case, Peachtree searches for any occurrence of
SMITH but will not search for smith or Smith.
 Use Wildcards: Peachtree recognizes the ? and the * characters as wild-
cards, meaning that you can use them in the search to indicate unknown
characters. The question mark (?) represents a single character, and the
asterisk (*) can represent any number of characters. Here’s an example,
using the sample Aged Receivables report: Select the Use Wildcards
check box and type a?m in the Find What text box, and Peachtree could
find armstrong, alma, palm, or any other similar combination. If you type
a*m, Peachtree would find all the words we just listed, along with
Natasha Cannon, M.D. and Dash Business Systems.

Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

 Find Complete Words Only: Select this check box to tell Peachtree that
you want to be specific and to locate exactly what you type. For example,
if you select this check box and type build in the Find What text box,
Peachtree locates only the word build, not builders or building. You can use
this option along with the Match Case option.
If you use the Find What text box to search for text or numbers, even on a dif-
ferent report or financial statement, Peachtree stores the previous 20 values
used during the current Peachtree session. You can choose one of your previ-
ously entered values by selecting it from the drop-down list.
Enter the text or numbers you want to locate, select any desired options, and
then click Find Next. Peachtree locates and highlights the first occurrence of
the item. Click Find Next again to locate the next occurrence. Peachtree dis-
plays a message box when no more occurrences are found. Click OK and then
click Cancel.
Customizing Reports
Sometimes, the standard reports don’t contain enough information to meet
your needs. Or perhaps they contain more information than you’re looking
for. Maybe you want to see the information only for a particular customer or
vendor and over a different time frame than that specified in the report. You
can modify the date range, field information, font, and page layout of any
report.
Using filters
Filtering restricts the report data to a different set of specifications than
Peachtree shows in standard reports. Suppose that you need to take a standard
report — for example, the Customer Ledgers — and view it a little differently.
In Figure 14-5, you can see the Modify Report–Customer Ledgers dialog box
with its default options. By default, the standard Customer Ledgers report
shows all activity for all customers for the current month. But what if you
want to see the transactions (both sales and receipts) for the entire year for
customer Cummings Construction? By using filtering, you can have Peachtree
display only that information.
281
Chapter 14: Making Reports Work for You

To use a filter, follow these steps:
1. Choose the report name that you want to filter.
In the example, we chose the Customer Ledgers report under Accounts
Receivable.
2. Click Options (as shown in the margin).
A Modify Report dialog box appears in which you can set a variety of
options for the report you want to display. The first thing you want to
change is the time frame. By default, this report displays the current
month, but we want to see the transactions for the entire year.
3. From the Date text box, change the date to represent the period you
want.
In our example, we want This Year. You can enter a more specific date
range by entering the beginning and ending dates in the From and To
text boxes.
4. From the Sort By option, select a method you want for sorting your
report.
The options available vary with the report that you’re using.
5. In the Filters section, click Customer ID.
On the right side of the dialog box, a list of all your customers appears
along with filtering options.
Figure 14-5:
Choose
sorting
options,
time frame,
and other
limits for a

282
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

6. Select the Range radio button. Then, in the From text box, type (or
look up and select) the first customer you want to view.
In this example, we use CUMMINGS.
7. Click in the To box and type (or lookup and select) the last customer
you want to view.
If you’re looking for a specific customer, enter the same ID in both the
From and To text boxes. If you want to see a list of IDs from a certain
point down through the list, enter only the From ID and leave the To ID
blank. For example, if you want to see every customer from SMITH
through WILLIAMS (last customer on the list), enter SMITH in the From
text box and leave the To text box empty.
Some reports allow you to select multiple IDs that are not contiguous.
When using the One or More option, select the check box for each cus-
tomer that you want to view on the report.
Figure 14-6 illustrates the Modify Report dialog box after setting our fil-
tering options.
8. Click OK to display the report on-screen.
Peachtree displays transactions for the specified time frame and the
specified customers.
9. Click Close (as shown here) when you finish reviewing the report.

Chapter 14: Making Reports Work for You

Adding, deleting, and moving report fields
Reports in Peachtree consist of data fields. Those data fields come from the
various modules in Peachtree. For example, information on an Aged
Receivables report contains information from a variety of Customer and Sales
fields, and the payroll register displays information from a variety of
Employee and Payroll entry fields. You have the option of including or
excluding any available fields to create a customized report.
For example, we want to add a field to the Cash Requirements report — a
field that indicates whether we’re still waiting on a bill from the vendor. We
also want to remove the Age field. To customize a report, just follow these
steps:
1. Choose Reports and Forms and select the module containing the
report you want to modify.
In this example, we chose Accounts Payable.
2. Locate and click the report that you want to modify.
In this example, we’re modifying the Cash Requirements report. A stan-
dard Cash Requirements report displays eight columns: the vendor ID,
vendor name, invoice number, invoice date, due date, amount due, dis-
count amount, and invoice age.
3. Click the Columns button (as shown here).
The options for the selected report appear. You can display any field in
the dialog box on the selected report. You might find that some fields
appear dimmed, which indicates that they can’t be changed. Dimmed
fields usually appear when the filter screen has the report set to display
in a summarized format. The fields currently being displayed have a
green check mark in the first column (the Show column).
4. Select the check box of the field you want to add.
For this example, select the Show check box next to the Waiting on Bill
from Vendor field (see Figure 14-7).
5. Clear the Show check box of the field you want to remove.
In this example, we cleared the check box beside the Age field.
Removing the check mark removes the field so that it no longer appears
on the report. When you remove a field from a report, the columns pre-
viously displayed to the right of the removed field move to the left. In
this example, when we added the Waiting on Bill from Vendor column, it
became the eighth column; but when we remove the Age column,
Waiting on Bill from Vendor becomes the seventh column.
We want the Waiting on Bill to appear next to the Invoice/CM# field. No
problem! We just use the Move Up command to change its location.
284
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

6. Click the field name you want to move.
Use caution not to click the Show column, or you’ll turn off the display
of the field. When you select a field, a red border appears around the
entire selected line.
7. Click the Move Up button (as shown here) to move the field up one
column at a time.
Conversely, click the Move Down button to move the field down one
column at a time. Continue clicking the Move Up or Move Down button
until the field appears in the location you want.
Select the check box in the Column Break section to make the selected
field appear on a new column on the report. If you want to place more
than one field in a column, first make sure that you select the Show
check box and then remove the check from the Break check box. Doing
so means that Peachtree doesn’t place a break (a column) between the
fields.
8. Click OK.
The report redisplays with the changes you selected.
Changing column width
Adding too many columns can cause some to fall off the edge of a page. Well,
they don’t really fall off, but it does cause the report to print two or more pages
in width. You have several choices at this point. You can print the report in
landscape mode, print multiple pages in width, remove some report columns,
stack some of the columns as described in the previous section, or — and this
is probably the best choice — change the column widths.
Figure 14-7:
You can add
additional
fields to
your
reports.
285
Chapter 14: Making Reports Work for You

Here’s how to change the column width. With the report on your screen,
notice the blue column marker lines that appear at the right of each column,
as shown in Figure 14-8. Position your mouse over the arrows on the column
marker until the mouse pointer turns into a double-headed arrow. You can
then drag the column markers to the left to make a column narrower, or to
the right to widen a column.
If you see a long red vertical dashed line on the right (also shown in Figure
14-8), your report prints multiple pages wide. You’ll know that the report fits
on one page when the long red dashed line disappears.
Keeping in style
What’s your style? Classic, Elegant, Contemporary, or Professional? By
default, Peachtree uses its Professional style, which simply means that all
Column Markers

reports print in an Arial font. You can display any or all of your reports in any
of the aforementioned styles. Here’s a description of the Peachtree-furnished
styles:
 Classic: The entire report uses a Times New Roman (black) font.
 Contemporary: The report heading appears as an Arial (red) font, the
data uses a Times New Roman (black) font, and the report totals appear
in Times New Roman (red) font.
 Elegant: The entire report uses a Garamond font. Headings and report
totals appear in navy blue, and the body data appears in black.
 Professional: The entire report appears in an Arial (black) font.
If you have a color printer, the reports print in the same colors that appear
on the screen.
Here’s an easy way to modify a report style:
1. Select the report you want to modify and click the Fonts button (as
shown here).
The Fonts tab of the report options appears, as shown in Figure 14-9.
2. Click the down arrow to the right of the Style box to display a list of
available styles.
3. Click the style you want for this report and then click OK.
The report redisplays on the screen with the new style.

Saving a customized report
Sometimes you customize reports for a one-time use, but you use other
reports frequently. To save yourself the trouble of re-creating the customized
report each time you want to display it, save the report with a name that
you’ll recognize.
To save a customized report, follow these steps:
1. Display the customized report on the screen.
2. Click the Save button (as shown here).
The Save As dialog box appears.
3. Enter a name for the report.
You can’t use the name of a Peachtree standard report. You must give it
a unique name. For example, you might call a customized Chart of
Accounts report My COA.
4. (Optional) In the Description text box, type a description of the
report.
5. Click Save.
The report is saved for future use.
6. Click Close to close the report window.
You can identify custom reports by the blue wrench symbol (as shown here)
that Peachtree places on the report icon.
Delete any customized report by highlighting the report name and then clicking
the Delete button (as shown here).
You can copy customized reports from one company to another. For instruc-
tions, see Chapter 15.
Mail Merge
One common marketing tool is to offer existing customers a discount to
encourage them to purchase again. Make your customers feel really special
by sending them a personalized letter with this distinctive offer. What? You
don’t have time to send them a personalized letter? It takes only a few min-
utes to send such letters when using the Peachtree Mail Merge feature.
288
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

You can use one of the standard letters included with Peachtree or create
your own letter. Just combine the letter and the customer contact informa-
tion that you already have in Peachtree. In a very short time, you can have a
personalized letter for every customer in your database. Don’t want to send
this letter to everyone? That’s okay. You can choose which customers should
receive the letter.
This type of mailing is called a mail merge because you’re merging the
generic letter and the variable customer information. Peachtree includes a
variety of mail merge letters for customers, vendors, or employees. The
underlying engine for this mail merge uses Microsoft Word. If you’re already
familiar with the Word Mail Merge feature, you can even customize your own
letters to merge with your Peachtree data.
You must have both Excel and Word installed on your system for the
Peachtree mail merge process to work correctly. Supported versions include
Excel and Word 2000, 2002, 2003, and 2007.
Perhaps you’re in the process of setting up a new employee and want to send
a letter welcoming him or her to your firm. As you enter the new employee
information in Peachtree, creating a welcome letter is just a click away.
Follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Write Letters➪Employee Letters.
The Select a Report or Form window appears, as shown in Figure 14-10.
Figure 14-10:

289
Chapter 14: Making Reports Work for You

2. In the Form Types section, click the form type you want to use.
In this example, we chose Employee Labels and Letters.
3. Select the letter you want to use.
Peachtree separates letters from forms by including an envelope on the
icon next to letters. In this case of the employee letters, there’s only one
example.
4. Click the Send Letter button (as shown here).
A filter dialog box opens from which you can select the specific IDs, date
ranges, and other criteria.
5. Select the filter criteria you want to use.
Refer to the “Using Filters” section earlier in this chapter.
6. Click the Word button (as shown here).
Microsoft Word opens with all the completed letters ready for you to
print or further modify if desired. (See Figure 14-11.)
Optionally, click the E-mail button (as shown here) to e-mail the letter
instead of opening it in Word.
Figure 14-11:

Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

You can also create letters for customers, vendors, or employees from the
respective Maintenance window. Select the customer, vendor, or employee 
to whom you want to send a letter and then click the Letters button (as
shown here).
Excel with Peachtree
If you have Excel, you can send any report — including financial statements —
to an Excel workbook.
Why would you want to send a report to Microsoft Excel? Well, perhaps you’d
like to sort the report in a different manner than Peachtree offers, total a
report that Peachtree can’t total, or add a column based on a calculation.
How about creating a chart based on the data? We like to use the Excel func-
tion to copy customer sales information that can be sorted and ranked in
Excel. Those are just a few things you can do by copying a report to Excel.
Follow these steps to copy report data to Excel:
1. Display the Peachtree report on your screen.
2. Click the Send To button on the report toolbar (refer to Figure 14-2)
and then click the Excel button (as shown here) from its menu.
The Copy Report to Excel dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 14-12.
Figure 14-12:

Chapter 14: Making Reports Work for You

3. Select the File Option that you want use to copy the report to Excel.
Your two choices are
• Select the New Microsoft Excel Workbook radio button.
• Select the Add a New Worksheet to an Existing Microsoft Workbook
radio button.
This option appends the report to an existing Excel file. Click the
Browse button to select an existing file.
4. Select any other desired Excel options.
You can determine where Excel should place the report header informa-
tion: in the worksheet header area or in the worksheet itself. You can
also decide whether you want Excel to freeze the heading rows and
optionally add filter arrows.
5. Select a report layout.
Select Peachtree Report Layout to display the report in Excel exactly as
you see it in Peachtree, or select Raw Data Layout to display the data in
standard Excel column layout.
6. Click OK to copy the report to Excel.
Peachtree copies the data including formulas to Excel.
Stay in a Group, Now
If you have a number of reports that you need at the same time, you can
create a report group to print them all at once. Report groups print directly
to the printer or Microsoft Excel; they can’t be previewed on the screen.
In Chapter 17, we suggest reports that you should print at the end of the
month. Placing those reports in a report group will make the report printing
process much easier.
Follow these steps to create a report group:
1. From anywhere in the Select a Report window, click the Group button
(as shown here).
The Report Groups window appears, as shown in Figure 14-13. All stan-
dard and custom reports appear in the Report Index list. To help you
find a particular report, you can limit the reports you see in the Report
Index list to only the reports for a particular module. Click the Report
Index drop-down arrow and select the module.
292
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

2. To build a report group, select the first report that you want to
include in the group in the Report Index list and then click the Add
button (as shown here).
Added reports appear on the right side of the window. Peachtree prints
the reports in the order that they appear on the right side of the
window.
3. Add any additional reports to the group.
You can mix and match report categories. For example, you might want
to print an Aged Payables report and an Aged Receivables report.
4. When you finish adding reports to the group, click the Save button.
The Save As dialog box appears.
5. Enter a name for the group, such as Monthly Reports.
6. (Optional) In the Description text box, type a description of the
reports.
7. Click Save (as shown here) to save the report group.
8. Click Close to close the Report Groups window.
When you’re ready to print the report group, click Report Groups in the
Select a Report window, and then click the name of the report group to print.
Click Print to print the reports to the printer with no further action on your
part, or click the Send button to send the reports to Microsoft Excel, a PDF
file, or as an e-mail PDF attachment. If you send the reports to Excel,
Peachtree opens each report in its own workbook.

efore you advance to the next Peachtree accounting period, you’ll prob-
ably want to print a series of reports for your records and possibly for
your accountant. Reports that you might find useful include the General
Ledger, Trial Balance, Balance Sheet, and Income Statement. Peachtree pro-
vides lots of other reports you may want, but these are the most common
ones. You’ll probably want to include them in a report group. (See Chapter 14
for creating a report group.)
The preceding reports fall into two categories: General Ledger reports and
financial statements. We begin by taking a look at the General Ledger reports.
Reviewing Standard General 
Ledger Reports
Two of the standard reports that you’ll use frequently are the General Ledger
and Trial Balance. Peachtree lists both of these reports in the General Ledger
report area of the Select a Report or Form window. (You can find out how to
display, filter, and customize reports in Chapter 14.)
The General Ledger report is the mother of all accounting reports. This
report lists all transactions you enter into Peachtree that affect the general
ledger. Figure 15-1 shows a sample General Ledger report. Note the column
titled Jrnl. The reference in this column represents the source of the transac-
tion. Table 15-1 lists the different Jrnl codes and their source.

accounts, so you won’t see them on the General Ledger report.
When printing or previewing the General Ledger report for multiple months,
you might find the option Hide Period Totals on Multiple Period Report
useful. You can select this check box on the Modify Report screen when you
set up the report’s options.
Figure 15-1:
See all

Like most Peachtree reports, you can double-click a line to open the window
in which Peachtree created the original transaction.
Peachtree provides two Trial Balance reports. The first report, General
Ledger Trial Balance, shows each account and its balance as of the date or
period you choose. The report displays the account ID and description as
well as the debit or credit balance.
The other Trial Balance report is Working Trial Balance. This report provides
a worksheet where you can list adjusting entries. Each account includes the
current balance and a series of lines where you can write down any neces-
sary adjusting amount. Referring to your handwritten trial balance entries
speeds up data entry when you need to make adjusting entries. Your accoun-
tant will like this report; he or she can use it to provide you with adjusting
entries before closing the year.
Using Segments and Masking
In Chapter 3, we show you how to set up your Chart of Accounts to better
track departments or locations. In that chapter, you can see how important
the numbering sequence is when setting up the Chart of Accounts, especially
if you want to report on your different company areas or segments.
In Peachtree Premium or higher, you can formally divide your accounts into
segments. In other Peachtree editions, you set up your accounts in a pattern
where you could utilize report masking. Masking is the ability to limit informa-
tion in certain reports to a single division, department, location, or type code.
You can use masking and segmenting in most General Ledger reports and in
financial statements.
For a review of designing your Chart of Accounts for masking or segmenting,
see Chapter 3.
Report masks use a wildcard character — an asterisk (*) — to represent all the
other digits of the account number except the digits you want on the report.
For example, Bellwether Garden Supply references two departments as Aviary
and Landscape Services; these departments are represented as AV and LS in
the Chart of Accounts. 40000-AV is the account number for the Aviary sales
account, and 40000-LS is the account number for the Landscape Services sales
account. So, a mask for the Aviary department looks like *****-AV, and a mask
for the Landscape Services appears as *****-LS. On many standard General
Ledger reports, you can use the mask when you set the report options.
If you’re using Peachtree Premium or higher, you can take advantage of the
segments feature. Using segments over masking means that you don’t have 
297
Chapter 15: Reviewing the Financial Picture

to remember the wildcard character or the number of digits. You need to
remember only what you called the segments, such as department or location.
From the Select a Report or Form window, select the General Ledger report
you want to view. Click the Options button (as shown here) to display the
Options dialog box. You’ll see an options dialog box, such as the one shown
in Figure 15-2. From the Select a Filter list, select Account Segment. Then, on
the right, select the segment type that you want to review. Finally, in the From
and To drop-down lists, select the segments you want.
If you don’t use segments or your Peachtree version doesn’t support seg-
ments, the Account Segment option doesn’t even appear in the Filter list. You
can still use wildcards and the Peachtree Department mask feature. Instead
of choosing Account Segment from the Filter list, choose Department Mask
and set masking options, using wildcards.
Producing Financial Statements
You display or print financial statements through the Select a Report or Form
window the same way you display or print other reports. Peachtree provides
a number of predefined financial statements, including a Balance Sheet and
an Income Statement. Similar to other reports, you can preview them, print
them to a printer or a PDF file, e-mail them, or send them to Excel.

As we mention earlier in this chapter, the two most frequently used financial
statements are the Balance Sheet and the Income Statement. Here are a few
suggestions to assist you when working with your financial statements:
 All financial statements appear for the current fiscal period unless you
select a different date range in the Options dialog box; however, financial
statements are always listed by fiscal periods. You cannot select a spe-
cific date range, such as March 3 through March 21.
 Open any financial statement by double-clicking the desired report. The
report Options dialog box, like the one shown in Figure 15-3, appears.
Make the desired changes, such as the date range or segments, and then
click OK.

General Ledger report.
 The option to select a segment does not appear if you don’t have segments
set up in General Ledger defaults.
Modifying Financial Statements
In this section, we take a look at the Financial Statement designer.
You can create customized financial reports by using the Financial Statement
Wizard or by the conventional method of customizing a statement yourself in
the Financial Statement Design window. The Financial Statement Design
window gives you more control over each individual aspect of the financial
design process, but the Financial Statement Wizard provides a grasp of the
basic elements of a statement and how to put them together effectively.
Using the Financial Statement Wizard
The Financial Statement Wizard can assist you with great detail in creating a
financial statement. At every point in the process, the wizard makes your
choices clear so you know what effect each choice has on the finished state-
ment. The following steps show you how to use the Peachtree Financial
Statement Wizard:
1. In the Select a Report window, choose Financial Statements.
2. Click the Financial Statement Wizard link (as shown here), located at
the top right of the window.
An introduction screen appears, showing you the processes that you
can specify by using the wizard.
3. Click Next to see the Financial Statement Name screen.
Similar to customized forms and reports, customized financial state-
ments must have their own name. Additionally, you start customization
by basing your report on one that already exists, as shown in Figure
15-4. This saves you tons of time!
4. From the Financial Statement Template drop-down list, choose an
existing financial statement design to use as the model for your new
statement. Then type a unique name for the new statement.

Although a report description is optional, we encourage you to supply
one. That way, when you click the report in the Select a Report or Form
window, you’ll see a reminder of the report’s purpose.
5. Click Next.
Each screen of the Financial Statement Wizard defines a specific area of
your financial statement:
• Headers and Footers: Enter the text of each header and footer you
want to include.
• Dates and General Ledger Account Masking: Choose the range of
dates you want the statement to cover. If you set up your General
Ledger accounts for account segments, you can enter an account
segment that limits reporting to just one of your departments. If
you’re not using segments, the screen provides options for creat-
ing an account mask.
• Column Properties: Select the type and properties of data that
appears in as many as 30 columns.
• Column Options: For each type of column you set up in your state-
ment, you can determine secondary titles, width, and alignment for
the column.
• Fonts: You can choose the fonts that Peachtree uses to display or
print each of the sections of your statement.
• Formatting and Default Printer: You can tell Peachtree which printer
you want to use, whether you want to print page numbers, to show
zero dollar amounts, to center the report on the page, and so forth.

6. Click Finish.
The Financial Statement dialog box appears.
7. Click OK.
The designed financial statement appears for your review on your
screen.
Creating customized financial statements
Earlier in this chapter, we talk about how you can use the Financial Statement
Wizard to create customized financial statements. However, you can also
manually customize any financial statement.
As a simple example, suppose that you want to compare the current period
with the year-to-date information for only one department. The standard
Income Statement compares current period information with year-to-date
information for your entire company. The upcoming steps outline how to
create a departmental version of the standard Income Statement, using the
department mask.
Creating a new financial statement by using an existing financial statement as
a model is always easiest. To avoid accidentally damaging the model, make a
copy by saving it under a new name in the Design window. Then, modify the
properties of the column heading to include a department mask.
For a review on designing your Chart of Accounts for masking, see Chapter 3.
The following steps show you how to create a customized financial statement:
1. Choose Reports & Forms➪Financial Statements.
Peachtree displays the available financial statement report formats in
the Select a Report window.
2. Select the financial statement you want to modify and then click the
Design button (as shown here).
In the example, we’re using the <Standard> Income Statement.
Peachtree’s Financial Statement Designer window for the Income
Statement appears (see Figure 15-5).

Chapter 15: Reviewing the Financial Picture

3. Double-click the Column Desc. button (as shown here)
The Column Description dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 15-6.
4. Click the row for Column 2 Activity to select it and display the Dept.
Mask field.
Just like in the earlier section, “Using Segments and Masking in Reports,”
you create the mask by using an asterisk (*) wildcard character to repre-
sent all the other digits of the account number except the digits you
want displayed.
5. Add an appropriate mask.
To mask for just the Aviary department, for example, enter *****-AV.

Activity.
7. Click OK to redisplay the report design.
8. Click the Save button (as shown here) to display the Save As 
dialog box.
Peachtree will not allow you to overwrite a <Standard> financial state-
ment. You must supply a different name.
9. In the Name text box, type a new name for the report.
For example, you might type Income Statement — Aviary.
10. (Option) Enter a description.
11. Click OK.
Peachtree changes the report title in the title bar.
Now when you print or preview the report, it includes information only for
the department you specified.
Delete any customized financial statement by highlighting the financial state-
ment name and then clicking the Delete button (as shown here).
You can be very creative when designing financial statements; however,
there’s just not enough room in this book to go into great detail. If you would
like more information, feel free to contact the nice folks at Wiley Publishing
and let them know you want them to hire us to write a Peachtree Bible.
Copying Reports and Financial
Statements
You’ll find customized reports (in any report area) and financial statements
available only in the company you created them in. However, you can copy
reports and financial statements that you create in one company to another
company. This feature comes in particularly handy if you create a second com-
pany and would like to use a customized report or financial statement that
you created in the first company.
Peachtree makes customized forms (invoices, checks, purchase orders, and
so on) available in all companies, regardless of which company you used to
create them.
305
Chapter 15: Reviewing the Financial Picture

To copy reports or financial statements between companies, begin by following
these steps:
1. Open the company that doesn’t have the necessary report.
2. Choose Reports & Forms and select any module.
For example, select Financial Statements or Accounts Payable. The
Select a Report or Form window appears.
3. Click the Copy button (as shown here).
The Copy Reports, Financial Statements & Letter Templates dialog box
opens.
4. From the Select a Company to Copy From drop-down list, select the
company containing the report you want to copy. See Figure 15-7.
5. From the Report or Financial Statement to Copy drop-down list, select
the report you want to copy.
6. Enter a name for the report and then click the Copy button.
You can use the name Peachtree suggests or you can change it. You can
also modify the description if desired.
7. Click the Close button (as shown here) to close the dialog box.
Your newly copied financial statement or report now appears in the cur-
rent company list.

When the Bank Statement Arrives
In This Chapter
 Choosing an account to reconcile
 Marking cleared items
 Printing the results of reconciliation
E
ach month, the mailman delivers an envelope from your bank. In that
envelope, you find a statement that lists deposits and withdrawals you
made, along with checks or copies of checks you wrote to others.
So why is the bank sending you this information? Well, the bank is obligated
to tell you each month how much money you have in your account. “Uh . . .
okay, so what?” you ask.
Well, if you’re smart, you want to make sure that the bank thinks you have
the same amount of money that you think you have. After all, banks make
mistakes, and you wouldn’t want to give your money away to the bank just
because you didn’t take the time to check its accounting and find its error.
Comparing the bank’s balance with yours is reconciling.
Face it; accounting isn’t exactly a barrel of laughs. And reconciling your bank
statement probably wins the award for the least fun thing you can do when
working with your company’s books. However, reconciling is an important
function because it’s the only way to confirm that you and the bank agree on
the amount of money you have in your account.
Anyone who ever tried to reconcile a bank account knows that the process
can be tedious at best — and at worst, a nightmare when you just can’t make
the bank’s numbers match yours. When you reconcile your bank statement
by using paper and pencil, you add time-consuming to the list of negative
adjectives.
Let Peachtree help you. At least when you reconcile your bank statement by
using the Peachtree Account Reconciliation feature, you finish more quickly.
This chapter shows you how to use the Account Reconciliation feature —
and how to track down problems when things don’t balance on the first try.

Understanding the Concept of Balancing
The statement that you receive summarizes the transactions the bank
processed for you during the month. These transactions include checks you
wrote, deposits you made, and actions the bank took, such as charging your
account for checks you ordered or adding interest to your account.
You need to use the statement to compare the account balance that the bank
says you have with the account balance that you think you have. In the best
of all worlds, they should match. If they don’t match, you need to figure out
why they don’t match and then take some action (which we talk about later
in this chapter) to make them match — that’s the part that most people think
isn’t fun.
After you record the transactions the bank has entered (check order charges,
service charges, and the interest), the difference between your account bal-
ance and the bank statement’s balance should be the total of the uncleared
transactions. Uncleared transactions are any checks you wrote or deposits
you made after the cutoff date on the bank statement. Think of uncleared
transactions as transactions about which the bank doesn’t know — that is,
according to the information on the statement. To reconcile a bank account,
you add to the bank statement balance any deposits you made after the bank
prepared the statement. Similarly, you subtract from the bank statement bal-
ance any checks you wrote after the bank prepared the bank statement.
Typically, the bank’s cutoff date for a business checking account is the last
day of the month; this date coincides with the end of an accounting period
for most businesses. So, when you reconcile your bank statement, you effec-
tively determine your actual cash balance as of the last day of the accounting
period. Your accountant needs to know your cash balance on the last day of
the accounting period to prepare accurate financial statements, so reconcil-
ing your bank statement helps your accountant prepare financial statements.
When you reconcile using paper and pencil, you list and total all checks you
wrote that don’t appear on the bank statement as well as all deposits that
you made that don’t appear on the bank statement. Then you can subtract
and add them to the bank’s ending balance to determine whether you and the
bank agree on your account balance. Initially, the listing and totaling is the
most time-consuming part of the process. (If your account doesn’t balance,
finding the error can become the most time-consuming part of the process.)
Peachtree shortens the listing and totaling part of the process by doing the
math for you.

Before You Start Reconciling
Before you start reconciling, you need to address two issues. First, after you
receive your statement from the bank, make sure you’re working in the
accounting period covered by the bank statement. The accounting period
appears at the top of any of the Navigation Centers.
If you need to change the accounting period, follow these steps:
1. Click the button above the Navigation Centers that displays the 
current period.
2. Click the period you want to reconcile.
3. Click OK.
If you see a prompt asking whether you want to print invoices, checks,
or reports, click No. Typically, this prompt appears when you change
the period to a higher number, not to a lower number.
For details on changing the accounting period, see Chapter 17.
Second, for deposits, some bank statements list individual items instead of the
deposit ticket total. (Most banks, however, list deposit ticket totals instead of
individual items.) If your bank lists individual items and you group receipts by
using the deposit ticket ID field available in the Receipts, Receive Payments,
and Select for Deposit windows, you can print the Bank Deposit report (as
shown in Figure 16-1) to match individual items to deposit ticket totals.
For details on grouping deposits, see Chapter 8.
Figure 16-1:
This report
lists the
individual
items that

309
Chapter 16: When the Bank Statement Arrives

In the Account Reconciliation window, Peachtree lists individual items if you
don’t fill in the deposit ticket ID field or if you have items you haven’t yet
selected for deposit. If you fill in the deposit ticket ID field, Peachtree lists the
deposit ticket total rather than each individual item. The Bank Deposit report
helps you tie the individual items to a particular deposit so that you can
properly identify deposits that clear the bank. To print the report, follow
these steps:
1. Choose Reports & Forms➪Account Reconciliation.
The Select a Report window appears, showing the available account rec-
onciliation reports.
2. On the right side of the window, select Bank Deposit Report.
3. Click the Print button, as shown in the margin.
4. In the Cash Account ID field, select the correct Cash account.
5. Click OK.
The Bank Deposit report doesn’t display deposits recorded using journal
entries.
Manually Marking Cleared Transactions
In the previous section, which we strongly suggest that you read, we discuss
two housekeeping tasks you should complete to prepare for reconciliation.
With those two housekeeping tasks out of the way, you’re ready to reconcile.
It won’t be painful. Honest. Or at least it won’t be as painful as it used to be.
You use a combination of your bank statement and the Account
Reconciliation window to reconcile a bank account. The bank statement
shows checks and deposits that have cleared the bank, along with those
other miscellaneous transactions that the bank might have recorded (service
charges, interest, and so on). The Account Reconciliation window shows the
transactions in the selected account that are available for reconciliation for
the period (see Figure 16-2).
You can maximize this window to see more information, and you can sort the
information in the window by any column in the window — just click the
column heading. If you’re looking for a particular transaction, you can click
the Find button (as shown here) on the Account Reconciliation window’s
toolbar to search for it.
310
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

When you compare your bank statement with the Account Reconciliation
window, you see some transactions in Peachtree that don’t appear on the
bank statement, and you might also see some transactions on the bank state-
ment that don’t appear in Peachtree.
You need to mark the transactions that appear on the bank statement as
cleared in the Peachtree Account Reconciliation window. You can match
cleared checks on the bank statement to checks in Peachtree by using the
number that appears in the Reference column. Most people use amounts to
match deposits on the bank statement to deposits in Peachtree. If you have
trouble matching deposits, Peachtree probably grouped a deposit differently
than the deposit you presented at the bank. You can double-click to drill
down on a deposit in the Account Reconciliation window to open it in the
Select for Deposit, Receipts, or Receive Payment window (wherever it was
created). Then, if necessary, change the deposit ticket ID number so that all
items you deposited in the bank on the same deposit ticket have the same
deposit ticket ID number in Peachtree. Also, use the Bank Deposit report
(refer to Figure 16-1) to help identify the receipts included in each deposit in
Peachtree.

Part III: The Fancy Stuff 
Reconciling for the first time
If you just started using Peachtree and this is the
first time you’re reconciling, you might find
checks and deposits on your bank statement that
you haven’t entered in Peachtree because the
transactions occurred before you started using
Peachtree. Your very first action after opening
the Account Reconciliation window should be to
enter these outstanding transactions. In the
Account Reconciliation window, click the arrow
button next to Beginning Transactions in the
lower-right corner of the window. Peachtree dis-
plays the Beginning Transactions dialog box, as
shown in the figure here.
Enter unreconciled transactions that appear on
your bank statement but occurred before you
started using Peachtree. In the top portion of
the window, enter unreconciled checks that
were written before you started using
Peachtree. Remember that unreconciled
checks include those checks remaining unrec-
onciled from prior bank statements as well as
checks that appear on the bank statement
you’re about to reconcile. In the lower portion
of the window, enter unreconciled deposits that
were made before you started using Peachtree.
Like 
unreconciled 
checks, 
unreconciled
deposits include deposits remaining unrecon-
ciled from prior bank statements as well as
deposits that appear on the bank statement that
you’re about to reconcile.
For checks, assign the check number as the ref-
erence number. For deposits, the reference
number doesn’t really matter; just make sure
that you enter the deposit amount as it appears
on your bank statement. Click OK after you
finish. The transactions you entered appear in
the Account Reconciliation window so that you
can mark them as cleared and reconcile your
bank statement.
If you’ve been using Peachtree for a while —
oh, say, maybe ten years — and you’re just now
deciding that you’re going to use Peachtree to
reconcile, you have a fairly big project ahead of
you. You see, all the checks and deposits you
entered after you started using Peachtree still
appear in Peachtree — unless you’ve purged
unreconciled transactions, which only compli-
cates the matter further. To make reconciliation
work, you have two choices:
 The “long but accurate” choice: You can
pull all your old bank statements and rec-
oncile, month by month. If you’ve purged
unreconciled transactions, you can’t use
this method.

Follow these steps to reconcile a bank account:
1. Choose Tasks➪Account Reconciliation to display the Account
Reconciliation window.
2. Click the lookup list indicator (as shown here) beside the Account to
Reconcile field to display the list of your accounts.
3. Click the account that you want to reconcile.
In Peachtree, you can balance any account, not just a checking account.
For example, you can balance savings accounts, petty cash accounts,
and credit card accounts.
4. At the bottom of the window, fill in the following:
• Interest Income and Service Charges fields: Record any interest you
earned and any bank service charges you incurred. For both fields,
assign the date of the bank statement and then select the appropri-
ate account.
• Statement Ending Balance field: Enter the ending balance that
appears on the bank statement.
5. Select the check box in the Status column at the left edge of each
entry that appears on the bank statement.
Peachtree places a blue check mark in the check box, indicating that the
bank has processed the item.
You can mark consecutive groups of transactions by using either the ref-
erence number or a date range. Click the Range button (as shown here),
and in the Clear Transactions dialog box that appears, enter the range of
reference numbers or transaction dates for Peachtree to mark.
If most transactions cleared the bank, you can mark all the transactions
cleared and then unclear the ones that didn’t clear. Click the Row 
drop-down button and then click the All button. Peachtree marks all
313
Chapter 16: When the Bank Statement Arrives
 The “shorter but potentially problematic”
choice: You can perform a dummy reconcil-
iation. Suppose that it’s May 2007, you
received your April 2007 bank statement,
and you want to reconcile it. Perform a
dummy reconciliation that clears all trans-
actions older than April 1 that don’t appear
on the April bank statement and have
appeared on older bank statements. To
make the Unreconciled Difference field
equal 0, you need to enter a dummy number
in the Statement Ending Balance field. That
dummy number is the part that can get you
in trouble down the road.
You might want to consider hiring a Peachtree
Certified Consultant, such as Diane (one of the
co-authors of this book), to help you reconcile
for the first time after using Peachtree for years.

transactions cleared. You can then remove check marks by deselecting
the check boxes for the transactions that did not clear the bank.
6. Check the Unreconciled Difference value in the lower right of the
window.
Your goal is to make that value equal to 0.
• If the Unreconciled Difference value equals 0: You’ve reconciled, and
you’re finished (pat yourself on the back). Just click the OK button
to save your work.
• If the Unreconciled Difference value doesn’t equal 0: Read the
upcoming section, “When the Account Doesn’t Balance.” (And
we’re sorry.)
Automatically Marking 
Cleared Transactions
If you’re using Peachtree Complete or higher, you can download transactions
from your bank and let Peachtree match cleared transactions for you —
saving even more time in the reconciliation process.
Peachtree refers to this feature as online banking, and you can use it with any
bank that lets you download transactions. Some banks interface directly with
Peachtree, but you can import bank transactions even if your bank doesn’t
interface with Peachtree — just as long as your bank lets you download
transactions and save them to an OFX (Microsoft Money) file or a QFX
(QuickBooks) file.
The list of banks that interface directly with Peachtree appears in the Import
Statement Wizard. If your bank doesn’t interface directly, go to your bank’s
Web site and follow its procedures to download your bank statement. If you
have a choice between an OFX and a QFX file, choose OFX. Save the file to
your hard drive and note the location. You’re now ready to use the Import
Statement Wizard.
When you use the Import Statement Wizard, Peachtree imports statement
information provided by your bank and then auto-clears records: that is,
matching the bank’s transactions with transactions in Peachtree. Your job
becomes reviewing the work Peachtree has done to make sure it’s accurate.
This method can save you lots of time because Peachtree is pretty good at
matching transactions. To import bank statement information, follow these
steps:
314
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

1. Choose Tasks➪Account Reconciliation.
Peachtree displays the Account Reconciliation window (refer to 
Figure 16-2).
2. Select your bank account in the Account to Reconcile field.
3. Click the Import button.
Peachtree displays the Welcome screen of the Import Statement Wizard.
4. Click Next to choose how to import your statement (see Figure 16-3).
Select the Automatically Connect to My Bank and Import a Statement
option if your bank appears in the Bank list box. Enter your bank-supplied
user ID and password.
Select the Manually Select a Statement option if your bank doesn’t
appear in the Bank list box. Then click the Browse button to navigate to
the location on your hard drive where you saved your downloaded bank
statement information.
5. Click Import.
Peachtree imports bank statement information. When Peachtree fin-
ishes, you see the Import Summary screen, which shows the statement
date and number of records, debits, credits, interest, and service
charges imported.
If your company uses more than one bank account, you see the Select
Account dialog box, where you need to select the bank account for
which you’re importing information.

Peachtree auto-clears records, matching Peachtree transactions to bank
statement transactions. When the process finishes, Peachtree redisplays

the Account Reconciliation window, showing you the results. A key
appears below the list of transactions, describing the status of each
transaction.
7. Fill in the Statement Ending Balance field and note the Unreconciled
Difference amount.
• If the Unreconciled Difference value equals 0: You reconciled, and
you’re finished (pat yourself on the back). Just click the OK button
to save your work.
• If the Unreconciled Difference value doesn’t equal 0: Read on; you
might need to do a little manual matching.
Most of the time, Peachtree is pretty good at matching transactions.
Occasionally, though, you have to do some matching. It really isn’t tough, 
so don’t worry.
The key at the bottom of the list of transactions helps you identify transactions
that haven’t been matched. In particular, you want to handle transactions
marked with a red flag. These are New Bank Record transactions that Peachtree
has identified as existing only at the bank — and not in your Peachtree company.
If the New Bank Record transactions really don’t exist in your Peachtree com-
pany, you need to enter them because the bank updated your account balance
by using them. Just minimize the Account Reconciliation window — you don’t
need to close it — and enter the transactions in the appropriate Peachtree
window. For example, choose Tasks➪Payments to record a check by using the
Payments window. When you redisplay the Account Reconciliation window
(you can click the Account Reconciliation button on the Windows taskbar),
Peachtree has updated it, and you can manually match the records.
If the New Bank Record transactions do exist in your Peachtree company,
manually match them by following these steps:
1. Click a New Bank Record transaction.
Peachtree adds the Quick Action buttons to the transaction (see 
Figure 16-4).
2. Click the Manual Match button.
Peachtree displays the Manual Matching dialog box (see Figure 16-5).
3. Select the Peachtree transaction that should match the New Bank
Record transaction.
4. Click the OK/Next button to continue matching other New Bank
Record transactions.
You might see a message explaining why Peachtree didn’t originally match
the transactions and asking whether you’re sure that they match. Click Yes.
316
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

If Peachtree incorrectly matches an imported bank record to a Peachtree
transaction, you can unclear it and then manually match it to the correct
transaction. Click the transaction in the Account Reconciliation window,
and then click the Unclear Quick Action button that appears when you
select the transaction. Then, follow Steps 2–4 to manually match the bank
record to the correct Peachtree transaction.

5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 as necessary.
Peachtree displays a message indicating that all transactions have been
matched. When you click OK, Peachtree redisplays the Account
Reconciliation window.
6. Check the Unreconciled Difference value.
Your goal is to make that value equal to 0.
• If the Unreconciled Difference value equals 0: You reconciled, and
you’re finished (pat yourself on the back). Just click the OK button
to save your work.
• If the Unreconciled Difference value doesn’t equal 0: Read the follow-
ing section, “When the Account Doesn’t Balance.” (Sorry.)
When the Account Doesn’t Balance
What do you do when you marked everything but the Unreconciled
Difference doesn’t equal 0? Well, you do a little detective work. Go dig your
detective hat and magnifying glass out of the closet so you can prepare to
snoop around. We’ll wait. . . .
Items to review
The Unreconciled Difference might not equal 0 for several reasons:
 The bank might have recorded a transaction that you didn’t record in
Peachtree. Look for bank charges, such as check reorder charges, other
service charges, or interest payments (assuming that your account is
interest bearing). Or, occasionally, you’ll write a check and forget to post
it in Peachtree, and the check will clear the bank.
 The bank might have recorded a transaction for a different amount
than you recorded in Peachtree. Compare the amounts of checks that
you recorded in Peachtree with the amount the bank cleared for the
check. Similarly, compare deposit amounts you recorded in Peachtree
with deposit amounts on the bank statement.
Add the digits of the unreconciled difference and see whether they equal
nine or a multiple of nine. If so, the odds are good that you transposed
the digits when recording one or more checks or deposits. We don’t
know why this works, but it does.
318
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

 You might have cleared a transaction that didn’t clear the bank.
Review the transactions you have cleared. If you used the Range button,
double-check the check numbers in the range both in Peachtree and on
the bank statement. When you mark a range, finding that transaction can
be difficult.
 You might have recorded the Statement Ending Balance incorrectly.
Make sure you typed the amount correctly.
If you determine that you need to correct an existing transaction or enter a
check or receipt, you can leave the Account Reconciliation window open
while you edit or add the transaction in the appropriate window. Repeat:
There is no need to close the Account Reconciliation window. To edit a check
or deposit, double-click it in the Account Reconciliation window; Peachtree
opens it in the window where you created it. To enter a check or deposit, just
ignore the Account Reconciliation window for a minute and choose Tasks➪
Payments to open the Payments window, or choose Tasks➪Receipts to open
the Receipts window. If you determine that you need to record either a bank
service charge or an interest payment, you can make an adjustment — read on.
Making adjustments
You can make an adjustment when you can’t find the problem and you decide
to write it off as a lost cause.
Accountants don’t frown on adjusting to reconcile the account when the dif-
ference is small (less than $5). You need to weigh the trade-offs: Is it worth
spending hours to find a nickel? We have to believe that your time is better
spent if you’re doing something other than looking for a dime or a quarter. On
the other hand, don’t write off large unreconciled differences and don’t make
a practice of writing off unreconciled differences because they will eventually
come back to haunt you.
To record an adjustment, follow these steps:
1. Click the Adjust button to open the General Journal Entry window.
Yep, that’s right, adjustments are journal entries. Don’t panic.
2. Record a journal entry.
On one line of the entry, select the Cash account you’re reconciling for
the GL account. On the other line of the entry, select an Income or
Expense account for the GL account. Record additional withdrawals for
check reorder charges as credits to the Cash account, and additional
deposits such as interest earned as debits to the Cash account.

Chapter 16: When the Bank Statement Arrives

Record the same amount on the other line that contains the Income or
Expense account. For additional withdrawals, select an Expense account
such as Bank Charges. For additional deposits, select an Income account
such as Interest Income. If you aren’t sure which account to select, ask
your accountant.
What about when you’re off by a small amount that you want to write
off? Remember this rule: If the Unreconciled Difference is negative, you
need to record a journal entry that credits the Cash account for the
Unreconciled Difference amount. If the Unreconciled Difference is posi-
tive, you need to record a journal entry that debits the Cash account for
the Unreconciled Difference amount. To record the other side of the
entry, set up an Expense account called something like Bank Over/Short.
3. After you finish, click the Save button and then click the Close button
to redisplay the Account Reconciliation window.
4. Select the check box next to each adjusting entry to mark it as cleared
and to balance your account.
Each debit or credit on the journal entry that affects the Cash account
appears as a separate entry in the Account Reconciliation window.
5. When the Unreconciled Difference equals 0, you can consider the
account reconciled. Click the OK button to close the Account
Reconciliation window.
If you later find the source of the problem that caused you to make the
adjustment and you want to delete or change the adjustment, choose
Lists➪General Journal Entries. Select the period in which you posted the
adjustment, click the transaction, and click the Open button. While viewing
the transaction in the General Journal Entry window, edit and save the trans-
action or delete it.
Printing the Reconciliation Summary
After all your hard work, you’ll want to print a record of the balanced recon-
ciliation. Follow these steps:
1. Choose Reports & Forms➪Account Reconciliation.
The Select a Report window appears, showing the available Account
Reconciliation reports.
2. From the list on the right, select Account Reconciliation.
3. Click the Print button to produce a paper copy of the report.
Peachtree prints a report similar to the one you see in Figure 16-6, show-
ing that the Unreconciled Difference is 0.
320
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

You might have noticed other available reports when you printed the
Account Reconciliation report. You don’t really need the Deposits in Transit,
Outstanding Checks, or Outstanding Other Items reports because all that
information appears on the Account Reconciliation report. We discuss the
Bank Deposit report in the “Before You Start Reconciling” section earlier in
this chapter; the Account Register report lists individual deposits and with-
drawals in the selected account.
In transit refers to checks you’ve written or deposits you’ve made that
haven’t yet cleared the bank.
You can see the same information that appears on the Account Register
report in the Account Register window. Choose Tasks➪Account Register to
display the window. (The window reminds us of the register you use with a
personal checking account to record deposits and withdrawals.) For the cur-
rent period, it lists only transactions that affect the Cash account. You can
switch to a different Cash account, and you can change the time frame dis-
played in the window. To see the details of any transaction, double-click to
drill down on it; Peachtree displays it in the window where you created it.

Chapter 17
When Accounting Cycles End . . .
and Other Miscellaneous Stuff
In This Chapter
 Changing accounting periods
 Making general journal entries
 Preparing the payroll quarterly report
 Completing year-end tasks
A
lot of stuff happens at the end of an accounting period — whether that
period is a month, a quarter, or a year. Most of it deals with finishing the
transactions that belong in the period that’s ending. But you need to start
working in a new period before you finish working in the old period because
you won’t have all the necessary information to finish working in a period on
the last day of the period. For example, you won’t be able to reconcile your
bank statement on the last day of the period because the bank hasn’t mailed
it to you yet.
In this chapter, we talk about the things you do at the end of each period —
and some other topics that just don’t fit well in any other chapter, such as
(and here come those words!) making journal entries.
Changing Accounting Periods
When you open Peachtree, note the date that appears in the middle of the
Button Control Bar, next to the current accounting period. The date matches
the system date on your computer, and Peachtree uses that date as the
default date for every transaction you enter.
This is true except when the accounting period changes. Look at an easy
example: You use standard months in the calendar year for accounting peri-
ods, and your fiscal year matches the calendar year.

324
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 
Fiscal year refers to the year your business uses. The fiscal year can be the
same as the calendar year, running from January 1 to December 31. Or the
fiscal year might run from April 1 to March 31 or from July 1 to June 30. You
and your accountant establish your fiscal year with the IRS.
So, assume that the current accounting period is January. All through the
month, Peachtree defaults transaction dates to the current day of the month
in January. On February 1, Peachtree will correctly report the date in the
Button Control Bar, but the default date for transactions will not be February
1 because you haven’t changed the accounting period. The default date on
transactions will be January 1 — and will remain January 1 for all subsequent
days — until you change the accounting period.
So, what’s the big deal? Well, you might be sitting around posting February
transactions in the accounting period that runs from January 1 through
January 31. That, of course, will misstate the financial condition of your busi-
ness for both January and February. You need to change the accounting
period on the first day of each new period.
“Is this a difficult thing?” you ask. Nope. “Don’t you need to wait to change
the accounting period until you’ve posted everything in the current period?”
Nope. You can switch back to any open period at any time. “You mean that
changing the accounting period doesn’t close it?” Yes, that’s what we mean.
In fact, in Peachtree, you can’t close a single accounting period; you can close
only a fiscal year, a subject we talk about later in this chapter.
Although you can change to a prior accounting period, we don’t recommend
that you make changes to transactions in a prior period after giving your data
to your accountant. Such actions tend to strain relationships.
If you enable security in Peachtree Complete or higher, a padlock symbol
appears in the Change Accounting Periods dialog box next to prior periods. You
can allow users to view prior period transactions but prevent them from editing
those transactions using Peachtree’s security settings. In the User Security
window, click the Company tab. Then, under Tasks, open the Transactions in
Prior Periods list box and choose Read. For more information on Peachtree and
security, see Chapter 18.
When you move forward to a new accounting period and operate on an
accrual basis, Peachtree asks you whether you want to print invoices,
checks, and reports before changing the period. (If you operate on a cash
basis and have printed all checks and invoices, Peachtree asks only about
reports.) If you haven’t finished entering transactions for the period, you
don’t need to print anything. However, we suggest that you simply answer no
to these questions, even if you’ve entered all transactions. Then when you’ve
finished entering everything for a period, use the Reports menu to print all
the reports for the period — the journals discussed at the end of the chap-
ters in Part II and the financial reports discussed in Chapter 14.
100 235

To make the report-printing process easier, create a report group that con-
tains all the reports you want to print at the end of a period. Then you won’t
need to select and set up each report. To find out how to make a report
group, see Chapter 14.
So, why do we suggest that you print reports using the Reports menu before
you change the accounting period? Well, the window you see when you’re
selecting reports to print while changing the accounting period doesn’t
include a few reports that you might find useful, such as the Balance Sheet,
Income Statement, and Trial Balance reports. And although you can print
these reports at any time for any period, printing them for an accounting
period while you’re working in that accounting period is easiest.
Second (for reasons we don’t understand), when you print reports while
changing the period, Peachtree displays reports from prior periods as well as
reports from the current period. You might think the reports appear because
you’ve changed a transaction in a prior period, but we can’t prove that.
We’ve found that printing reports using a report group is faster and easier.
Follow these steps to change the accounting period if you operate on an
accrual basis:
1. Click the Period button (as shown here) on the Button Control Bar or
choose Tasks➪System➪Change Accounting Period.
The Change Accounting Period dialog box appears (see Figure 17-1).
Figure 17-1:
Use this
dialog box
to switch to
a different
period.
325
Chapter 17: When Accounting Cycles End . . . and Other Miscellaneous Stuff

2. Click the new period you want to use and then click OK.
Peachtree might display a dialog box asking whether you want to print
invoices or checks. If the dialog box appears, we suggest that you click
No and print invoices or checks using the batch printing method
described in Chapter 13.
When you select No, Peachtree displays another dialog box asking
whether you want to print reports. Again, we suggest that you click No
and create a report group to print reports as described in Chapter 14.
Peachtree changes the accounting period; you’ll see the new period
reflected at the top of the screen.
If you operate on a cash basis and have no unprinted invoices or checks,
Peachtree doesn’t ask whether you want to print invoices and checks, but it
does ask whether you want to print reports. Again, we advise that you not
print reports at this time. Instead, see Chapter 14 to learn how to create a
report group to print the necessary end-of-period reports.
Making General Journal Entries
Okay, don’t be freaked by the title of this section. Journal entries are nothing
more than another type of transaction to enter in Peachtree. You just won’t
use journal entries as often as you do other types of transactions. In fact,
here’s a good rule to follow:
Don’t enter journal entries unless your accountant tells you to make the entry
and you really know what you’re doing.
You see, the truth is, you can usually find another way to enter the informa-
tion. For example, when you pay your telephone bill of $57.50, you spend
money from your Cash account and identify what you spent the money on by
making an entry in your Telephone account. Although you can use the
General Journal Entry window, it’s much easier to write a check from the
Payments window or the Select for Payment window.
By the way, this example also demonstrates what accounting types mean
when they talk about double-entry bookkeeping. The term simply means that
each transaction conducted by your business causes you — and your
accounting software — to make at least two entries. And here come those
dreaded words: One entry is a debit, and one entry is a credit. The most
important thing to know about debits and credits is that they must equal
each other. Do you need to know this? No. When you use Peachtree’s various
Task windows, Peachtree does the work for you. Can it hurt you to know this?
No. Who knows . . . knowing may even help you.
100 235
500

326
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

So, when would you use the General Journal Entry window? Well, you’d use it
to record the depreciation of assets. Most businesses let their accountants
figure the amount of the depreciation — and then the accountant gives you
the journal entry information so you can enter the transaction. Or, if you use
job costing (see Chapter 12), you can add overhead to a job using a journal
entry.
If you’re interested in the how-and-why of debits and credits, read Bonus
Chapter 5, “The Accounting Equation — Whom to Blame and How It Works,”
which you can find on this book’s Web site, www.dummies.com/go/
peachtreefd.
Okay, now that you understand to not make journal entries unless you really
need to make them, we’ll show you how to make them:
We set the window display to show two lines for each entry so that you can
see the account name below each line along with the other information for
the line. To set your display to show two lines per entry, see Bonus Chapter 1
on this book’s Web site, www.dummies.com/go/peachtreefd.
1. Choose Tasks➪General Journal Entry.
Peachtree displays the General Journal Entry window (see Figure 17-2).
2. If necessary, change the date.
3. Enter a reference number to identify the transaction.
We use JE (for Journal Entry) and then the month and date (refer to Figure
17-2). And yes, you can use the same reference number more than once.
Figure 17-2:
To be able
to record a
journal
entry, it

Chapter 17: When Accounting Cycles End . . . and Other Miscellaneous Stuff

4. In the GL Account column, click the lookup list button (as shown here)
to select the first account you want to change.
Accountants like for you to list debits first and then credits. Doing so is
not a rule, but this habit will make you look more professional. We’re
going to assume that you want to look professional, so enter the debit
first and then the credit.
5. In the Description column, enter the reason for the transaction.
Peachtree copies these words to the next line for you, saving you the
typing. You can change them on the next line if you want.
6. In the Debit column, enter the amount.
7. If necessary, assign a job to the entry.
8. Repeat Steps 4–7, but in Step 6, enter the amount in the Credit
column.
When you finish, debits should equal credits. If they don’t, the amount
that you’re out of balance appears at the bottom of the window. If you’re
out of balance, fix things before you try to save. Peachtree won’t let you
save the entry if it’s out of balance.
9. Click Save (as shown here) to save the journal entry.
For some journal entries, you might need to enter multiple debits to offset
one credit or multiple credits to offset one debit, or even multiple debits and
multiple credits to offset each other. That’s fine. A journal entry consists of a
set of debits and credits that equal each other. Also, your accountant might
send you a list of entries to make before you close the fiscal year. You can
make all the entries in one General Journal Entry transaction — maybe even
with a description such as “Adjustment per CPA.” That is, you can keep enter-
ing lines in the General Journal Entry window using only one reference
number.
Accounting Behind the Screens
If you chose the Hide General Ledger Accounts option for your company in the
Maintain Global Options dialog box, your transaction windows don’t look like
the ones we show throughout this book. In particular, you don’t see any General
Ledger accounts in your transaction windows. See Bonus Chapter 1 on this
book’s Web site, www.dummies.com/go/peachtreefd, for a comparison of
what windows look like when you hide or display General Ledger accounts.
In Chapter 5, we allude to a neat way to identify the accounts Peachtree
updates while you enter transactions even if you don’t display the General
100 235
500
99
83
328
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

Ledger accounts in your transaction window. Click the Journal button in the
window (as shown here), and Peachtree displays the Accounting Behind the
Screens dialog box shown in Figure 17-3.
And yes, you can make changes in this dialog box to modify one or more of
the accounts Peachtree updates for this transaction, but we don’t recom-
mend it. Notice that you can’t change a debit to a credit or vice versa; if you
change the accounts and you don’t know what you’re doing, you’ll really
mess up your company’s books.
Batch Posting
Don’t read this section if you’re using real-time posting. You’ll just waste your
time.
People who like batch posting typically work in a multi-user environment and
want to review transactions before updating the General Ledger. When you
use batch posting in Peachtree, you save transactions as you enter them, but
they don’t update your accounts — or appear on reports — until you post.
You choose batch or real-time posting in the Maintain Company window. See
Chapter 2 for more information.
You can’t create purchase orders behind the scenes if you use batch posting.
Figure 17-3:
This is the

Peachtree is

329
Chapter 17: When Accounting Cycles End . . . and Other Miscellaneous Stuff

Okay, so you know you need to post to update your accounts. You also need
to make sure you post all journals before you try to change the accounting
period. If you use batch posting, follow these steps to post:
1. Choose Tasks➪System➪Post.
Peachtree displays the Post dialog box shown in Figure 17-4.
2. Select the journal you want to post, or leave the check mark in All
Journals to post everything.
3. Click OK.
Peachtree displays a bar across the screen while it posts and then redis-
plays the main Peachtree window when posting finishes.
Before producing many reports, Peachtree asks batch posting users whether
they want to post before viewing the report.
Preparing the Payroll Quarterly 
Report (941)
This one’s easy. You’re gonna love it. As long as you subscribe to any
Peachtree Payroll Solution, you just print a form. You can print the form onto
plain paper, and the IRS will accept the form in lieu of the preprinted form
that it sends you each quarter, or you can file it electronically (e-filing).
We recommend that you print the 941 Worksheet (or the 941B Worksheet if
appropriate) before you print the Federal Form 941; choose Reports &
Forms➪Payroll. The worksheet will show you the amount you were supposed
to deposit during the quarter — and we assume that you make your payroll
tax deposits in a timely fashion, as required by law. You’ll need the amount
you deposited to print an accurate Federal Form 941.
Figure 17-4:
Use this
dialog box

330
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

To print an Employer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Return, follow these steps.
1. Choose Reports & Forms➪Forms➪Tax Forms.
Peachtree displays the Select a Report or Form window. In the Form
Types list, Peachtree selects Tax Forms and displays available tax forms.
2. In the Forms list, select Payroll Tax forms.
Peachtree displays a sample Federal 940; don’t let that throw you.
3. Click the Print Preview button.
Peachtree displays the Payroll Tax Form Selector dialog box (see 
Figure 17-5.
4. In the Select Form Type section, select the Federal option button.
5. From the Available Forms list, choose the 941/Schedule B form for the
appropriate year.
6. In the Select Filing Period section, click the Quarter drop-down list
arrow and select the quarter for which you’re reporting.
7. Click OK.
Peachtree opens the form on-screen (see Figure 17-6) and displays the
Report Steps dialog box, which explains the steps you need to take to
complete the form. Click OK to dismiss the dialog box. The Red Fields
dialog box appears to remind you to fill out each field surrounded by a
red flashing box. Click OK to dismiss the dialog box.
Figure 17-5:
Use this
dialog box

331
Chapter 17: When Accounting Cycles End . . . and Other Miscellaneous Stuff

You can make changes to fields highlighted in blue, but we don’t recom-
mend that unless your accountant tells you to make changes.
8. Fill out each field that Peachtree highlights with a red flashing box.
Press Tab to move to the next field surrounded by a red flashing box.
The choices in Part 2, Line 15 determine whether Peachtree also dis-
plays the Schedule B. If Peachtree displays the Schedule B, continue fill-
ing in the fields surrounded by red flashing boxes. When you finish filling
fields surrounded by red flashing boxes, Peachtree displays a blue flash-
ing box around your company name.
9. To print a copy of the report for your records, click the Next Step
button (as shown here) on the toolbar above the report.
Peachtree displays a message that indicates that you won’t be able to
make changes to the report if you continue. The message offers you the
opportunity to double-check your work (by clicking the Double Check
button). Or click the Agree button to continue with the printing process.
10. Click the Print button (as shown here) to print your copy.
Peachtree prints the form. If your printer cuts off any portion of the
form, you should e-file the form.
Figure 17-6:

11. Click the Next Step button again.
Peachtree displays the Filing Options dialog box.
12. Click the e-File button to file the report electronically or click the
Print button to print a copy of the report that you can mail to the IRS.
Printing W-2s
You must print W-2s before you close the Payroll Tax year. To print W-2s, you
follow Steps 1–7 in the preceding section, selecting W-2s in Step 5. A wizard
then displays a checklist that you can print of things you need to verify. The
wizard then walks you through the process of verifying employee informa-
tion, such as name, address, Social Security number, and wage information,
and company information and printing W-2s. After you dismiss that dialog
box, you begin the verification process. In Figure 17-7, we’re printing only one
W-2, just to give you an idea. By default, Peachtree automatically includes all
employees whom you’ve paid during the current year when you choose All
employees, even if you’ve marked an employee as inactive.
You mark an employee inactive in the Maintain Employees/Sales Reps
window when the employee no longer works for you. If the employee worked
for you during any part of a calendar year, though, you must provide the
employee with a W-2. Also, by marking the employee inactive, you make the
employee a candidate for purging, which we talk about later in this chapter.
Click the Next Step button at the top of the window until you complete the
review process. Peachtree asks you to review all employee information first
and then all company information. After you finish reviewing information,
Peachtree gives you the option to e-file W-2s or to print your own. If you
choose to print W-2s, Peachtree displays them on-screen (see Figure 17-8),
and you can use the Print Final button at the top of the window to print the
W-2s. After you print W-2s, the wizard prompts you to print the W-3
Transmittal of Wage and Tax Statements form that accompanies W-2s when
you submit them.
Figure 17-7:

Chapter 17: When Accounting Cycles End . . . and Other Miscellaneous Stuff

Printing 1099s
You’ll need to purchase 1099 forms and load them into your printer.
You can purchase your forms from your local office supply store or printer
(the people, not the machines), or you can use the offers you receive in your
Peachtree software box. Chapter 21 lists Web contact information on a few
sources for forms. (If you contact Deluxe Forms at 800-328-0304 and reference
this book and discount code R03578, you’ll receive 20 percent off your first
order.)
You follow the same steps to print 1099s that you follow to print the Federal
Form 941, outlined in the earlier section, “Preparing the Payroll Quarterly
Report (941).” Follow Steps 1–7, but, in Step 2, select the appropriate 1099
form: 1099-MISC Preprinted or 1099-INT Preprinted.
Peachtree displays the Preview and Print 1099 Forms dialog box, where you
select the year for which you’re printing the forms and the vendors for whom
you want to print the form. By default, Peachtree automatically includes all
vendors who meet both of the following criteria:
Figure 17-8:
If you
choose to
print W-2s,
Peachtree
displays
them on-
screen.
334
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

 You select Independent Contractor or Interest in the 1099 Type field of
the Maintain Vendors window.
 You paid more than $600.00 or more than $10.00 in interest during the
calendar year.
Read Chapter 5 for information on setting up vendors and the 1099 Type field.
You must print 1099s before you close the payroll year. You can modify the
form if necessary; see Chapter 13.
Peachtree supports producing 1099s for only two types of vendors: Interest
(1099-INT) and Independent Contractors (1099-MISC). If you need to produce
1099s for more than two types of 1099 vendors, workarounds exist, but they
are beyond the scope of this book. So, once again, if you like this book, contact
Wiley and tell them that you want them to hire us to write a Peachtree Bible.
Updating Payroll Tax Tables
To calculate payroll accurately, Peachtree uses tax tables. Each tax table is
associated with the current year. The name of the table ends with the last two
digits of the current year, which means that as you begin a new calendar year,
you must have new tax tables with names that include the last two digits of
the new year. In addition, the calculations in the tax table might have changed,
and you need to make sure that the tax tables will calculate correctly.
So, how do you do this? We suggest that you subscribe to one of the
Peachtree Payroll Solutions. Whenever the government makes changes to
payroll tax tables or payroll forms, the Peachtree updates your tax tables via
electronic download. For more information on the services and subscribing,
visit www.peachtree.com.
As an alternative, you can manually update the User-Maintained tax tables in
Peachtree. Because most tax tables you see in the User-Maintained Payroll
Tax Tables window don’t change drastically from year to year, you can use
last year’s tax table as a model to create this year’s table.
If you start a new payroll year and attempt to process payroll without creat-
ing new tables for the new year, Peachtree displays a message indicating that
it couldn’t find tax table calculations and offers to update your User-
Maintained tax tables for you by creating new tables using last year’s tables
as models.
For details on creating a User-Maintained tax table, see the section on union
dues in Chapter 19. However, be aware that out of the box, Peachtree doesn’t
335
Chapter 17: When Accounting Cycles End . . . and Other Miscellaneous Stuff

come with tax tables needed to calculate federal income tax, Social Security,
and Medicare. To use payroll, you must have these tables. So, either set them
up yourself as User-Maintained tax tables or pop for one of the Peachtree
Payroll Solutions. Further, even if you set up these tax tables yourself, you
won’t be able to produce the payroll forms we describe earlier in this chap-
ter: namely, the 941 and the W-2. To produce those forms, you need to sub-
scribe to one of the Peachtree Payroll Solutions.
“If I can’t print payroll forms without subscribing to a Peachtree Payroll
Solution, why would I bother to set up User-Maintained tables?” you ask. If
you’re recording after-the-fact payroll — say, an outside service prepares 
all your payroll information for you — setting up User-Maintained tables 
will suit your needs and make your payroll entry easy.
Understanding Closing
Closing the Payroll Tax Year and the Fiscal Year are not difficult or time con-
suming. The activities that you should complete before closing, however, can
indeed be time consuming. Before we jump into describing those activities,
you should understand what happens when you close in Peachtree.
Closing in Peachtree automatically does the equivalent of manually preparing
and posting closing entries to the General Ledger. In addition, Peachtree
resets all your vendors’, customers’, and employees’ year-to-date totals to
zero. That way, you can begin monitoring the new year’s purchases with each
vendor; sales with each customer; and wages, benefits, deductions, and taxes
with each employee.
Why does Peachtree enable you to close the payroll tax year separately from
the fiscal year? The payroll tax year is based on a calendar year. When you
close the payroll tax year, Peachtree zeros-out year-to-date wage and tax
information for employees and year-to-date purchasing information for ven-
dors — the information that appears on W-2s and 1099s. However, your fiscal
year might or might not be a calendar year. When you close the fiscal year,
Peachtree zeros-out other information (such as year-to-date customer infor-
mation) and closes everything, including the General Ledger. If your fiscal
year is the same as your calendar year, you still need to let Peachtree close
both years to close everything.
Even if you don’t use payroll, you need to close the payroll year to zero-out
year-to-date vendor purchase information.
When you close, Peachtree automatically closes the first 12 periods, which
make up the oldest open year. Timing is everything when you talk about clos-
ing. Typically, no one is ready to close a year on December 31. But because
Peachtree allows you to have two years — 24 periods — open simultaneously,
336
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

you should have no trouble moving forward to the new year while leaving the
prior year open. Therefore, closing should not become a pressing issue unless
you find that you’re working in Period 24 and need to move to a new open
period. If you find yourself in this situation, you need to close both the Payroll
Tax Year and the Fiscal Year. Then, Peachtree will close Periods 1–12 and then
renumber so that the periods that used to be 13–24 become 1–12.
To identify the years you have open, click the Period button on the Button
Bar to display the Change Accounting Period dialog box (refer to Figure 17-1).
The open Fiscal and Payroll Tax Years appear on the right side of the box.
Payroll housekeeping tasks
Before you close the payroll year in Peachtree, you must finish payroll pro-
cessing for the year you intend to close. You should check employee back-
ground information, wage information, and tax information. Printing W-2s
should be the last task you perform for the year you intend to close so that
you can be sure that the information on the forms will be accurate.
If you have adjustments or fringe benefits that should be reflected on W-2s,
you can include them in the last payroll of the year, or you can run a separate
payroll. We recommend that you try to include them in the last payroll of the
year. See Chapter 9 for information on setting up and paying bonuses.
Because Peachtree keeps open two payroll years, you can prepare payroll for
the new calendar year before you close the old calendar year as long as the
period assigned to the January of the new calendar year is Period 13. Before
you prepare payroll in the new calendar year, you’ll receive a Peachtree
Payroll Tax Service Update that contains information relevant to both the
year you’re finishing and the year you’re starting. You’ll want to install that
update before you print payroll tax and vendor 1099 forms and calculate
fixed asset depreciation for the year you’re finishing.
Non-payroll area housekeeping tasks
Before you close a year, take the time to complete general housekeeping
tasks in Peachtree before you purge old, unnecessary data from your
Peachtree company. And, you don’t need to worry about losing information if
you purge; even though Peachtree purges inactive transactions, the program
retains enough information to produce comparative financial statements. You
read about purging later in this chapter.
Review Table 17-1 for ideas on the year-end housekeeping tasks you should
consider for other accounting areas besides payroll.

Chapter 17: When Accounting Cycles End . . . and Other Miscellaneous Stuff

Table 17-1
Year-end Housekeeping Tasks for Non-Payroll Areas
Accounting Area
Considerations
Accounts Payable
In addition to printing 1099s before closing the payroll
year, consider identifying any vendors with whom you no
longer do business and marking them inactive in the
Maintain Vendors window. Also review open purchase
orders and close any that you know you won’t fill,
making them candidates for purging along with inactive
vendors.
Inventory
Although there are no special year-end procedures for
inventory in Peachtree, many businesses perform a
physical inventory count at this time of year. The
Peachtree Physical Inventory List report contains space
for you to enter actual counts, which makes taking phys-
ical inventory easier. Be sure to print an Inventory
Valuation Report after you adjust your quantities to the
physical count.
Accounts Receivable
Review customers; and, in the Maintain
Customers/Prospects window, mark inactive those with
whom you no longer do business. Review open quotes
and sales orders and close any that you know you won’t
fill, making them candidates for purging. You should also
review your Aged Receivables report for possible bad
debts and write off any amounts that you know you
won’t collect.
Job Cost
Job costing helps you track costs and revenues over the
life of a project. By its very nature, job costing doesn’t
run on a calendar or fiscal year basis and has no end-of-
year procedures. Still, you should review existing jobs
and mark appropriate ones as inactive from the Maintain
Jobs window.
Account Reconciliation
Reconcile your December bank statements before you
close the fiscal year to make reconciled checks and
deposits candidates for purging. Unreconciled transac-
tions remain in the system.
General Ledger
Make year-end adjustments before closing; you get
those from your accountant after he or she has prepared
the income tax return for the business. Also review your
Chart of Accounts for accounts you’re no longer using
and mark those accounts inactive.
338
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

Checking your data for common 
accounting mistakes
You can use the Peachtree Internal Accounting Review feature at the end of
each month — or, at a minimum, before you close the year — to double-
check your company for common mistakes. For example, the Internal
Accounting Review checks for payments or checks that don’t credit a cash
account, like most checks normally do. The Internal Accounting Review
checks for 15 common mistakes in accrual-based companies and 11 common
mistakes in cash-based companies. You can run the Internal Accounting
Review by choosing Reports & Forms➪Internal Accounting Review. Peachtree
displays the Internal Accounting Review window, as shown in Figure 17-9.
Areas with transactions that are atypical appear with a red flag in the right
side of the window, and areas where no potentially problematic transactions
exist appear with a green check in the right side of the window.
Figure 17-9:
The Internal
Accounting
Review
helps you
identify and
correct
common
mistakes.
339
Chapter 17: When Accounting Cycles End . . . and Other Miscellaneous Stuff

You can click any potentially problematic transaction, and Peachtree displays
it in the window where you created it, leaving the Internal Accounting Review
window in the background. Inspect the transaction, makes changes as appro-
priate to correct the transaction, and then save it.
When you redisplay the Internal Accounting Review window, click the
Refresh button in the upper left of the window to recheck your data.
Peachtree doesn’t make you fix the transactions it identifies; it’s quite possi-
ble that the transactions are correct as is. You, as the human in the equation,
have the final say. If you are unsure whether to correct a transaction, discuss
it with your accountant.
When you change the accounting period or close a year, Peachtree offers you
the opportunity to run the Internal Accounting Review.
Archiving your data
If you’re using Peachtree Premium or higher, you can archive your company
data at any time, but the end of the year is a good time to create an archive
copy of your company data. When you archive data, Peachtree creates a
read-only copy of your company that you can use to print reports and review
transactions. From your accountant’s perspective, the good news is that you
can’t add, change, or delete anything in an archived company. Accountants
really don’t like it when you make changes to a closed period (it kind of
makes them nuts). And, if you create an archive copy of your data to use for
prior-year research right before you close, you will make your accountant
very happy.
You might want to change the period to the last month (typically December)
of the year you’re archiving before you create the archive file. If you change
periods like we suggest, Peachtree displays that month when you open the
archive file.
Although you get the opportunity to create an archive company while you
close your year, we find separating the two processes easier to understand.
To create an archive company, choose File➪Archive Company. In the Archive
Company window, supply a name for the archive company. Peachtree sug-
gests the name Archive-XXXXXX, where the Xs represent the date in six-digit
format, which works for us. Then, click Archive, and Peachtree creates the
archive company.
If you archive multiple companies, include the company name after “Archive”
so that you can easily identify a particular company archive file.
340
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

To use an archived company, choose File➪Open Archived Company.
Peachtree displays the Open Archived Company dialog box, which lists all
archived companies you’ve created. Select the one you want to open and
then click OK. Your company name along with the archive date appear in the
title bar of the window.
After you review reports or transactions, choose File➪Open Previous
Company to view a list of companies you can open. Select your company
from the list. Note that archive companies do not appear in this list.
Peachtree stores archived companies in a folder called Archives, which
appears inside your company folder after you create your first archive com-
pany. Should you happen to be housecleaning and get the urge, you can
delete old archives from the Archives folder. However, the government often
tasks two or three years to question a tax return or payroll tax filing, so use
the same record-keeping rules for archive files that you use for other docu-
mentation that supports your tax returns. Typically you should keep three
years’ worth of documentation. If the IRS suspects you of committing fraud,
they may want to look back seven years, so, if you’re committing fraud, keep
at least seven years worth of archive files.
Using the Year-End Wizard
We suggest that you print any year-end reports you want before you start the
Year-End Wizard. When you close the payroll tax year, Peachtree doesn’t
prompt you to print any reports. And when you close the fiscal year,
Peachtree selects the reports for you that you can print. To retain some
choice in this matter, print all your reports before you start the Year-End
Wizard. See Chapter 14 for details on printing reports.
You can’t cancel the year-end closing process after you click the Begin Close
button in the Year-End Wizard. Restoring from a backup becomes the only
way you can “undo.”
In addition to the backup that Peachtree will force you to make before clos-
ing, we suggest that you use the archiving feature available in Peachtree
Premium and higher, as we describe in the earlier “Archiving your data” sec-
tion, so that you’ll have access to reporting and transaction details in closed
years. If you’re using other versions of Peachtree, we suggest that before
closing, you create a prior-year company (see Chapter 19) so that you can
print reports and view transaction details in closed years.
The closing process closes the first 12 periods. By the time you close these
periods, you won’t be working in them anymore; instead, you’ll be working in
Period 13 or later. It’s safe to close the first 12 periods if you’ve finished all
the work for those periods.
341
Chapter 17: When Accounting Cycles End . . . and Other Miscellaneous Stuff

Closing the payroll year
Peachtree asks you to back up during the closing process, so make sure you
have disks or a flash drive available.
Even if your company’s fiscal year doesn’t match the calendar year, payroll
always operates on a calendar-year basis. Therefore, sometime in January,
after you create your last payroll for the preceding year, confirm that your
payroll data is complete, and print your W-2s, you’re ready to close your pay-
roll information for last year.
You won’t be able to cancel this process after the first screen.
Follow these steps to close the payroll year:
1. Choose Tasks➪System➪Year-End Wizard.
Peachtree displays the current open years. Fiscal years appear on the
left side of the window, and payroll tax years appear on the right.
2. Click Next to display the Close Options dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 17-10.
3. Select the Payroll Tax Year option button and then click Next.
Payroll Tax Year is not an option if the oldest open year is the current
year.
If you have any unprinted payroll checks or if you have not yet printed
W-2s or 1099s, Peachtree prompts you to print them before you con-
tinue. Click Cancel, print the appropriate forms, and restart the closing
process. After you close, you won’t be able to print them.

Peachtree displays a window where you can confirm that you are closing
the payroll tax year for the previous year.
7. Click Next.
The Begin Close-Year Process window appears. This is your final chance
to cancel before closing.
8. Click Begin Close.
Peachtree closes the oldest open payroll tax year and displays a window
where you see the new open years, both fiscal and payroll.
9. Click Finish.
You can now continue to enter payroll information into the next year.
Closing the fiscal year
When you finish processing and made all adjustments to a fiscal year —
adjustments typically identified by your accountant while processing your
tax return — you need to close that fiscal year in Peachtree. You’ll probably
postpone closing a fiscal year until well after you start a new one. For exam-
ple, if your fiscal year matches the calendar year, you probably won’t close
last year any earlier than March of the current year.
343
Chapter 17: When Accounting Cycles End . . . and Other Miscellaneous Stuff

We suggest that you print any reports for the year that you’re closing before
you start the closing process. Although you can print reports during the
process, they are the reports Peachtree selects — not necessarily the ones
you would select.
In addition, before Peachtree will let you close a fiscal year, you must not
have any purchases that are “Waiting on Bill” from the vendor in the year that
you want to close. Typically, you will have received all bills by the time you
want to close the fiscal year. If you haven’t, you should change these transac-
tions. We suggest that you create a custom Aged Payables report that
includes the Waiting on Bill field and print the report for the entire year. From
the report, you can drill down and view transactions that display a Y in the
Waiting on Bill From Vendor column and edit them appropriately.
Depending on the amount of data in your company, closing can take awhile.
You can’t interrupt the process.
To close the fiscal year, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪System➪Year-End Wizard.
Peachtree displays the current open years. Fiscal years appear on the
left side of the window, and payroll tax years appear on the right.
2. Click Next to display the Close Options window.
3. Select Fiscal Year and then click Next.
If you didn’t previously close the payroll tax year, select the Fiscal and
Payroll Tax Years option button.
4. Click Next.
If you have any unprinted checks, Peachtree prompts you to print them
before you continue. Click Cancel to print them and then restart the
closing process. You won’t be able to print them after you close the
Peachtree Fiscal Year-End Reports window.
5. If you follow our advice and printed all your reports before you
started, click the Check None button and then click Next.
If you use Peachtree Premium or higher, the Internal Accounting Review

This window presents your final chance to cancel before closing.
11. Click Begin Close.
Peachtree closes the oldest open year(s) and displays a window where
you see the new open years, both fiscal and payroll.
12. Click Finish.
Purging
You can purge information from your company data files at any time, but
most people like to tie purging with other year-end activities. Peachtree lets
you purge transactions in only closed years of your company, and you can
purge payroll and 1099 transactions only after you close both the fiscal and
payroll tax years during which you entered those transactions. So, purging
after closing is the way to go.
Purging can take quite a long time, depending on the size of your data, the
speed of your computer, and the age of the transactions you choose to
include in the purge. Peachtree’s purge process doesn’t have a limit to the
number of passes it makes, or the time it takes to go through the journal file.
We strongly recommend that you start this process before leaving for the
night or weekend.
345
Chapter 17: When Accounting Cycles End . . . and Other Miscellaneous Stuff

If your Peachtree journal file is large, you might want to purge every month.
To determine the size of your journal file, choose Help➪Customer Support
and Service➪File Statistics and look at the Size in Kbytes column for the Jrnl
Rows file. If this file is larger than 50MB, you’ll probably want to purge in
small increments.
Peachtree purges two types of data:
 Transactions: Quotes, invoices, sales orders, receipts, purchases, pur-
chase orders, payments, paychecks, and general journal entries from
previous years that are no longer needed. If you use Peachtree Complete
or higher, Peachtree also purges time and expense tickets.
 Inactives: Customers, vendors, employees, inventory items, jobs (and
phases and cost codes if you use Peachtree Complete or higher), and
General Ledger accounts that you’ve marked as Inactive in the Maintain
windows.
If you plan to purge inactives, you should also purge transactions because
Peachtree won’t purge inactives if any transactions apply to them.
Follow these steps to purge information:
1. Choose Tasks➪System➪Purge Wizard.
Peachtree displays a screen that tells you the earliest date you can use
to purge data.
2. Click Next.
Peachtree displays the Back Up Company Data window.
3. Click the Back Up button.
Peachtree displays the Back Up Company window, where you can
choose to include your company name in the backup filename, For
detailed instructions on creating a backup, see Chapter 18.
When Peachtree finishes the backup, you see the Back Up Company
Data window again.
4. Click Next.
Peachtree displays the Old Transactions window, as shown in Figure 17-11.
5. Select the date Peachtree uses to identify transactions to purge as well
as the types of transactions to purge.
The choices concerning Audit Trails and Tickets appear only if you’re
using Peachtree Complete or higher.

6. Click Next.
The Account Reconciliation window appears.
7. Identify accounts that you reconcile. Most people reconcile Cash
accounts at a minimum, but you can also reconcile other accounts.
Double-click the arrow in the Use column for any account type to dis-
play the account numbers. Then add a check mark next to each account
you reconcile. Peachtree purges all unreconciled transactions dated ear-
lier than the purge date you establish in Step 5.
8. Click Next.
The Inactive Maintenance Records window appears.
9. Select the check box next to each type of inactive maintenance record
that you want to purge.
Maintenance records are the ones you create for customers, vendors,
employees, General Ledger accounts, inventory items, and jobs in the
windows that open when you select a command on the Maintain menu.
10. Click Next.
The Summary of Options window appears, and you see a list of the
choices you made in the wizard.
11. Click Begin Purge.
You can stop a purge as long as the Stop button is available in the Purge
Is in Progress window. When that button appears dimmed, you can’t
safely interrupt the purge. Yes, that means turning off your computer at
this point is not recommended.

12. When the purge finishes, click Close.
You can click the Log button to see a file in the Windows Notepad listing
your selection criteria and information about what did and did not purge
(see Figure 17-12).
When Stuff Doesn’t Purge
Sometimes, after purging, you’ll find information still in the system that you
think should have been purged. Peachtree follows some extensive rules when
selecting information to purge.
We don’t have room to list all the rules Peachtree follows, but we do list the
ones that we believe affect the majority of transactions that don’t purge.
Anything that Peachtree leaves in your database, we call a saved transaction.
We refer to the date you specify while setting up a purge (the one that identi-
fies the latest transaction date Peachtree will purge) as the Purge Through
date. Peachtree saves the following:
Figure 17-12:
The purge
log shows
you what
information
was and
wasn’t
purged.
348
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

 All transactions dated later than the Purge Through date
 All transactions in any open year
 All inventory adjustment transactions
 Purchases and invoices that are not completely paid as of the Purge
Through date
 All cash disbursements or receipts applied to a saved purchase or
invoice
 All purchases and invoices that are related to saved cash disburse-
ments or cash receipts
 Purchases or invoices related to unpurged jobs
 Open sales orders and purchase orders
 All quotes with a transaction date or good-through date later than the
Purge Through date
 Unreconciled transactions (as of the Purge Through date) associated
with an account you designate as one you reconcile
 For Peachtree Complete and higher, time or expense tickets dated
later than the Purge Through date or available as reimbursable
expense tickets
If you haven’t chosen to purge unused time tickets, Peachtree also saves
unused tickets for employees paid using time tickets and tickets tied to
customers where the ticket status is HOLD.
 Inactive jobs (and phases and cost codes for users of Peachtree Complete
and higher) with saved transactions that refer to the inactive job
Use the purge log to review what Peachtree purged and what it didn’t purge.
The log will even tell you why an item wasn’t purged. Peachtree stores the
purge log (purge.txt) in your company data folder. You can open it at any
time by locating and double-clicking it.

 Backing up and restoring data
 Setting up user security
 Using the audit trail
L
ike with any financial software, a business has a lot at stake with Peachtree
data. After all, it holds the financial picture of the business. In this chapter,
we show you how to protect that data. You discover how to protect your data
from computer failure as well as from unauthorized entry. We even show you
how to play detective and snoop on what others are doing to your financial
data. (However, we don’t provide the detective hat, overcoat, and spyglass.
Those you need to provide for yourself.)
Backing Up Your Data
Prepare yourself. We’re going to nag at you here.
You know the silly (but popular) little saying, “Stuff happens.” (That’s not
exactly how it goes, but you get the idea.) Well, it’s true. Things happen. Now,
we don’t mean to sound pessimistic, but computers do fail, data gets deleted
or corrupted, and disasters (such as fire or theft) can occur.
Well, you can always get another computer and reload Peachtree. Even mil-
lions of dollars, though, can’t buy back all the work that you’ve put into
Peachtree. That’s why backing up your company data files on a regular basis
is important. You can then restore your data if necessary.
Even if your network administrator backs up to a tape every day, you still
should make your own Peachtree backup. This is our years of experience
talking here.

352
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 
By backing up company data within Peachtree, your company data files and
customized forms are backed up using the Peachtree format. You can save
your Peachtree backup to another hard drive; or other mediums, such as
Flash drives and recordable CDs. Personally, we recommend that you use 
a Flash drive because they are reliable, inexpensive, fast, and very portable.
If you choose to back up your company data to a tape device, you must exit
Peachtree and use the tape backup to copy the company files. To make back-
ups to those mediums, refer to the tape instruction manual. However, we really
don’t recommend this method. And don’t forget to look up how to restore those
tape backups: The non-standardization of tape backup functioning is one of the
reasons we really don’t recommend this method.
Establish a regular policy for backing up your data. Backups are the only way
to guarantee the safety of the accounting records that you create in Peachtree.
Without backups, you run the risk of losing weeks, months, or even years of
work. Do you really want to take that kind of risk?
The general rule is that if you used Peachtree that day, back it up that day.
Backing up data doesn’t take long, and in case of a catastrophe, you’ll be glad
you did. Backup media is inexpensive, especially when compared with the
costs of reconstructing and reentering data.
In Table 18-1, we show you an ideal plan for backing up. That’s the one that we
really suggest that you use. However, we’re also realistic. We show you an
absolute minimum strategy for backing up in Table 18-2. If you don’t follow Plan
A (the ideal), follow Plan B (the minimum) at the very least. Believe us — you
won’t regret it. Backing up is the cheapest form of insurance that you can have.
When we refer to backup disks, they can be Flash drives, CDs, DVDs, Zip
disks, floppy disks, or tapes.
Table 18-1
Plan A: An Ideal Backup Strategy
Number of Disks
Backup Plan
10 disks
Back up onto a different disk each day (Monday
through Friday) for two weeks, and then begin again
with the same set of disks.
12 monthly disks
At the end of each month, back up to one of these
disks. Keep the monthly disk sets off site.
Label each disk with the day of the week. If a backup uses more than one
disk, be sure to number the disks so that you know which disk is Disk 1 of the
backup.

Table 18-2
Plan B: The Minimum Backup Strategy
Number of Disks
Backup Plan
5 daily disks
Use one disk for each day of the week and then start
reusing them again the following Monday.
2 monthly disks
At the end of each month, back up to one of these disks.
Again, alternate them. For example, use one disk in January,
and then use the second disk in February. Reuse the
January disk in March. Keep the monthly disk sets off site.
To back up your Peachtree data and customized forms, use the following 
procedure:
1. Choose File➪Back Up or press Ctrl+B to display the Back Up Company
dialog box.
No other users can work in Peachtree during the backup process.
Select the Reminder check box if you want Peachtree to prompt you to
back up in a specified number of days. When the specified number of
days elapses, Peachtree displays a reminder message when you close
the company or exit the program.
In a moment, Peachtree suggests a name for the backup file. First,
though, Peachtree wants to know whether it should include the com-
pany name as part of the backup filename. We recommend that you do
include it, especially if you have multiple companies. That way, you
won’t confuse the backups of one company with another. If you do want
to include the company name as part of the backup, select the Include
Company Name in the Backup File Name check box.
Peachtree can also back up your archived data if any is available. Find
out more about archiving data in Chapter 17.
2. Click the Back Up button (as shown here) to display the Save Backup
As dialog box.
3. In the File Name text box, type a filename for the backup set or leave
the one Peachtree suggests.
Peachtree backup files use the *.ptb (for Peachtree backup — clever,
huh?) file extension. Peachtree automatically adds the current date to the
backup filename. If you elect to not include the company name as part of
the backup filename, Peachtree includes the letters BU as part of the file-
name. (In case you’re wondering, BU stands for backup — also clever.)
4. From the Save In list box, choose a location for the backup set.
We recommend backing up to a Flash drive or CD drive, a Zip disk,
floppy disks, or a different computer.
353
Chapter 18: Keeping Your House Safe

For data protection, don’t back up the Peachtree data to the same hard
drive where the current data resides. If the hard drive crashes, you’ll
lose both your original company data and your backup, and that won’t
do you one bit of good.
5. Click the Save button.
Peachtree displays the estimated size in megabytes (MB) of your
backup. Or, if you’re backing up to a floppy disk, Peachtree displays the
estimated number of floppy disks needed for the backup.
6. Click OK.
Depending on the medium you’re using for backup, Peachtree might
prompt you to insert the first disk.
7. Click OK.
The system displays the backup progress.
Depending on the quantity of data, the speed of your computer, and the
backup device that you use (floppy drives back up more slowly than any
other kind of device), the backup process might take several minutes to com-
plete. Don’t interrupt the process. Interrupting the backup process could cor-
rupt the data — and then you’d have a useless backup.
If you’re backing up to a Flash drive, CD, or Zip disk, the disk might become
too full at some point to hold another backup, so you’ll want to erase the
oldest backup file. Refer to your Windows documentation for directions on
deleting files.
If you’re backing up to floppy disks, you probably need to erase those disks
before you use them again. Refer to your Windows documentation for proce-
dures on erasing floppy disks.
If you have a server making automated backups for you, be sure that you
don’t make incremental backups of Peachtree data. You cannot back up indi-
vidual files because each file relates to another. You must back up the entire
Peachtree company data. In fact, we suggest that you let the server back up
everything and that you back up Peachtree independently by using the steps
that we provide. This approach is safer, and we’re all about safety, especially
when it’s Peachtree data we’re discussing.
Restoring Information
We sincerely hope that you never ever have to restore your data. If you do, it
probably means that something really bad happened, and we just don’t want
those kinds of incidents to materialize.

But if something does happen, you’ll be so glad that you read this chapter
and found out how to back up and restore your data.
If you back up company data by using an alternate utility (for example, a tape
program), you must use that program to restore your company data.
No other users can use Peachtree during the restore process. Use the follow-
ing steps to restore your data:
1. Open the company that you want to restore.
Any data that you entered after making the backup isn’t part of the
backup — and, thus, is lost.
2. Choose File➪Restore to launch the Restore Wizard.
Peachtree displays the Select Backup File window, as shown in Figure 18-1.
If the file that you want to restore doesn’t appear, click the Browse
button (as shown here) and then locate and click the name of the
backup file that you want to restore. Peachtree backup files use the
*.ptb file extension.
Many compression programs, such as WinZip, can open and extract PTB
files.
3. Click Next.
The Select Company screen appears. You can restore the backup file on
top of the currently open company data, or you can restore it to a new
separate company folder.
4. Select the option that you want and then click Next.
What data gets restored? When you restore data, you’re restoring all the
information that was previously backed up: all the Receivable, Payroll,
Figure 18-1:
Select the
file you
want to
restore.
355
Chapter 18: Keeping Your House Safe

Payable, Inventory, and Job Cost information together. Everything. The
process replaces all the current data files with those that have been pre-
viously backed up. You cannot restore individual files because each file
relates to another. However, you can restore your customized forms,
such as invoices or checks, separately from your data.
5. Click the options that you want restored and then click Next.
A confirmation screen appears.
6. Click Finish.
Peachtree displays the progress of the restoring data files. Peachtree
might prompt you to insert disks as needed.
Depending on the quantity of data, the speed of your computer, and the
backup device that you use, the restoration process could take several min-
utes to complete. Don’t interrupt the process. Interrupting the restoration
process could corrupt the data.
Securing Your Data from Prying Eyes
Because accounting data is highly sensitive and confidential, you might want
to prevent unauthorized persons from accessing your data. Peachtree
includes a security system that allows you to set accessibility parameters for
each user that you identify. Peachtree security makes use of user IDs and
passwords and uses what Peachtree calls a Named User philosophy. Named
users are those who have assigned privileges to access the Peachtree data.
Setting up users
Peachtree can allow tailored access for different individuals. With the secu-
rity feature activated, Peachtree requires each user to enter his or her user
name and password before opening and working with company data. With
the correct user name and password, users can access the areas of the pro-
gram to which they have rights.
All Peachtree versions support setting up multiple users. However, unless
you purchase a multi-user Peachtree version, only one user at a time can
access Peachtree. Multiple user versions are available in Peachtree Complete
and higher.
The multi-user versions of Peachtree Complete and all the Peachtree
Premium flavors allow five licensed users to access the data simultaneously.
Peachtree Quantum allows for ten licensed users.
356
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

When you set up users, you must set up at least one user with full administra-
tive rights. Typically, this user is a system administrator who has the access
rights to all Peachtree features, including setting up and maintaining com-
pany users and their passwords.
While setting up or maintaining user accounts, no other users can use
Peachtree. To set up users, follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪User Security.
The User Security dialog box appears.
2. Click the New User button (as shown here).
The Create Administrator dialog box opens. The first user must be an
administrator with full administrative rights.
3. Enter a user name or accept the default user name Admin.
User names are not case sensitive and each must be unique: For exam-
ple, Joe, joe, and JOE are all the same user name.
4. In the Choose Your Password, enter your password.
The password can be up to 16 alphanumeric characters. Don’t use a
slash (/) as part of the password. Passwords are case sensitive, and two
users cannot have the same password.
Unlike passwords in many other programs, when you create the user,
the Peachtree passwords do display on the screen. Make sure that no
unwanted eyes are peeking. The passwords don’t display when the user
logs on to Peachtree.
5. Click the Save button (as shown here).
The administrative user appears in the User Security dialog box.
6. To enter additional users, click the New User button.
The User Rights dialog box, as shown in Figure 18-2, appears.
Figure 18-2:

357
Chapter 18: Keeping Your House Safe

7. Enter the next user name and its corresponding password.
8. Choose an access type.
• Full access allows access to all features except user security.
If you select Full or Administrator access, the Save button appears.
• Selected access allows you to precisely define areas the user can
access.
If you enable Selected access, the Next button appears.
9. Click Save or Next (as shown here).
• If you choose Save: The User Security dialog box reappears.
• If you choose Next: The Selected Access dialog box appears.
Continue with the next section on customizing user rights.
Customizing user rights
When setting up users, you can select an access level to each program area
for an individual user. For example, if you have a clerk who mainly makes
Accounts Receivable entries, you might want to restrict that clerk from
accessing Accounts Payable, Payroll, or General Ledger information. Perhaps
you have a person who receives inventory, but you want to restrict him or
her from editing the information after it’s entered or from printing Inventory
Valuation reports.
By customizing the user rights, you give each user specific access. The rights
vary depending on the feature. Through the Selected Access dialog box, you
can choose from the following options when deciding how much access you
want to allow a user:
 No Access at All to the Feature
 Only the Ability to View the Data
 To View and Add to the Data
 To View, Add to, or Edit the Data
 Full Rights (which allows the user to view, add, edit, or erase data)
The security that we describe here is for the Peachtree Complete and above
editions. If you’re using Peachtree First or Pro Accounting, your choices are
limited to setting security selections for an entire module (Accounts
Receivable, Accounts Payable, Payroll, and so on).
358
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

We recommend that you have only one administrative user with access to the
Maintain Users window. This setup prevents multiple users from accessing
other users’ passwords, changing other users’ security settings, or inadver-
tently erasing users.
You can quickly restrict access to a primary program area, such as Payroll.
Along the left side of the window, select the tab for the program area you
want to restrict. Then, at the top of the right side on the window, select a con-
trol level. For example, in Figure 18-3, we restrict all rights to Payroll by
choosing Payroll on the left side and also choosing No Access from the
Employees & Payroll Access drop-down list.
Follow these instructions to be more specific regarding user accessibility:
1. Click the module for which you want to set restrictions.
Peachtree displays a list of the task areas.
2. Scroll through the task area until you locate the feature you want
restricted.
3. Click the Access level you want to modify.
The access choices vary depending on the feature. For example, if you
click the Customer & Sales area and open the Access Level drop-down
list for Receive Money, you find that you can select Full, No Access,
Read, Add, or Edit. But if you open the Access Level drop-down list for
Master Lists under the Reports program area, you can select only Full or
No Access. In Figure 18-4, the user named Alex can view or add
Inventory items and adjustment but cannot edit or erase them.
Figure 18-3:

Chapter 18: Keeping Your House Safe

4. Click Save.
The User Security dialog box reappears with a list of user names and
their access areas.
Select a user and click Edit User’s Rights (as shown here) to modify the
user password or access.
To create another user with the same access rights as an existing 
user, click the current user name and then click the Copy User button
(as shown here). Peachtree prompts you for another user name and 
password.
You can set up as many user names as you like, but you can license only
five users (ten if you’re using Peachtree Quantum) at one time. If you
have more users than licenses, the administrator must uncheck the
license for one user to allow another user access. You can check and
uncheck the license allowances as needed, but Peachtree will never
allow you to check more than the maximum your license allows. See
Figure 18-5.
5. Click the Close button to close the User Security dialog box.
Any changes that you make take effect the next time you open the company.

Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

Removing users
By deleting users, when someone leaves or changes positions, you can stop
him or her from accessing Peachtree data. If you have multiple companies,
deleting a user from the current company doesn’t affect his or her rights in
other Peachtree companies. If you want the user completely deleted from the
system, you must remove that user from each company independently.
To remove a user, choose Maintain➪User Security to display the User
Security window. Select the user record that you want to remove, and then
click the Delete User button. A warning message appears. Click OK to delete
the user.
If multiple users still exist and you attempt to delete the only administrative
user with access to Maintain Users, Peachtree displays an error message. You
cannot remove the administrative user until you remove all other user
records.
Any changes that you make take effect the next time you open the company.
Logging on as a user
After user security is enabled, when you or anyone on your Peachtree net-
work (if you’re on a network, that is) tries to open your Peachtree company
files, Peachtree prompts you for a user name and password.
Figure 18-5:

361
Chapter 18: Keeping Your House Safe

Enter your user ID in the User Name text box, enter your password in the
Password text box, and then press Enter.
Don’t lose the password! If you do lose your user name or password and no
one else can open the Peachtree company, you have no back-door way to
access the passwords. You’ll need to back up your data and send it into a
Peachtree-certified consultant or to Peachtree technical support for them to
locate the information.
The user ID system works like this: Say you give user Bob no access to
Payroll, but user Alex does have Payroll access. No matter whose computer
Bob uses — his own computer or Alex’s computer — he doesn’t have access
to Payroll when he logs on as Bob.
To prevent unauthorized access to your data, exit the Peachtree program
when you leave your computer unattended.
Using the Audit Trail Report 
to Track Actions
Peachtree includes an audit trail security feature that tracks when a person
enters new transactions, edits existing records or transactions, or removes
data. The audit trail provides accountability of users, discourages users
against fraudulent activity or mistakes, and tracks transaction history. The
Audit Trail report traces all activity and adjustments; from this report, you
might find that transactions were completed without your knowledge.
Only the Peachtree Complete and above editions contain the audit trail feature.
The audit trail is automatic in Peachtree and cannot be disabled, except in
older versions. In older versions of Peachtree, you activate or deactivate the
audit trail through Maintain➪Company Information.
The Audit Trail report displays the date and time of each Peachtree action. If
you have user security enabled, you can also see who did it.
To view the Audit Trail report, choose Reports & Forms➪Company to display
the Select a Report or Form dialog box, and then double-click the Audit Trail
report to display the report on-screen.
By default, this report displays only the transactions that took place on the
current date, but you can click the Options button to select a different time
frame. You can even specify the user ID that you want to review.
Like other Peachtree reports, you can customize the Audit Trail report. See
Chapter 14 for instructions on customizing reports.

 Organizing employee loans, garnishments, and other odds and ends
T
his book wouldn’t be complete if we didn’t provide you with solutions for
some common situations. Given the limited space we have in the book to
present Peachtree to you, we worked really hard to make room for these real-
life situations.
Handling Customer Prepayments
Under certain conditions, your customers might pay you before you actually
deliver the goods or services you promise. For example, in the building busi-
ness, customers often provide down-payments that builders use to purchase
construction materials. Some service providers, such as lawyers and CPAs,
request retainers before performing work. If your customers pay you in
advance, you’re accepting money that you must account for as a liability until
you deliver the promised goods or services.
Deposits and prepayments — interchangeable terms — are, by definition, pay-
ments received before you deliver goods or services. Your method of
accounting — cash or accrual basis — has no bearing on how you handle
these prepayments. Prepayments from customers are actually your liabilities.
Because you receive the money before you supply the goods or services, you
now have an obligation (a liability) to the customer to complete the transac-
tion. The money that you accept in advance of providing goods and services
is unearned revenue.
100 235
500

83

First, you need a G/L account in which to record customer prepayments
when you receive them. To handle customer deposits, from the Maintain
Chart of Accounts window, set up Customer Deposits as an Other Current
Liability type account. (See Chapter 3 to review adding accounts.)
Second, set up a non-stock inventory item for deposits. Use the Customer
Deposits G/L account you created for all three G/L accounts (Sales,
Salary/Wages, and Cost of Sales), and be sure to select an exempt Item Tax
Type. See Chapter 11 to review setting up inventory items. When you receive
a prepayment from your customer, create a receipt to track the deposit by
following these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Receipts to display the Receipts window.
2. Enter the deposit ticket ID, customer ID, receipt number, date, pay-
ment method, and Cash account just like you normally enter receipts.
Refer to Chapter 8 for details on entering receipts.
3. On the Apply to Revenues tab, enter a quantity of 1.
4. In the Item drop-down list, select Deposits.
5. Enter the amount of the deposit.
6. Click Save (as shown here) to save the transaction.
This transaction debits Cash and credits Customer Deposits. The balance
sheet shows the Customer Deposits account as well as the Cash account
increased by the amount of the prepayment.
After you perform the work, you want to send your customer an invoice. Add
a final line item on the invoice showing a quantity of –1 by using the Deposits
item for the amount of the prepayment (see Figure 19-1). On the line showing
the deposit, be sure to enter a negative number (–1) for the quantity but use
a positive number for the unit price amount. Peachtree automatically con-
verts the total amount to a negative number.
If the amount of the invoice you create equals the amount of the prepayment,
the customer owes you nothing. If the invoice amount exceeds the prepay-
ment amount, the customer owes you the difference between the invoice
amount and the prepayment amount.

Creating a Prior-Year Company
When you close and purge a fiscal year, the transactions and reports are no
longer accessible. Before you close your year, you should archive your com-
pany data if you’re using Peachtree Premium or higher. If you’re using any
other edition of Peachtree, you can create a prior-year company so that you
can print reports, look for transactions, and so on. The big picture? You
create a backup of your existing company; create a new, empty company; and
then restore the backup into the new, empty company.
To find out how to close and purge a fiscal year, turn to Chapter 17.
Follow these steps before you close the fiscal year.
1. Open your company in Peachtree.
2. Choose File➪Back Up, select backup options, and then click Back Up.
See Chapter 18 for details on backup options.
The Save Backup For dialog box appears.
3. In the File Name text box, leave your company name but replace
today’s date with the last open fiscal year (so that you can easily iden-
tify the data in the backup).
Figure 19-1:

4. Use the Save In drop-down list to select the folder on your C: drive
where you store your Peachtree company data.
If you work in a network, save the backup to the My Documents folder
on your C: drive.
5. Click Save to back up.
When the backup is complete, you need to restore it and simultaneously
create a new company.
The following technique works with Peachtree 2004 or later. If you have an
older version of Peachtree, you need to create a new, empty company before
you restore; then restore the backup into that company.
Follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Restore to start the Restore Wizard.
2. On the Select Backup File screen, click Browse and navigate to the
location where you stored the backup.
3. Select the backup file and click Open.
4. Click Next to display the Select Company screen.
5. Click the A New Company option button and then click Next.
6. On the Restore Options screen, select all appropriate check boxes and
then click Next.
Peachtree automatically selects the Company Data check box; if you
have Customized Forms or Web Transactions, select those check boxes
as well.
7. On the Confirmation screen that appears, click Finish.
Peachtree creates a new company for you and restores the backup into it.
8. When Peachtree finishes the process, choose Maintain➪Company
Information and change the name of the new company.
Use an obvious name, such as FYXXXX Company Data, where XXXX is
the last open fiscal year in the company. This step makes the second
copy of your company appear as a separate name in the Open Company
window.
You can now open your regular current company by choosing File➪Open
Company. When you need to refer to the prior-year company, you can find it
in the Open dialog box.

Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

Handling Retainage
Suppose that you receive partial payment at the beginning of a job and the
balance when the job is completed. If you work this way, you have retainage,
and you need to know how to correctly bill customers and track both billed
and unbilled amounts owed to you.
You need only one extra account on your balance sheet — an Other Current
Assets account, called Retainage Receivable. See Chapter 3 to review adding
accounts.
Suppose that the terms of your contract specify that you will earn $10,000
and get paid 90 percent at the beginning of the job, with 10 percent ($1,000)
held as retainage. You need to prepare an invoice for $9,000 and account for
the $1,000 retained by the customer:
1. Choose Tasks➪Sales/Invoicing to display the Sales/Invoicing window
and select the customer for whom you need to prepare the invoice.
2. In the line item section of the invoice, create two lines.
3. Fill in the total sale amount ($10,000 in our example) and post the line
against an income account.
4. On the second line, post the retainage amount as a negative number
to the Retainage Receivable account and then save the invoice.
This transaction credits an Income account for $10,000, recognizing the rev-
enue you will generate from the contract. It also debits Accounts Receivable
for $9,000 (the amount the customer owes immediately) as well as Retainage
Receivable for $1,000 (the amount the customer will pay when the job is 
completed).
When the customer pays you for the original invoice — $9,000, in this 
example — record the receipt in the same way that you’d record any receipt
in the Receipts window. When you finish the job, you need to bill the cus-
tomer for the final amount — the retainage amount of $1,000 in this example.
Record an invoice, posting the line item for the retainage amount as a positive
number against the Retainage Receivable account. As a result of this invoice,
Peachtree debits the Accounts Receivable account and credits the Retainage
Receivable account, reducing the amount of retainage the customer owes but
increasing the customer’s regular Accounts Receivable balance.
To use the following method to track retainage balances, we suggest that you
use an invoice number for the retainage bill that is the same as the original
invoice number, followed by an R.
367
Chapter 19: Real-Life Ways to Use Peachtree

When the customer pays this bill, record the receipt the same way you would
record any receipt in the Receipts window.
To help you identify clients who have unbilled retainage amounts, we suggest
that you take advantage of the Peachtree Account Reconciliation feature.
(See Chapter 16 for details on account reconciliation.) You can use the
Account Reconciliation feature to reconcile any account, not just bank
accounts:
1. Choose Tasks➪Account Reconciliation to display the Account
Reconciliation window.
2. Select the Retainage Receivable account as the account to reconcile.
Note that some amounts appear in both the Deposit/Bank Credit and
Check/Bank Debit columns of the window and the Payee for those
amounts is identical. The entry in the Check/Bank Debit column occurs
when you prepare the original invoice that held back the retainage
amount. The entry in the Deposit/Bank Credit column occurs when you
bill the retainage.
3. When you see a pair of like entries in both the Deposit/Bank Credit
column and the Check/Bank Debit column, select their respective
check boxes in the Status column (shown in Figure 19-2) because they
represent billed retainage amounts.
You don’t need to enter the Statement Ending Balance because you don’t
have a statement. The Unreconciled Difference should always be zero
because you’re checking off matching entries in the Account
Reconciliation window.
Figure 19-2:
Match
entries by

retainage.
368
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

4. When you finish marking off matched pairs, click OK (as shown here).
Use the Account Reconciliation Other Outstanding Items report to identify
the clients and retainage amounts you didn’t mark off in Account
Reconciliation. These are the amounts that you have not yet billed. Choose
Reports & Forms➪Account Reconciliation and highlight the Other
Outstanding Items report. On the Filter tab, choose the Retainage Receivable
account. When you print the report, you’ll see only retainage amounts that
you haven’t yet billed.
Paying for Purchase Orders 
by Credit Card
Here’s the situation: You ordered goods via a purchase order and, at the time
that you placed the order, you hadn’t made a decision about how you wanted
to pay for the goods. The goods arrive, and you now decide that you want to
pay for them with a credit card. You need to make sure that you account for
everything properly in Peachtree.
We assume that you have a Credit Card Payable account — an Other Current
Liabilities account — on your Chart of Accounts so that you can record credit
card purchases in Peachtree. If you don’t have a Credit Card Payable account —
yours might be called Visa Payable or American Express Payable — set one
up from the Maintain Chart of Accounts window.
The process starts when you decide to buy a product and you issue a pur-
chase order. You create the purchase order the same way that you create any
purchase order. Some time passes, and the goods you ordered arrive. You
need to receive the goods into inventory and establish that you owe the
vendor money. Enter a purchase against the purchase order in the same way
that you enter a purchase against any purchase order.
So far, you haven’t done anything unusual. When you pay for the goods using
a credit card, though, you need to make some changes from your usual pro-
cedures. Follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Payments to display the Payments window.
2. Select the vendor.
3. Find the appropriate purchase to pay and click in the Pay column.
369
Chapter 19: Real-Life Ways to Use Peachtree

4. Click the lookup list button (as shown here) to change the Cash
Account from your checking account to the Credit Card Payable
account (see Figure 19-3).
5. Enter a dummy check number and then click Save to save the 
transaction.
Don’t forget to change your Cash account back to your regular checking
account. Peachtree remembers the last account you selected until you
change it.
When the credit card bill arrives, you need to make sure that you post the
items on it correctly in the Purchases/Receive Inventory window. Typically,
you post each line item to its appropriate expense account. But for goods
you ordered on a purchase order and paid for using a credit card, you need
to assign the purchase order charge on the credit card bill to the Credit Card
Payable account (see Figure 19-4).
When you’re ready to pay the credit card bill, use the Payments window or
the Select for Payment window. Make sure that you use your regular Cash
account when you print the check to pay this bill.

For those of you who care, we’ll explain the debits and credits posted to the
General Ledger with these transactions. If you don’t care, you can quit read-
ing here:
 Entering the purchase order had no effect on the General Ledger; no pur-
chase order affects the General Ledger. When we entered the purchase
to receive the goods into inventory and post a payable for the vendor,
we debited Inventory or Expense accounts and credited Accounts
Payable.
 When we paid the vendor’s bill, we debited Accounts Payable (reducing
our debt to the vendor and washing out the Accounts Payable account)
and credited the Credit Card Payable account (increasing the credit card
liability).
 When we recorded the line on the bill from the credit card company for
the goods purchased using the purchase order, we debited the Credit
Card Payable account (washing out the Credit Card Payable account)
and credited Accounts Payable (increasing our debt to the credit card
vendor).
 Finally, when we paid the credit card bill, we debited Accounts Payable
(reducing Accounts Payable and washing out the balance owed to the
credit card vendor for the credit card bill), and we credited Cash (reduc-
ing the balance in our checking account).

Real-Life Payroll Situations
Of the dozens of real-life payroll situations, we picked the ones we figure
occur most frequently and therefore would be of the most use to you. In the
sections that follow, we show you how to set up some common payroll
deductions and taxes.
Payroll deductions, in general
For all payroll deductions, you need at least two elements: the payroll field
for the deduction and a General Ledger account that you tie to the field.
Because you assign a General Ledger account to a payroll deduction, we usu-
ally suggest that you first set up the General Ledger account and then set up
the deduction.
In many cases, you also need a third element: a user-maintained payroll tax
table to calculate the amount of the deduction. And you assign a payroll tax
table to a deduction. So, when a deduction requires a payroll tax table, we
suggest that you first set up the General Ledger account, then set up the
user-maintained payroll tax table, and finally set up the deduction.
“But what does a payroll tax table have to do with a deduction?” you ask. Well,
Peachtree uses payroll tax tables to calculate more than just federal, state, 
or local taxes due. The name payroll tax table is somewhat of a misnomer
because these tax tables store calculations that you need for payroll, even 
372
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

if the calculation is not for a tax. You can set up payroll tax tables to calculate
401(k) deductions, health insurance deductions, union dues deductions, vaca-
tion, and sick leave. You can see where we’re going with this concept.
Finally, you also need to define the elements of Adjusted Gross Income so
that Peachtree can calculate payroll deductions or additions. In the upcom-
ing section, “Health insurance,” you can see examples of deductions that
affect the calculation of adjusted gross wages. Read the sidebar, “Calculating
Adjusted Gross,” for more information about adjusted gross wages.
Peachtree simplifies the process of tracking employee vacation and sick leave
if you use the Payroll Setup Wizard — and we highly recommend this
approach. It’s very straightforward and self explanatory. Good wizard.
Similarly, Peachtree simplifies setting up a 401(k) plan using the Payroll Setup
Wizard, and we like the Payroll Setup Wizard for this deduction, too. In the
upcoming section, “Adding a 401(k) plan to an existing company,” we show
you a modification you can make after you let the wizard set up your 401(k)
deduction that will simplify the other steps needed to finish setting up the
401(k) plan in Peachtree.
Employee loans
Suppose that you loan money to an employee. You can set up a payroll
deduction so that the employee can repay the loan from his or her paycheck.
And, depending on the repayment amounts, you can either manually enter
the repayment amount on each paycheck, or Peachtree can automatically
deduct a fixed amount from each paycheck until the loan is repaid.
The General Ledger
You need two elements for a payroll deduction for an employee loan: the
General Ledger account and the deduction. To track a loan, set up an Other
Current Assets account on your Chart of Accounts and then call the account
something like Employee Loans or Employee Advances.
If you intend to loan money to more than one employee, we suggest that you
use Peachtree’s masking feature (if you’re using Peachtree Premium or
higher, use the segmenting feature) and set up individual accounts for each
loan that would roll up into the Employee Advances account. For example, if
you created 14100 for your Employee Advances account, the account number
for a loan to Dorothy Beckstrom might be 14100-01, and the account number
for a loan to Elliot Adams might be 14100-02. See Chapters 3 and 15 for infor-
mation on masking.

Chapter 19: Real-Life Ways to Use Peachtree

Writing a loan check
When you write the check for the employee’s loan, use the Payments window.
You don’t need to set up the employee as a vendor; simply type the employee’s
name in the Pay to The Order Of box. On the Apply to Expenses tab of the
Payments window, fill in the employee’s loan account as the G/L account.
The payroll field
You need to use the manual repayment method if the repayment amounts
differ from paycheck to paycheck.
Set up a payroll deduction for the loan by following these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Default Information➪Employees.
2. Click the EmployEE Fields tab and scroll to the bottom.
3. In the Field Name column, add a field called Loan (see Figure 19-5).
The name must not contain spaces. Use the underscore (_) character if
you need space between words. The name you use will appear on the
paycheck stub.
4. In the G/L Account list, select the main account you set up for
employee loans.
In our example, we selected 14100-00.
5. Place a check mark in the Run column.
Peachtree will now maintain a running total for the deduction even after
you close the payroll year.
6. Click OK.
Figure 19-5:
Setting up a
payroll field.
374
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

Next, use these steps to assign the loan payroll field to the employee to
whom you are making the loan:
1. Choose Maintain➪Employees/Sales Reps.
2. Select the employee to whom you are making the loan.
3. Click the Employee Fields tab and remove the check mark from the
Use Defaults column (see Figure 19-6).
4. Change the G/L account to the account for the employee.
5. Click Save (as shown here).
Repaying the loan
When you create a paycheck for the employee, fill in the repayment amount
on the paycheck as a negative number. To track the amount the employee
has repaid, customize the Yearly Earnings report. On the Fields tab, show
only the payroll field for the loan and the Amount field. On the Filter tab,
select the Show Totals Only check box.
If you can divide the loan amount into equal installment payments, you can
let Peachtree automatically record the loan payment on the employee’s pay-
check. Set up the General Ledger account and the deduction as we describe.
However, when you edit the employee’s record in the Maintain Employees/
Sales Reps window, also fill in the loan repayment amount as a negative
number in the Amount column on the Employee Fields tab.

Chapter 19: Real-Life Ways to Use Peachtree

Garnishments
Occasionally, you need to hold back money from an employee’s check as a
legal garnishment. Garnishments are another form of payroll deduction simi-
lar to employee advances; however, garnishments typically use all three ele-
ments of the payroll deduction. For the General Ledger account, use an Other
Current Liabilities account in the case of a garnishment instead of the Other
Current Assets account you set up for an employee loan. You also need to set
up the payroll deduction that you’ll probably name Garnishment, and you’ll
probably use a payroll tax table to calculate the garnishment amount. In the
upcoming sections, “Health insurance” and “Union dues,” you see some
examples of setting up payroll tax tables.
Different states have different requirements for garnishments; the garnish-
ment might be a percentage of adjusted gross pay or a percentage of net pay.
Check with your accountant to determine the correct way to calculate the
garnishment.
Health insurance
For health insurance deductions, you need two elements: the General Ledger
account and the payroll deduction. However, health insurance deductions
come in two basic types: after-tax deductions (non-qualified plans) and
before-tax deductions (qualified plans, such as cafeteria plans). And for cafe-
teria plans, you need to take an extra step and include the field when
Peachtree calculates the adjusted gross amount it uses for taxes.
As the employer, you must pay the amount you deduct for health insurance
to the insurance company that supplies the plan. Therefore, the amount is a
liability to you, and you need to set up an Other Current Liabilities account in
your Chart of Accounts.
You set up the health insurance deduction in the same way that you set up
the deduction for an employee loan. In the Employee Defaults dialog box, on
the EmployEE Fields tab, type a name (no spaces allowed) for the health
insurance deduction. Remember that the name you type will appear on the
paycheck stub. Supply the liability account for health insurance.
You handle this next part in the same way you handle employee loans, as we
describe in the preceding section. If you deduct the same amount for most
employees, enter the amount in the Amount column on the EmployEE Fields
tab of the Employee Defaults dialog box as a negative number. To supply
amounts for employees who don’t pay the standard amount or who don’t pay
anything, open the Maintain Employees/Sales Reps window and select the
employee. Click the EmployEE Fields tab and remove the check mark from the
376
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

STD column for the health insurance deduction. Then supply the appropriate
amount as a negative number in the Amount column (refer to Figure 19-6).
A new payroll field can affect the calculation of existing payroll fields.
Whenever you add a tax-sheltered deduction or an addition that is taxable,
you need to click the Adjust button for other payroll fields that are affected by
the new field — not the field you are setting up. For example, tax-sheltered
deductions — such as a health insurance deduction for a cafeteria plan — are
typically deducted from gross pay before calculating taxes. So you need to
click the Adjust button next to Federal Income Tax, Social Security, Medicare,
and any state and local taxes. In the Calculate Adjusted Gross dialog box,
shown in Figure 19-7, you select the Use check box next to the health insur-
ance deduction. Then Peachtree will subtract the health insurance deduction
from gross pay before calculating taxes. If you’re not sure whether a deduc-
tion is taxable, check with the plan administrator.
Union dues
Deducting union dues from an employee’s paycheck can be tricky simply
because so many different ways exist to calculate union dues. In this section,
we examine how to set up payroll to calculate and deduct union dues, and
examine four different ways of calculating the amount:
 Deducting a flat amount per month
 Deducting a number of hours of pay per month
 Using an hourly rate based on hours worked
 Using a percentage of gross pay
Figure 19-7:

377
Chapter 19: Real-Life Ways to Use Peachtree

If you must deduct a flat amount per month, regardless of the number of
hours the employee works, you need only the first two elements of a payroll
deduction; you don’t need to set up a payroll tax table. Skip the following sec-
tion and complete the following two sections, in which you set up the liability
account and the payroll deduction. Then, for each employee, calculate the
total amount due for the year and divide that number by the number of pay
periods in the year. When you set up the deduction for each employee in the
Maintain Employees/Sales Reps window, supply that number.
To calculate union dues in any of the other three ways listed above, you need
all three elements of the payroll deduction: the General Ledger account, the
payroll field, and the payroll tax table to calculate the union dues amount.
As an employer, you handle union dues deductions in the same way you
handle federal income tax deductions — you collect the money due from the
employee and turn it over to the proper authority. So, to track the union dues
collected that must be paid to the union, you need an Other Current
Liabilities account on your Chart of Accounts. See Chapter 3 for help creating
the account.
Setting up a payroll tax table
For most union dues calculations, we think you’ll find it easiest to use payroll
tax tables to calculate the amount to deduct from an employee’s paycheck.
Follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Payroll Tax Tables➪User-Maintained.
Peachtree displays the User-Maintained Payroll Tax Tables window (see
Figure 19-8).
378
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 
Calculating Adjusted Gross
You’ll find ADJUSTED_GROSS in the formulas
of many payroll tax tables. When you use one of
these payroll tax tables, you need to identify 
the fields that Peachtree should include when
calculating ADJUSTED_GROSS
to make
Peachtree actually calculate something. You
identify these fields by clicking the Adjust button
next to the new field you’re adding and then
selecting the Use check box next to the fields
that Peachtree should add or subtract when
calculating ADJUSTED_GROSS for the new
field. As a rule, whenever you create a payroll
field for which you don’t supply an amount in the
Amount column, you should always click the
Adjust button for the new field and select the
Use check box for the Gross field. The Gross
field is the first field in the left column — you
can’t see it in Figure 19-7. A formula that
includes ADJUSTED_GROSS in its calculation
makes Peachtree calculate something; if the
formula doesn’t include ADJUSTED_GROSS,
you won’t hurt anything.

2. Type an ID for the tax table.
Use something like Union that helps you easily identify the purpose of
the tax table.
3. In the Tax Name text box, type a name and add to the end of the name
a space and the last two digits of the year for which the tax table will
be applicable.
For the Tax name, we typically use the same name as we type in the Tax
ID text box and append the year information to it.
4. Even though the Government section has nothing to do with union
dues (no jokes, please), select the State or the Local option button
there.
5. Enter the appropriate formula for the calculation you want Peachtree
to make (see the next section).
6. Click the Save button to save the tax table.
Figuring out what goes in the Formula field
The information in the Formula field will change, depending on how you need
to calculate union dues. Many of the formulas that we show you use EMP_
SPECIAL1_NUMBER or EMP_SPECIAL2_NUMBER. Peachtree provides these
two fields as variables that you can set for individual employees as needed.
To set the values for these variables, open the Maintain Employees/Sales
Reps window, select the employee, and click the Withholding Info tab. As
Figure 19-8:
Store
calculations
you use in
payroll that
are specific
to your
company.
379
Chapter 19: Real-Life Ways to Use Peachtree

needed, supply values in the Additional Withholding column for Special 1 
and Special 2. If you’re supplying a percentage, make sure you type the per-
centage as a percentage. For example, if the percentage is 2.65%, type 2.65;
don’t use .0265, which is the rate, not the percentage.
If the formula you use requires different rates for each employee, the formula
will reference EMP_SPECIAL1_NUMBER or EMP_SPECIAL2_NUMBER, and you’ll
need to enter each employee’s rate in the employee’s record. However, if the
formula calls for the same rate for each employee, you should substitute that
rate in the formula as a value instead of using EMP_SPECIAL1_NUMBER or
EMP_SPECIAL2_NUMBER.
In the formulas that follow, we use EMP_SPECIAL1_NUMBER. If you’re already
using EMP_SPECIAL1_NUMBER for another purpose, substitute EMP_
SPECIAL2_NUMBER.
To calculate union dues as a percentage of adjusted gross pay, use the follow-
ing formula for both salaried and hourly employees:
ANSWER = -ADJUSTED_GROSS*EMP_SPECIAL1_NUMBER/100
If you need to calculate union dues based on a number of hours worked, use
the following formula for hourly employees, where REGULAR, OVERTIME, and
SPECIAL are the pay levels you set up in your company:
ANSWER = –(REGULAR+OVERTIME+SPECIAL)*EMP_SPECIAL1_NUMBER
If you pay your employees a salary instead of an hourly wage and need to 
calculate union dues based on a number of hours worked, use the following
formula, where pay periods are biweekly and consist of 80 hours. If you pay
some employees weekly, some biweekly, and some semimonthly, you’ll need
separate tax tables, one for each pay frequency. In the weekly tax table,
change 80 to 40; in the semimonthly table, change 80 to 88.
ANSWER = -80*EMP_SPECIAL1_NUMBER/100
If all employees pay the same percentage, you can substitute that percentage
for EMP_SPECIAL1_NUMBER/100 in the formula.
Suppose that you must deduct an amount equal to two hours of pay per
month for an hourly employee. In the following formula, you enter the annual-
ized amount you need to deduct in the Additional Withholding column of the
Special 1 field on the Withholding Info tab in the Maintain Employees/Sales
Reps window. Peachtree then prorates the annualized amount so that the cor-
rect amount is deducted from an employee’s paycheck based on the fre-
quency you pay. For example, if an employee earns $10 per hour, union dues
would be $20 for the month or $240 for the year — and that’s the number you
enter in the Additional Withholding column of the Special 1 field. If you pay
your employees weekly, you’d want to deduct $4.62 per paycheck. Using the
380
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

PRORATE function tells Peachtree to divide the annualized amount ($240 in
our example) by the number of pay periods in the year (52 in our example) to
determine the amount to deduct per pay period.
ANSWER = -PRORATE(EMP_SPECIAL1_NUMBER)
If you must deduct a flat amount based on the number of hours worked —
say, 5 cents per hour — use the following formula:
ANSWER = -(REGULAR+OVERTIME+SPECIAL) * .05
REGULAR, OVERTIME, and SPECIAL are the pay levels you set up in your
company.
Creating the payroll deduction for union dues
You create the payroll deduction for union dues on the EmployEE Fields tab
of the Employee Defaults dialog box, using the same steps that you used to
create the deduction for health insurance. Remember that the name you type
appears on paycheck stubs and cannot contain spaces. Supply the liability
account for union dues; and, if you created a payroll tax table to calculate
union dues, place a check mark in the Calc column. The Tax Name column
will then become available, and you can select the payroll tax table that you
created. Remember that we called it Union. Last, be sure to click the Adjust
button and select the elements of pay that Peachtree should include in
ADJUSTED_GROSS when calculating union dues. At a minimum, select the
Use box next to Gross.
If you didn’t create a payroll tax table to calculate the union dues deduction,
supply the liability account for union dues when you create the field, but
don’t place a check mark in the Calc column. If most employees pay the same
amount for union dues, type that amount as a negative number in the Amount
column, remembering to supply the amount per pay period. Peachtree will
assign the amount you type in the Maintain Employee Defaults dialog box to
all employees. For an employee who doesn’t pay the standard amount, select
the employee in the Maintain Employees/Sales Rep window and click the
Employee Fields tab. Then remove the check mark from the Use Defaults
column, and type the amount per pay period that you want to deduct as a
negative number in the Amount column.
Showing employer contributions 
on paycheck stubs
Suppose that you want to display the employer’s contribution on the
employee’s paycheck stub. No problem. In fact, although we use union dues
as the example, you can display any employer contribution to any program
on the employee’s paycheck stub.
381
Chapter 19: Real-Life Ways to Use Peachtree

By default, the paycheck stub shows only the information that appears on
the EmployEE tab of the Employee Defaults dialog box. But employer’s contri-
butions appear on the EmployER tab of the Employee Defaults dialog box. To
make an employer contribution appear on the paycheck stub, you create a
field on the EmployEE tab. To avoid affecting the employee’s paycheck, make
the field a memo field.
Remember that you use the memo field in addition to (not instead of) the
EmployER field.
Employer contributions to benefit plans are handled as liabilities on the balance
sheet. As such, to calculate correctly, the formula you use usually generates a
negative number. If you don’t mind showing the contribution as a negative value
on the employee’s paycheck stub, you can use the same formula for the memo
field as you use for the employer’s contribution. However, you might prefer to
show the contribution as a positive number on check stubs so that employees
don’t mistakenly think you deducted the money from their paychecks. In this
case, create another formula that looks just like the employer contribution for-
mula. However, make sure that you do the following:
 Remove the negative sign from the portion of the formula that calculates
the deduction.
 Set up the formula type as an Exception rather than a Deduction.
Click the Adjust button for the new memo field and make sure that you
include the same fields when calculating the memo field that you included
when calculating the actual employer contribution.
Adding a 401(k) plan to 
an existing company
Suppose that you’ve been using payroll for a while and your company
decides to implement a 401(k) plan. We’re not going to walk you through set-
ting up a 401(k) plan; you have the Payroll Wizard to help you do that.
The Payroll Wizard assumes that you want to assign contribution percent-
ages individually to each employee in the Maintain Employees/Sales Reps
window. If your employees’ contribution rates vary greatly, you don’t have
much choice. Choose Maintain➪Employees/Sales Reps and select an
employee who participates in the plan. On the Withholding tab, supply the
employee’s contribution percentage in the 401k% field.
However, if most of your employees contribute the same percentage, you can
save yourself some work (and time). Simply change the 401K EE tax table that
382
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

Peachtree creates to calculate the 401(k) contribution using the percentage
that most employees contribute. That way, you need to set up specific per-
centages only for those employees who contribute the different rate. Let
Peachtree use a default rate that matches the rate contributed by most
employees. Follow these steps to modify the 401K EE tax table:
1. Choose File➪Payroll Tax Tables➪User-Maintained.
2. Highlight the 401K EE tax table to see its formula (see Figure 19-9).
3. In the Formula field, add the following three lines, placing them at the
top of the tax table or immediately below the first line of the tax table
that specifies the limit (the line that begins with LIMIT=):
Be sure you don’t type anything while the formula is highlighted.
To add lines below the first line, place the insertion point at the end of
the first line and press Ctrl+J to start a new blank line. Make sure you
include a semicolon at the end of each line you add.
E=2%;
F=EMP_401K_NUMBER%;
G=If (F=(0),E,F);
In the first line, type the fixed percentage used by most employees. In
our example, we made the percentage 2%.
Figure 19-9:
The formula
Peachtree
creates for
a 401K field.
383
Chapter 19: Real-Life Ways to Use Peachtree

4. Edit the line that contains the information for the A variable and
replace EMP_401K_NUMBER% with G. After you edit the line, it should
look like this:
A=G*ADJUSTED_GROSS;
5. Click Save.
Next, edit only the records of employees who don’t use the standard rate (2%
in our example) and employees who don’t participate in the 401(k) plan. For
the employees who don’t use the standard rate, choose Maintain➪Employees
/Sales Reps. On the Withholding tab, supply the correct rate in the Additional
Withholding column of the 401k% field. For the employees who don’t partici-
pate in the 401(k) plan, open the same window and click the Employee Fields
tab. Then remove the check mark from the Use Defaults column and the
Calculated column next to the K401 payroll field.
The modifications to the 401K EE payroll tax table that we suggest change the
way Peachtree calculates the 401(k) contribution. Using our modifications,
Peachtree first checks the Employee Fields tab to determine whether an
employee participates in the plan. If so, Peachtree then checks the rate in the
401k% field on the Withholding Info tab of the Maintain Employees/Sales Reps
window. If an employee’s rate is 0, Peachtree uses the default rate specified in
the formula stored in the 401K EE payroll tax table (in our example, 2%) to
calculate the employee’s 401(k) contribution. On the other hand, if Peachtree
finds a percentage in the 401k% field in the Maintain Employees/Sales Reps
window, Peachtree uses that percentage to calculate the 401(k) contribution.
Multiple state withholdings
If your business is located on the border of a state, you might employ people
who live in both the state in which your company is located and in the neigh-
boring state. In this case, your payroll is affected at two levels:
 Typically, you need to pay state unemployment insurance (SUI) for only
the state in which your business is located.
 You must deduct correct state income taxes for employees based on
where they reside, not where your business is located.
Look first at SUI. When you set up Payroll, Peachtree automatically creates a
payroll field for state unemployment insurance for the state in which your
business is located. Peachtree makes the calculation for each state based on
the employee’s state of residence. So, you need to edit your payroll setup to
tell Peachtree to include all employees, regardless of their residence, when
calculating state unemployment for your company’s state. Follow these
steps:
384
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

1. Choose File➪Payroll Tax Tables➪User-Maintained to display the User-
Maintained Payroll Tax Tables window.
2. Highlight the state unemployment tax table.
Typically, the table’s name is comprised of your two-letter state abbrevi-
ation and the characters SUI. The state unemployment insurance tax
table for Florida, for example, is FLSUI.
3. In the State box, delete the characters that represent the two-letter
abbreviation for your state.
4. Click the Save button to save the tax table.
Next, you need to make sure that Peachtree uses the correct state unemploy-
ment insurance tax table. Follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Default Information➪Employees.
2. Click the EmployER Fields tab.
3. Highlight your state unemployment insurance tax table.
4. In the Tax Name text box, select your state’s payroll tax table.
In our example, we’d select FLSUI instead of **SUI ER.
5. Click OK.
Last, you need to make sure that all employees’ records use the correct state.
1. Choose Maintain➪Employees/Sales Reps to display the Maintain
Employees/Sales Reps window.
2. Select an employee.
3. On the Withholding Info tab, make sure that the state code matches
the state in which the employee resides.
Local taxes
During the initial payroll setup, you have the opportunity to set up local
taxes as well as state taxes. But suppose your employees live in a variety of
localities instead of just the locality in which your business is located. You
need to set up additional tax tables for those other localities and assign them
to the appropriate employees.
The process is similar to setting up payroll for multiple state withholdings.
First, make sure you have an Other Current Liabilities account for local taxes
set up in your Chart of Accounts. Then confirm that you have a Local tax pay-
roll field set up, and assign it (if necessary) to the correct box on the W-2.
385
Chapter 19: Real-Life Ways to Use Peachtree

1. Choose Maintain➪Default Information➪Employees to display the
Employee Defaults dialog box.
2. Click the EmployEE Fields tab.
3. If you don’t find a Local field, type Local on a blank line and assign
the Local field to the appropriate Other Current Liabilities account.
4. Click OK to save the field.
5. Reopen the Employee Defaults dialog box by repeating Step 1.
6. On the General tab, click the W-2s button to display the Assign
Payroll Fields for W-2s dialog box.
7. Select the Local payroll field you created from the Local Inc Tax list
box (the last box in the dialog box).
8. Click OK twice to close both dialog boxes.
Next, set up additional local tax tables by following these steps:
1. Choose File➪Payroll Tax Tables➪User-Maintained.
Peachtree displays the User-Maintained Payroll Tax Tables window.
2. Enter a tax ID.
For Marion County, for example, you might use something like Marion.
3. In the Tax Name box, enter the tax ID and follow it with the last two
digits of the current year.
In our example, we’d type Marion XX, where the Xs represents the last
two digits of the current year.
4. Set the Government type to Local. In the Local box, type a name for
the locality.
The name can be up to 15 characters long; don’t use spaces or punctua-
tion in the name.
5. In the State box (above the Local box), type the two-letter abbrevia-
tion for the state.
6. In the Formula box, type the formula for the locality.
Remember to place a semicolon (;) at the end of every line except the
last line and press Ctrl+J to start a new line. The last line should begin
with ANSWER = . A local tax formula might look something like this:
PERCENT = .7;
ANSWER = - PRORATE ((ANNUAL (ADJUSTED_GROSS)) * PERCENT%)
386
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

You’d change the percentage amount in the first line to match the per-
centage for your local tax.
7. Click the Save button to save the tax table.
8. Repeat Steps 2–7 for each local tax you need to create and then click
Close.
Last, make sure that you assign each employee to the correct local tax.
Follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Employees/Sales Reps.
2. Select an employee.
3. On the Withholding Info tab, check the following:
• The State/Locality box for the State field contains the two-letter
abbreviation for the state in which the employee resides.
• The State/Locality box for the Local field contains the name of one
of the localities you created in the preceding steps.
4. Click the Employee Fields tab.
5. Find the Local payroll field, remove the check mark from the Use
Defaults column and place a check mark in the Calculated column.
6. Based on the employee’s locality, select the appropriate payroll tax
table you created in the preceding set of steps.
7. Click the Adjust button for the Local field and place check marks in
the Use boxes for all fields that you want Peachtree to include when
calculating Adjusted Gross Income.
At a minimum, place a check mark in the Use check box next to Gross.
Ask your accountant about the others if you’re unsure.

In This Chapter
 Surviving and mastering common errors
S
ometimes, computer programs just don’t act the way that you expect. At
any moment in time, error messages might pop up, throwing most
people into a state of near panic.
This might sound a little strange, but frequently you can fix a problem if you
simply exit Peachtree and restart your computer. Always try shutting down your
computer before any other step. If the problem remains after restarting your
computer and you’re on a network, try restarting your server. If the problem
still remains after that, look at this chapter or contact technical support for a
resolution.
Although most error messages are easy to fix, you might need to run the Data
Verification program if an error occurs because of data problems. Contact
Peachtree or your Peachtree consultant before you attempt to run Data
Verification or its more powerful counterpart, Integrity Check. You might notice
that we don’t even include the instructions for running Data Verification or
Integrity Check anywhere in this book. We leave it out on purpose!
Here’s a valuable piece of advice: Data Verification or Integrity Check must be
run from Period 1. Don’t run these tools unless you really know what you’re
doing and always make a backup before you run the program. We don’t mean
to scare you, but trust us on this one: We found this out the hard way. If you
don’t know how to run these two data repair features, contact your Peachtree
consultant or Diane or Elaine at diane@thepeachtreelady.com or
elaine@thepeachtreelady.com, respectively. See Chapter 17 for informa-
tion on changing accounting periods.

Missing Buttons in Peachtree Windows
Although missing buttons don’t equal an error message per se, sometimes
this common situation occurs while working in any of the Maintain windows.
We’re talking about those buttons on toolbars that you don’t see on your
computer window. Here’s the deal: Peachtree displays buttons in the
Maintain windows based on the width of the window. And here’s the fix: If a
button seems to be missing, widen the window. A couple of the buttons we’ve
found that sometimes are “hidden” are the Attachments button and the
Outlook button.
To widen a window, move your mouse over the right side of the window.
When the pointer changes to a double-sided arrow (as shown here), drag the
window boundary. You can repeat the process on the left side of the window.
You can also maximize the window by clicking the Maximize button, which
you can see in the margin here.

improperly posted one or more transactions. Usually (but not always), the
error occurs if you interrupt Peachtree’s posting process. You can usually
repair the problem by changing to a batch-posting method, posting all jour-
nals, and changing back to a real-time posting method.
To correct the error, follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Company Information to display the Maintain
Company Information dialog box.
2. Click the arrow next to Posting Method to display the Posting Method
dialog box.
3. Change the Posting Method to Batch posting and then click OK twice.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 

4. Choose Tasks➪System➪Post to display the Post dialog box.
5. Click OK.
Peachtree now posts any unposted entries.
6. Repeat Steps 1– 3, selecting Real-time posting in Step 3 instead of
Batch posting.
You can now change your accounting period.
The Record You Are Trying to Access 
Is Currently in Use
This error, which also includes the message Please try again when it
is available, occurs when you attempt to select, use, or modify a cus-
tomer, vendor, item, employee, job, and so on when you or another user on
your network has the respective Maintain window open. To access the record
in question, the user who has the maintenance window open needs to close it.
Sometimes, you might get this message when the network connection gets
disrupted. You can fix the problem by restarting both your server and the
workstations.
No Forms to Print
Peachtree displays this message in a couple of different situations:
 If you try to print forms, such as invoices or checks, and Peachtree
determines that no transactions meet the requirements you specified:
For example, you tell Peachtree to print invoices, but no invoices exist
without an invoice number. (Remember that Peachtree identifies
invoices or checks that need to be printed based on the fact that they
don’t have a reference number.) Sometimes Peachtree displays the No
forms to print message if you dated them for a future date — such
as tomorrow — when you created these transactions. Unless you change
the Last Date for which the invoices will print in the Options dialog box,
Peachtree assumes that you want to print only the forms dated today or
earlier.
 If you try to reprint a customer statement after updating the customer
file

Chapter 20: Ten or So Common Peachtree Messages 

This Program Has Performed 
an Illegal Operation
First of all, you haven’t done anything illegal. Rest assured that you don’t
have to live in fear that the Software Police are going to knock at your door
and haul you away to jail (or the hoosegow, as Grandma called it).
Frequently, programs just decide that they won’t play nice anymore, so you
see this error message. There are too many reasons to list that can cause a
program to crash. As a remedy, usually you can just restart the program. If
that doesn’t work, reboot your computer and then start the program. If that
doesn’t work, try reinstalling the program. If that still doesn’t work, you need
to contact your Peachtree consultant or Sage Software (the company that
manufactures Peachtree).
GL Does Not Foot
This message occasionally appears when you attempt to print a General
Ledger report. To correct the error, you need to run Peachtree’s Data
Verification, running both tests as the feature suggests. If that doesn’t fix your
problem, you need to run a specific list of Integrity Checks.
Don’t run Data Verification or Integrity Check unless you really know what
you’re doing. We strongly suggest that you contact Peachtree or your
Peachtree consultant before you run Integrity Check, and always make a
backup before proceeding.
Could Not Find the xxx Single 
(Or Married) Calculation
This message appears when you’re trying to generate a paycheck, and the
payroll tax tables haven’t been updated. We cover updating the tax tables in
Chapter 17.
394
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

General Error in Module 4
This error appears with a damaged GENERAL.DAT file. The GENERAL.DAT file
stores all the default settings for your company, including the fiscal periods.
You can copy this file from a previous backup; however, the backup file must
be from the same current fiscal year.
The GENERAL.DAT file is the only Peachtree file that you can copy from a
backup. Attempting to copy any other Peachtree data file can result in seri-
ous data corruption.
Do not copy the file from another company. If you have a backup file (PTB)
file, use a program such as WinZip to extract the GENERAL.DAT file. To use
WinZip to extract the file, temporarily change the backup filename extension
from .ptb to .zip. When you finish extracting, rename the backup filename
extension to .ptb.
I/O Errors
I/O — Input/Output — errors are communication errors and mean that
Peachtree might be having a problem reading or writing data to your com-
puter’s hard drive.
Frequently, this means that a problem exists with your hard drive or transmis-
sion across your network. Contact your hardware specialist to check your
system. I/O errors can cause irreparable data corruption. A few files might
show I/O errors that you can safely delete from your company data folder and
let Peachtree re-create them. These files are EVENTLOG.DAT, ALARM.DAT,
ALERT.DAT, USERPREF.DAT, and AUDITTR.DAT.
For other I/O errors, you must restore a backup, re-create your Peachtree
company from scratch, or send your data out for repair. Contact your
Peachtree consultant for assistance.
395
Chapter 20: Ten or So Common Peachtree Messages 

Unable to Determine Security Privileges
This error can occur when the company’s PERMISS.DAT file becomes locked or
damaged. Often, simply rebooting all computers that access Peachtree —
including the server (if you have a server, of course) — remedies the problem. If
the error remains after rebooting, you either have to restore a backup or send
your data out for repair. Contact your Peachtree consultant for assistance.
The Account Reconciliation Screen 
Shows No Entries
Although this isn’t an actual error message, this situation is a fairly common
problem and seems to mostly occur after upgrading your company to a
newer Peachtree version and sometimes after running the Year End closing
procedure. You can run the Data Verification process, which forces the
entries to reappear.
Don’t run Data Verification unless you really know what you’re doing. We
strongly suggest that you contact your Peachtree consultant before you run
Data Verification. If you do run it yourself, make sure you change to Accounting
Period 1 and run both Data Verification tests. Review the report at the end of
the Data Verification to confirm that no other underlying problems exist.

with topics ranging from customizing Peachtree and networking Peachtree to
add-on programs that coordinate with your Peachtree Accounting software.
You can also read more about the accounting equation and just why and how
it works. That one’s not the most exciting chapter in the book, but it’s a nec-
essary one! (Besides, it tells you whom to blame.)
Just in case you didn’t see the commercial announcements that we make in

and management assistance to help Americans start, run, and grow their
businesses. With a portfolio of business loans, loan guarantees, and disaster
loans, the SBA is the nation’s largest single financial backer of small busi-
nesses. Last year, the SBA offered management and technical assistance to
more than 1 million small business owners and played a major role in the

Chapter 21: Ten or So Things You Can Get from the Web

Day after day, we all get e-mails claiming something has happened, is happen-
ing, or can happen. The problem is that many of these “alerts” are untrue,
and passing them along propagates the false rumors: for example, the rumor
that drinking Mountain Dew can prevent you from having children. It’s
untrue. However, the rumor that Lee Marvin (actor) and Bob Keeshan, (tele-
vision’s Captain Kangaroo) fought together at the battle for Iwo Jima is true.

I
f old Blue Eyes (that’s Frank Sinatra, for all of you who are too young to
remember) could do it his way, so can you. Peachtree allows customiza-
tion of how the program reacts to different things you do.
In this chapter, you discover how to customize settings such as the way that
numbers display when you type them in, the colors that display, and the
fields that you see on your screen during data entry.
Setting Global Options
You can use the Global Options feature to set the way Peachtree functions as
well as to select the color of your Peachtree windows. After all, you do want
to make sure that it matches your office décor, don’t you? You can set various
options to control the behavior, look, and feel of the program.
To set the global options, choose Options➪Global. The Maintain Global
Options dialog box appears with the Accounting tab in the front, as shown in
Figure BC1-1.

If you have multiple users, each user can set his or her own global option
preferences. See Chapter 18 for information on setting up users.
The Accounting tab
The first section on the left side of the Accounting tab — Decimal Entry —
determines how Peachtree inserts decimal points and how many decimal
points to use. You have a choice between allowing the Peachtree program to
place a decimal point in figures and entering the decimal point yourself.
If you select the Automatic option, Peachtree inserts the decimal point before
the last two digits of the number. For example, if you type 10, Peachtree
enters it as 0.10; however, if you select the Manual option for the decimal
point entry, Peachtree enters 10 as 10.00.
Most people prefer to set the decimal point entry to Manual. This option
affects any field that requires numbers, whether a Quantity field or a Price
field.
The section on the right side of the Accounting tab determines the number of
decimal places you want for particular field types. For example, if you sell
your products only in whole number quantities, you might set the Quantity
fields at 0 decimal places. If you charge a price like .2657 each for them, you
might set the Unit Price fields to 4 decimal places. The Standard Fields box
applies to fields such as Accounts Receivable amount, Average Costing, Sales
weight, Total % billed. For a complete list of standard fields, click the What
Fields Are Standard Fields link.

Peachtree For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

Use the middle section on the Accounting tab to optionally hide the General
Ledger account number fields in certain task windows. Transactions created
with the GL account number hidden automatically use the default General
Ledger accounts that you have set up. (You can find out how to set default
General Ledger accounts in Chapter 4.)
You can hide General Ledger accounts in the following task areas:
 Accounts Receivable: Select this option to hide GL accounts in the
Quotes, Sales Orders, Sales Invoicing, and Receipts windows.
 Accounts Payable: Select this option to hide GL accounts in the
Purchase Orders, Purchases/Receive Inventory, and Payments windows.
 Payroll Entry: Select this option to hide GL accounts in the Payroll
Entry window.
For example, selecting the Accounts Receivable option changes the look of
the Sales/Invoicing window. The Accounts Receivable account and the GL
account field of each line item are hidden. When you enter a sales invoice,
Peachtree uses the sales default GL account set up for the customer in
Maintain Customers/Prospects. If you select an inventory item, Peachtree
uses the default GL accounts set up in Maintain Inventory Items for this item.
Should you hide these accounts? Well, look at it this way. If your Chart of
Accounts has one GL Sales account and one Accounts Receivable account
that you use most of the time, these numbers would never change, so you
might as well hide them. You can then generate your invoice faster because
you don’t have to press the Tab key in these fields when you create an
invoice. If, however, the GL Sales account number changes depending on the
product or service provided, you should leave the account numbers dis-
played so that you can change them as necessary.
If you choose the Hide General Ledger Accounts option, you can view and
change the transaction’s GL accounts by clicking the Journal button in vari-
ous task windows.
Other options on the Accounting tab include
 Warn If a Record Was Changed But Not Saved: When you select this
option, Peachtree displays a warning if you try to exit a new or modified
record without saving it. If you deselect this option, you won’t see the
warning. We strongly recommend that you select this option.
 Hide Inactive Records: When you select this option, Peachtree doesn’t
display inactive General Ledger, customer, vendor or other records in
the lookup lists.
BC3
Bonus Chapter 1: Customizing the Way You Work

 Recalculate Cash Balance Automatically in Receipts, Payments, and
Payroll Entry: When you select this option, Peachtree automatically
updates the Cash Balance fields in the Receipts, Payments, and Payroll
Entry windows when you post or save transactions. The balance dis-
plays as of the date that appears in the task window.
The last option on this tab controls how Peachtree handles a secondary sort.
In a large number of reports and in the List dialog box where you select a
transaction for editing, you can sort the information by date. If two or more
transactions have the same date, the option you select here determines how
Peachtree sorts the matching items:
 By the transaction reference number such as the invoice or check
number
 By the order in which you entered the transactions
The General tab
The General tab, as shown in Figure BC1-2, includes features that affect
Peachtree’s performance as well as the visual color schemes.
The first four options affect how Peachtree performs:
 Do Not Print Total Page Length of Reports in Report Headers: When
you deselect this option, Peachtree calculates the total number of pages
in a report before printing the report. Selecting this option allows reports
to print faster, skipping the initial calculation of the total number of pages
prior to printing. Instead of displaying page 1 of 12 or page 2 of 12
in the report header, your reports will display page 1 or page 2.

Peachtree For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

 Do Not Show Quantity on Hand in Inventory Item Lookup Lists:
Selecting this option speeds up the display of inventory item lookup
lists because it skips the process of calculating each item’s current quan-
tity on hand every time you display the inventory item lookup list.
 Update the Business Status and Navigation Centers Only When the
Refresh Button Is Clicked: Selecting this option improves Peachtree’s
performance by not refreshing the Business Status until you manually
click the Refresh button on the Button Control Bar.
 Update Reports Automatically When Records Are Saved: Leaving this
option unchecked helps performance whenever you have a report open
in the background. Instead of recalculating each open report every time
you make a change to a record, the report data updates only when you
bring the open report to the foreground.
Depending on the configuration of your computer, you might or might not see
a noticeable improvement when selecting these performance options.
In the Line Item Entry Display section, you can determine whether Peachtree
displays one or two lines for each line item in the various task windows. For
example, two-line entry displays the name and description of the account,
and single-line entry allows display of more items on the window.
With the options in the Smart Data Entry section, you can enable lookup lists
to display instantly and anticipate what you want to enter. These options
make data entry faster in most cases. Unless you have a very slow computer,
you’ll probably want these features activated:
 Automatic Field Completion: Anticipates what you’re typing by filling in
the field with the nearest match to the characters you enter as you type
them. With it, you can avoid having to type all characters.
 Drop-Down List Displays Automatically: Allows Peachtree to automati-
cally display a list of choices when you place the insertion point in a
lookup field and type at least one character. We recommend you select
this option.
 Automatically Create IDs on Maintenance Windows: This option,
selected by default, tells Peachtree while in the Maintain Vendor,
Customers, Employees and so forth, to automatically create an ID based
on data you enter in the name or description field.
In the Color Scheme section, you can select colors for Peachtree windows
and dialog boxes. When you select a color scheme, this default affects all
Peachtree companies you open at this computer. If you change a color
scheme preference, you must exit and restart Peachtree before the color
changes take effect.
BC5
Bonus Chapter 1: Customizing the Way You Work

These color schemes apply only to windows and dialog boxes within the
Peachtree program — not to other Windows applications or the Windows
desktop.
Last, you see the Reset button; as you work in Peachtree, you will see mes-
sages that you can disable. The Reset button reactivates any disabled mes-
sages so that they appear when the respective condition warrants it.
The Peachtree Partners tab
This option controls how Peachtree interacts with its partner add-in pro-
grams, such as FAS, Timeslips, or Direct Deposit. We recommend that you do
not change this setting. See Bonus Chapter 4 for more information on
Peachtree add-in programs.
If you use Peachtree add-in products and you use Peachtree security fea-
tures, make sure you set the security access level to Full for the COM & DDE
Data Access area, located in the Company Tasks area. See Chapter 18 for
information on using Peachtree security.
The Spelling tab
Spelling errors can ruin the professional impression that you’re trying to
maintain. If your flying fingers frequently fumble (wasn’t that a great allitera-
tion?) on the keyboard, Peachtree can show you the error of your ways and
often offer corrections. By default, Peachtree will check spelling in most task
windows and note fields while you work, highlighting misspelled words in red
as you type them. Right-click a misspelled word to see a list of suggested
replacement words and then click the word you want in place of the mis-
spelled word.
If the word is spelled correctly but Peachtree doesn’t recognize it — a term
specific to your industry, for example — you can add the word to the dictio-
nary so that Peachtree recognizes it as a correctly spelled word. You manage
your spelling preferences using the Spelling tab of the Maintain Global
Options dialog box, as shown in Figure BC1-3.
On the Spelling tab, you can set up Peachtree to check spelling when you save
or close a transaction as well as control the speed of the Spell Check feature.
BC6
Peachtree For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

You can speed up the spell-checking process if you take advantage of
Peachtree’s capability to automatically correct spellings that you identify.
This feature is very useful in helping you correct typing mistakes that you
make on a regular basis or to recognize special terms you use on a regular
basis. For example, if you regularly type teh instead of the, set up an autocor-
rect action to make Peachtree automatically replace teh with the every time
you type it — without asking you about it.
Use this feature to store abbreviations for long words or phrases. For exam-
ple, you can store an acronym like ssa and tell Peachtree to replace it with
Social Security Administration.
To add words or phrases to a custom dictionary, follow these steps:
1. Choose Options➪Global to open the Maintain Global Options dialog
box; then click the Spelling tab.
2. Click the Custom Dictionary button.
Peachtree displays the Custom Dictionary dialog box, as shown in Figure
BC1-4.
3. In the Words text box, type the misspelling you want corrected.
4. In the Other Word text box, type the correct spelling.
5. From the Action drop-down list, select the Auto Change (Use Case of
Checked Word) option.

6. Click the Add Word button.
Peachtree adds the misspelled word and its correction to the list. You
can repeat Steps 3–6 for each misspelled word you want Peachtree to
automatically correct.
7. Click the Close button. Then in the Maintain Global Options dialog
box, click OK.
Whenever you type one of these words that you added, Peachtree replaces it
with the replacement word you provided. Note that you must type the word
that you added exactly as you added it. For example, if you add ssa but you
type SSA, Peachtree will not make the replacement.
Navigating Peachtree
We all know that some people are more analytical by nature, and others are
more artistic and graphical. Peachtree includes a feature — the Navigation 
Bar — designed to satisfy the appetites of those with the creative eye. You can
find it on the left side of your screen. With seven different centers, including
the Business Status Center, you can use the Navigation Bar as an alternate
method to open transaction and maintenance windows or to run reports. You
can find out about customizing the Business Status Center in Bonus Chapter 2.
Clicking any center on the Navigation Bar displays a list of applicable and
common choices for the selected center. In Figure BC1-5, you see choices and
information related to Employees & Payroll.

You then click the choice with which you want to work. Some buttons take
you directly to a specific task, while others (such as Employees) provide you
with a small menu of choices. Buttons that provide a menu have a small
arrow in the lower-right corner.
Customizing Shortcuts
Beneath the Navigation Bar is a series of Shortcuts (links) that take you
quickly to the Peachtree screens you use in your daily business. There are
seven default shortcuts, but you can customize them to better meet your per-
sonal needs by removing the ones you don’t use and adding others you’d like
to use. Click the Customize link to see the Customize Shortcuts dialog box, as
shown in Figure BC1-6.

separate the shortcuts: for example, to separate the Customer shortcuts
from the Vendor shortcuts.
After you make your selections, click OK. Peachtree revises the Shortcuts
Bar. If you add more than ten shortcuts, you’ll see a More Shortcuts link 
at the bottom of the bar. Click the link, and the rest of the shortcuts appear

Listing to the Left: Working with 
and Customizing List Windows
Peachtree contains lots of lists. You can see a list of almost any transaction
type (such as invoices, purchases, or general journal entries) as well as lists
of general records (such as customers, vendors, employees, inventory, or
jobs).
Peachtree lists are extremely flexible and customizable, so you can add or
delete fields; change the order by which the list is sorted; and reorganize the
fields to better meet your needs. In addition, you can select records to edit,
add new records, or generate tasks right from the list. For example, from the
Vendor List window, you can add a new vendor, create a purchase or pay-
ment for the vendor, or view vendor-related reports.
Using list windows
Peachtree provides several ways to access lists. You can choose Lists from
the main menu and then select the list you want. You can select the List
option from a Navigation Center button, or you can click the List button (as
shown here) from a record or task toolbar.
Any of these methods opens a list window, such as the Sales Order List
window you see in Figure BC1-7.
Figure BC1-7:
Open a list

information.
BC11
Bonus Chapter 1: Customizing the Way You Work

At the top of the list, you see the header information where you can select a
date range. List windows that show transactions (such as customer invoices,
purchase orders, or paychecks) initially show transactions for the current
period. From the Date Range drop-down list, you can select a different date
range or period; if you change the date range, Peachtree displays information
for the new date range next time you open the window.
Date ranges are available only in the transaction list windows and not in the
record maintenance lists.
In the main list section of the window are columns of data. If a column is too
narrow and you can’t see all the information, you can widen it. Conversely, if
a column is too wide and takes up excess room, make it narrower. For either
adjustment, place your mouse pointer over the small vertical bar to the right
of the column heading. When the mouse pointer changes to a double arrow,
drag the bar to the left or the right to resize the column.
If your List window is not large enough, you might not be able to see all the
fields. Resize the window by dragging the outside window edges or maximize
the window by clicking the Maximize button.
Peachtree indicates the current sort column by a small triangle in the column
heading. Click any column heading to sort by that field. Click the heading
again to sort by that field in descending order.
By entering information into the Search For text box, you can search your
company data for the record or transaction by using criteria that you specify
from the List window. For example, in the Sales Order List window in Figure
BC1-7, you can search for sales orders using customer ID numbers, customer
name, sales order dates, numbers, amount, or posting period.
For an alternative method for locating elusive data, see the upcoming section,
“Finding Transactions.”
After you select a search criterion, type some information about the transac-
tion into the Search For box that matches the criterion you selected. The ID
number and transaction dates, numbers, or totals are self explanatory; if you
choose Period as your search criterion, set the Date Range field to All
Transactions and enter the period number in the Search For box.
Search text is not case sensitive. Typing Abc, for instance, will call up values
with abc, Abc, and ABC in the specified field.
Click the various buttons on the List window toolbar to create a new transac-
tion or open an existing one. You can also use the toolbar buttons to print,
e-mail, export to Excel, or even create a PDF file from your list.
BC12 Peachtree For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

Customizing a List window
Each Peachtree user, based on his or her security rights, can customize any
List window, and the changes are saved exclusively for that user. In addition,
if you have several companies, you can have different settings for each com-
pany. See Chapter 18 to set user security rights.
Follow these steps to customize a List window:
1. Display the list you want to customize.
You can display the list through the List menu, from a Navigation Bar
button, or through a Maintenance or Task window.
2. Click the Settings button on the toolbar (as shown here).
A Settings window like the one seen in Figure BC1-8 appears. On the left
is a list of fields you can use, and on the right is a list of the fields that
are currently displayed.
3. Perform any of the following actions:
• To add a field: Click a field from the Available Columns list and then
click the Add button (as shown here).
• To remove a field: Select a field from the Selected Columns list and
then click the Remove button (as shown here).

or the Move Down button (both shown here).
• To completely reset the column settings to the Peachtree defaults:
Click the Reset Defaults button (as shown here).
Fields with an asterisk next to them are calculated fields. Adding many
of them to a list may slow down the performance of the list.
4. Click OK.
The List displays the fields you select.
Customizing Data Entry Windows
Over the years, our clients have commented that they want to be able to
enter their data quickly and go on to the next project. To aid in this goal,
Peachtree allows you to modify several of the Peachtree windows to display
certain portions of the window while hiding others. For example, if your 
business doesn’t use job costing, why not hide the Job text box in the Sales/
Invoicing or Purchases/Receive Inventory windows? By hiding a portion of
the window, the person entering the data skips the hidden areas, which
allows for faster data entry.
You can use these customized windows — known as templates — to enter
data in the following task windows: Quotes, Proposals, Sales Orders,
Sales/Invoicing, Purchase Orders, and Purchases/Receive Inventory.
For example, you can remove the Jobs and Ship To information from the
Sales/Invoicing window. Here’s how to customize the data entry window:
1. Choose Tasks and then select the task window you want to customize.
In our example, we want the Sales/Invoicing window.
2. Click the Layout button on the toolbar (as shown here).
A listing of available templates appears, with a check mark next to the
template currently in use.
You can’t edit or delete predefined templates. To customize a template,
you must first create a new, customized template.
3. From the list of templates, click Customize xxx Template, where the
xxx represents the task window you are using.
BC14 Peachtree For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

In our example, the Maintain Sales/Invoicing Templates window appears.
See Figure BC1-9.
4. In the Template Name field, type a unique name for the template.
For example, you might want to use your company’s name.
5. Press the Tab key and enter a description of the template.
Now you can determine which fields you want to be hidden during data
entry.
6. Select the fields and columns you want on the screen and deselect the
fields and columns you don’t want.
Some fields are required and cannot be hidden. Required fields are
grayed out and unavailable for change.
You can also customize a printed form associated with this task.
However, for better form design, we recommend that you customize the
form as we show you in Chapter 13.
7. When you finish modifying the template, click the Save button and
then click the Close button (both as shown).

Simplifying Repetitive Transactions
Memorized transactions can save you a great deal of time in repetitive data
entry tasks. Because they’re different from recurring transactions, you can
use memorized transactions repeatedly and at whatever time interval you
choose. You can enter memorized transactions for General Journal entries,
Quotes, Sales Invoices, Purchase Orders, and Payments. (For some odd
reason, though, you can’t create memorized Purchases. We don’t know why.)
With memorized transactions, you can enter the GL accounts and general
information without knowing an exact amount. They are great for transac-
tions that occur irregularly because they don’t automatically post, and you
can use them as needed.
Creating memorized transactions
Suppose that you sell a product line in which a customer will probably need
several parts at once, instead of just one part. By creating a memorized Sales
Invoice, each time one of these units is sold, you won’t need to look up or
enter the invoice information. As an example, in the sample company, we sell
birdhouses. When a customer orders a birdhouse and a pole, we give the cus-
tomer some birdseed at no charge. To create a memorized transaction to
store the invoice information, follow these steps:
Figure  BC1-10:

BC16 Peachtree For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

1. Choose Maintain➪Memorized Transactions.
A submenu of available memorized transactions types appears.
2. Select the type of transaction: in this example, Sales Invoices.
The Maintain Memorized Sales Invoices window appears.
3. Create an ID and description that defines the transaction.
IDs can be up to 20 alphanumeric characters, and the description can be
up to 30 characters in length.
4. Set the customer ID:
• If you’re designing this memorized invoice for a specific customer:
enter the customer ID in the Customer ID text box.
• If you’re designing this invoice for any customer: Leave the Customer
ID text box blank so that you can use it for any of your customers.
5. Enter the transaction information.
See Figure BC1-11 for an example. Note that this transaction doesn’t
have an invoice number or date because not all transaction fields are
maintained in memorized transactions. The date and invoice number
fields display when you actually use the memorized transaction.
6. Click the Save button (as shown here).

Using memorized transactions
You can use a memorized transaction at any time. To see how to use the
invoice we create in the preceding section, follow these steps:
1. Choose Task➪Sales/Invoicing (or whatever type of transaction you
want to use) to display a task window.
2. Click the arrow to the right of the List button and click the Select
button (both shown here).
The Select Memorized Transaction dialog box appears, displaying all the
memorized transactions relative to the current window.
3. Click the transaction you want to use and then click OK.
Voilà! The invoice information appears on-screen. You need to enter only the
header information, such as customer name, invoice number, date, and so
forth. You can edit the transaction lines as needed. We told you this could
save you time!
You can find out how to enter invoices in Chapter 7.
You can also use existing transactions as memorized transactions for later
use. After entering the transaction, click the arrow to the right of the Save
button and choose the Memorize button (both shown here). Enter an ID and
description for the transaction.
Action Items: May I Have 
Your Attention, Please?
Because being busy is part of daily life, overlooking a circumstance you
intended to monitor does happen. Peachtree includes Action Items that
assist you in tracking events and situations that are most important to your
business. In the Action Items window, you can create events to keep track of
certain occurrences or to remind you when a particular situation occurs.
A strange turn of events
Are you a sticky-note fanatic? Is your desk littered with lots of little notes
with no clear place to put them, yet you know they are important? If these
notes pertain to customers, vendors, or employees, you might want to take a
look at the Peachtree Event feature.
BC18 Peachtree For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

Turning off the automatic events
We all know that too much of a good thing is not so good. So it is with the
event log. By default, Peachtree keeps a log file of every type of transaction
you make for customers, vendors, and employees. No, we’re not talking
about the journals where the actual transactions are stored. Instead, we’re
talking about a second place to store a list of transactions. Although the log
file is a nice-enough feature, Peachtree’s default event log settings tend to
clutter a very useful screen with redundant data.
We recommend that you turn off the event log automatic features and create
events only when you want them.
To turn off the automatic events, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Action Items.
The Action Items and Event Log Options window opens.
2. Click the Options button (as shown here).
3. Click the Transactions tab and remove all the check marks from the
Create Event column. (See Figure BC1-12.)
4. Click OK and then click the Close button (as shown here).
Peachtree no longer automatically creates transactions in the Event Log
file.
Creating your own events
Suppose that you contacted a delinquent customer and would like to make a
note of the conversation, or perhaps an employee received a favorable com-
ment from a customer or a reprimand for being late. Maybe your favorite

vendor sales representative has promised you a special discount on your
next order. For notes like these, you can effectively use Peachtree’s event log.
Throw those sticky notes away! (Well, okay, if you don’t want to throw them
away, stick them on the cat.)
You can create events from the Maintain Customers, Vendor, or Employees
windows; from most task windows involving customers, vendors, or employ-
ees; or even from the Action Items window (also available under the Tasks
menu).
For this example, we create an event note tracking a telephone call we
received about one of our employees:
1. Choose Maintain➪Employees/Sales Reps to display the Maintain
Employees & Sales Reps window.
Optionally, open the Maintain Customer/Prospects or Maintain Vendor
windows to enter events pertaining to customers or vendors.
2. Click the Event button (as shown here) to reveal the Create Event
window, as shown in Figure BC1-13.
Click the Open button to modify an existing event.
3. Choose the employee ID from the ID lookup list.
4. (Optional) Change the date of the event.
You can type the event date or select a date from the calendar icon.
Figure BC1-13:

5. Select the option that best describes the note you want to make in the
Event Type section.
If you select the Other option, you can write your own description for
the type of event.
6. Type a note describing the event (for example, a telephone conversa-
tion) in the Note text box.
You can enter up to 255 characters in the Note text box. To start a new
paragraph in the Note text box, press Ctrl+Enter.
Click the Open button to modify an existing event.
7. Click the Save button (as shown here) and then close the Event
window.
Looking at the event log
You can view the event log through the Maintain Customers, Vendors, or
Employees windows. You can see or print all the events pertaining to a cus-
tomer, vendor, or employee by following these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Employees & Sales Reps (or Customer/Prospects or
Vendors).
The Maintain Employees & Sales Reps (or Customer/Prospects or
Vendors) window appears.
2. Enter the employee ID in the Employee ID text box or choose it from
the lookup list.
3. Click the Log button, and Peachtree displays the log file.
To print the event log, click the Print button (as shown here).
Making a to-do list
One of the more useful Action Items features is creating a to-do list. Keeping
track of the things you need to do with the Action Items feature is like having
your own little Personal Information Manager (PIM) stored right in Peachtree.
Follow these steps to use the Action Items feature:
1. Choose Tasks➪Action Items to display the Action Items window.
2. Click the To Do tab.
Use the To Do tab to set up a list of tasks that you need to complete.
These tasks are not associated with a vendor, customer, or employee.
BC21
Bonus Chapter 1: Customizing the Way You Work

3. Enter a date for the first To Do item.
Peachtree assumes that you want to accomplish this task as of the cur-
rent date.
4. Click the Notes section of the first line and type your first task. See
Figure BC1-14.
After you complete a task, select the Done check box at the beginning of the
line. To hide completed items, click the arrow next to the All To Do’s and
Events drop-down list (at the top of the window) and then choose
Uncompleted Events. Peachtree then hides the completed events.
Although you see only eight lines for to-do items, when you reach the last line
and press the Tab key in the Notes text box, Peachtree creates a new line and
adds a scroll bar.
Other useful buttons are the Delete button to delete a selected to-do task and
the Print button to print a copy of your to-do list. (Both buttons are shown in
the margin.)
When you close the window, Peachtree automatically saves the to-do list 
for you.
Setting alerts
Alerts are conditions that you want to be aware of as they happen so that you
can take further action. Alerts might warn you of low inventory, a customer
credit card about to expire, or an employee working too much overtime.
Figure BC1-14:

Do list.
BC22 Peachtree For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

When the conditions for an alert are met, Peachtree can display it on an alert
list or send someone an e-mail about the condition. You can create alerts for
employees, vendors, customers, inventory items, and General Ledger
accounts that meet certain criteria. Follow these steps to create an alert:
1. Choose Tasks➪Action Items to display the Action Items window.
2. To create a new alert condition, click the Alert button (as shown
here).
The Set Company Alerts dialog box appears, as shown in Figure BC1-15.
3. Click the next available blank line in the list.
4. Select the E-mail check box if you want to send an e-mail message
notifying someone of the alert condition.
You enter the e-mail recipient information in the bottom section of the
window. Alternatively, click the arrow next to a recipient box to display a
list of all customer, vendor, and employee e-mail addresses stored within
Peachtree.
To generate e-mail messages from within Peachtree, you must use a
MAPI-compliant, default e-mail application such as Outlook or Outlook
Express. If your default e-mail system is AOL, you can’t send e-mail
alerts from Peachtree because AOL is not a fully MAPI-compliant e-mail
application.
5. Select whether the alert condition applies to a customer, vendor,
employee, inventory item, or GL account, as well as which customer,
vendor, employee, or GL accounts you want to include.
Peachtree does not allow you to leave fields blank or amounts at zero.

priate to the type of information you have chosen.
The choices you see vary, depending on the type of alert selected.

Finding Transactions
Sherlock Holmes, where are you? Looking for specific transactions can be
time consuming and feel like detective work. In many cases, the Customer
and Vendor ledger reports give a lot of information, but what about employ-
ees? What if you’re looking for inventory information that could be affecting a
customer or a vendor, such as which customers purchased product XYZ this
year? Fortunately, Peachtree includes a Find Transactions feature that makes
your sleuthing work much easier.
You can activate the Find Transaction feature at any time or from any window
in Peachtree. To search for transactions, follow these steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Find Transactions or press Ctrl+F.
The Find Transactions window opens, showing a number of conditions
by which to search.
2. Enter the criteria for which you want to search.
You can use any option by itself or in combination with another option.
If you combine two options, Peachtree searches for a transaction that
matches both criteria, so using more than one option limits the number
of transactions Peachtree finds. Here are the conditions you can use to
search:
• Date: Find transactions based on To and From dates.
• Transaction Type: Find transactions based on the type of transac-
tion such as Invoice, Purchase, or Inventory Adjustment.
BC24 Peachtree For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

• Reference Number: Find transactions based on the transaction ref-
erence number. You entered this number when you created the
transactions. For payments, the reference number usually refers to
the check number.
• Customer, Vendor, or Employee ID: Find transactions for a specific
or range of customers, vendors, or employees.
• Job ID: Find transactions related to a specified job.
• Item ID: Find transactions related to a specified inventory item.
• Transaction Amount: Find transactions equal to, greater than, less
than, or within a specified dollar range.
• Account ID: Find transactions that affect specified GL accounts.
Figure BC1-16 shows an example. We want to see any transaction this
year involving our garden hoses, which are our inventory item IDs of
EQWT-15110 through EQWT-15120. We let the Find Transactions feature
do the detective work for us.
3. Click the Find button (as shown here).
Peachtree searches all journals for any transactions referring to the
field(s) data you specify. The results display at the bottom of the Find
Transactions window.

BC30 Peachtree For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
Financial analysts and bankers calculate dozens of ratios to help them under-
stand the financial picture of a company. Peachtree provides some of the
more basic ones in the Business Summary view, using information you can
find on your income statement and balance sheet.
The numbers you see in the four panes of the Business Summary are percent-
ages, but we describe ratios here. You must multiply the result of each of the
following calculations by 100 to adjust for percentages. (Remember that high
school math? Ugh!)
Ratios by themselves are meaningless; you need to compare the ratios with
either historical data for your company or to other companies in your indus-
try. You might want to take a look at Leo Troy’s Almanac of Business and
Industrial Financial Ratios (published by CCH, Inc.). You can purchase the
book from several vendors, including www.amazon.com.
Operational Analysis
To calculate the Cost of Sales as a Percentage of Sales, Peachtree uses your
income statement and divides Total Cost of Sales by Total Revenues. The
higher the ratio, the more it costs you to make your sales — thus reducing
your gross profit.
To calculate Gross Profit as a Percentage of Sales, again, Peachtree uses your
income statement and divides Gross Profit by Total Revenues. This ratio plus
the previous ratio will total 100 percent, so you can expect that a lower ratio
indicates that your cost of sales is high.
To calculate Net Income as a Percentage of Sales, Peachtree again uses your
income statement and divides Net Income by Total Revenues. This ratio takes
into consideration both your cost of sales and your operating expenses. A
higher ratio means that you’ve kept your expenses down.
Figure BC2-1:

Profitability
To calculate Return on Total Assets as a percentage, Peachtree uses both
your Income Statement and your Balance Sheet, dividing Net Income on your
Income Statement by Total Assets on your Balance Sheet. If the resulting ratio
is high, either you have a high profit margin, or you turn over your assets
quickly.
To calculate Return on Net Worth as a percentage, Peachtree again uses both
your Income Statement and your Balance Sheet and divides Net Income by
Total Equity (or Capital). The higher the ratio, the better, because it indicates
that you’re making more money on the money you invested.
Resource Management
In the Resource Management section, Peachtree lists your Current Assets and
Current Liabilities (both found on your Balance Sheet) and then calculates
the Current Ratio by dividing Current Assets by Current Liabilities. The
Current Ratio gives you a measure of your ability to cover your debts with
your assets in case of an emergency. A number less than 1 indicates that your
assets would not cover your liabilities.
Working Capital
To calculate Inventory Turnover, Peachtree uses both the Income Statement
and the Balance Sheet and divides Total Cost of Sales by Inventory. This ratio
helps you measure how long items remain in inventory before you sell them.
A higher number indicates that you keep items in inventory longer.
The Days A/R Outstanding entry represents the average length of time (in
days) that your receivables remain outstanding. To calculate Days A/R
Outstanding, Peachtree first divides Total Sales by the number of days in the
period — call the result Sales Per Day. Then Peachtree divides Average
Accounts Receivable for the period by Sales Per Day to determine the aver-
age number of days receivables remain outstanding.
Key Balances view
The Key Balances view of the Financial Manager window (see Figure BC2-2)
provides key balances for certain balance sheet accounts and, in the
Operations section, a summarized version of your Income Statement. Select
the Key Balances radio button to switch to this view.

While viewing Key Balances, you can click the S.Sheet button to have
Peachtree display corresponding monthly values.
Understanding the Cash Manager
“I really need to know how much cash I’m going to have at the end of the
month.” Have you heard yourself say that? Let the Peachtree Cash Manager
do the math for you.
The Cash Manager window, as shown in Figure BC2-3, shows you the com-
pany’s expected cash balance for a particular date, taking into consideration
sales you are due to collect (outstanding receivables), payments you are due
to make (outstanding payables), payroll you are due to meet, and any cash
adjustments. To open this window, choose Analysis➪Cash Manager.
If you use batch posting, you need to post before using the information in
this window to get an accurate picture of your cash position.
If pictures speak to you more than numbers, select the Graph radio button to
view the information in the Cash Manager window in graphic format (see
Figure BC2-4).
You can switch to Spreadsheet view by clicking the S.Sheet button, but we’re
going to work in the Numeric view shown in Figure BC2-3. Display this view
by clicking the Numeric toolbar button (as shown here) and then selecting
the Numeric display radio button.

BC32 Peachtree For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

To calculate the first Starting Cash balance shown on the screen, Peachtree
sums the balances in all accounts you defined as cash accounts in your Chart
of Accounts. All subsequent starting cash balances equal the ending cash bal-
ance from the prior period. You can change the forecast frequency from its
default of Weekly to Biweekly or Monthly from the Forecast drop-down list.
Suppose that you’re hoping to close a large deal, and you’d like to see what
the cash picture will look like if you’re successful. Or suppose that you might
buy a truck during the time period, and you’d like to include the effects of the

the Cash Adjustments lines. To add cash to the picture, double-click any
number on the Cash Adjustments (+) line. To subtract cash from the picture,
double-click any number on the Cash Adjustments (–) line. Peachtree dis-
plays the Spreadsheet view for the appropriate adjustments line. Record the
adjustment in the appropriate column (the column headings are dates) and
click the Numeric button to redisplay the view shown in Figure BC2-3. If you
click Save, you can review the adjustments at a later time when you return to
the Cash Manager window.
To subtract cash, record the adjustment using the Cash Adjustments (–) line
and enter a positive — not a negative — number.
Using the Payment Manager
The Payment Manager can help you select and pay bills. When you open the
Payment Manager window by choosing Analysis➪Payment Manager, you see
the window shown in Figure BC2-5.
Even if your business operates on a cash basis, you’ll see bars that represent
unpaid bills in this window.
You can view the information numerically by selecting the Numeric view
option, but we’re going to continue working in the Graph view.

BC34 Peachtree For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

The information that Peachtree presents is aged like the balances you see on
the Aged Payables report. Peachtree typically sets the As Of date field to
today’s date, but you can change it, too. You can use a date in the Show list to
compare last month with this month or this month last year with this month
this year date. Initially, the date in the Show field matches the As Of date.
Suppose that you want to see the details that make up the 31-60 bar. Double-
click the bar, and a window appears like the one shown in Figure BC2-6.
Place a check mark next to bills that you want to pay and then click the
Check button at the top of the window. Peachtree allows you to select a form
and print checks for the selected bills.
Using the Collection Manager
Managing accounts receivable can be critical to the survival of your business.
If you don’t collect money that your customers owe you in a timely fashion,
you might not have enough money to buy the things you need to continue
your business. A cash flow crunch could squeeze you out of business.
From the Collection Manager window, as shown in Figure BC2-7, you can mon-
itor your receivables and even create collection letters to send to your cus-
tomers. Choose Analysis➪Collection Manager to open this window.

The Collection Manager works a lot like the Payment Manager. You can view
the information numerically and change the dates you’re viewing. And, if you
double-click a bar on the chart, you can view details of the invoices that are
past due for that period.
In the Collection Manager window, you can select invoices for which you
want to send collection letters. Click the Letter button on the toolbar at the
top of the window, and then select a letter format. You can view and change
the text for each letter format, which range from gentle reminders to firm
requests for payment, from the Reports & Forms window. Click Reports &
Forms, point at Forms, and click Customer Labels and Letters. Select the
letter you want to view and click the Customize button.
Peachtree treats collection letters as forms; therefore, you can modify the
various collection letters the same way you modify other forms. You can find
the collection letters by opening the Select a Report or Form window for
Accounts Receivable and looking for a folder called Collection Letters. Also
note that the form letters used in the Collection Manager are not the same
ones used by the Mail Merge function. Unfortunately, there’s no slick way to
create a collection letter through the Mail Merge function for customers
selected in the Collection Manager.
See Chapter 13 for more information on customizing forms and Mail Merge.

Looking at the Business Status Center
If you are using Peachtree Complete or higher, when you first opened your
company in Peachtree, you probably noticed the Business Status Center —
the first page of Peachtree’s Navigation Centers (see Figure BC2-8). You can
think of the Business Status Center as an information center for your com-
pany. By default, Peachtree displays (in the Aged Receivables section) a
breakdown of your receivables and lets you view your customer list and your
Aged Receivables report. You also can record a customer payment from the
Business Status Center.
You can change the default page from the Business Status Center to any of
the other centers — for example, Customers & Sales Center or Employees &
Payroll Center — by clicking the tab for that center and then clicking the
Make This The Default Page button that appears above the information in
that center.
In the Vendors to Pay area, you also see a list of vendors to pay and the
amounts owed and dates due. You also can view your vendor list or pay bills
from the Business Status Center.
At the bottom of the page, you can use the Find a Report section to help you
select a report to print.
You can customize the Shortcuts area just below the tabs of the Navigation
Centers. See Bonus Chapter 1 for details.
You can customize the Business Status Center to display a variety of informa-
tion. For example, you can monitor information such as the current period
net income and year-to-date balances in certain accounts. We like to watch
bank accounts, Accounts Payable, and Accounts Receivable.
We include our suspense account in this group to make sure that its balance
is always zero. We use a suspense account to handle unusual transactions
such as adding labor burden to a job, and we always want the account’s bal-
ance to be zero.
BC37
Bonus Chapter 2: Managing Your Business’s Money

Displaying information such as Account Balances or Top Customers might
take longer than displaying other types of information. The amount of time
Peachtree needs to display information depends on the amount of informa-
tion you store in your Peachtree company.
You also can display your top customers over the past 12 months and your
year-to-date revenue information. And, depending on the information you
choose to display, you can print certain reports directly from this page.
Peachtree security settings control how much information appears to each
user, based on the user’s security settings. For example, if a user doesn’t
have security privileges for payroll information, that user doesn’t see the
Employees & Payroll Center. For more information on setting security in
Peachtree, see Chapter 18.
To customize the page, follow these steps:
1. Click the Customize This Page button.
Peachtree displays the Customize Business Status dialog box (see Figure
BC2-9).

3. To change the order of appearance, select a section and click either
the Move Up or the Move Down button.
4. Click OK.
Peachtree displays your new Business Status Center (see Figure BC2-10).
If you choose to display account balances, you can click the Customize link in
that section to select the accounts you want to view. Peachtree displays the
Customize Account Balances dialog box (see Figure BC2-11). Select the check
box for each account you want to display. Toward the bottom of the box, you
can choose whether to display accounts that have a $0 balance. You also can
choose whether you want to display current period balances or year-to-date
balances as well as display the same accounts in the Banking Center.
Notice that you can print certain reports associated with each kind of infor-
mation. For example, if you display the Top Customers section, Peachtree
provides a link to display the Customer Sales History report.

Peachtree and Networking
In This Chapter
 Installing Peachtree on a network
 Modifying Peachtree settings
I
f you’re not a geeky type of person who fools around with networking, skip
this chapter. Go to lunch, take a nap, hug a tree, whatever. However, if
you’re the one responsible for keeping Peachtree running across your net-
work, read on. You might find something in this chapter that you can use.
Peachtree Complete Accounting and above are the only multi-user products.
You can’t use Peachtree Pro Accounting or Peachtree First Accounting in a
network environment. Also, to function in a network environment, you must
purchase the multi-user license version of the product or purchase a single
user copy for each PC on which you want to install Peachtree. Otherwise, two
users can’t access the data files at the same time.
What Type of Network Can Be Used?
The most typical types of networks in use today are peer-to-peer networks
and client/server networks:
 A peer-to-peer network environment allows each connected computer to
act as a server or a workstation or both. Each computer can share its
hard drive, printers, and other devices with all other computers in the
network. This makes each computer on the network equal to the other
computers — a peer.
 A client/server network environment has one computer — the server —
acting as a central unit with several workstations connected to it. The
server is where you store the data shared by the workstations.
Peachtree will not operate properly on a Novell network.

This chapter provides general guidelines for installing Peachtree on a net-
work. You can also obtain guidelines providing specific system requirements
for Peachtree to run successfully on various network types. Go to the Peachtree
Web site at www.peachtree.com/support and search the Peachtree
Knowledge Base for networking.
Where Do Files Reside?
Peachtree divides all its files into two main sets:
 Program files: Program files do not need to be shared. They need to
reside on each individual machine.
 Data files: Data files must be shared in a networked environment. Data
files include help files, the status.dat file, the options.dat file, the
global taxtable file, and form files as well as all company folders that
include the data files when you create your Peachtree company.
In a client/server network, data files are stored on the server. In a peer-to-
peer network — which doesn’t have a traditional server — the administra-
tor’s machine is usually designated as the main computer. Ideally, this
computer is the fastest and has the largest amount of available memory and
hard drive space.
Installing Peachtree on a Network
Peachtree must be loaded on a computer using administrator rights.
Individual users don’t need administrator rights to use Peachtree after it’s
loaded on their computers. However, they do need rights to modify the data
on the server where the Peachtree data is located. Additionally, they need
read/write access to the C:\Program Files\Common Files\Peach folder
and to C:\Winnt or C:\Windows. They also need rights to the Registry for
Peachtree.
This is important! You MUST install Peachtree on the system where the data
files will be stored (the server) first. Key files are copied to the server during
the installation process. After you install Peachtree on the server, then you
can install on the rest of the workstations.
BC42 Peachtree For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

Mapping the drive
During Peachtree installation, you’ll be asked for a data path. So, before you
install Peachtree on the workstations, you must map a drive letter to the
server. (We like to use the letter P for our mapped drive. P for Peachtree —
get it?) The data location you select must be a shared folder. Because peer-to-
peer networks allow you to share the entire hard drive or only a particular
folder, before you load Peachtree, you should know whether you’re sharing
the entire drive or just the Peachtree folder. If you’re planning to share only
to a particular folder, here are a few strategies to keep in mind:
 If you’re planning to map Peachtree workstations to a specific folder,
such as making P: point directly to the \Program Files\Peachtree\
folder, your data path would read
P:\Company\
 If you are mapping the entire Program Files folder as P:, your data path
would read
P:\Peachtree\Company\
 If you map the entire hard drive as P:, the data path would read
P:\Program Files\Peachtree\Company\
 If you’re performing the Peachtree installation on the server, the pro-
gram path and data path should be the same. However, when installing
on the workstation, the program path should be on a local hard drive
(C:\Program Files\Peachtree\), and the data path should point to
the Company folder on the server computer: for example
P:\Program Files\Peachtree\Company
Installing the program
When you insert the Peachtree CD into the drive, the Autorun screen should
appear, welcoming you to Peachtree and offering you three choices:
 Install Peachtree Accounting
 Install Server Components Only
 Remove or Modify Peachtree Accounting
BC43
Bonus Chapter 3: Peachtree and Networking

If installing on the server, you can choose either of the first two options.
When installing on the workstations, however, you must choose the first
option. During the workstation installation process, follow the on-screen
prompts and pay close attention to the screen that asks for the data path. On
the workstations, the data path should point to the mapped drive — to the
Company folder.
Do not point the data path directly to YOUR company folder. Point the data
path to the folder actually named Company.
During the install, Peachtree will advise you if it needs to add additional pro-
grams, such as Microsoft .NET. It’s a pretty smart installation program; let it
install what it needs.
Because installing Peachtree writes to the Windows Registry, you should
restart your system after installation but before you use the application.
If you’re installing to the server, be sure to warn any users who might be
using other applications on the server that you’re going to restart the
system.
Just a Few Final Notes
We told you this was really geeky stuff! Here are a few little ditties you might
want to know if you need to make changes to your Peachtree settings.
Data folders
For each company you create in Peachtree, Peachtree creates a folder in
which to store the company information. The folder name comes from the
company name. Generally, Peachtree takes the first three letters of the first
word of the company name, the first three letters of the second word of the
company name, and the first two letters of the third word of the company
name. If your company name contains one or two words, Peachtree uses only
those words but a total of eight letters if possible. Confused? Here are some
examples:
 If your company name is All Business Service, Peachtree creates a folder
named ALLBUSSE.
 If your company name is Marmel Enterprises, LLC, Peachtree creates a
folder named MARENTLL.
 If your company name is Bo the Handyman, Peachtree creates a folder
named BOTHEHAN.
BC44 Peachtree For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

 If your company name is Magic Fingers, Peachtree creates a folder
named MAGFINGE.
 If your company name is Wanderbusters, Peachtree creates a folder
named WANDERBU.
You get the idea.
The Forms folder
During installation, Peachtree automatically creates a Forms folder and
places it under the Company folder. This is at the same level as your com-
pany data folder. All Peachtree standard forms as well as forms that you cus-
tomize are located in the Forms folder.
Peachtree uses an .frm extension for its forms. The first several letters indi-
cate the form type, and the form name follows in a numerical format. For
example, INV01430.frm is an invoice form, PRC0130.frm is a payroll check
form. Peachtree standard forms all have a value greater than 1000, and cus-
tomized forms have a value less than 1000. If you see a form named
APC00001.frm, that means that it’s a customized accounts payable check.
You can read about customizing forms in Chapter 13.
Do not move the Forms folder to a different location unless you are changing
the data path. See the upcoming section, “Changing the data path.”
Changing from single user to multi-user
If you first installed Peachtree as a standalone program, but now you need to
network it, we suggest that you uninstall Peachtree and then reinstall the pro-
gram. Different settings are used when installing as a single user versus as a
multi-user. You can uninstall Peachtree either through the Windows Control
Panel or by inserting the Peachtree installation CD and choosing the Remove
or Modify Peachtree Accounting option.
Changing the data path
In Peachtree 2007 and later, if you need to change the data path location, you
must uninstall Peachtree and reinstall it. You can uninstall Peachtree either
through the Windows Control Panel or by inserting the Peachtree installation
CD and choosing the Remove or Modify Peachtree Accounting option.

Special hardware and software issues
This section contains suggestions — not requirements — for networking.
However, we have found that Peachtree responds much better if you follow
these guidelines:
 Same Operating System: Peachtree works best if all workstations use
the same version of Windows. If you’re using Windows Vista, for exam-
ple, make sure that everyone is using Windows Vista. Peachtree might
operate if you use different operating systems, but the risk for problems
increases.
 Latest Windows update: Make sure that all workstations are using the
latest update of their Windows version. To check for updates, visit
www.windowsupdate.com from each computer.
 Same network card brand: Make sure that all workstations have the
same brand of network card. We’ve seen a number of instances where
replacing the network cards so that all workstations use the same brand
substantially improved Peachtree performance. We don’t really know
why it works better, but it does.
 Enough memory: Make sure the workstations have enough memory. If
you’re on a network, chances are your Peachtree data files will be larger
than a single user simply because you have more people entering data.
More memory means much better performance.
System Requirements
For Peachtree Premium, the recommended system requirements (per
Peachtree) are as follows:
 1 GHz Intel Pentium III (or equivalent) for single user and 1.8 GHz Intel
Pentium 4 (or equivalent) for multiple concurrent users
 512MB of RAM for single user and 1GB for multiple concurrent users
 Windows 2000 SP3, XP SP2, or Vista
 1GB of disk space for installation
 Internet Explorer 6.0 or higher required (provided on CD; requires an
additional 70MB of disk space)

Peachtree Fixed Asset System
If your company owns assets with a useful life of more than one year, you
own fixed assets. From an accounting perspective, you treat a fixed asset dif-
ferently from another type of asset because you depreciate it over its esti-
mated useful life to spread out the cost of the asset instead of recognizing its
entire cost in the year that you buy the asset. If you have lots of fixed assets,
tracking their value and associated depreciation can be problematic.
Consider trying Peachtree FAS, which ships with Peachtree Complete and
higher.

The Accounting Equation —
Whom to Blame and How It Works
In This Chapter

e’re going to start with a little history. After all, debits and credits didn’t
just magically appear. And, with the history lesson, at least you’ll know
whom to hate for inventing debits and credits. (We’ve always found that direct-
ing anger correctly is more productive than being angry in general.)
The History of the Accounting Equation
You can trace double-entry bookkeeping back to Luca Pacioli’s book, Summa
de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalita (Everything about
Arithmetic, Geometry, and Proportion). Pacioli was a Franciscan friar in Venice,
Italy, and wrote the Summa in 1494. One part of his book described a method of
keeping accounts so that a trader could get, without delay, information about
his assets and liabilities. Pacioli’s interrelating system of accounts was based
on two fundamental principles that are still the foundation of accounting today:
 The accounting equation (also called an accounting model)
Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s equity
• Assets are things of value, such as cash, receivables, inventory,
equipment, deposits, and investments that your company owns.
These things of value help you operate your business.
• Liabilities are the debts owed by the company, such as accounts
payable, loans, taxes, and interest.
• Owner’s equity (also called equity, capital, and paid-in capital) is
the owner’s interest in the company.
 Debits = credits

Understanding the Accounting Equation
To understand how the accounting equation works, we’ll start a fictitious
cash-based business with $1,000 of our own money, giving the company one
asset of cash. To represent our investment into the business, we record the
$1,000 as equity, as you can see from Line 1 in the following table of fictitious
accounting transactions.

Owner’s Equity

+
$1,800
To run our business, we purchase a delivery truck by borrowing $3,000 from
the bank (it’s a cheap truck), which we record as Line 2 in the table.
Combining this entry with the original investment, we have $4,000 of assets
(the initial cash and the truck), $3,000 of liabilities (the bank loan for the
truck), and $1,000 of equity. Note that the accounting equation balances. That
is, assets equal liabilities plus owner’s equity. The table is looking suspi-
ciously like a Balance Sheet — and now you can understand why it’s called a
Balance Sheet.
Every business has income from sales (or it won’t stay in business very long)
and expenses. Pacioli realized this, too. We’re sure you would agree that what
you earn belongs to you. At least, you should get to keep most of it. We
handle income and expenses in the accounting equation by expanding the
equation to include them in owner’s equity:
Equity = Original investment + Income – Expenses
In our example, the original investment was $1,000. Suppose that we made
$2,000 of cash sales and pay for $1,200 of expenses. What would happen to
our accounting model? Line 3 in the table shows how $2,000 of cash sales
increases our assets (cash) and the income portion of owner’s equity. Line 4
shows that $1,200 of cash expenses decreases our assets (cash) and the
expense portion of owner’s equity.
BC56 Peachtree For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

Income minus expenses is net income — and the business pays taxes on this
amount. And, when you close the year, Peachtree posts net income after
taxes to the equity section of the Balance Sheet. You can gain numerous
insights about your business by studying your Balance Sheet and Income
Statement. Wish we had space to show you, but . . . if we could write a book
on Peachtree in Wiley’s Bible series, we’d have plenty of room. So, contact
Wiley and help us lobby for a Peachtree Bible.
Now consider Pacioli’s second principle of accounting: Debits = Credits.
Pacioli needed some mechanical device to make sure that the accounting
equation was always in balance. He developed the following four rules, which
we find most helpful when preparing journal entries:
 Debits increase Asset accounts and decrease Liability and Equity
accounts.
 Credits do the opposite; they decrease Asset accounts and increase
Liability and Equity accounts.
Expense and Income accounts behave like Equity accounts, so
 Debits increase Expense accounts and decrease Income accounts.
 Credits (surprise!) do the opposite; they decrease Expense accounts and
increase Income accounts.
Return to our example to see how these work. In Line 1 of the table, we
started our business by investing $1,000. We increased our assets and
increased our equities. According to Rules 1 and 2, we debited assets and
credited equity.
Line 2 shows how we handled the purchase of our truck. Because both an
asset (purchase of truck) and a liability (borrowed money) increased, we
debited assets and credited liabilities (again, Rules 1 and 2).
In our last transactions (Lines 3 and 4 of the table) we earned $2,000 of
income and paid $1,200 of expenses. Note the following:
 The income increased our cash asset by $2,000 and also increased our
income by the same amount. Therefore, Rules 1 and 4 say we should
debit (increase) the cash asset and credit (increase) income.
 Expense transactions have the opposite effect; therefore, Rules 2 and 3
say we should credit (decrease) the cash asset and debit (increase)
expenses.
These debit/credit rules are necessary to make sure we always keep the
accounting model in balance.
