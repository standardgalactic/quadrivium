Velocity of Shortening 
Speed of shortening is related to the  
amount of load

Metabolism & Fuels 
Creatine phosphate donates a phosphate to convert ADP to ATP 
in the first seconds of muscle activity, 100 meter dash 
 
Anaerobic metabolism (glycolytic) produces ATP & lactic acid  
using glycolysis, Burns glucose and muscle glycogen, 400 meter 
dash 
 
Aerobic metabolism (oxidative) produces ATP, CO2 & water  
using oxidative phosphorylation, Burns blood glucose & fatty 
acids, marathon 
 
Fuel sources: Glucose, glycogen, & fatty acids

Fatigue State  
Contributing factors include: 
 
1.
Build up of ECF [K+] = persistent 
depolarization of fiber 
 
2.
Build up of metabolites which impair SR Ca2+ 
ATPase  & troponin-tropomyosin.  
 
3.
Buildup of Pi in ICF inhibits cross bridge 
 
detachment & slows cross bridge cycling 
 
4.     Decrease in fuel stores (glycogen, fatty acids & 
glucose) 
 

Slow-oxidative resist fatigue (muscles for posture). 
Fast-oxidative-glycolytic resist fatigue (muscles used in 
walking).  
Fast-glycolytic used for bursts of strong force  
(muscles used to jump).

Fiber types 
& 
metabolism 

Fiber Types & Motor Units 
Each motor unit has one type of muscle fiber.  
Small motor unit  (#1) has fewer fibers = finer movement 
Large motor unit (#2) has more fibers = more tension 
Each fascicle contains more than one motor unit. 
Motor 
unit 2 
Motor  
unit 1 
Most skeletal muscles include all three fiber types.  

Slow -oxidative recruited first = low force but high precision and/or long duration. 
Fast-oxidative-glycolytic recruited next = intermediate force.  
Fast-glycolytic recruited last = high force tasks of short duration. 
Recruitment

Weight training induces hypertrophy to 
generate more tension (force). 
 
Endurance training induces resistance to fatigue 
without dramatic hypertrophy. 
 
Training changes relative size of fibers not 
number of fibers 
 
 
Muscle Plasticity 

Key Concepts 
 
Muscles can shorten at a constant force (isotonic 
contraction) or develop force without shortening (isometric 
contraction).  Maximal velocity of shortening occurs with 
zero load. Summation of contractions (tetanus) can occur in 
skeletal muscle resulting in maximal force. Speed of 
contraction is set by the myosin ATPase.  
  
The immediate fuel for muscle contraction is ATP which is 
generated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Those 
muscles with high requirements for ATP and resistance to 
fatigue have predominantly aerobic metabolism
