Welcome To:
Module 8
Disk Management and 
Run Levels

System Run Level
• System Run Levels
Main Run level
• 0
Shut down (or halt) the system
• 1
Single-user mode; usually aliased as s or S
• 6
Reboot the system
Other Run levels
• 2
Multiuser mode without networking
• 3
Multiuser mode with networking
• 5
Multiuser mode with networking and GUI.

Linux Boot Process

Linux Boot Process (Newer Versions)
• The boot sequence changes in CentOS/Redhat 7 and above
• systemd is the new service manager in CentOS/RHEL 7 that manages the boot 
sequence
• It is backward compatible with SysV init scripts used by previous versions of 
RedHat Linux including RHEL 6
• Every system administrator needs to understand the boot process of an OS in 
order to troubleshoot effectively

Linux Boot Process (Newer Versions)
BIOS = Basic Input and Output Setting (firmware 
interface)
POST = Power-On Self-Test started
MBR = Master Boot Record
Information saved in the first sector of a hard disk that indicates where 
the GRUB2 is located so it can be loaded in computer RAM
GRUB2 = Grand Unified Boot Loader v2
Loads Linux kernel
/boot/grub2/grub.cfg
Kernel = Core of Operating System
Loads required drivers from initrd.img
Starts the first OS process (systemd)
Systemd = System Daemon (PID # 1)
It then starts all the required processes
Reads = /etc/systemd/system/default.target to bring the system to the 
run-level
Total of 7 run-levels (0 thru 6)

Add and Extend Disk using LVM
By: Imran Afzal
/oracle = 1.0G
/oracle = Full
Few Options:
• Delete older files to free up disk space
• Add new physical disk mount to /oracle2
• Create a new virtual disk and mount to /oracle2
• Or extend /oracle through LVM.

Add/Extend Swap Space
By: Imran Afzal
•
What is swap? – CentOS.org
Swap space in Linux is used when the amount of physical memory (RAM) is full. If the system needs 
more memory resources and the RAM is full, inactive pages in memory are moved to the swap 
space. While swap space can help machines with a small amount of RAM, it should not be 
considered a replacement for more RAM. Swap space is located on hard drives, which have a 
slower access time than physical memory
• Recommended swap size = Twice the size of RAM
M = Amount of RAM in GB, and S = Amount of swap in GB, then
If M < 2
then 
S = M *2
Else
S = M + 2
• Commands
•
dd
•
mkswap
•
swapon or swapoff

•
Red Hat 8 introduces the next generation volume management solution called Stratis
•
It uses thin provisioning by default
•
It combines the process of creating logical volume management (LVM) and creation of 
filesystems into one management
•
In LVM if a filesystem system gets full you will have to extend it manually whereas stratis
extends the filesystem automatically if it has available space in its pool
In this lesson we will learn…

File System Check (fsck and xfs_repair)
• Linux fsck utility is used to check and repair Linux 
filesystems (ext2, ext3, ext4, etc.)
• Linux xfs_repair utility is used to check and repair Linux 
filesystems for xfs filesystem type
• Depending on when was the last time a file system was 
checked, the system runs the fsck during boot time to 
check whether the filesystem is in consistent state
• System administrator could also run it manually when 
there is a problem with the filesystems
• Make sure to execute the fsck on an unmounted file 
systems to avoid any data corruption issues.
By: Imran Afzal

File System Check (fsck and xfs_repair)…
• Force a filesystem check even if it’s clean using option –f
• Attempt to fix detected problems automatically using option -y
• The xfs_repair utility is highly scalable and is designed to repair even 
very large file systems with many inodes efficiently. Unlike other Linux 
file systems, xfs_repair does not run at boot time
• The following are the possible exit codes for fsck command

System Backup (dd Command)
5 Different Types of Backups
1.
System backup (entire image using tools such as acronis, Veeam, Commvault
etc.)
2.
Application backup (3rd party application backup solution)
3.
Database backup (Oracle dataguard, SQL backup etc.)
4.
Filesystem backup (tar, gzip directoris etc.)
5.
Disk backup or disk cloning (dd command)
• dd is a command-line utility for Unix and Unix-like operating systems whose primary 
purpose is to convert and copy files
• As a result, dd can be used for tasks such as backing up the boot sector of a hard 
drive, and obtaining a fixed amount of random data
• Please note the source and destination disk should be the same size
By: Imran Afzal

System Backup (dd Command)…
• To backup or clone an entire hard disk to another hard disk connected to the 
same system, execute the dd command as shown
# dd if=<source file name> of=<target file name> [Options]
# dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb
• To backup/copy the disk partition
# dd if =/dev/sda1 of=/root/sda1.img
• Restoring this image file to other machine after copying the .img
# dd if=/root/sda1.img of=/dev/sdb3

Network File System (NFS)
• NFS stands for Network File System, a file system developed by Sun 
Microsystems, Inc. 
• It is a client/server system that allows users to access files across a network and 
treat them as if they resided in a local file directory
• For example, if you were using a computer linked to a second computer via 
NFS, you could access files on the second computer as if they resided in a 
directory on the first computer. This is accomplished through the processes of 
exporting (the process by which an NFS server provides remote clients with 
access to its files) and mounting (the process by which client map NFS shared 
filesystem)

Network File System (NFS)…
Steps for NFS Server Configuration
• Install NFS packages
# yum install nfs-utils libnfsidmap
(most likely they are installed)
• Once the packages are installed, enable and start NFS services
# systemctl enable rpcbind
# systemctl enable nfs-server
# systemctl start rpcbind, nfs-server, rpc-statd, nfs-idmapd
• Create NFS share directory and assign permissions
# mkdir /mypretzels
# chmod a+rwx /mypretzels
• Modify /etc/exports file to add new shared filesystem
#   /mypretzels 192.168.12.7(rw,sync,no_root_squash) = for only 1 host
# /mypretzels *(rw,sync,no_root_squash) = for everyone
• Export the NFS filesystem
# exportfs -rv
IP address of 
client machine
NFS share
Read/write
all changes to the according filesystem are 
immediately flushed to disk; the respective 
write operations are being waited for
root on the client machine will have the same 
level of access to the files on the system as root 
on the server.

Network File System (NFS)…
Steps for NFS Client Configuration
• Install NFS packages
# yum install nfs-utils rpcbind
• Once the packages are installed enable and start rpcbind service
# systemctl rpcbind start
• Make sure firewalld or iptables stopped (if running)
# ps –ef | egrep “firewall|iptable” 
• Show mount from the NFS server
# showmount -e 192.168.1.5 (NFS Server IP)
• Create a mount point 
# mkdir /mnt/kramer
• Mount the NFS filesystem
# mount 192.168.1.5:/mypretzels /mnt/kramer
• Verify mounted filesystem
# df –h
• To unmount
# umount /mnt/kramer

Samba
• Samba is a Linux tool or utility that allows sharing for Linux resources such as files and 
printers to with other operating systems
• It works exactly like NFS but the difference is NFS shares within Linux or Unix like system 
whereas Samba shares with other OS (e.g. Windows, MAC etc.)
• For example, computer “A” shares its filesystem with computer “B” using Samba then 
computer “B” will see that shared filesystem as if it is mounted as the local filesystem

Samba (smb vs. CIFS)
• Samba shares its filesystem through a protocol called SMB (Server Message Block)  which 
was invented by IBM
• Another protocol used to share Samba is through CIFS (Common Internet File System) 
invented by Microsoft and NMB (NetBios Named Server)
• CIFS became the extension of SMB and now Microsoft has introduced newer version of 
SMB v2 and v3 that are mostly used in the industry
• In simple term, most people, when they use either SMB or CIFS, are talking about the same 
exact thing  

Samba Installation and Configuration
• Take snapshot of your VM
• Install samba packages
• Enable samba to be allowed through firewall (Only if you have firewall running)
• Disable firewall
• Create Samba share directory and assign permissions
• Also change the SELinux security context for the samba shared directory
• Or disable SELinux
• Modify /etc/samba/smb.conf file to add new shared filesystem
• Verify the setting
• Once the packages are installed, enable and start Samba services (smb and nmb)
• Mount Samba share on Windows client
• Mount Samba share on Linux client
• Additional instructions on creating secure Samba share.

NAS Device for NFS or Samba
• A storage can be carved on a Linux server, and it can be shared with another 
Linux machine through NFS or to a Windows machine through Samba service
Server
Client
• NFS/Samba or any NAS service can be setup through a dedicated NAS device

• Mount shared folder from the NAS device to Linux and Windows

SATA and SAS
By: Imran Afzal
www.utclisolutions.com
•
SATA Stands for Serial Advanced Technology Attachment and SAS stands for Serial 
Attached SCSI (SCSI Stands for Small Computer System Interface, typically pronounced 
as “scuzzy”)
•
Both SAS and SATA utilize serial communication. Serial communication means that the 
highway has both lanes
Serial communication
Parallel communication

SATA and SAS
By: Imran Afzal
www.utclisolutions.com
•
The main difference between them is that SAS drives are faster and more reliable than SATA drives
•
SAS is generally more expensive, and it’s better suited for use in servers or in processing-heavy 
computer workstations.  SATA is less expensive, and it’s better suited for desktop file storage
•
In a SATA cable, all 4 wires are placed within the same cable. In a SAS cable, the 4 wires are 
separated into 2 different cables
Why divide the wires between 2 cables???
•
So you can connect more devices to one another. With a SATA cable, you can only link the motherboard 
and the storage drive. You could hook up an expansion device, but that takes up valuable room inside your 
computer.
•
With a SAS cable, you can hook up the motherboard to both a storage drive and another piece of 
hardware that has SAS connectors.
Here’s what the highways look like, metaphorically:
•SATA cable: Los Angeles to San Francisco
•SAS cable: Los Angeles to San Francisco or Los Angeles to Las Vegas
