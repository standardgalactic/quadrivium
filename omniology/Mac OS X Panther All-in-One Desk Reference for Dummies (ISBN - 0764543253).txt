About the Author
Mark L. Chambers has been an author, computer consultant, BBS sysop, pro-
grammer, and hardware technician for more than 20 years. (In other words,
he’s been pushing computers and their uses far beyond “normal” perform-
ance limits for decades now.) His first love affair with a computer peripheral
blossomed in 1984 when he bought his lightning-fast 300 bps modem for his
Atari 400. Now he spends entirely too much time on the Internet and drinks
far too much caffeine-laden soda.
His favorite pastimes include collecting gargoyles, watching St. Louis
Cardinals baseball, playing his three pinball machines and the latest com-
puter games, supercharging computers, and rendering 3-D flights of fancy
with TrueSpace — and during all that, he listens to just about every type of
music imaginable. (For those of his readers who are keeping track, he’s up to
1,200+ audio CDs in his collection.)
With a degree in journalism and creative writing from Louisiana State
University, Mark took the logical career choice and started programming
computers. However, after five years as a COBOL programmer for a hospital
system, he decided there must be a better way to earn a living, and he
became the Documentation Manager for Datastorm Technologies, a well-
known communications software developer. Somewhere in between organiz-
ing and writing software manuals, Mark began writing computer books; his
first book, Running a Perfect BBS, was published in 1994.
Along with writing several books a year and editing whatever his publishers
throw at him, Mark has recently branched out into Web-based education,
designing and teaching a number of online classes — called WebClinics — for
Hewlett-Packard.
Mark’s rapidly expanding list of books includes Building a PC For Dummies,
Scanners For Dummies, CD and DVD Recording For Dummies, PCs All-in-One
Desk Reference For Dummies, Microsoft Office v. X Power User’s Guide, BURN
IT! Creating Your Own Great DVDs and CDs, The Hewlett-Packard Official Printer
Handbook, The Hewlett-Packard Official Recordable CD Handbook, The Hewlett-
Packard Official Digital Photography Handbook, Computer Gamer’s Bible,
Recordable CD Bible, Teach Yourself the iMac Visually, Running a Perfect BBS,
Official Netscape Guide to Web Animation, and the Windows 98 Troubleshooting
and Optimizing Little Black Book.
His books have been translated into 12 different languages so far — his
favorites are German, Polish, Dutch, and French. Although he can’t read
them, he enjoys the pictures a great deal.
Mark welcomes all comments and questions about his books. You can reach

Dedication
This book is dedicated to my oldest daughter, Erin Chambers — 
“Version 1.0” — with all the love and happiness I can give her.
— Mark Chambers
Author’s Acknowledgments
It’s high time I express my heartfelt thanks to everyone who helped produce
the book you’re holding!
Copious thanks are due (again) to the technical editor, Greg Willmore, who
checked each and every word of this Desk Reference for technical accuracy . . .
and that, my friends, is no easy job, especially when you consider that
Panther was in beta during the development of this book! I was very lucky to
have the help of such a knowledgeable technical editor. Mondo kudos also to
Teresa Artman for her outstanding work as copy editor.
A book of this size places a huge burden on the publisher’s Composition
Services team because those folks have to design over 700 pages and then
prepare both the copy and the high-resolution figures. Again, as in the past,
the work they’ve done is wonderful, and I appreciate the hard work of every-
one on the Composition Services team.
As with all my books, I’d like to thank my wife, Anne, and my children, Erin,
Chelsea, and Rose, for their support and love — and for letting me follow my
dream!
Finally, I turn to the two people at Wiley who made this book possible: Bob
Woerner, the acquisitions editor whom I’ve been lucky enough to know for
several years now; and Linda Morris, the project editor who seems to be
“rewarded” with all my longest titles (and yet keeps her sense of humor).
Their talents and ongoing assistance made this project a joy instead of a job
as they gave me all the support that every author craves. Many, many thanks
to you both from a very grateful Mac owner!

Mac OS X Panther All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies

Introduction
E
legant.
I remember the first moment that I moved a mouse across a Mac OS X
Desktop — at that time, it was the beta of version 10.0 — and I very well
remember the word elegant as my first impression. (My second impression
was UNIX done better.)
That’s really saying something because I’m an old operating system cur-
mudgeon: I cut my computing teeth on Atari, Commodore 64, and TRS-80
Model III machines, and I still feel much at home in the character-based
environment of DOS and UNIX. Of course, I’ve also used every version of
Windows that His Gateness has produced, including the much-improved
Windows XP. And yes, I’ve used Mac OS since before the days of System 7,
using a Macintosh SE with a 9-inch monitor (and a built-in handle).
But out of this host of operating systems, could you really call one elegant
before now? (Even Mac OS 9 didn’t deserve such a description, although it
did provide the foundation of convenience and simplicity.) Mac OS X — now
at version 10.3, affectionately called Panther — is something different: It’s a
fine-cut diamond amongst a handful of semi-precious stones. It’s the result
of an unnatural marriage, I’ll admit . . . the intuitive, graphical world of Mac
OS 9 and the character-based stability and efficient multitasking of UNIX.
Who would have thought that they would work together so well? Mac OS X
performs like a Ferrari, and (unbelievably) it looks as good, too.
Therefore, you can imagine just how excited I was to be asked by my friends
at Wiley to write this book and how I immediately jumped at the chance to
write a comprehensive guide to Apple’s masterpiece. The book that you
hold in your hands is a classic For Dummies design — it provides you the
step-by-step instruction on every major feature of Mac OS X, plenty of which
my editors agree is humorous — but it also goes a step further from time to
time, delving into why something works the way that it does or what’s going
on behind the scenes. You can chalk that up to my sincere admiration for
everyone in Cupertino and what they’ve perfected.
What you won’t find in this Desk Reference is wasted space. All the new fea-
tures of version 10.3 are here, including iChat AV, Exposé, the new Font
Book, the latest versions of all the iApps (like iTunes 4), FileVault, and the
new incarnations of the Finder and Apple Mail. Everything’s explained from
the ground up, just in case you’ve never touched an Apple computer before.

What’s Really Required
2
By the time you reach the final pages, you’ll have covered advanced topics
such as networking, AppleScript, Internet security . . . and yes, even an
introduction to the powerful world of UNIX that exists underneath.
I sincerely hope that you’ll enjoy this book and that it will act as your guide
while you discover all the wonderful features of Mac OS X Panther that I use
every day. Remember, if a Windows-enslaved acquaintance still titters about
your iMac, I’ll understand if you’re tempted to drop this weighty tome on his
foot.
The official name of the latest version is (portentous pause here, please)
Mac OS X version 10.3 Panther. But who wants to spit out that mouthful
every time? Throughout this book, I refer to the operating system as Mac
OS X, and when I discuss something that’s particular to the latest version, 
I call it Panther. Okay with you?
What’s Really Required
If you’ve got a Mac that’s either running Mac OS X version 10.3 (Panther) or
is ready to be upgraded to it, you’re set to go. Despite what you might have
heard, you won’t require any of the following:
✦A degree in computer science: Apple designed Mac OS X for regular
people, and I designed this book for people of every experience level.
Even if you’ve never used a Mac before, you’ll find no hostile waters
here.
✦A fortune in software: I do describe additional software that you can
buy to expand the functionality of your Mac; however, that section is
only a few pages long. Everything else covered in this book is included
with Mac OS X Panther — and by the size of this volume, you get a
rough idea of just how complete Mac OS X is! Heck, many folks buy
Macs just because of the free software like iTunes and iPhoto. (Tough
cookies to the vast Unwashed Windows Horde.)
✦An Internet connection: Granted, you’re not going to do much with
Apple Mail without an Internet connection, but computers did exist
before the Internet. You can still be productive with Mac OS X without
receiving buckets of spam.
Oh, you will need a set of Mac OS X version 10.3 installation discs, unless it
came pre-installed on your Mac. Go figure.

Conventions Used in This Book

About This Book
Although this book is a Desk Reference, you can also read it in a linear fash-
ion (straight-through) — probably not in one session, mind you. (Then
again, Diet Coke is cheap, so it is possible.) The material is divided into
seven mini-books, each of which covers an entire area of Mac OS X knowl-
edge. For example, you’ll find mini-books on networking, the Apple Digital
Hub suite of applications, customizing your Desktop, and Internet-related
applications.
Each self-contained chapter discusses a specific feature, application, con-
nection, or cool thing about Mac OS X. Feel free to begin reading anywhere
or skip chapters at will. For example, if you’re already using an Internet con-
nection, you won’t need the chapter on adding an Internet connection.
However, I recommend that you read this book from the front to the back,
like any good mystery novel. (Watch out, oncoming spoiler: For those that
want to know right now, Bill Gates did it.)
Conventions Used in This Book
Even For Dummies books have to get technical from time to time, usually
involving commands that you have to type and menu items that you have to
click. If you’ve read any of my other For Dummies books, you’ll know that a
helpful set of conventions is used to indicate what needs to be done or what
you see onscreen.
Stuff you type
When I ask you to type a command or enter something in a text field (like
your name or phone number), the text appears like this: Type me.
Press the Return key to process the command or enter the text.
Menu commands
When I give you a specific set of menu commands to use, they appear in the
following format: Edit➪Copy.
In this example, you should click the Edit menu and then choose the Copy
menu item.

Display messages
If I mention a specific message that you see on your screen, it looks like this
on the page: This is a message displayed by an application.
In case you’re curious about computers
No one expects a book in the For Dummies series to contain techno-jargon
or ridiculous computer science semantics — especially a book about the
Macintosh, which has always strived for simplicity and user-friendliness. 
I hereby promise that I’ll do my absolute best to avoid unnecessary techno-
talk. For those who are interested in what’s happening under the hood, 
I provide sidebars that explain a little more about what’s doing what to
whom. If you’d rather just have fun and ignore the digital dirty work, please
feel free to disregard these additions (but don’t tear sidebars out of the
book because there’s likely to be important stuff on the opposite side of
the page).
How This Book Is Organized
I’ve done my best to emulate the elegant design of Mac OS X by organizing
this book into seven mini-books, with cross-references where appropriate.
Book I: Introducing Mac OS X
This mini-book begins with an invigorating chapter explaining exactly why
you should be so happy to be a Mac OS X owner. Then I provide an introduc-
tion to the basic tasks that you’ll perform — things like copying files, run-
ning programs, and the like. Because Sherlock 3 and the Address Book are
such important elements of Mac OS X, I also cover them in this mini-book.
You’ll also find coverage of Classic mode, a guide to normal Mac OS X main-
tenance and troubleshooting, and instructions on using the Mac OS X Help
system.
Book II: Customizing and Sharing
Who wants to stick with the defaults? The material in this mini-book leads
you through the steps that you need to customize Mac OS X to your specific
needs and desires . . . everything from a tweak to your background or screen
saver to a description of how to set up and administer multiple accounts
on a single Macintosh. You’ll also find coverage of the different settings that
you can change in System Preferences, which is an important place in
Mac OS X.

How This Book Is Organized
5
Book III: The Digital Hub
Sweet! This chapter jumps right in among the crown jewels of the Digital
Hub: iTunes, iPhoto, iDVD, iMovie, QuickTime, and the DVD Player. Taken as
a suite, these applications allow you to plug in and use all sorts of electronic
gadgets, including digital cameras, digital video (DV) camcorders, and MP3
players — plus, you can edit or create your own DVDs, audio CDs, and
movies.
Book IV: The Typical Internet Stuff
This mini-book contains just what it says. But then again, it’s easy to get
enthusiastic about Apple Mail, the latest version of Apple’s instant messag-
ing application (iChat AV), and the online storage provided by iDisk. I also
cover Safari, Apple’s hot-rod Web browser. Finally, you’ll discover more
about the built-in Internet firewall and how you can use it to safeguard your
Mac from Internet undesirables.
Book V: Networking in Mac OS X
Ethernet, Rendezvous, and AppleTalk are lurking in this mini-book — but 
I explain them step-by-step, in language that a normal human being can
understand. Find out how to use wireless networks like AirPort Extreme
from Apple as well as how to share an Internet connection with other com-
puters in a local network.
Book VI: Expanding Your System
Time to take things up a notch. In this mini-book, I discuss the hardware and
software that everyone’s adding to Mac OS X and why you might (or might
not) need such toys. Memory (RAM), hard drives, printers, USB, and the
newest FireWire 800 . . . they’re all discussed here in detail. Consider this a
banquet of expansion information.
Book VII: Advanced Mac OS X
I know that I told you earlier that I was going to avoid techno-talk whenever
possible, yet I also mentioned the advanced things that you’ll find in this
mini-book, like using UNIX within Mac OS X and writing basic AppleScript
scripts to automate repetitious tasks. If you don’t mind immersing yourself
in all that’s technical, read here for the skinny on hosting a Web site and
communicating with Mac OS X by using your voice and your handwriting.

Icons Used in This Book
The icons in this book are more than just attractive — they’re also impor-
tant visual cues for stuff that you don’t want to miss.
The Tip icons flag short snippets of information that will save you time or
trouble (and, in some cases, even cash).
These icons highlight optional technical information for folks like me — if
you also used to disassemble alarm clocks for fun when you were 6 years
old, you’ll love this stuff.
Always read this information next to this icon first! Something looms ahead
that could put your hardware or software at risk.
Look to the Remember icons for those tidbits that you need to file away in
your mind. Just remember to remember.
Follow these road signs for all the cool updates and innovations in Mac OS X
version 10.3 Panther.

t’s human nature to require instant gratification from your software. I’ve
seen it countless times: Someone runs a program, immediately feels com-
fortable with it, and then spends the rest of his days using that program reli-
giously. Or another person plays with the same program for 120 seconds and
dismisses it as too difficult or too confusing. It’s rather like watching a fancy
fashion show runway in Rome or Paris: There had better be eye appeal pretty
quickly, or the bucks won’t flow.
Ditto for modern computer operating systems. An operating system is the
basic software that determines the look and feel of your entire computer
and usually extends to the programs that you run as well. Microsoft recently
felt the pinch of an old-fashioned operating system — Windows 98 and
Windows Me were starting to appear rather plain-looking — and promptly
released Windows XP, where menus fade in and out like fireflies on a
summer night, little puppies help you find files, and animation abounds. To
be honest, however, updating a PC by upgrading to Windows XP is a little
like putting on a polyester sports coat over the same tired old T-shirt and
jeans — most of what changes is on the outside.
Apple doesn’t work that way. Sure, Mac OS X looks doggone good . . . forget
the minimum requirement of shirt and shoes — this operating system is
wearing an Armani suit. What’s really exciting for Macintosh owners around
the world, however, is the heart that beats beneath the pretty form. Mac 
OS X is quite literally an operating system revolution, delivering some of the
most advanced features available on any personal computer in use today
while remaining as easy to use as the first Macintosh. (And yes, I do own
and use both PCs and Macs — what’s important to me is which computer
does the job the fastest in the easiest manner.)

Convince Me: Why Mac OS X?

Now, I’m not going to just haul off and proclaim that Mac OS X can run rings
around — well . . . you know, the W word — without solid proof. In this
chapter, I introduce you to the advantages of Mac OS X and why it’s such a
step ahead for those running Mac OS 9. I also cover the hardware require-
ments that you’ll need to run Mac OS X version 10.3 (Panther) as well as
guidelines on upgrading from Mac OS 9. Finally, I familiarize you with the
steps that you’ll encounter the first time that you fire up the Big X.
Convince Me: Why Mac OS X?
Apple pioneered the graphical approach to computing with the appearance
of the first Macintosh, so you’d expect Mac OS X to be simple to use — and
indeed it is. For many folks, that’s Job One. If you’re one of those people,
you can happily skip this section without need of further evidence because
Mac OS X is undoubtedly the easiest operating system on the planet to use.
(And believe me, I’m not knocking simplicity. Computers are supposed to be
getting easier to use, and techno-nerds like me are supposed to be rendered
unnecessary as computers advance.) Here is the mantra of the Mac — and
the first of Mark’s Maxims for this volume:
One Mouse, One Button, One King.™
Still with me? Need more testimony? Or perhaps you’re just curious about
the engine under the hood. Then read on — and if you’re a Macintosh
owner, feel free to gloat! (If you’re a PC owner, there’s always eBay.)
Pretty to behold
Let me illustrate with a screenshot or two: Figure 1-1 illustrates a typical
screen from a day spent in Mac OS 9.2, the capable — albeit rather old-
fashioned — version of the Mac OS operating system that shipped in the
days before Mac OS X.
Compare that screen with a similar screen from the latest version of the
Big X, as shown in Figure 1-2. As you can see, everything’s streamlined in
appearance, with maximum efficiency in mind. Tasteful 3-D abounds, from
the drop-shadowed windows to the liquid-look scroll bars. Icons look like
miniature works of art. Macintosh owners appreciate outstanding design —
and can recognize the value of a great computer, even if it is lime-green
(or looks like half of a white basketball). After all, many Mac owners are pro-
fessionals in the graphic arts, and Apple provides the hardware that they
need — like the top-of-the-line liquid crystal display (LCD) used with the 17-
inch, flat-panel iMac or the killer performance of the latest Power Mac G5.

Take a look at what’s going on behind the curtain — the Great Oz is actually
pretty busy back there.
The allure of Aqua
The Apple software developers who introduced us to Mac OS X designed
this new look from the ground up. They call it Aqua, and it’s the new stan-
dard user interface.
Whoops, I just realized that I slipped a ten-cent example of techno-babble
into that previous paragraph. Let me explain: A user interface design deter-
mines how things look throughout both the operating system itself and all
applications that are written to run under an operating system (OS). This
includes the buttons that you push, the controls that you click or move, and
even the appearance of the windows and menus themselves. For example, if
you’ve already begun to use Mac OS X, you’ve probably stopped right in the
middle of a task and exclaimed to yourself, “Why, Self, look at that cool 3-D
striping effect on that menu bar!” Those stripes are a tiny part of the Aqua
user interface design.
Aqua also extends to the placement of controls and how they’re shown to
you. For example:
✦Mac OS X uses Aqua sheets (which are attached to their parent dialogs
and windows) to prompt you for input, like confirming when you’re
about to close a document without saving it. Unlike Windows, multiple
programs can have multiple sheets open, so you can continue to work
in other applications without being rudely forced to answer the query
immediately.
✦Aqua’s new file selection controls, like the one in Figure 1-3, make it
much easier to quickly navigate to a specific file or folder from within an 
application.
✦The Dock is another Aqua addition, replacing some of the functions of
the old Control Strip and the Launcher from Mac OS 9. The Dock
launches your favorite applications, indicates what’s running on your
Mac, and allows you to switch between those programs — and all in a
strip that you can relocate and customize at will. I talk about the Dock
in greater detail later in Book II, Chapter 2.
Consider Aqua the look-and-feel of Mac OS X and virtually all applications
that it runs; you’ll discover how to use these Aqua controls in the pages
to come. Of course, Mac owners really don’t have to worry about Aqua
itself; the Aqua guidelines are a roadmap for those writing applications for
Mac OS X. Programs written to the common Aqua interface standard will be
easier for you to use, and you’ll become a proficient power user of that pro-
gram much faster.

The quality of Quartz
The second ingredient in the visual feast that is Mac OS X is named Quartz
Extreme — again, I must ask your forgiveness, good reader, because I have
to get a tad technical again. Quartz Extreme is a graphics engine: It’s the por-
tion of Mac OS X that draws what you see on the screen (in the Aqua inter-
face, natch). Think of the engine in your car, which is responsible for making
your car move. Whether your Mac is running Microsoft Word or simply
idling at the Desktop waiting for you to finish your soda, Quartz Extreme is
at work displaying icons, drawing shapes, exhibiting the Finder, and animat-
ing things in the Dock.
What sets Quartz Extreme apart from the ho-hum graphics engine that
Windows uses? It’s all about international programming standards . . . you
know, those things that Microsoft would much rather that you forget. To wit:
✦PDF: The Quartz Extreme engine is built around the Acrobat Portable
Document Format (PDF for short) developed by Adobe. If you’ve been
spending any time at all on the Internet in the last two or three years,

you know that PDF files have emerged as the standard for displaying
and printing the highest-quality electronic documents. Plus, Adobe has
released a version of the free Acrobat reader (www.adobe.com) for just
about every computer on this green Earth. This means that text and
graphics displayed in Quartz Extreme are razor sharp, resizable, and
easily portable from one computer to another. In fact, Mac OS X dis-
plays PDF files without even requiring Acrobat, using the built-in
Preview application. Figure 1-4 shows a complex PDF document that
I opened in Mac OS X.
✦OpenGL: Gamers will get really excited about this one: Quartz Extreme
also uses the OpenGL graphics acceleration standard, which delivers
the fastest 3-D graphics on the planet. (Think photo-realistic, high-
resolution graphics drawn in the blink of an eye.) In fact — and this
is a really cool trick — if you have an advanced 3-D card, OpenGL is
even used to produce the Desktop in Mac OS X Panther.
In English, that means that today’s top-of-the-line, 3-D gaming and 3-D
graphics acceleration can take care of drawing everything; forget about
waiting for windows to close or menus to appear, even when you’re cre-
ating the world’s biggest honking spreadsheet or building a presenta-
tion the size of Baltimore. As the Chairman of the Board would say,
“We’re talkin’ fast, baby, like a rocket ship to the moon!”

Stable, stable, stable
“So it’s elegant in design. That’s great, Mark, but what if Mac OS X crashes?
Aqua and Quartz Extreme aren’t worth a plug nickel if my mouse doesn’t
move and I lose my document!” Believe me, I couldn’t agree more; I make my
living from computers, and every time that a misbehaving program locks up
one of my machines, I throw a tantrum that would make Godzilla back off.
Lockups shouldn’t be tolerated in this day and age . . . and, unfortunately,
Mac OS 9 crashed almost as often as Windows 98.
Luckily, the folks who designed Mac OS X were just as interested in produc-
ing a rock-solid operating system as they were in designing an attractive
look. (Think of Tom Cruise’s face on The Rock’s body.)
Mac OS X is as hard to crash as the legendary UNIX operating system —
that’s right, the same reliable workhorse that techno-wizards around the
Don’t forget QuickTime!
If you’ve recorded or edited digital video (DV),
you’re probably already familiar with Apple’s
QuickTime .mov format. QuickTime movies are
high-resolution, relatively small in size, and
easily created with iMovie, which I discuss later
in Book III, Chapter 4. Although QuickTime isn’t
“on stage” all the time like Aqua or Quartz
Extreme, it’s still an important part of Mac OS X:
Every time that you display a video clip that
you’ve recorded or watch a streaming TV
broadcast from a Web site, you use QuickTime.
(Note, however, that you don’t use QuickTime to
watch DVD movies — that job is reserved for
the Apple DVD Player.)
QuickTime is actually not a new Mac OS X fea-
ture — it’s been around since the days of Mac
OS 8 — but the latest version of Mac OS X
includes the free QuickTime 6.3 Player (shown
in the figure here), which provides support for
the latest broadcast and Web video. In fact, you
can set up your own TV station on the Web with
the tools included in the Professional QuickTime
package.

world use to power the Internet, where stability is all-important. In fact, Mac
OS X is actually built on top of a UNIX base. It’s just well hidden underneath,
allowing you and me to focus on our programs and click with a mouse with-
out learning any of those obscure, arcane keyboard commands. You get the
benefits of UNIX without a pair of suspenders, a pocket protector, or the
hassle of growing a beard. (Not to mention years of computer programming
experience.)
Apple calls this UNIX foundation at the heart of Mac OS X by another nifty
title: Darwin. I could tell you that Darwin provides the latest in memory and
CPU management, but if you’re a normal human being, your eyes will glaze
over. Suffice it to say that Darwin makes the best use of your computer’s
memory (RAM) and your computer’s brain (CPU). Rest assured that your
Web server will stay up even if your misbehaving Virtual Birdcalling simula-
tion decides to run amok. (Emus running amok . . . how dreadful.)
Yes, yet another standard is at work here — uh-oh, Overlord Gates is truly
angry now! For those who do have a beard and are curious about such
things, Darwin uses a FreeBSD kernel, so it also inherits all the protocol
standards that have made UNIX the foundation of today’s Internet. You can
find more about FreeBSD at www.freebsd.org. Because Mac OS X is devel-
oped as an open source project, software engineers outside of Apple can
actually contribute ideas and code, just like UNIX continues to evolve over
time. (And yes, you’ll even discover how to access the UNIX command
prompt from Mac OS X later in Book VII, Chapter 1!)
To get an idea of just how well-armored Mac OS X is, consider Figure 1-5:
Note that one program, which I call Titanic 1.0, has locked up like San
Quentin. Under Mac OS 9, your only chance at recovering anything would
involve divine intervention. However, in Mac OS X, AppleWorks is unaffected
because it has a completely protected area of system memory to play in.
Hint: I show you how to force Titanic 1.0 to go away a little later in Book I,
Chapter 3.

By the way, Darwin makes it easy for UNIX software developers to quickly
and easily port (or modify) all sorts of UNIX applications to work under
Mac OS X. I think that you’ll agree that a wider selection of applications is
a good thing.
Multitasking and multithreading 
for normal human beings
And now, for your entertainment, a short one-act play. (Yes, really.)
A Shakespearean Moment of Multitasking and Multithreading
Our play opens with Julius Caesar shaking his head in disgust at his Mac OS 9
Desktop.
Caesar: Anon, I am only one mortal, yet my Desktop doth abound with
portals to applications of all different mien. Tell me, foul beast, why thy
spirit seems slow and sluggish, and my Excel spreadsheet doth crawl on
its belly!
[Enter Romeo, a cocky and rather brash young Apple software developer.]
Romeo: Dude, the problem is, like, your operating system. Y’see, older
versions of Mac OS ended up constantly, like, shifting your computer’s
attention from one app to another — Excel has to cooperate with every-
thing else that’s running in the background, like a good little corporate
boy. It’s less efficient and very, very ’90s. Upgrade to Mac OS X, and you
get pre-emptive multitasking — the app you’re actually using, like, gets
the lion’s share of the processing time, and everything runs smoother
when you need it. That’s the way UNIX works.
Caesar: Verily, your strange tongue doth annoy me. Guards, behead
him — then obtain for me this Mac OS X.
Romeo: I’m outta here — I’ve got a hot date — but don’t forget, like,
Mac OS X also uses multithreaded processing, so your Mac can handle
different operating system tasks at the same time. It’s kind of like your
computer can both walk and chew gum at the same time: fast, fast, fast!
[Exit Romeo — rather swiftly — stage right.]
Fin
As the play closes, we can only hope that Romeo is fast as well. (I told you it
was a short play.)

The definition of Internet-savvy
Remember the classic iMac advertisements that touted the one-plug
approach to the Internet? That entire campaign was centered on one idea:
that the Internet was supposed to be easy to use. The folks at Microsoft sat
up and took notice when the iMac proved so incredibly successful, and
Windows XP actually reduced some of the overwhelming folderol that you
had to encounter just to connect to the Internet — but Mac OS X still wipes
the floor with XP when it comes to easy and complete Internet connectivity.
For example:
✦Easy configuration: Mac OS X sets up your entire Internet connection
with a simple wizard of four screens. As long as you’ve got the right
information handy (which your Internet service provider [ISP] should
supply), it’s a snap to set up.
✦iDisk: What if I told you that for a reasonable yearly subscription fee,
Apple can provide you with a chunk of Internet-accessible, private hard
drive space — and that you can access this hard drive space from any-
where on Earth with an Internet connection? Absolutely, unbelievably,
massively cool. This neat trick is called iDisk, and I cover it later in
detail in Book IV, Chapter 4.
✦All the Internet behind-the-scenes stuff: The Internet is basically built
on a number of protocols (read that as rules for exchanging all sorts of
data) — and, as I mention earlier, UNIX machines dominate the Internet.
Ergo, adding Mac OS X to your Macintosh also provides you with sup-
port for just about every Internet protocol on the planet. Even if you
don’t know them by name or write your own software, the applications
that you buy can use them.
✦A gaggle of great Internet applications: Mac OS X ships with all sorts
of Internet magic built-in. For example, there’s Sherlock 3 — a super-
charged search program that also acts as a doorway to information
channels, which I discuss in Book I, Chapter 4. You also get instant
Internet and local network communication with iChat AV (which I cover
in Book IV, Chapter 3), and Apple Mail, a standard-issue battle-ready
e-mail program (which I discuss in Book IV, Chapter 2). Yup, it’s all free.
✦And Apache, sweet Apache: Friends, as a Webmaster myself, I can tell
you that I was visibly moved — well, at least exceptionally excited —
when I learned that Mac OS X included the industry-standard Apache
Web server, which runs over half of the sites on the Web! (Yep, that
includes www.apple.com.) Get all the details in Book VII, Chapter 4.
Lots of free goodies
You don’t just get Internet applications when you latch your fingers onto a
box o’ Mac OS X — you can start doing all sorts of neat stuff without invest-
ing one extra dollar in more software!

Remember, what you receive along with Mac OS X depends on whether
you’re buying a boxed copy, upgrading from an older version of Mac OS, or
receiving the Big X already installed on a new Macintosh. With that in mind,
check out the possibilities.
✦This is the iLife: This suite of easy-to-use integrated programs is practi-
cally as well known as the Macintosh itself these days: iDVD, iPhoto,
iTunes, and iMovie. Each of these stellar programs is covered in full in
Book III. If you’ve got a digital camera, an MP3 player, or a DV cam-
corder, you’re going to be a very happy individual. I promise.
✦AppleWorks: If you’ve bought a new Macintosh with Mac OS X pre-
installed, you’ve also received AppleWorks (Apple’s answer to Microsoft
Office). Good stuff, indeed. If you don’t want to spend the bucks on
Office v. X and you don’t need the complex gewgaws and baroque archi-
tecture of Word and Excel, I can guarantee you that AppleWorks is pow-
erful enough to satisfy your office yearnings.
✦The obligatory games: Apple couldn’t have picked two games that are
a better match: the finger-exercising arcade shoot-’em-up challenge of
Deimos Rising and the immersive 3-D fun of Otto Matic. Because this
book this isn’t a game guide, I leave you to explore these two programs
at your leisure.
Naturally, there are others that I haven’t mentioned here — in fact, bundled
programs like Quicken 2004 Deluxe have entire For Dummies books devoted
to them — but that gives you a taste of what’s included.
It even runs the old stuff
Convinced yet? Before I go, I should mention one more outstanding feature
of Mac OS X that will undoubtedly please dyed-in-the-wool Mac users: The
Big X can run virtually all software written for older versions of Mac OS 8
and 9! (It’s rather like Windows XP running Windows 98 programs without
the hassle and the deluge of error messages.) The good folks at Cupertino
are sharp enough to ensure that you can run legacy software if necessary.
In the world of Mac OS X, these applications are called Classic programs. To
run a Classic application, Mac OS X actually launches a virtual Mac OS 9 ses-
sion, as you can see in Figure 1-6. You can set Classic to run automatically
whenever you turn on your Mac, or Mac OS X can launch it whenever neces-
sary, thus saving the system resources for native Mac OS X applications
until you really need Classic. Because I work almost exclusively in Mac OS X
now, I’ve chosen the latter. Face it: This is just downright cool. (For more on
Classic, see Book I, Chapter 7.)

What Do I Really Need to Run the Big X?
20
If you’re a new Mac owner, you can promptly forget about this feature —
everything you’ll be buying and using from now on will likely be written for
the Big X (unless you suddenly stumble upon a gem of a program from a few
years back). Oh, and you can also boot cleanly into Mac OS 9 whenever you
like . . . usually just for a nostalgic whim, and then you’ll reboot right back
into Mac OS X.
What Do I Really Need to Run the Big X?
I’ve written four other For Dummies books, and I always find the “Hardware
Requirements” section a hard one to write. Why? Well, I know what Apple
claims as the minimum hardware requirements necessary to run Mac OS X.
But, on the other hand, I know what I would consider the minimum hard-
ware requirements, and they’re substantially different. Oh well, let me list
the bare bones, and then I’ll give you my take on what you really need. (Of
course, if Mac OS X is already pre-installed on your computer, feel free to
tear out this page and create a handful of celebratory confetti.)

Upgrading from Earlier Versions of Mac OS
21
From The World According to Jobs, the minimum requirements are
✦Hardware: You’ll need any Mac with a G3, G4, or G5 processor — except
for older PowerBook G3 portables without Universal Serial Bus (USB)
ports, and the older beige G3 tower Macs, neither of which are sup-
ported in Mac OS X. Other than those exceptions, this means that just
about any iMac, eMac, iBook, Power Mac G3, Power Mac G4, or Power
Mac G5 is eligible to play. I should also mention that Mac OS X doesn’t
support third-party CPU upgrade cards out of the box.
✦RAM: You’ll need at least 128MB of memory (RAM). At today’s low
prices, that’s like buying a pizza.
✦Hard drive territory: Although svelte by Windows standards, Mac OS X
still needs about 2GB of free space on your hard drive.
From The World According to Chambers, the minimum requirements are
✦Hardware: I recommend at least a 600 MHz G3. Remember, this is my
take on what you’ll need to really take advantage of Mac OS X, and I
have to say that I don’t think it performs well enough on older, slower
G3 computers. Any G4 is well suited to run Mac OS X . . . and, of course,
if your Mac is lucky enough to sport a G5 processor, it can use Mac OS X
to run rings around a pokey Pentium 4 PC.
✦RAM: Don’t settle for anything less than 256MB. Again, with memory as
cheap as it is these days, this is like adding extra cheese to that pizza.
Any techno-nerd worth the title will tell you that the single most impor-
tant key to performance in today’s operating systems is RAM — yep, it’s
actually more effective than a faster processor! Therefore, if you’ve got
any extra spending cash in between your sofa cushions, spend it on
RAM. (Up to an earth-shaking 8 gigabytes of RAM on the latest Power
Mac G5 racehorses!)
✦Hard drive territory: I’d recommend 3GB free.
Upgrading from Earlier Versions of Mac OS
Because the installation of Mac OS is as simple as loading a CD-ROM and
double-clicking an icon, there’s not much to tell. What’s important is the
steps that you should take care of before you start the installation. I cover
those in the next section. Pay heed, or pay later. I won’t go into detail about
the actual installation because there really aren’t any details to speak of —
you’ll answer a question or two, and then hop up to get another cup of
coffee or another caffeine-laden soda while the installer does the rest.
Would anyone expect any different from Apple?

Upgrading from Earlier Versions of Mac OS
22
Back up — PLEASE back up
I know you’re anxious to join the In crowd, and Apple makes the upgrade
process as non-invasive and as safe as possible, but SNAFUs like power loss
and hard drive failures do happen. With a full backup of your system on CD
or DVD (or even to an external hard drive), you can rest assured that you’ll
get your precious files and folders back in pristine shape if tragedy strikes.
To be honest, you need to back up your system on a regular basis anyway.
Promise me now that you’ll back up your system, won’t you?
I recommend a good commercial back-up program like Retrospect Backup
from Dantz Development Corporation (www.dantz.com), as shown in 
Figure 1-7 — version 5.1 even supports both Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X, so you
can use it both before and after the upgrade!

Before you upgrade, I recommend using the Mac OS 9 Disk First Aid utility
(see Figure 1-8) one last time — upgrading a disk with errors will take longer.
You’ll find Disk First Aid in the Utility folder.

Pet Peeve Number 1 . . .
The round object that you load into your
CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive is a disc, not a disk,
like your hard drive or that flimsy floppy. Anyone
who pretends to talk oh-so-knowingly about a
CD-ROM disk or DVD disk is a dweeb, and you
should steer as far away from that dweeb as
possible in the future.

Shaking Hands with
Mac OS X
Upgrading from Earlier Versions of Mac OS
23
On the plus side, Mac OS X comes with its own disk check-up program,
called Disk Utility, which I cover later in the book in Book I, Chapter 6. Ain’t
technology grand?
Plug it, Road Warrior
You’re on the road with your iBook, and you’ve just bought your copy of
Mac OS X. You’re thinking of installing your brand-spanking new operating
system. . . . Stop! NOW.
Before you decide to upgrade your Mac notebook, consider what will
happen if that magical vessel containing all your files should flicker and. . . .
No, on second thought, don’t even visualize it. (Even if the battery is fully
charged.) If you’re installing a Mac OS X upgrade on a PowerBook or iBook,
make sure that it’s plugged in and receiving its share of good, clean AC
power from a handy, nearby wall socket. The installation process may take
an hour, and there’ll be constant hard drive and CD-ROM activity — think
“Attack of the Energy Draining Installation from Planet Lithium.” You don’t
want to try this while your notebook is operating on battery power.
Heck, a techno-purist would probably recommend that you attach your
Macintosh to an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) for the installation
process, but I’m not quite that paranoid about power outages.
If you can’t install Mac OS X with your current start-up hard drive, restart
your Mac and hold down the C key during the boot sequence. This forces
your Macintosh to use the disc as your start-up volume — in this case, the
Mac OS X Install disc — which should allow you to launch the install pro-
gram without any headaches.

Personalizing the Big X
24
Keep one thing in mind while installing Mac OS X: If you format the destination
drive — the drive where you’ll be installing Mac OS X — you’ll lose everything
that it stored. No big surprise there, and the installation program will warn
you profusely about this beforehand. There’s really no reason to do so unless
you just crave a clean installation (which is an installation of a new operating
system on a newly-formatted drive, compared with an upgrade of your exist-
ing Mac OS System files). Oh, and don’t forget to use Mac OS Extended format.
Personalizing the Big X
After the installation has completed and you’ve rebooted the beast, stand
back and watch those beautiful rounded edges and liquid colors appear. But
wait — you’re not quite done yet! Mac OS X needs to be personalized for you,
just like your toothbrush or your SUV’s six-way power seat; therefore, use
what I call the First Use Wizard steps the first time that you boot Mac OS X.
These wizard screens change periodically — and they’re completely self-
explanatory — so I won’t march you through each one step by step.
However, here are a few tips that will provide a bit of additional over-the-
shoulder help while you’re setting things up.
✦How rude! If you’re outside the United States or other English-speaking
countries, you should know that Mac OS X hides “foreign” country
names and keyboard layouts. Rest assured, though, because Mac OS X
does indeed provide full support for other languages and keyboard con-
figurations. To display these options in the list boxes, click the Show All
button at the bottom of the wizard screen.
✦Accounts are important. When Mac OS X asks you to create your
account, don’t forget your password — oh, and they’re case-sensitive,
too, so THIS is different from this or ThiS. It’s a good idea to enter a pass-
word hint, but don’t make that hint too easy to guess. For example, My
first dog’s name is probably preferable to Plays Frasier on TV. Mac OS X
will use the name and password that you enter to create your account,
which you’ll use to log in if you set up a multi-user system for several
people. (More on this later in Book II, Chapter 4.) Never write down
your passwords, either; such crib sheets work just as well for others
as for you.
✦I need to fix that. You can click the Back button at any time to return
to previous wizard screens. Mac OS X, being the bright child that it is,
automatically saves your choices for you, so when you click Continue
to return, everything is as you left it.

✦Extra stuff. Whether you decide to accept the news, offers, and related-
product information from Apple is your decision. However, it’s only
right that I point out that you can find this same information on the
Apple Web site, so there’s no need to engorge your e-mail Inbox unless
you so desire. (In other words, I turned this off.)
✦Local area network (LAN) connections. If you’re connecting your Mac
to a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network
(or you’re using an Internet router that uses Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol [DHCP]), it’s a good idea to click Yes when you’re asked whether
you should use the configuration supplied by the existing server.
DHCP automatically provides the computers on the network with all the
settings that they need to connect. If that sounds like ancient Sumerian,
find out more in Book V, Chapter 1.
✦Do create your .Mac account! Apple’s .Mac service just plain rocks —
especially the iDisk storage that you receive. Again, more on this in
Book IV, Chapter 4, but take my word for it. Join up, trooper. (The trial
subscription is free, and it’s easy to upgrade to a full membership if you
decide that you like the .Mac benefits.)
✦Have your Mail settings handy. If you set up your trial .Mac account,
you can set up an @mac.com address without any bother — again, this is
a good thing. However, if you’re setting up an existing account, make
sure you have all those silly settings and numbers and names that your
ISP supplied you with when you signed up. This stuff includes your
e-mail address, mail server variety, user account ID, password, and out-
going mail server.

A
s the folks in Cupertino will tell you, “It’s all about the graphics.” They’re
right, of course — Mac OS X is a highly visual operating system, and
using it without a mouse is like building Hoover Dam with a pocketknife. (And
not a particularly sharp pocketknife, either.) Therefore, most of this chapter
will require you to firmly grasp the little rodent — I introduce you to little
graphical bits like icons and menus, and you discover how to open windows
that can display anything from the contents of a document to the contents of
your hard drive.
On the other hand, any true Macintosh power user will tell you that the key-
board is still a useful piece of hardware. Because I want you to be a bona
fide, well-rounded Mac OS X power user, I also demonstrate those key com-
binations that can save you time, effort, and possible tennis elbow from all
that mouse-wrangling.
Finally, I lead you through the basic training that you’ll need to run your pro-
grams: how to start them, how to open and save documents, and how to
quit an application as gracefully as Fred Astaire on his best day.

Restarting, Sleeping, and Shutting Down
28
Restarting, Sleeping, and Shutting Down
First things first. As the guy on the rocket sled probably yelled, “This is neat,
but how do you stop it?” Call ’em The Big Three — Sleep, Restart, and Shut
Down are the Mac OS X commands that you use when you need to take care
of other business. All three appear on the friendly Apple menu at the top-left
corner of your Desktop (as shown in friendly Figure 2-1).
Each of these options produces a different reaction from your Mac:
✦Sleep: There’s no need for a glass of water or a bedtime story when you
put Mac OS X to Sleep, which is a power-saving mode that allows you to
quickly return to your work later. (“Waking up” from Sleep mode is
much faster than booting or restarting your computer, and it can con-
serve battery power on laptops.) Depending on the settings that you’ve
chosen in System Preferences — which I discuss in Book II, Chapter 3 —
your Mac can power-down the monitor and spin-down the hard drives
to save wear and tear on your hardware. You can set Mac OS X to auto-
matically enter Sleep mode after a certain amount of inactivity. To
awaken your slumbering supercomputer, just click the mouse or press
any key on the keyboard. PowerBook and iBook owners might be able to
wake their machines by simply opening the computer.
✦Restart: Use Restart if your Mac has suddenly decided to work “outside
of the box” and begins acting strangely — for instance, if your Universal
Serial Bus (USB) ports suddenly lock up or your FireWire drive no
longer responds. Naturally, you’ll need to save any work that’s open.
You also elect to restart Mac OS X when you switch start-up volumes.
(Many applications and Apple software updates require a restart after
you’ve installed them.)
✦Shut Down: When you’re ready to return to the humdrum, real world
and you’re done with your Mac for the time being, use the Shut Down
option. Well-behaved Mac applications will automatically prompt you to
save any changes that you’ve made to open documents before the com-
puter actually turns itself off. If you’ve configured your Mac with multiple
accounts, you can shut down Mac OS X from the login screen as well.
Besides the Apple menu command, many Macs have a Power key on the
keyboard that you can press to display the dialog that you see in Figure 2-2.
If you change your mind and decide to tie up loose ends before you leave,
click the Cancel button to return to Mac OS X.

A Window Is Much More Than a Frame

A Window Is Much More Than a Frame
“And in the beginning, there was the window.” Like older Mac operating sys-
tems, most of what you’ll do in Mac OS X occurs within these fancy rectan-
gular frames. And, as you might imagine, a number of controls are at your
disposal that you can use to control the size, shape, and appearance of
these potent portals. In this section, I’ll — well, to be blunt, I’ll do windows.
(No squeegee jokes, if you please.)
Opening and closing windows
Windows are generally opened automatically. Usually, a window gets opened
by an application (when you first run it or it needs to display a document)
or by Mac OS X itself (when the Finder opens a window to display the con-
tents of your hard drive). The Finder, by the way, is the application that Mac
OS X runs to display the operating system’s menus and windows.
Some programs even let you open new windows on the fly: For example,
Figure 2-3 illustrates a window in its purest form: a new Finder window. To
display this window on your own Mac, choose File➪New Finder Window or
press Ô+N. From here, you can reach any file on your Mac or even venture
onto the Internet.
Actually, we’re not finished just yet. . . .
I should probably also mention the other guys:
the Log Out command (which you can find
under the Apple menu) and the User Switch
menu (at the right side of the Finder menu).
 Choose Log Out when you’re running your
Mac with multiple users and you want to
completely pass control over to another
person — all your programs will quit,
and the other person can take over by log-
ging in with their account. Mac OS X will
reconfigure itself with the other user’s 
preferences.
 If you’ve enabled Fast User Switching (new
to Panther), another user can log in from the
User Switch menu. However, your applica-
tions do not quit, you don’t have to formally
log out, and you can take control back
when the other user is finished. (Hence the
words Fast and Switching in the name.) To
turn on this feature, display the Accounts
panel in System Preferences, click Login
Options, and then select the Enable Fast
User Switching check box.

The Command key has an Apple (Ú) and a rather strange-looking symbol
(Ô) on it that I often call the Spirograph.
When you’re finished with a document or you no longer need a window
open, you can close it to free that space on your Desktop. To close a window
in Mac OS X, move your mouse pointer over the Close button; it’s the red cir-
cular button at the top-left corner of the window, as shown in Figure 2-3. An
X appears on the button when you’re in the zone. When the X appears, just
click the mouse. (By the way, if you’ve been living the life of a hermit in a
cave for the last decade or so, pressing the mouse button is called clicking
the mouse. In the Apple universe, a standard mouse has only one button.)
Most Mac applications don’t want you closing a window willy-nilly if you’ve
changed the contents without saving them. For example, try to close a docu-
ment window in Word or AppleWorks without saving the file first. The pro-
gram will ask you for confirmation before it closes the window containing
your Great American Novel. Most programs also have a Close command on
their File menu.
To close all windows that are displayed by a particular program, hold down
the Option key while you click the Close button on one of the windows.
Whoosh! They’re all gone.

Scrolling windows
Often there’s more stuff in a document or more files on your hard drive than
you can see in the space available for a window. Guess that means it’s time
to delete stuff. No, no, just joking! You don’t have to take such drastic meas-
ures to see more in a window.
Just use the scroll bars that you see in Figure 2-4 to move through the con-
tents of the window. You can click on the scroll bar and drag it — for the unini-
tiated, that means clicking on the bar and holding down the mouse button
while you move the mouse in the desired direction. Alternatively, you can
click in the empty area above or below the bar to scroll pages one at a time.
Depending on the type of application that you’re using, you might be able to
scroll a window with your arrow keys as well — or perhaps use the Page Up
and Page Down keys to move through a window.
Minimizing and restoring windows
The multitalented Figure 2-4 also displays another control that you can use
with a window: the Minimize button. When you minimize a window, you
eliminate it from your Desktop and store it safely in the Dock — that strip of
Figure 2-4:

icons that appears along the bottom (or the side) of your Mac OS X Desktop.
In fact, a minimized window appears as a miniature icon in the Dock, so you
can actually keep an eye on it (so to speak). Figure 2-5 illustrates a mini-
mized window from Safari, which is actually displaying my Web site at
www.mlcbooks.com. To minimize a window, move your mouse pointer over
the yellow Minimize button at the top-left corner of the window — a minus
sign appears on the button — and then click.
You’re gonna love this “Easter Egg” hidden in Mac OS X — if you hold down
the Shift key whilst you minimize, the window shrinks in cool slow motion.
(Who says operating systems have to be totally serious, anyway?)
When you’re ready to display the window again on your Desktop — a process
called restoring the window — simply click the thumbnail icon representing
the window in the Dock, and Mac OS X automagically returns it to its former
size and location.
By the way, some — note that I said some — applications will continue to
run when minimized, while others will simply stop or pause until you return
them to the Desktop. Such is the crazy world we live in.

Zooming windows
Zooming windows has a kind of Flash Gordon sound to it, don’t you think?
It’s nothing quite that exciting — no red tights or laser guns — still, when
you’re trying to view a larger portion of a document, zooming is a good
thing because it expands the window to the maximum practical size for the
application that you’re using. In some cases, zooming a window fills the
entire screen; at other times, the extra space would be wasted, so Mac OS X
only zooms the window to a larger portion of the Desktop. In fact, the Zoom
button can even be disabled by an application that doesn’t want you to
muck about with the window; for example, I own a game or two that don’t
allow zooming.
To zoom a window, move your mouse pointer over the green Zoom button
at the top-left corner of the window. Again, Figure 2-4 struts its stuff and
illustrates the position. (Man, that is one versatile figure.) A plus sign
appears on the Zoom button. Click to expand your horizons.
After you’ve finished with a zoomed window, you can return it to its previ-
ous dimensions by clicking the Zoom button again.
Toggling toolbars
If you’re wondering what that little lozenge-shaped button is at the right
corner of many Mac OS X application windows, I won’t leave you in sus-
pense: It toggles the display of the window’s toolbar on and off. A toolbar is
a strip of icons that appears across the top of a window that you can click to
perform common commands, like changing the display format or printing
the current document. (The toolbar in Figure 2-4, for example, features icons
to move Back and Forward, among others.) You’ll encounter more toolbar
technology throughout the book.
Moving windows
Unlike the rather permanent windows in your home, you can pick up a
window and cart it to another portion of the Desktop — typically, this is
done when you’re using more than one application at a time and you need
to see the contents of multiple windows. To grab a window and make off
with it, click the window’s title bar — the strip at the top of the window that
usually bears a document or application name — and drag the window to
the new location. Then release the mouse button to plant it firmly in the
new location.
By the way, most applications allow you to arrange multiple windows in a
graceful swoop with a single click on a menu. Click the Window menu and
choose Arrange All to perform this magic.

I talk about Exposé later in the section, “Switching ’Twixt Programs with
Aplomb.” This new feature helps you organize a large number of open win-
dows on your Desktop. You can use it to display all open application windows
so that you can pick the one you want . . . or even display all the windows
opened by a specific application.
Resizing windows
Next, consider how to change the width or height of your window. To
change the dimensions of a window to your exact specifications, move your
mouse pointer over the lower-right corner of the window (which is usually
marked with a number of slashed lines to indicate its status as a control),
click, and drag until the window is the size that you prefer.
Switching windows
Before I move to other graphical wonders of Mac OS X, it’s important that
you master how to switch between windows on your Desktop. First, remem-
ber this old Norwegian saying (or is it one of Mark’s Maxims?):
Only one can be active at once.™
What our Oslo friends are communicating is that only one window can be
active at any time. The active window appears on top of other windows, and
it’s the one that you can edit by typing or by moving your mouse. (It also
sports Close, Minimize, and Zoom buttons in color.) Other windows that you
have open might be minimized, as I describe earlier in “Minimizing and restor-
ing windows,” or they can be inactive (mere ghosts of themselves) and remain
on your Desktop. Mac OS X dims inactive windows so that you can tell they’re
hanging around . . . but you can’t use them at the moment. Figure 2-6 illus-
trates a number of open windows, with the iPhoto window active.
I know you’re going to get tired of hearing me say this, but here I go again:
Certain applications will continue to run while their windows are inactive,
like File Transfer Protocol (FTP) clients and such. Most programs, however,
stop or pause until you make their window active.
And how do you switch to — activate — a different window in Mac OS X?
Again, Exposé allows you to activate another window, but if the window is
currently visible, you can simply click on any part of that window. I generally
click the window’s title bar if it’s visible, but any part of the inactive window
will do. The window that you click leaps like a proud stallion to the fore, and
the previously active window now skulks in the background.

Menu Mysteries Explained
36
You can still use a window’s Close, Minimize, and Zoom buttons even when
it’s inactive.
Menu Mysteries Explained
Next, I move on to menu control in Mac OS X. Menus are handy drop-down
controls that allow you to select commands that are grouped together logi-
cally. For example, an application’s File menu will usually allow you to create
or open a document, save a document to disk, or quit the program. To pull
down a menu, click the desired menu group name on the bar at the top of
the screen and then click the desired menu option from the extended menu.
Figure 2-7 illustrates the Safari menu: Note the submenus designated by right-
arrow icons. When you move your mouse pointer over a submenu command,
you get another set of even more specific menu commands — in this case,
the Services submenu command displays commands like Mail and Grab.
Some applications allow you to create your own custom menus; naturally,
configuring a new menu system takes some time to learn, but imagine the
productivity gains that you’ll enjoy! For example, my menus in Microsoft
Word v. X feature only the commands that I use often — they’re sleeker and
easier to navigate. (However, you have to stop short of claiming that you

wrote the application — I already checked with Microsoft. They got down-
right snippy about it.)
Mac OS X also provides another type of menu: contextual. The contextual
menu appears when you hold down the Control key and click certain items
on the screen, revealing commands that relate specifically to that item.
(Unfortunately, the items that sport contextual menus vary from application
to application, so it’s best to check the documentation for a program before
you spend countless hours Control+clicking everything onscreen.)
Many manufacturers sell mice, trackballs, and other pointing things that
include a secondary mouse button. This is decidedly a Windows trait —
remember, both Apple and I agree that a second mouse button is mere fili-
gree — but if you have one, the device might display contextual menus
when you click the secondary button. (This is often called right-clicking
because the left mouse button is typically the primary button.) Then again,
you might launch Aunt Harriet into a geosynchronous orbit, so double-
check the manual for your pointing thing on the default button assignment
(and how to change it, if necessary).

Icons ’R Us
38
You’ll note that many commands in menus have keyboard shortcuts —
because I’ll be holding forth on this subject later in “Keyboard Shortcuts for
the True Power User,” I’ll hold off on describing them here.
Icons ’R Us
Icons are more than little pictures, they’re . . . well . . . actually, I guess
they are little pictures. However, these graphical WUDs (that’s short for
Wonderful User Devices) are really representations of the components of
your Mac OS X system, and therefore they deserve a section of their own.
For complete details on what any icon is, what it represents, and what it will
do, click the icon once to highlight it and then press Ô+I. This displays the
Info dialog that you see in Figure 2-8, which tells you what kind of icon it is,
where the item it represents is actually located, and how big it is. You’ll also
see a version number for applications — a handy way of quickly checking
what version of a program you’re running — and when the file was created
and last modified. The Info dialog also offers other settings and options that
you can display by clicking in the General drop-down list box, and I cover
them in other parts of the book.

Hardware
Mac OS X uses icons to represent the various hardware devices in your com-
puter, including your
✦Hard drive
✦CD or DVD drive
✦Printer
✦Zip drive
You get the idea. Just double-click a hardware icon to display the folders and
files that it contains, like with your hard drive and CD/DVD drive.
Generally, you’ll only encounter hardware icons on your Desktop or in Finder
windows. Figure 2-9 illustrates some of the hardware icons that live in my
system.

Programs and applications
These are the fancy icons, folks — most applications have their own custom
icons, and double-clicking one will typically whisk you on your way. Mac OS
X also includes a generic icon or two for applications that don’t include
their own custom icon. Figure 2-10 illustrates a number of my favorite pro-
gram icons from all sorts of Mac OS X applications.
Running a program in Mac OS X can be as simple as double-clicking the
application icon — more on this later in the section, “Houston, We’re Go to
Launch Programs.”
Files
Your hard drive will contain many thousands of individual files, and the Big
X tries to make it as easy as possible to visually identify which application
owns which file — therefore, most applications use a special icon to indicate
their data files. For example, Figure 2-11 illustrates several documents and
data files created by a range of applications: Microsoft Word, AppleWorks,
QuickTime, Safari, and Adobe Acrobat. Some cheeky applications even use
more than one icon to differentiate between different file types, like docu-
ments and templates in Microsoft Word.
There are also a number of generic file icons that indicate text files, includ-
ing RTF (short for rich text format) documents and PDF (Portable Document
File) documents, which use the Adobe Acrobat format.

You can open most documents and data files by double-clicking them, which
automatically launches the proper application and loads the document.
Folders
Folders have a 3-D look in Mac OS X — and, as you can see in Figure 2-12,
some applications even customize their folder icon!
To open a folder within Mac OS X, just double-click it. (Alternatively, you can
click it once to select it and then press Ô+O.) Discover more about how to
control the look of folder contents in Book II, Chapter 1.
Aliases
An alias is a strange beast — although it might look like a standard icon,
upon closer examination, you’ll notice that an alias icon sports a tiny curved
arrow at the base, and the tag alias appears at the end of the icon name.
Figure 2-13 has roped in a variety of aliases for your enjoyment, along with
one or two actual icons for comparison.

Essentially, an alias is a link to something else on your system. For example,
a Photoshop alias can run Photoshop just like the actual program icon, but
it only takes up a scant few bytes on your hard drive. (If you’re a Switcher
who’s just crossed over from the Windows Wilderness, think shortcut —
Windows shortcuts work in a similar manner.) The alias file is just big
enough to hold the location of the actual file or folder, allowing it to yell at
Mac OS X: “Hey, the Human actually wants you to run this or open that thing
over there!”
Aliases come in handy for a number of reasons:
✦They allow you to launch applications and open files and folders
from anywhere in your system. For example, you might want an alias
icon in your MP3 folder that runs Roxio Toast so that you can launch
Toast and burn an audio CD without laboriously navigating to the Roxio
folder, which could be nested in goodness-knows-how-many layers of
subfolders.
✦They can be easily deleted when no longer needed without wreaking
havoc on the original application, file, or folder. If you decide that
you’d rather use iTunes to burn audio CDs, you can simply delete the
Toast alias without trashing Toast itself.
✦Their tiny size allows you to add multiple aliases (and mucho conven-
ience) for a single application without gulping down hard drive space.
You might be wondering, “Why use aliases when I can just copy the actual
application, file, or folder to the desired spot?” Well, indeed you can do that.
However, the application might not work in its new location because you
didn’t copy any of the supporting files that most applications need to run.
(An alias actually runs the original application or opens the original file or
folder, so things should work just as if you double-clicked the original icon.)
Additionally, remember that copying applications willy-nilly throughout
your hard drive will eat up territory like a horde of angry vikings.
If you dislike the alias hanging off the end of the icon name, feel free to
rename it (as I show you in the next chapter). The alias will continue to
function nicely no matter what moniker you give it. (If you create an alias by
holding down Ô+Option whilst dragging the original icon to a new location,
the alias name won’t include the alias appendage.)
If the original file no longer exists, an alias naturally no longer works, either.
However, Mac OS X is sharp enough to automatically “fix” an alias if you
rename or move the original file, pointing it to the new location. Slick!

Selecting Icons for Fun and Profit
44
Selecting Icons for Fun and Profit
You’ll often find yourself performing different actions on one icon — or a
number of icons at one time. For example, you can copy or move files from
one location on your hard drive to another or delete a group of files that you
no longer need. (The idea of drag-and-drop file management using icons
originated on the Macintosh, but I’ll wait until the next chapter to describe
these operations in detail.) For now, focus on the basics of selecting one or
more icons, which specifies which files and folders that you want to use for
whatever you’re going to do next.
Selecting a single icon
First, here are the various ways that you can select a single icon for an
impending action:
✦Place your mouse pointer over the file and click once. Mac OS X dark-
ens the icon to indicate that it’s selected — a mysterious process called
highlighting.
✦Type the first few letters of the icon’s name. After you type enough
characters to identify the icon uniquely (whether it be one or a dozen),
Mac OS X highlights the icon that matches the text string.
✦If an icon in a window is already highlighted, you can move the high-
light to the next icon across by pressing the right-arrow key. Likewise,
the other three directional arrow keys move the highlight in the other
directions. To move through the icons alphabetically, press Tab to go
forward and Shift+Tab to go backward.
Selecting multiple icons
To select a gaggle of icons for an action, use one of these methods:
✦If the icons are next to each other, click and drag within the window
(and not directly on a specific item) to highlight them all. While you
drag, Mac OS X displays a selection box, and any icons within that box
will be highlighted when you release the mouse button (as shown in
Figure 2-14). Think “lasso,” and you’ll get the picture.
✦You can also select multiple adjacent icons by clicking the first item to
highlight it and then holding down the Shift key while clicking the last
icon in the series that you want to select.
✦If the icons are not next to each other, you can hold down the Ô key
while you click on each item that you want to select.
Selecting an icon doesn’t launch or do anything . . . you’re just marking your
territory.

Keyboard Shortcuts for the True Power User
Virtually all Mac OS X applications have their own keyboard shortcuts — a
ten-cent term for a key combination that performs the same operation as a
menu command or a toolbar button. Although the mouse might seem the
easier path when controlling your Mac, it’s not always the fastest — those
hardy souls who venture to learn common keyboard shortcuts can zip
through a spreadsheet or warp through a complex outline at speeds that no
mere rodent-wrangler could ever hope to attain.
With that in mind — and with the goal of “pumping you up” into a power
user — I hereby present the most common keyboard shortcuts for the Big X
in Table 2-1. I’ve also sprinkled other keyboard shortcuts liberally through
the book when I discuss other applications, but these combinations are the
classics that appear virtually everywhere.

down the first two keys simultaneously and press the third key. Common
“strange” key symbols that you’ll see in both the Finder and most applica-
tions are shown in Table 2-2.

The next stop on your introductory tour of Mac OS X is the launch pad for

ally do something with your Mac as well.

✦Navigating to the corresponding application folder — by either clicking
or double-clicking drive and folder icons — and double-clicking the
application icon.
✦Double-clicking a document or data file that’s owned by the application.
For example, double-clicking an MP3 audio file will run iTunes.
✦Double-clicking an alias that you’ve created for the application. (Get the
skinny on aliases in the earlier section, “Aliases.” I’ll wait.)
✦Clicking the application’s icon in the Dock (more on adding items to the
Dock in Book II, Chapter 2).
✦Selecting the application icon and pressing the Ô+O keyboard shortcut.
✦Adding the application to your Startup items list. (I cover this in more
detail later in Book II, Chapter 3.)
Running applications from a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM
After you load a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM, you can display its contents by
double-clicking the disc icon that appears on your Desktop. A Finder
window opens and shows the files that reside on the disc (see Figure 2-15).

After you locate the application you want to run on the disc, you can launch
it by double-clicking it or selecting it and pressing Ô+O.
Switching ’Twixt Programs with Aplomb
You might think that juggling multiple applications will lead to confusion,
fatigue, and dry mouth, but luckily Mac OS X makes it easy to jump between
programs that are running on your Mac. Use any of these methods to jump
from open application to application:
✦Press Ô+Tab. If you’ve got a dozen windows open, this can get a bit
tedious, which leads us to one of Panther’s sassiest new features,
brazenly named Exposé and shown in Figure 2-16. (Am I stretching
things a bit? You say that technology doesn’t compare to the glamour
of Hollywood? Then take in a Steve Jobs keynote address at the yearly
MacWorld convention!) You can specify which keys you want to use to
control Exposé within System Preferences.
✦Press F9 to show all open application windows using Exposé; then
click the one that you want. Figure 2-16 illustrates the tiled window dis-
play on my Mac after I press F9. Your cursor changes into the traditional
(and so very elegant) gloved hand. Move the cursor on top of the
window that you want to activate — the window turns blue when it’s
selected — and click once to switch to that window.
✦Press F10 to show all open windows from the application that you’re
currently using; then click the one that you want to activate. This
Exposé function is great for choosing from all the images that you’ve
opened in Photoshop or all the Safari Web pages littering your Desktop!
✦Click anywhere in the desired application window to make it the
active window.
✦Click the application icon in the Dock. All applications that are running
have an icon in the Dock, and the icon will have an up-arrow beneath it
to indicate that the application is open.
Along with the window switch, an astute observer will notice that the appli-
cation menu bar will also change to match the now-active application.
Besides the F9 and F10 hot keys that I just discussed, Exposé provides one
more nifty function: Press F11, and all your open windows scurry to the side
of the screen, as shown in Figure 2-17. (Much like a herd of zebras if you
dropped a lioness in the middle.) Now you can work with drives, files, and
aliases on your Desktop — and when you’re ready to confront those dozen
application windows again, just press F11 a second time.

Opening and Saving Your Stuff in an Application
50
Opening and Saving Your Stuff in an Application
Almost all Mac OS X applications open and save documents in the same
way, whether you’re typing a quick letter to your mom with AppleWorks or
expressing your artistic side with Painter. Therefore, I’m going to take a
moment to outline the common procedures for opening and saving docu-
ments. Believe me, you will perform these two rituals dozens of times a
week, so no nodding off.
Opening a document
First, the simple way to load a document: Double-click that document in a
Finder window, and . . . well, that’s it. (This is my preferred method because
I’m an ALT — short for Admitted Lazy Techno-wizard — who would rather
use complex hand movements to pour myself another Diet Coke.)
To open a document the hard way — from inside an application — here’s
the plan:
1. Choose File➪Open or press that handy Ô+O key combination.
Your Mac OS X program is likely to display the attractive Open dialog
that you see in Figure 2-18.
2. Navigate to the location of the document that you want to open.
The drop-down list allows you to jump directly to common locations —
such as the Desktop, your Home folder, and your iDisk — as well as
places that you’ve recently accessed (Recent Places).
If the target folder isn’t in your drop-down list, move the slider at the
bottom of the dialog to the far left to display your hard drives,
CD-ROM/DVD drives, and network locations.
3. Click the habitat where the file will be found.
You’ll note that the right column(s) will change to show you the con-
tents of the item that you just clicked. In this way, you can cruise
through successive folders to find that elusive document. (This some-
what time-consuming process is somewhat derisively called drilling —
hence, the importance of using Recent Items, or dragging files, loca-
tions, and applications into the column at the left of the Finder.)
4. When you sight the document that you want to load, either double-
click it or click once to highlight the filename and then click Open.
“Hey, the Open dialog can be resized!” That’s right, good buddy — you can
expand the Open dialog to show more columns and find things more easily.
Click and drag the bottom-right corner of the Open dialog to resize it.

Book I
Chapter 2
Navigating and
Running Programs
Opening and Saving Your Stuff in an Application
51
Saving a document
To save a document, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Save.
If you’ve previously saved this document, your application should
immediately overwrite the existing document with the new copy, and
you get to return to work . . . end of story. If you haven’t previously
saved this document, the program will display a Save dialog that’s usu-
ally very similar to the Open dialog; it generally has a few more options,
however, so stay frosty.
2. Navigate to the location where you’d like to save the document and
then type a filename.
Often, you can use a default name that’s already provided by the thought-
ful folks who developed the software. Note that you might be given the
chance to save the document in several different formats. For example,
Figure 2-19 illustrates the AppleWorks Save dialog; you can click the File
Format drop-down list to choose other formats, such as RTF, HyperText
Markup Language (HTML), and even bargain-basement text.
Figure 2-18:
The soon-
to-be-quite-
familiar
Open dialog.

Quitting Programs
52
3. Click Save (or OK, depending on the application).
If an application offers a Save As menu option in the File menu, you can in
effect copy the document by saving a new version of the document under
another name. Save As comes in particularly handy when you want to retain
the original version of a document.
Quitting Programs
If I had a twisted and warped sense of humor, I’d simply tell you to quit
applications by pulling your Mac’s power cord from the wall socket.
(Luckily, I don’t.) There are, however, more sane ways to exit a program —
use one of these methods instead:
✦Press the Ô+Q keyboard shortcut.
✦Choose File➪Quit.
✦Click the Close button on the application window — note, however, that
this doesn’t always completely close down the application. For example,
Safari stays running even if you close the browser window.

fter you master basic Mac spell-casting — things like selecting items,
using menus, opening and saving documents, working with windows,
and launching an application or two — it’s time to delve deeper into Mac OS
X. (Can you tell I’m a Dungeons & Dragons old-timer?)
In this chapter, I discuss file management, showing you the hidden power
behind the friendly Apple menu. I also discuss some of the more advanced
menu commands, how to print within most applications, and how to listen
to an audio CD on your Mac. (It makes a doggone good stereo.) Finally, I
introduce you to the built-in CD/DVD recording features within the Big X.
The Finder: It’s the Wind beneath Your Wings
So what exactly is the Finder anyway? It’s a rather nebulous term, but in
essence, the Finder gives Mac OS X the basic functions that you’ll use for
the procedures that I outline in this chapter. This UberOS has been around
in one guise or another since the days of System 6 — the creaking old days
when a Mac was an all-in-one, tote-able computer with a built-in screen.
Come to think of it, some things never change.

The Finder: It’s the Wind beneath Your Wings
54
The Finder is always running, so it’s always available — and you can always
switch to it, even when several other applications are open and chugging
away. Figure 3-1 illustrates the Dock with the rather perspective-crazy
Finder icon at the far left side.
Is that icon supposed to be one face or two faces? I’m still confused, and I’ve
been using the Mac now since 1991.
Don’t forget that Mac OS X gives you a second method of doing everything I
cover in this chapter: You can use Terminal to uncover the UNIX core of Mac
OS X, employing your blazing typing speed to take care of things from the
command line. Of course, that’s not the focus of this book, but for those
who want to boldly go where no Mac operating system has ever gone
before, you’ll find more in Book VII, Chapter 1. Despite what you might have
been led to believe, power and amazing speed are to be found in character-
based computing.

Copying and Moving Files and Folders
55
Copying and Moving Files and Folders
Here’s where drag-and-drop makes things about as easy as computing
can get:
✦To copy a file or folder from one window to another location on the
same drive: Hold down the Option key and click and drag the icon from
its current home to the new location. (Note: You can drop files and fold-
ers on top of other folders, which puts the copy inside that folder.) If
you’re copying multiple items, select them first (read how in Book I,
Chapter 2) and then drag and drop the entire crew.
“Is the Desktop a valid target location for a file or folder?” You’re darn
tootin’! I recommend, though, that you avoid cluttering up your Desktop
with more than a handful of files — instead, create a folder or two on
your Desktop and then store those items within those folders. If you
work with the contents of a specific folder often, drag it into the column
at the left side of any Finder window, and you can open that folder from
the Finder with a single click — no matter where you are!
✦To copy items from one window to a location on another drive: Click
and drag the icon from the window to a window displaying the contents
of the target drive. Or, in the spirit of drag-and-drop, you can simply
drag the items to the drive icon, which places them in the root folder
of that drive.
✦To move items from one window to another location on the same
drive: Simply drag the icon to the new location, whether it be a window
or a folder.
Mac OS X provides you with a number of visual cues to let you know what’s
being copied or moved. For example, dragging one or more items displays a
ghost image of the items (check out Figure 3-2), and when you’ve positioned
the mouse pointer over the target, Mac OS X highlights that location to let
you know that you’re in the zone. If you’re moving or copying items into
another Finder window, the window border is highlighted to let you know
that Mac OS X understands the game plan.
In case you move the wrong thing or you port it to the wrong location, press
Ô+Z to undo the previous action.
If the item that you’re dragging already exists in the target location, you get
a confirmation dialog like the one you see in Figure 3-3. You can choose to
replace the file, leave the existing file alone, or stop the entire shooting
match.

Cloning Your Items — It’s Happening Now!
56
Cloning Your Items — It’s Happening Now!
No need for sci-fi equipment or billions in cash — you can create an exact
duplicate of any item within the same folder. (This is often handy when you
need a simple backup of the same file in the same folder or when you’re
going to edit a document but you want to keep the original intact.)

Deleting That Which Should Not Be
57
Click the item to select it, and then choose Finder➪File➪Duplicate. To dis-
tinguish the duplicate from the original, Mac OS X adds the word copy to the
end of the duplicate’s icon name; additional copies have a number added to
the name as well.
Alternatively, aficionados of the keyboard can hold down the Option key
and drag the original item to another spot in the same window — when you
release the button, the duplicate appears.
Heck, if you prefer the Control key, you can hold it down while clicking the
item, and then choose Duplicate from the contextual menu that appears.
Decisions, decisions. . . .
Oh, and don’t forget that Action button (it looks like a little gear with a
downward-pointing arrow) on the Finder toolbar (refer to Figure 3-1) —
you could also click it and choose Duplicate from the drop-down list.
When you duplicate a folder, Mac OS X automatically duplicates all the con-
tents of the folder as well. Remember that this could take some time if the
folder contains a large number of small files (or a small number of large
files). Groucho would’ve loved computers!
Deleting That Which Should Not Be
Even Leonardo da Vinci made the occasional design mistake — his trash can
was likely full of bunched-up pieces of parchment. Luckily, no trees will be
wasted when you decide to toss your unneeded files and folders; this sec-
tion shows you how to delete items from your system.
By the way, as you’ll soon witness for yourself, moving items to the Trash
doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re immediately history.
Dragging unruly files against their will
In Mac OS X, the familiar Macintosh Trash can has been moved to the right
edge of the Dock — in fact, it’s now a spiffy-looking wire can instead of the
old clunker that the Mac faithful remember. You can click and drag the items
that you’ve selected to the Trash and drop them on top of the wire can icon
to delete them. When the Trash contains at least one item, the wire can icon
changes to appear as if it were full of trash.
You can also add a Delete icon to your Finder toolbar — for all the details,
see Book II, Chapter 1.

Emptying That Wastepaper Basket
58
Deleting with the menus and the keyboard
The mouse isn’t absolutely necessary when deleting items. Your other
options for scrapping selected files include
✦Choosing File from the Finder menu and choosing the Move to Trash
menu item
✦Pressing the Ô+Delete keyboard shortcut
✦Clicking the Action button on the Finder toolbar and selecting Move to
Trash from the drop-down list
✦Holding down Control while clicking the item to display the contextual
menu and then choosing Move to Trash from that menu
Emptying That Wastepaper Basket
As I mention earlier, moving items to the Trash doesn’t actually delete them
immediately from your system — believe me, this fail-safe measure comes in
handy when you’ve been banging away at the keyboard for several hours
and you stop paying close attention to what you’re doing. (I usually also
blame lack of Diet Coke.) More on how to rescue files from the Trash in the
next section.
Like any folder, you can check the contents of the Trash by clicking the
Trash icon in the Dock.
After you double-check the Trash contents and you are indeed absolutely
sure you want to delete its contents, use one of the following methods to
nuke the digital Bit Bucket:
✦Choose Finder from the Finder menu and choose the Empty Trash
menu item.
✦Choose Finder from the Finder menu and choose Secure Empty Trash.
Believe it or not, if you use the standard Empty Trash command, you
haven’t completely zapped that refuse! Some third-party hard drive repair
and recovery programs will allow an uncool person to restore items from
the Trash. Use the new Secure Empty Trash method for those sensitive
files and folders that you want to immediately and irrevocably delete —
the data is overwritten with random characters, making it impossible to
recover. (A great idea for that Mac you want to sell on eBay, no?)
✦Press the Ô+Shift+Delete keyboard shortcut.
✦Click the Trash icon in the Dock, hold down the mouse button, and
choose Empty Trash from the menu that appears.

Housekeeping
Renaming Your Items
59
✦Hold down Control while clicking the Trash icon in the Dock and
then choose Empty Trash from the contextual menu that appears.
Depending on the method that you select and the settings that you choose
in System Preferences (which I cover in Book II, Chapter 3), Mac OS X might
present you with a confirmation dialog to make sure that you actually want
the Trash emptied.
WAIT! I Need That After All!
In the adrenaline-inducing event that you need to rescue something that
shouldn’t have ended up in the scrap pile, first click the Trash icon in the
Dock to display the contents of the Trash. Then rescue the items that you
want to save by dragging them to the Desktop or a folder on your hard
drive. (This is roughly analogous to rescuing your old baseball glove from
the family garage sale.)
Feel free to gloat — if someone else is nearby, ask her to pat you on the back
and call you a lifesaver.
Renaming Your Items
You wouldn’t get far in today’s spacious virtual world without being able to
change a moniker for a file or folder. To rename an item in Mac OS X, use
one of these two methods:
✦With the mouse: Click once on an icon’s name (or just press Return).
Mac OS X highlights the text in an edit box — type the new name and
then press Return when you’re done.
You want to wait a few seconds between clicks, as opposed to a rapid-
fire double-click.
✦From the Info dialog: Select the item and press Ô+I to display the Info
dialog; then click the triangle next to Name & Extension to display the
field that you see in Figure 3-4. Click in the name field, drag the mouse
to highlight the text that you want to change, and type the replacement
text.
Naturally, the first method is the easiest, and it’s the one that I use most
often.

Adding a Dash of Color
60
Adding a Dash of Color
The release of Panther also heralds the return of a popular feature from the
days of Mac OS 9 that had fallen by the wayside: the ability to color-code
files and folders to help you organize and recognize your data in a hurry. For
example, why not assign the green label color to the files and folders that
make up your current project? Or, if you need to mark a file for immediate
attention, assign it the red label color.
To assign a label color to selected files and folders, you have three options:
✦Click the Action button on the Finder toolbar and then click the desired
color.
✦Hold down Control while you click on the selection and then choose the
color from the pop-up menu.
✦Click File and choose that perfect shade from the menu.
Displaying the Facts on Files and Folders
Speaking of the Finder’s Info dialog, it’s the place to view the specifics on
any highlighted item (including drives and aliases). Select an item and press
Ô+I, click the Action toolbar button and select Get Info from the list, or click
the Finder’s File menu and choose Get Info (see the results in Figure 3-5). If
you select more than one item, the Info dialog combines as many properties
as possible to give you a summary.

Displaying the Facts on Files and Folders
61
Mac OS X displays the General information panel when you first open the
Info dialog, but other panels are usually available (depending on the type
of selected items). To display the other panels, click the panel that you want
to see.
For most types of files and folders, the Info dialog can tell you
✦Kind: What type of item it is — for example, whether it’s a file, folder,
drive, or alias — and what program automatically launches when you
open the selected item
✦Size: The total size of the item (or items) that you select
✦Where: The actual path on your hard drive where the item is located
✦Dates: The date when the item was created and was last modified
✦Version: The application version number
✦Permission: The privileges that control who can do what to the file —
more on this later in Book II, Chapter 6 — and whether a file is locked in
read-only mode
Some of this information you can change, and some can only be displayed.
To banish the Info dialog from your Desktop, click the dialog’s Close button.
For the rest of this section, I describe a number of tasks that you can accom-
plish from the Info dialog.

Adding comments
Mac OS X provides you with a comment field where you can add additional
text that’s stored along with the file. I use this feature to record the version
number of manuscript chapters and programs that I create during the
course of writing books.
To add a comment, follow these steps:
1. Display the Info dialog for the item by pressing Ô+I or choosing
File➪Get Info.
2. Click in the Comments box and type the comment text.
If you need to expand the Comments section of the Info dialog, click the
triangle next to the Comments heading — the arrow rotates and the
Comments box appears.
3. Close the Info dialog to save the comment.
Displaying extensions
Extensions are alien creatures to most Mac owners — however, these three- or
four-character add-ons that follow a period at the end of a filename have been
a mainstay in the DOS, Windows, and UNIX environments for years. An exten-
sion identifies what program owns a specific file, and therefore which applica-
tion launches automatically when you double-click that file’s icon. Examples
of common extensions (and the applications that own them) include
Hey, Martha Stewart — Make stationery 
with Mac OS X!
If you use a specific document over and over as
a basis for different revisions, you can enable
the Stationery Pad check box on the General
information panel to use the file as stationery.
Opening a stationery file automatically creates
a new, untitled version of the file in the linked
application; this can save you steps compared
with duplicating the file or using the Save As
procedure that I show you in Book I, Chapter 2.
Here’s an example: Suppose that you save a
blank shipping invoice in AppleWorks because
you have to create and print a new invoice for
everything that you buy for your company —
but you don’t need to keep a separate copy on
your hard drive of each invoice that you handle.
You can simplify everything by creating a blank
invoice document file and then turning that doc-
ument file into stationery. Now all you need to
do is double-click the file, make your changes,
print, and then close AppleWorks without
saving anything. Neat!

Why would someone want to see a file’s extension? It comes in handy when
a number of different types of files are linked to the same application — for
example, if you install Adobe Photoshop, both JPEG and TIFF images have
the same icon, so you can’t tell one from the other. With extensions dis-
played, it’s easy to tell what type of file you’re looking at.
Follow this procedure to hide or display extensions with your filenames:
1. Display the Info dialog for the item by pressing Ô+I or choosing
File➪Get Info.
2. If you need to expand the Name & Extension section of the Info
dialog, click the triangle next to the Name & Extension heading.
3. To display the extension for the selected file, clear the Hide Extension
check box to disable it.
4. Close the Info dialog to save your changes.
Choosing the application to launch with a file
So what’s the plan if the wrong application launches when you double-click
a file? Not a problem: You can also change the linked application from the
Info dialog as well. (I told you this was a handy toy box, didn’t I?) Follow
these steps to choose another application to pair with a selected file:
1. Click the Action button on the Finder toolbar and click Show Info to
display the Info dialog for the item.
2. Click the triangle next to the Open With heading, which expands to
show the information that you see in Figure 3-6.
3. Click the drop-down list button, and Mac OS X displays the applica-
tions that it feels are best suited to open this type of document.
4. Select the application that should open the file.

Displaying the Facts on Files and Folders

To go completely hog-wild and choose a different application, select
Other from the drop-down list. Mac OS X opens a Choose Other
Application dialog where you can navigate to and select the program
you want. After you highlight the application, click Add.
5. To globally update all the documents of the same type to launch the
application that you chose, click the Change All button.
Mac OS X displays a confirmation dialog asking whether you’re sure
about making this drastic change. Click Continue to update the other
files of the same type or click Cancel to return to the Info dialog.
6. Close the Info dialog to save your changes.
Locking files against evildoers
“Holy Item Insurance, Batman!” That’s right, Boy Wonder: Before I leave the
friendly land of the Info dialog, every Mac owner needs to learn how to pro-
tect files and folders from accidental deletion or editing. By locking a file,
you allow it to be opened and copied — but not changed, renamed, or sent
to the Trash. Locked items appear in the Finder with a small padlock
attached to the icon.

To lock or unlock a file, you have to have ownership of the file — I cover
privileges in Book II, but on a Mac where you’ve configured only one admin-
istrator account, you should already have ownership. Follow this procedure:
1. Display the Info dialog for the item.
2. Select the Locked check box to enable it.
The Locked check box is in the General section of the dialog.
3. Close the Info dialog to save your changes.
Creating an Alias
I mention aliases in Book 1, Chapter 2. As I discuss in that chapter, an alias
acts as a link to an application or document that actually exists elsewhere
on your system (a handy trick to use when organizing items on your hard
drive). You have a number of different ways to conjure an alias after you
select an item:
✦Choose File from the Finder menu and choose the Make Alias menu
item. (You have to move the alias yourself.)
✦Press the Ô+L keyboard shortcut. (Again, you have to move the new
alias to its new location.)
✦Click the Action button on the Finder toolbar and then click Make Alias.
✦Hold down Control while clicking the selected item and then choose
Make Alias from the contextual menu that appears.
In addition, you can hold down the Ô+Option key combination and drag the
item to the location where you want the alias.
Although Mac OS X does a great job in tracking the movements of an origi-
nal and updating an alias, some actions can break the link — for example,
if you delete the original, the alias is left wandering in search of a home.
However, all is not lost — when you double-click a broken alias, Mac OS X
offers to help you fix the alias. This involves browsing through your system
to locate a new original.
Using the Apple Menu
The Apple menu is a familiar sight to any Mac owner — although Apple con-
templated removing it during the original development and beta cycle for
Mac OS X version 10.0, the ruckus and cry from beta-testers ensured that it
remains today. It’s amazing how reassuring that little fellow can be when
you boot the Big X for the first time.

In this section, I cover the important things that are parked under the Apple
menu.
Using Recent Items
If you’re like most of us — and I think I’m safe in assuming that you are —
you tend to work on the same set of applications and files during the day.
Normally, this would be somewhat of a pain because each time you sit down
in front of the keyboard, you have to drill down through at least one layer of
folders to actually reach the stuff that you need. To make things easier on
yourself, you could create a set of aliases on your Desktop that link to those
files and applications . . . but as you move from project to project, you’d find
yourself constantly updating the aliases. As Blackbeard the Pirate was wont
to exclaim, “Arrgh!”
Ah, but Mac OS X is a right-smart operating system, and several years ago
Apple created the Recent Items menu to save you the trouble of drilling for
applications and files. Figure 3-7 illustrates the Recent Items menu from my
system — note that the menu is thoughtfully divided into both Applications
and Documents. When you open documents or launch applications, they’re
added to the list. (Accountants will revel in this First In, First Out technol-
ogy.) To launch an application or document from the Recent Items menu,
just click it.

To wipe the contents of the Recent Items menu — for example, if you’ve just
finished a project, and you want to turn over a new digital leaf — click
Recent Items and choose the Clear Menu item.
You can specify the number of recent items that will appear in the menu
from System Preferences; display the Appearance settings and click the
Applications and Documents list boxes in the Number of Recent Items field.
(More on this in Book II, Chapter 3.)
Also, remember the trick that I mention earlier: You can drag any folder into
the Location column at the left of the Finder window, adding it to that exclu-
sive club that includes your Home folder, Applications folder, and media
folders.
Playing with the Dock
You know how Air Force One acts as the mobile nerve center for the presi-
dent? And how The Chief can jet all around the world and take all his stuff
along with him? Well, the Dock is kind of like that. Sort of.
If you want your Dock to go mobile as well, click the Apple menu and
choose the Dock item to display the submenu that you see in Figure 3-8.
Here’s a rundown of the options that you’ll find:
✦Magnification: Click Turn Magnification On/Off to toggle icon magnifica-
tion when your pointer is selecting an icon from the Dock. With magnifi-
cation on, the icons in the Dock get really, really big . . . a good thing for
Mr. Magoo or those with grandiose schemes to take over the world.
Check out the rather oversized icons in Figure 3-9. (The amount of mag-
nification can be controlled from the System Preferences Dock settings,
which I explain in Book II, Chapter 3.)
✦Hiding: Click Turn Hiding On/Off to toggle the automatic hiding of the
Dock. With hiding on, the Dock disappears off the edge of the screen
until you move the mouse pointer to that edge. (This is great for those
who want to make use of as much Desktop territory as possible for their
applications.)
You can press Ô+Option+D to toggle Dock hiding on and off from the
keyboard.
✦Position: Click one of three choices (Position on Left, Bottom, or Right)
to make the Dock appear on the left, bottom, or right of the screen,
respectively.
✦Dock Preferences: Click this to display the System Preferences Dock
settings, which I explain in Book II, Chapter 3.

Bad program! Quit!
Once in a while, you’re going to encounter a stubborn application that locks
up, slows to a crawl, or gets stuck in an endless loop — although Mac OS X
is a highly advanced operating system, it can still fall prey to bad program-
ming or corrupted data.
Luckily, you can easily shut these troublemakers down from the Apple
menu. Just choose Force Quit to display the Force Quit Applications dialog
that you see in Figure 3-10. (Keyboard types can press Ô+Option+Esc.)
Select the application that you want to banish and then click the Force Quit
button; Mac OS X requests confirmation, after which you click the Force
Quit button again.
If you select Finder in the Force Quit Applications dialog, the button
changes to Relaunch — this allows you to restart the Finder, which comes in
handy if your system appears to be unstable. (This is much faster than actu-
ally restarting your Mac.)
Forcing an application to quit will also kill any open documents that you
were working with in that application, so save your work (if the program will
allow you to save anything). If you relaunch the Finder, some programs
might restart as well.
Tracking down your version
This isn’t a big deal, but if you choose About This Mac from the Apple menu,
Mac OS X displays the About This Mac dialog that you see in Figure 3-11. In
case you need to check the amount of memory or the processor in an unfamil-
iar Mac, the About This Mac dialog can display these facts in a twinkling —

however, I primarily use it to check on the Mac OS X version and build
number as well as to launch the Apple System Profiler (which I discuss in full
in Chapter 6 of this mini-book). Click the More Info button to launch the
Profiler.
Apple added a button that launches Software Update to both the About This
Mac dialog and the Apple menu . . . sheesh, they must really want you to
keep your Big X up to date, I guess.
Specifying a location
Mac OS X allows you to create multiple network locations — think of a loca-
tion as a separate configuration that you use when you connect to a differ-
ent network from a different locale. For instance, if you travel to a branch
office, you’d assign a location for your desk and a location for the remote
branch. A student might assign one location for her home network and
another for the college computer lab network.
A location saves all the specific values that you’ve entered in the System
Preferences Network settings, including IP address, AppleTalk Zones, proxy
servers, and the like. If all this means diddly squat to you, don’t worry —
I explain this in Book V, Chapter 1. For now, just remember that you can
switch between locations by choosing Location from the Apple menu, which
displays a submenu of locations that you can choose from.

Availing Yourself of Mac OS X Services
71
Availing Yourself of Mac OS X Services
In Mac OS X, Services allow you to merge information from one application
with another. To Mac old-timers, that might sound suspiciously like the
Clipboard; however, services can also include functionality from an applica-
tion, so you can create new documents or complete tasks without running
another program! Services can be used in both the Finder and Mac OS X
applications.
To illustrate, here’s a fun example:
1. Launch TextEdit (you’ll find it in your Applications folder) and type
these words: Hello from your Macintosh!
2. Highlight those words.
3. Click the TextEdit menu — don’t switch to the Finder, use the
TextEdit Application menu — and choose Services.
4. From the Services submenu, choose Speech and then choose Start
Speaking Text.
After you’ve chuckled a bit at your Mac’s accent, consider what you just
did — you ran the Speech application from within TextEdit, using the
selected words! Pretty slick, eh?
A glance at the other Services that show up from within most applications
gives you an idea of just how convenient and powerful Mac OS X Services
can be — I often use Services to take care of things like
✦Sending an e-mail message from an e-mail address in a text file,
AppleScript document, or the Address Book (via the Mail Service)
✦Capturing a screen snapshot within an application (using the Grab
Service)
✦Checking the availability of an Internet server by pinging it (using the
Network Utility Service)
Remember, you can access the Services menu from a Mac OS X application
by picking that program’s Application menu (sometimes called the named
menu). For instance, in the demonstration earlier, I use the TextEdit menu
that appears on the TextEdit menu bar. In Microsoft Word, I would click the
Word menu.

Get Thee Hence: Using the Go Menu
72
Geez, I think the computing world needs another word for menu — don’t
you?
Many third-party applications that you install under Mac OS X can add their
own commands under the Services menu, so be sure to read the documenta-
tion for a new application to see what Service functionality it adds.
Get Thee Hence: Using the Go Menu
Remember the transporter from Star Trek? Step on the little platform,
assume a brave pose, and whoosh! — you’re transported instantaneously to
another ship or (more likely) to a badly designed planet exterior built inside
a soundstage. Talk about convenience . . . that is, as long as the doggone
thing didn’t malfunction.
The Finder’s Go menu gives you the chance to play Captain Kirk: You can
jump immediately to specific spots, both within the confines of your own
system as well as external environments like your network or the Internet.
(You can leave your phaser and tricorder in your cabin.)

that you can travel to include the following:

✦Back/Forward/Enclosing Folder: I lump these three commands together
because they’re all basic navigation commands. For example, Back and
Forward operate just like they do in Safari, or your favorite Web browser.
If you’re currently inside a folder, you can return to the parent folder by
clicking Enclosing Folder.
✦Computer: This window includes your hard drives, CD and DVD drives,
and your network — the same places that appear when you open a new
Finder window with the Ô+N key shortcut.
✦Home: This window displays the home directory for the user currently
logged in.
✦Network: Did you guess this displays a window with all of your network
connections? Dead giveaway, that.
✦iDisk: This window displays the contents of your Internet iDisk storage.
(More on the coolness that is iDisk in Book IV, Chapter 4.)
✦Applications: This window includes all the applications that appear in
your Mac OS X Applications folder (a neat Just the programs, ma’am
arrangement that really comes in handy).
✦Utilities: This window displays all the utilities in your Mac OS X Utilities
folder.
✦Recent Folders: This window displays a submenu that allows you to
choose from the folders that you’ve recently opened.
You can also type the path for a specific folder (use the Go to Folder com-
mand) or connect to a specific network server (use the Connect to Server
command).
Note that most of the Go menu commands include keyboard shortcuts,
proving once again that the fingers are quicker than the mouse.
Monkeying with the Menu Bar
Ever stared at a menu bar for inspiration? Fortunately for Mac owners like
you and me, people in Cupertino are paid to do just that, and these design-
ers get the big bucks to make the Mac OS X menu bar the best that it can be.
Thus were born menu bar icons, which add useful controls in what would
otherwise be a wasted expanse of white.

Monkeying with the Menu Bar
74
Using menu bar icons
Depending on your hardware, Mac OS X might install several menu bar icons.
The Volume icon is always there by default, along with the Clock display,
which is actually an icon in disguise. Figure 3-13 illustrates these standard
icons.
Clicking the Displays menu bar icon (it looks like a monitor) allows you to
choose from the recommended resolutions and color depth settings for
your graphics card and monitor. For example, Figure 3-14 illustrates the 
recommended settings for my G4 iMac, which has an LCD monitor: I can
choose from 640 x 480, 800 x 600, or 1024 x 768 resolutions, and my display
can be set to thousands or millions of colors. Typically, it’s a good idea to
choose the highest resolution and the highest color depth. You can also
jump directly to the System Preferences Display settings by clicking
Displays Preferences.
To quickly change the audio volume level within Mac OS X, click the Volume
icon (it looks like a speaker with emanating sound waves) once to display
its slider control; then click and drag the slider to adjust the level up or
down. After you select a level by releasing the mouse button, your Mac
thoughtfully plays the default system sound to help you gauge the new
volume level.
Depending on the functionality that you’re using with Mac OS X, these other
menu bar icons might also appear:
✦Modem status: You can turn on the display of the Modem status icon
from the Internal Modem panel of the Internet Connect application,
which I discuss in Book IV, Chapter 1. Click this icon to connect to or
disconnect from the Internet by using a modem. You can open the
Internet Connect application from the menu bar icon, and the icon can
be set to show the time that you’ve been connected to the Internet as
well as the status of the connection procedure.
✦AirPort: If you’ve installed an AirPort or AirPort Extreme card in your
Mac, you can check the status of the AirPort connection; click the
AirPort icon to toggle AirPort on or off. The icon displays the relative
strength of your AirPort signal, whether you’re connected to a Base
Station or a peer-to-peer computer network, or whether AirPort is
turned off.
✦PPoE: The display of this icon is controlled from the Ethernet panel of
the Internet Connect application. Click this icon to connect to or discon-
nect from the Internet using Point-to-Point over Ethernet (PPoE), which is
a type of Internet connection offered by some digital subscriber line
(DSL) providers.

Doing timely things with the Clock
Even the Clock itself isn’t static eye candy on the Mac OS X menu bar — I
told you this was a hardworking operating system, didn’t I? Click the Clock
display to toggle the icon between the default text display and a miniature
analog clock.
You can also open the System Preferences Date & Time settings from the
icon. From within the Date & Time settings, you can choose whether the
seconds or day of the week are included, whether the separators should
flash, or whether Mac OS X should display the time in 24-hour (military)
format. More on this in Book II, Chapter 3.
Eject, Tex, Eject!
Mac OS X makes use of both static volumes (your Mac’s hard drive, which
remains mummified inside your computer’s case) and removable volumes
(like Zip disks, DVD-RAM cartridges, and CDs/DVD-ROMs). Mac OS X calls
the process of loading and unloading a removable volume by old-fashioned
terms — mounting and unmounting — but you and I call the procedure load-
ing and ejecting.
I won’t discuss loading/mounting a removable volume — the process differs
depending on the computer because some Macs need a button pushed on
Mark’s totally unnecessary Computer Trivia 1.0
“Where the heck did mounting come from,
anyway? Sounds like a line from a John Wayne
Western!” Well, pardner, the term dates back to
the heyday of Big Iron — the Mainframe Age,
when giant IBM dinosaurs populated the com-
puting world. Sherman, set the WayBack
Machine. . . .
At the time, disks were big, heavy, removable
cartridges the diameter of dinner plates (and
about as tall as a 100-count spindle of CD-Rs).
The acolytes of the mainframe, called com-
puter operators, would have to trudge over to
a cabinet and swap disk cartridges whenever
the program stopped and asked for them —
that’s right, those mainframes would actually
stop calculating and print, “I need you to mount
cartridge 12-A-34, or I can’t go any further.
Have a nice day.” (Can you imagine what it
would be like loading and unloading a hard
drive every time you needed to open a folder?)
Anyway, even though eons passed and mini-
computers appeared — which were only the
size of a washing machine — the terms mount-
ing and unmounting still commonly appeared in
programs. This time, the removable volumes
were 8-inch floppy disks and tape cartridges.
Because UNIX and its offspring Linux date from
the Minicomputer Age, these operating systems
still use the terms.

the keyboard, others have buttons on the drive itself, and some drives have
just a slot, with no button at all. However, there are a number of standard
ways of unloading/unmounting/ejecting a removable volume:
✦Drag the Volume icon from the Desktop to the Trash, which changes to
an Eject icon to help underline the fact that you are not deleting the con-
tents of the drive (see Figure 3-15). Let me underline that with a Mark’s
Maxim because Switchers from the Windows world are usually scared to
death by the concept of dragging a volume to the Trash.
Have no fear — drag removable volumes to the Trash with aplomb.™
✦Click the Volume icon and use the Ô+E keyboard shortcut.
✦Click the File menu and choose Eject.
✦Hold down Control and click the Volume icon to display the contex-
tual menu; then choose Eject.
✦Press your keyboard Eject key (if it has one) to eject a CD or DVD
from your built-in optical drive. (If you’re using a keyboard without a
Media Eject key, press F12 instead.)
You can’t unmount a static volume from the Desktop — you have to use the
Disk Utility application — so your internal hard drive icon will stay where it is.

Common Tasks Aplenty
Okay, I admit it — this section is kind of a grab bag of three very common
tasks. However, I want to walk you through these three procedures early in
the book. Most Mac owners will want to listen to and record CDs as soon as
Mac OS X is installed, and you’d be amazed how much information still
flows across the Internet in plain, simple text.
Therefore, hang around and take care of business.
Opening and editing text files
Text files would seem to be another anachronism in this age of formatted
Web pages, rich text format (RTF) documents, and word processors galore —
however, virtually every computer ever built can read and write in standard
text, so text files are often used for
✦Information files on the Internet, like FAQs (Frequently Asked Question
files)
✦README and update information by software developers
✦Swapping data between programs, like comma-delimited database files
Here’s the quick skinny on opening, editing, and saving an existing text file:
1. Navigate to your Applications folder and launch TextEdit.
2. Press Ô+O to display the Open dialog.
3. Navigate to the desired text file and double-click the filename to load
it (see Figure 3-16).
You can also open an existing text file by dragging its icon from the
Finder window to the TextEdit icon.
4. Click the insertion cursor anywhere in the file and begin typing — or,
to edit existing text, drag the insertion cursor across the characters to
highlight them and type the replacement text.
TextEdit automatically replaces the existing characters with those that
you type. To simply delete text, highlight the characters and press Delete.
5. After you finish editing the document, you can overwrite the original
by pressing Ô+S (which is the same as choosing File➪Save), or you
can save a new version by choosing File➪Save As and typing a new,
unique filename.
6. To exit TextEdit, press Ô+Q.

Listening to an audio CD
By default, Mac OS X uses iTunes to play an audio CD — although I cover
iTunes in complete detail in Book III, Chapter 2, take a moment to see how
to master the common task of playing an audio CD (just in case you want to
jam while reading these early chapters). Follow these steps:
1. Load the audio CD into your Mac’s CD-ROM/DVD-ROM drive.
An Audio CD volume icon appears on your Desktop.
2. Mac OS X automatically loads iTunes and displays the spiffy window
that you see in Figure 3-17.
In this case, I’ve loaded an old favorite of mine: the James Brown block-
buster album Live at the Apollo. And here’s a piece of killer Mac trivia to
stump even the hardiest silicon warrior: James Brown performed at the
Mac OS 8 rollout party. Get funky with it!
3. Click the Play button at the upper left of the iTunes window to begin
playing the disc at the beginning. To play an individual track, double-
click the track name in the iTunes window.

4. To adjust the volume from within iTunes, drag the Volume slider to
the left or right — it’s under the Play button.
5. To eject the disc and load another audio CD, click the Eject CD button
at the lower-right of the iTunes window.
6. To exit iTunes, press Ô+Q.
The first time that you run iTunes, you’re asked to configure the program
and specify whether Mac OS X should automatically connect to the Internet
to download the track titles for the disc you’ve loaded. I recommend that
you accept all the default settings and that you allow automatic connection.
Is simple, no?
Recording — nay, burning — a data CD
Mac OS X offers a built-in CD recording feature that allows you to burn the
simplest form of CD: a standard Mac format data CD-ROM that can hold up
to approximately 660MB of files and folders, or an audio CD that can hold up
to about 78 minutes of music. Naturally, you’ll need a Mac with a CD or DVD
recorder.
If you’re interested in recording all the exotic CD and DVD formats available
today, I can heartily recommend the best book on CD and DVD recording on
the shelves: CD and DVD Recording For Dummies, 2nd Edition, written by
(surprise!) yours truly and published by Wiley Publishing, Inc. CD and DVD
Recording For Dummies is a comprehensive recording guide that shows you
how to burn all types of audio, data, and video by using the latest PC and

Mac hardware and the best software on the planet (Roxio Easy CD Creator
for the PC and both iDVD and Toast for the Mac). I can honestly say that it’s
a good read.
Back to the story! To record a disc, follow these steps:
1. Load a blank CD-R or CD-RW into your drive.
Mac OS X displays an Untitled CD volume icon on your Desktop. (It’s
marked with the letters CDR so you know that the disc is recordable.)
You’ll be prompted for permission to format it.
2. Double-click the Untitled CD icon to display the contents — it’ll be
empty, naturally.
The window tells you that you have 660.7MB of space remaining on the
disc.
3. Click and drag files and folders to the CD window as you normally do.
4. Rename any files or folders as necessary — remember, after you’ve
started recording, this stuff is etched in stone, so your disc window
should look just like the volume window should look on the finished
CD-ROM.
5. Click File on the Finder menu and choose Burn CD.
6. The Big X displays a confirmation dialog — if you’ve forgotten some-
thing, you can click the Cancel or Eject button.
Otherwise, click the Burn button and sit back and watch the fun.
Adding the perfect font with Font Book
Need to install a font in Mac OS X, or perhaps
you’d like to organize your fonts into collections
based on their theme or their designer? If so,
you’re talking about Font Book, which is the
new font organizer that ships with Panther. To
open Font Book, visit your Applications folder
and double-click the Font Book icon.
Press Ô+O (or choose File➪Add Fonts) to
import a new font into your system, or simply
drag the font file from a Finder window into the
Font Book window. Remember: Panther can
accept both TrueType and OpenType PostScript
fonts. When it’s been added, your new font can
be categorized by dragging it into one of your
collections, thus making that font easier to
locate and display. Individual fonts and entire
collections can be enabled or disabled (by
using the plus and Disable buttons at the bottom
of the Font Book window), so that you can “turn
on” only those fonts that you need for a specific
application or project. The Font Book window
also comes fully equipped with a Search box, so
you can find any font by name.

All You Really Need to Know about Printing
82
Unfortunately, Mac OS X doesn’t support recording from the Finder for
many of the external and third-party drives available for the Macintosh. If
you can’t burn from the Finder, I recommend that you buy a copy of Roxio
Toast recording software (www.roxio.com).
In Book III, Chapter 2, you discover how to burn an audio CD with iTunes.
All You Really Need to Know about Printing
To close out this chapter, I turn the attention to another task that most Mac
owners need to tackle soon after installing Mac OS X: printing documents.
Because basic printing is so important (and in most cases, so simple), allow
me to use this final section to demonstrate how to print a document.
Most of us have a Universal Serial Bus (USB) printer — the USB being the
favored hardware connection within Mac OS X — so as long as your printer
is supported by Mac OS X, setting it up is as easy as plugging it in to one of
your Mac’s USB ports. The Big X does the rest of the work, selecting the
proper printer software driver from the Library/Printers folder and setting
your printer as the default power of the universe.
Before you print, preview! Would you jump from an airplane without a para-
chute? Then why would you print a document without double-checking it
first? Click Preview, and Mac OS X opens the Preview application to show
you what the printed document will look like. (Once again, some upstart
programs have their own built-in Print Preview mode.) When you’re done
examining your handiwork, close the Preview application to return to your
document.
To print from within any application using the default page characteristics —
standard 81⁄2-x-11 inch paper, portrait mode, no scaling — follow these steps:
1. Within your application, click File and choose Print — or press the
Ô+P keyboard shortcut.
2. Mac OS X displays the Print dialog that you see in Figure 3-18.
Some applications use their own custom Print dialogs, but you should
see the same general settings.
3. Click in the Copies field and enter the number of copies that you
need — you can also enable or disable collation, just like those oh-so-
fancy copiers.
4. To print the entire document, use the default Pages radio button set-
ting of All — to print a range of selected pages, select the From radio
button and enter the starting and ending pages.

All You Really Need to Know about Printing
83
Each Mac OS X application provides different panes so that you can
configure settings that are specific to that application — it’s not neces-
sary to display any of these extra settings to print a default document,
but the power is there to change the look dramatically when necessary.
To display these settings, click the drop-down list box in the Print dialog
and choose one of these panes. For example, if you’re printing from the
Address Book, you can choose the Address Book entry from the drop-
down list and elect to print a phone list or an e-mail list.
5. When everything is go for launch, click the Print button.
Of course, there are more settings and more functionality to the printing
system within Mac OS X, and I cover more complex printing topics in much
more detail in Book VI, Chapter 4 — however, I can tell you from my experi-
ences as a consultant and hardware technician that this short introduction
to printing will likely suffice for 90 percent of the Mac owners on earth. ’Nuff
said.

O
ne of the things that the Internet is supposed to provide is (almost)
instantaneous access to all sorts of information: news, reference and
research material, e-mail addresses, shopping, streaming live video, and
even maps that help you chart your way to Grandma’s house from wherever
you happen to be on the planet. And yes, all that stuff is there, just waiting
to be used.
However, actually finding anything in the organized chaos that is the
Internet is a completely different matter. A favorite e-mail tagline of mine
reads as follows:
What good is a Web search engine that returns 324,909,188 “matches”? That’s
like saying, “Good news, I’ve located the information you want. It’s on Earth.”
In this chapter, I introduce to you to the famous sleuth who makes it easy to
search for the proverbial needle in the Internet haystack: Sherlock 3, which
is included in Mac OS X. (One note: If you don’t have an Internet connec-
tion, you can skip this chapter because Sherlock 3 depends entirely upon
the Internet while searching for the information that you need. There’s
always a caveat, right?)

Sherlock Is Just Plain Neat
86
Sherlock Is Just Plain Neat
I love Conan Doyle’s character Sherlock Holmes — he’s one of my favorite
fictional figures in literature, as a matter of fact — but even the Bloodhound
of Baker Street would be hard pressed to keep up with the great flood of
information available online. Apple’s Sherlock, on the other hand, was built
to do precisely that. To wit:
✦Help me, Mr. Wizard!: Sherlock simplifies the major search engines and
allows you to access them all from a single location — no longer do you
have to open your Web browser and laboriously visit search engine
sites like Lycos. If you find something on a Web site that you want to
explore, a simple double-click of the item automatically launches your
Web browser and displays that page.
✦Real-time, really: You can also display real-time information by using
Sherlock: Access stock prices, news and headlines, your eBay auctions,
and such.
✦Plug it in: Sherlock can provide additional services through the use of
plug-ins — software add-ons offered by companies, libraries, and Apple
itself that expand the functionality of Sherlock.
✦Show me: Depending on the type of information you’re seeking,
Sherlock can display text, graphics, and even video.
Looking for the Scent with the Great Detective
“By Jove, Watson, the game is afoot!” You can run Sherlock by simply click-
ing its icon in the Dock, which features Holmes’ hat and magnifying glass. To
begin, take a look at the Sherlock window itself — Figure 4-1 does the job
nicely. The most common window configuration (for the Internet channel) is
divided thusly:
✦Use the Channel buttons displayed along the top of the window to
quickly switch between different types of searches. To display all the
channels on a single page — complete with descriptions — click the
Channels button on the toolbar.
✦In the Topic or Description box, type whatever you’re searching for.
The fields in this area can change depending on the type of search that
you’re conducting.
✦Click the Search button — the button bearing the suave-looking magni-
fying glass — to start searching the selected sites. (Alternatively, you
can just poke the Return key.)

87
✦The fruits of your search appear in the results section — for more infor-
mation on an item, double-click it.
✦Clicking an item once often displays a quick summary of the information
in the summary section.
Several channels alter the basic look of the Sherlock window, so not every
channel will offer all these controls.
Note the handles — the double lines — that appear in the separator bars.
You can click and drag these handles to resize the dimensions of the chan-
nel button display and the results section.
To sort a column in Sherlock, just click the column’s heading button. For
example, if you’re looking at your stock portfolio, click the Name column
Search button

heading to sort the sites in ascending order. Click again to sort in descend-
ing order (so that the triangle at the corner of the column header points
down). You can also click and drag the right edge of each column’s heading
button to resize the width of the column.
You Don’t Need a Remote for These Channels
As I mention earlier in this chapter, Sherlock calls each different type (or
genre, or class) of search that you can perform a channel. For example, the
default Sherlock channels include
✦Internet: Click this channel to display popular Web search engines.
✦Pictures: Click this channel to search and select content from the Getty
Images online image collection.
✦Stocks: Use this channel to keep track of your stocks and recent head-
lines concerning each company.
✦Movies: Switch to this channel for movie listings and times in your area
or watch the latest movie trailers — now that’s techno-sassy!
✦Phone Book: Use this channel to search for brick-and-mortar 
businesses — just like that ponderous paper phone book — and
even display a map with directions to help you reach a business.
✦eBay: Click this channel and hang onto your wallet as you traverse
the auction place to hang out — search and track your auctions with
aplomb.
✦Flights: Check the major airline schedules by departure and arrival city,
as well as flight information like plane type, altitude, and speed — you
can even pinpoint the location of a plane in flight!
✦Dictionary: If you use the Internet for research, this channel is, quite
simply, your Holy Grail. From this one location, you can peruse the
online versions of the American Heritage Dictionary, Webster’s Revised
Unabridged Dictionary, and Roget’s II Thesaurus.
✦Translation: Need to know the word for taxi in Portuguese? You can
translate phrases and words to and from different languages with this
channel.
✦AppleCare: Clicking this channel brings you to the Apple Knowledge
Base — a virtual gold mine for Sherlock searches — the Macintosh
Product Guide and the Apple Web site.
When troubleshooting a Mac OS X issue, fire up Sherlock and use the
AppleCare channel to check out keywords potentially related to your
problem.

As I mention earlier, you can display all the default channels and a short
description of each channel by clicking the Channels button on the Sherlock
toolbar. From this Channel panel — yes, I actually wrote that — click a chan-
nel icon to begin your search.
To switch channels, just click the desired channel icon at the top of the
Sherlock window.
Tracking Businesses, Movies, 
Definitions, and Auctions
To demonstrate the Fine Art of Search, I show you in this section how to
locate a business, how to check movie listings, the definition of the word
sleuth, and how to locate a print of Old London on eBay. (Something for
everyone there, wouldn’t you agree?)
Let your mouse do the walking
First, use Sherlock to locate the address and telephone number for a popu-
lar local pizza restaurant. Follow these steps:
1. Launch Sherlock 3 and then click the Phone Book channel button to
display the window that you see in Figure 4-2.
2. Type the name Shakespeare’s Pizza into the Business Name or
Category box.
3. Type the city and state Columbia, MO into the Find Near (Name, City
& State or Zip) box and then click the Search button (the magnifying
glass button).
Figure 4-3 illustrates the results. The business address and phone
number is listed, along with the approximate distance in miles from
your location.
By default, Sherlock provides directions starting from your home address
(as provided by your card in the Address Book). However, you can click
the Driving Directions From drop-down list box to select another starting
point for the directions.
The map display at the lower-right corner can be zoomed by dragging the
Zoom slider in the desired direction. To move the map so that you can
see additional territory, click the desired direction on the Pan control.
4. If the search matches more than one business, click a name in the
results section to display the information for that business.
To print the results of your search, click the Print button.

Scoping local movies
To search local theaters for information on a movie and watch the trailer to
boot, follow these steps:
1. Click the Movies channel button to display the window that you see
in Figure 4-4.
2. To search by movie name, click the Movies button at the top-left corner

3. Click the Showtime drop-down list box and then select the date for
your listings.
By default, today’s date is shown.
If necessary, you can also enter a different city/state combination or Zip
code in the Find Near box.
4. Hey, there’s one that looks good — click the Terminator 3 entry to
display the summary text (see Figure 4-5).
Sherlock automatically begins downloading the poster and QuickTime
movie trailer for the film. After the movie downloads, click the Play
button in the QuickTime viewer window to watch the trailer.

Consulting Sherlock’s dictionary
One of the tasks that I perform most often with Sherlock is searching for
word definitions. Follow these steps to find the definition of a word:
1. Click the Dictionary channel button.
2. Type the word sleuth into the Word to Define box and then click the
Search button.
The definition and synonyms appear, and you didn’t have to turn a
single page.
3. To display the definition of any synonyms, click the desired word in
the Thesaurus column, and Sherlock provides you with the definition
in the summary section, as shown in Figure 4-6.
Happy hunting!

Sherlock can make use of existing Internet search engines. Follow these
steps to search the Internet for Web sites:
1. Click the Internet channel button.
2. Type the phrase Scanners For Dummies into the Topic or Description
box and then click the Search button.
3. When you find the perfect match for your search, click that entry to

Translating, ’Twixt Languages
Although Sherlock can’t help you with the word for bathroom when you’re
in the middle of the street in Berlin, you can use the Translation channel to
translate words and phrases from the comfort of your computer desk. (And
come to think of it, if you have a wireless Internet connection and an iBook,
I guess you could use it in the middle of a foreign street!)
Follow these steps to translate words and phrases:
1. Click the Translation channel button.
2. Type the word or phrase that you want to translate into the Original
Text box.
(Sorry about the very silly line from Monty Python and the Holy Grail, but
how could I possibly resist?)
3. Click the language-to-language drop-down list box to specify the
starting and ending language for the translation.
4. Click the Translate button to translate the text, as shown in Figure 4-10.
Figure 4-10:

You can highlight and copy the translated text into the Clipboard and
then paste it into your word processor or e-mail application.
Want to experience what I call the Tower of Babel Effect (or TBE)? Start
with an English phrase, translate it into a second language, and then
continue to translate the results to another language or two. Finally,
translate the end result back to English and — voilà! You’ll likely be sur-
prised by just how imprecise different languages can be.
Finding Flight Information
Finally, allow me to demonstrate how you can track flight schedules by
using Sherlock — truly, gentle reader, this program is as versatile as Apple
claims! Follow these steps:
1. Click the Flights channel button.
2. Click the Airline drop-down list to narrow your search to specific
airlines.
To display information on a particular flight, type the flight number into
the Flight Number box.
3. To search by departure city, click the Departure City or Airport Code
drop-down list and then click the desired location.
Note that you can also type a city name or airport code directly into the
Departure City or Airport Code list.
4. To search by arrival city, click the Arrival City or Airport Code drop-
down list and then click the desired location.
Note that you can also type a city name or airport code directly into the
Arrival City or Airport Code list.
5. Click the Search button.
6. Click any flight entry, and Sherlock updates the summary section
with the specific flight information, as shown in Figure 4-11.
To display any leg of the flight, click the Leg drop-down list box.

 Importing and exporting vCards
Do you have a well-thumbed address book stuck in a drawer of your office
desk? Or do you have a wallet or purse stuffed with sticky notes and odd scraps
of paper, each of which bears an invaluable e-mail address or phone number?
If so, you can finally set yourself free and enjoy the “Paperless Lifestyle” of the
new millennium with the revolutionary new Rauncho Digital Address Book! As
seen on TV! Only $29.95 — and it doubles as an indestructible garden hose!
But wait! If you order now, we’ll also send you. . . .
O
f course, you and I would tune that stuff out as soon as we heard, 
“As seen on TV” — but, believe it or not, the Rauncho Digital Address
Book does exist (after a fashion), and you already have one if you’ve installed
Mac OS X. It’s called the Address Book, and in this chapter I show you how
to store and retrieve all your contact data, including iChat information, pho-
tographs, and much more.
(And before you ask, operators are not standing by.)
Hey, Isn’t the Address Book Just a Part of Mail?
It’s true — in older versions of Mac OS X, Address Book was relegated to the
minor leagues and usually appeared only when you asked for it within Mail.
Although it could be run as a separate application, there was no convenient
route to the Address Book from the Desktop, so most Mac owners never
launched it standalone.

Hey, Isn’t the Address Book Just a Part of Mail?
102
In Mac OS X Panther, however, the Address Book arrives in the limelight,
earning a default location in the Dock and available whenever you need it.
Although the Address Book can still walk through a meadow hand-in-hand
with Mail, it also flirts with other Mac OS X applications and can even
handle some basic telephony chores all by itself through the use of Services.
Figure 5-1 illustrates the default face of the Address Book, complete with a
personal address card: your own contact information, which you enter
within the First Use Wizard that I mention in Book I, Chapter 1. This card
carries a special me tag indicating that it’s your personal card, as well as a
suave-looking silhouette next to your name in the Name column. Other Mac
OS X applications use the data in your card to automatically fill out your
personal information in all sorts of documents. (In Figure 5-1, I’ve added a
number of well-known friends as well . . . a few TV characters, a composer
or two. You know the drill.)

Note those cool little dimples that mark the Group and Name column

can click the two buttons at the upper-left corner (underneath the window
controls) to hide or show the Group and Name columns.
Entering Contact Information
Unless you’ve actually met and hired a group of DataElves — see the sidebar
“I gotta type (or retype) that stuff?” — you’ll have to add contacts to your
Address Book manually. Allow me to demonstrate here how to create a new
contact within your Address Book:
1. Launch Address Book from the Dock by clicking its icon.
The icon looks like an old-fashioned paper Address Book with an @
symbol on the cover.
2. Press the Ô+N shortcut to create a new contact. Alternatively, choose
File➪New Card or click the Add a New Person button at the bottom of
the Name column.
Address Book displays the template that you see in Figure 5-2, with the
First name field highlighted and ready for you to type.
3. Enter the contact’s first name and press Tab to move to the Last name
field.
4. Continue entering the corresponding information in each field, press-
ing Tab to move through the fields.
If a field is not applicable (for example, if a person has no home page),
just press Tab again to skip it. You can press Return to add extra lines to
the Address field.
When you complete certain fields — like the Address field — a plus
symbol pops up to the left of the field. That’s the Address Book telling
you that there are additional versions of the field that you can enter as
well. (Think home and work addresses.) Click this plus sign, and you
can enter the other version. For example, if you enter an iChat address
for the contact at home, the plus sign appears; click it, and then you can
enter the contact’s work iChat address, too.
5. To add a photograph to the card, just double-click the thumbnail
square next to the person’s name.
Address Book displays an Open dialog that you can use to select the
image.

Entering Contact Information
104
6. When you’re done, click the Edit button (bottom-center) to save the
card.
You can edit the contents of a card at any time by displaying it and clicking
the Edit button at the bottom (or by pressing Ô+L, or even by clicking Edit
and choosing the Edit Card menu item). You can also add new fields to a
card, such as birthdays, anniversaries, and the like.
No need to edit a card to add information to the Note field — just click and
type.
You can also add contact cards directly to your Address Book from the Mac
OS X Mail application — go figure. Within Mail, click the message (to high-
light it) from the person whom you want to add, click the friendly Message
menu, and then click Add Sender to Address Book. (Naturally, this doesn’t
add supporting information — just the person’s name and e-mail address.
Once again, your nimble fingers will have to manually enter the rest.) For
more on Mail, see Book IV, Chapter 2.

Don’t forget to add those fax numbers! Panther can fax from any application —
just click File and choose Print (or press Ô+P) like you always have, and
then click the Fax button at the bottom of the Print dialog. Mac OS X now
automatically fills in the address for you, but only if the contact has a fax
number entered as a part of the contact card.
If someone sends you a vCard (look for an attachment with a .vcf exten-
sion), consider yourself lucky. Just drag the vCard from the attachment
window in Mail, drop it in your Address Book, and any information that the
person wants you to have will be automatically added!
To delete a card, click the unlucky name to display the card, click Edit, and
then choose Delete Person.
“I gotta type (or retype) that stuff?”
In my two decades of travel through the per-
sonal computing world, one lovely recurring
fantasy shared by computer users keeps crop-
ping up over and over: I call it the DataElves. You
see, DataElves are the hard-working, silicon-
based gnomes in tiny green suspenders who
magically enter all the information that you want
to track into your database (or Address Book, or
Quicken, or whatever). They burrow into your
papers and presto! — out pops all that data,
neatly typed and . . . whoa, Nellie! Let’s stop
there.
For some reason, computer users seem to forget
that there are no DataElves. I wish I had a dime
for every time I’ve heard a heartbroken com-
puter user say, “You mean I have to type all that
stuff in?” (My usual retort is, “Affirmative . . .
unless you want to pay me a hideous amount to
do it for you.”) Make no mistake — adding 
a lifetime’s worth of contact information 
into your Address Book can be several hours of
monotonous and mind-bendingly boring work,
which is another reason why many computer
owners still depend on paper to store all those
addresses. But take my word for it, dear reader,
your effort is worth it — the next time that you
sit down to prepare a batch of Christmas cards
or you have to find Uncle Milton’s telephone
number in a hurry, you will appreciate the effort
that you made to enter contact information into
your Address Book. (Just make sure that you —
repeat after me — back up your hard drive.)
By the way, if you’ve already entered contact
information into another PIM (short for Personal
Information Manager), you can re-use that data
without retyping everything — that is, as long
as your old program can export contacts in
vCard format. After you export the records, just
drag the vCards into the Address Book window
to add them, or import them by pressing Ô+I.
(More on this at the end of this chapter.)

Using Contact Information
Okay, now that you’ve got your contact information in Address Book, what
can you actually do with it? Often, all you really need is a quick glance at an
address. To display the card for any contact within Address Book, just
double-click the desired entry in the Name column. You can move to the
next and previous cards by using the directional arrow buttons at the
bottom-right corner of the Address Book window.
But wait, there’s more! You can also
✦Copy and paste: The old favorites are still around — you can copy any
data from a card (press Ô+C) and paste it into another open application
(press Ô+V).
✦Send an e-mail message: If you’ve already read through Chapter 3 of
this mini-book, you’ll remember the Mac OS X services feature that I tell
you about. Click and drag to select any e-mail address on a card; then
click the Address Book menu and click the Services menu. Choose Mail
from the submenu and then choose Mail To. Bingo! Depending on the
information that you select, other services might also be available.
✦Add an iChat buddy: From within iChat, click the Buddies menu and
then click Add a Buddy to display the dialog that you see in Figure 5-3.
From here, you can select a contact card that has an Instant Messenger
address and add it to your Buddy List.

you how many contacts contain matching characters and displays just
those entries in the Name column. Now that’s sassy! (And convenient.
And fast as all get-out.) Check out Figure 5-4, where many of the charac-
ters from my favorite TV shows are gathered — note that a number of
very familiar folks share the same address in Gotham City, and I found
them by using the Search field.

Arranging Your Contact Cards
Address Book also provides you with a method of organizing your cards into
groups. A group usually consists of folks with a common link, like your
family, friends, co-workers, and others who enjoy yodeling.
To create a group, choose File➪New Group or press Ô+Shift+N. (Using the
Hollywood method, click the plus sign button at the bottom of the Group
column.) Address Book creates a new entry in the Group column, with a
highlighted text box so that you can type the group name (see Figure 5-5).
After you type the group name, press Return to save it, and then click and
drag the entries that you want to add to the New Group icon.
If you’ve already selected the entries for those contacts that you want to
add to the group, choose File➪New Group from Selection instead. This
saves you a step because the group is created and the members are added
automatically.
Click to add a new group.

After you create a New Group, you can instantly display members of that
group by clicking its icon in the Group column. To return to the display of all
your contacts, click the All group button.
To further organize your groups, you can drag and drop a group on top of
another group. It becomes a subgroup, which is handy for things like branch
offices within your company, or relatives whom you’re not speaking to at
the moment.
Here’s another handy feature of an Address Book group: You can send all
the members of a group the same e-mail message at once. Within Mail,
simply enter the Group name in the To field in the Compose window, and
the same message is sent to everyone. Even Gandalf couldn’t do that (but
my copy editor bets that Dumbledore could).
Using Network Directories
I know, I know, I said earlier that you’d have to enter all your contacts 
yourself — but I was talking about your personal contacts! You can also
access two types of external directories from within Address Book:
✦If you’re a member of a company NetInfo network — and if you don’t
know, ask your wizened network administrator — you can search net-
work directory servers from within Address Book. These servers are
available automatically, so there’s no configuration necessary. Sweet.
✦You can search Internet-based LDAP directories. Sorry, folks, I know
that’s pretty cryptic, but others have written entire books on this tech-
nology. Again, suffice it to say that your network guru can tell you
whether LDAP servers are available to you. (In another blazing display
of techno-nerd acronym addiction, LDAP stands for Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol.) With LDAP, you can search a central company directory
from anywhere in the world as long as you have an Internet connection.
To configure this feature, click Address Book from the menu and choose
the Preferences menu item; click the LDAP tab, and then click the
button with the plus sign to enter the specific settings for the server
that you want to access (see Figure 5-6). Your network administrator or
the LDAP server administrator can supply you with these settings.

To search either type of network directory, click the Directories entry in the
Group column and use the Search field like you normally would. Matching
entries will display the person’s name, e-mail address, and phone number.
“But hey, Mark, what if I’m not online? My company’s LDAP directory isn’t
much good then, right?” Normally, that’s true. If you’re a mobile user, LDAP
information is only available to you when you’re online and the LDAP server
is available. Ah, but here’s a rocking power user Tip that’ll do the trick for
iBook and PowerBook owners: To make a person’s information always avail-
able, search the LDAP database and drag the resulting entry from the
Directories window to the All group. You’ll import the information to your
local Address Book — and you’ll see it even when you’re not online!
Printing Contacts with Flair
Next, consider how to print your contacts (for those moments when you
need an archaic hard copy). Address Book offers two different formats.
By default, Address Book prints on standard US letter-size paper (81⁄2-x-11
inches) in portrait orientation. To change these settings, choose File➪
Page Setup or press Ô+Shift+P. From the Page Setup dialog that you see in
Figure 5-7, you can choose exotic settings such as legal-size paper or land-
scape orientation. Click OK to return to Address Book.

Follow these steps to print your contacts:
1. Choose File➪Print or press Ô+P.
Address Book displays the Print dialog.
If you need more than one copy, click the arrows next to the Copies field
to specify the desired number.
Need labels? We’ve got ’em! Click the Style drop-down list box and
choose Mailing Labels to specify what type of label stock you’re using
on the Layout panel. Click the Label button to sort your labels by name
or postal code, choose a font, select a text color, and add an icon or
image to your labels. To switch back to a standard contact list, click
Style again and then click Lists.
2. Select the desired Attributes check boxes to specify which contact
card fields you want to appear in your list (see Figure 5-8).
The Attributes list appears only if you’re printing contacts in Lists style.
3. Click the Preview button to check the appearance of the list or click
the Print button to send the job to the selected printer.
Alternatively, you can create a PDF file in a specified location — a handy
trick to use if you’d rather not be burdened with paper, but you still need
to consult the list or give it to others. (PDF files are a special document
display format developed by Adobe; they display like a printed document
but take up minimal space and can’t be edited.) To display the contents of
a PDF file in Mac OS X, you need only double-click it in the Finder window,
and the built-in Preview application will be happy to oblige.

Swapping Bytes with vCards
112
Swapping Bytes with vCards
A vCard is a standard file format for exchanging contacts between programs
like Address Book, Microsoft Entourage, Eudora, and the Palm computer
desktop. (Heck, if you’re lucky enough to have an iPod, you can even store
vCard data there.) Think of a vCard as an electronic business card that you
can attach to an e-mail message, send via File Transfer Protocol (FTP), or
exchange with others by using your cellular phone and palmtop computer.
vCard files end with the extension .vcf.
In Address Book, you can create a single vCard containing one or more
selected entries by clicking File and choosing Export vCards. Then, like any
other Mac OS X Save dialog, just navigate to the spot where you want the
file saved, give it a name, and click Save. Figure 5-9 illustrates the Get Info
window with information about my vCard, saved from my Address Book to
my Desktop.
To import vCards into Address Book:
✦Drag the vCard files that you’ve received to Address and drop them in
the application window.
✦Alternatively, choose File➪Import vCards or press Ô+I. From the Open
dialog, navigate to the location of the vCard files that you want to add,
select them, and then click Open.

he title of this chapter really sounds like a contradiction in terms, doesn’t
it? The concepts of joy and maintenance will likely be mutually exclusive
to you — and it’s true that most Mac OS X owners would rather work or play
than spend time under the hood, getting all grimy. I understand completely;
maintenance is far less sexy than WarCraft III or PowerPoint.
However, if you do want your work or play uninterrupted by lockups and
crashes — yes, believe it or not, the Big X can indeed take a dive if it’s not
cared for — and you’d like your Mac to perform like Lance Armstrong,
you’ve got to get your hands dirty. That means performing regular mainte-
nance on your hardware, Mac OS X, and your all-important applications,
documents, and folders.
Like most techno-types, I actually enjoy pushing my system to the limit and
keeping it running in top form. And who knows — after you become a
Panther power user, you could find yourself bitten by the maintenance bug
as well. In this chapter, I cover how to take care of necessary tune-up
chores, step-by-step.
Deleting Applications the Common Sense Way
Nothing lasts forever, and that includes your applications — you might no
longer need an application or maybe you need to remove it to upgrade to a

Deleting Applications the Common Sense Way

new version or to reinstall it. Unlike Windows XP, Mac OS X doesn’t have an
Add or Remove Programs utility for uninstalling software — nor does it need
one because virtually all Macintosh applications are self-contained in a
single folder or series of nested folders. (And not by accident . . . it’s always
been a rule for Apple software developers since the first days of the
Macintosh.) Therefore, removing an application is usually as easy as delet-
ing the contents of the application folder from your hard drive.
Always check the application’s README file and documentation for any spe-
cial instructions before you delete any application folder. If you’ve created
any documents in that folder that you want to keep, don’t forget to move
them before you trash the folder and its contents!
Some programs can leave preference files, start-up applications, or driver
files in other spots on your disk besides their home folder. When you’re
uninstalling a program that has support files in other areas, use the Search
box in the Finder toolbar to locate other files that might have been created
by the application. (I cover this feature in Book II, Chapter 1.)
For example, Figure 6-1 illustrates a search that I’ve run on Microsoft Office
v. X. By searching for the word office, I’ve found a number of files created in
other folders, like the settings file that’s in my Preferences folder. Typically,
you’ll want to delete the main application folder first and then remove these
orphans.

Spring Cleaning, from Aladdin Systems (www.aladdinsys.com), also has the
ability to uninstall a program, as well as a feature that can find and remove
orphaned files left from past applications.
Popping the Hood: Using the Apple System Profiler
Need hard information about your hardware? You might need to determine
precisely what hardware is installed in your Mac for the following reasons:
✦If you’re working with a technical support person to solve a problem:
This person will usually request information about your system, such as
what processor you’re running and how much memory you have.
✦If you’re evaluating an application before you buy it: You’ll want 
to check its minimum system requirements against the hardware on
your Mac.
✦If you’re considering an upgrade to your Mac: You’ll likely need to
determine how much memory you have, what type it is, and which
memory slots are filled. (The same goes for your hard drive and your
video card, for those Macs with video card slots.) For more on upgrad-
ing your Mac, thumb through Book VI, Chapter 2.
Apple provides Mac OS X with an all-in-one hardware and software display
tool, aptly named Apple System Profiler, which you can find in the Utilities
folder within your Applications folder. (You can also reach the Profiler
through the Apple menu — click About This Mac and then click the More
Info button.) As you can see from Figure 6-2, there’s a lot to digest from the
System Profiler window.
Like the folders in a Finder window in list view mode, you can expand or
collapse each major heading that appears in a Profiler screen. Just click the
triangle that appears to the left of each Contents heading to expand or col-
lapse that heading.
The System Profiler major headings include
✦Overview: The heart of the Profiler, this is the screen that you’ll use the
most (again, feast your eyes on Figure 6-2). It includes information
about your Mac OS X version, an overview of your system hardware, a
description of the physical memory in your Mac, and an overview of the
network connections that you’re currently using.
✦Hardware: This heading tells you volumes about your hard drives —
forgive me — as well as specifics concerning your CD and DVD drives,
modem, AirPort hardware, and any FireWire and USB devices connected
to your system. Figure 6-3 illustrates the information from my USB
screen, with many of the devices expanded so that you can see them.

✦Network: This heading shows a listing of your network configuration,
active network connections, and other assorted network paraphernalia.
You’ll probably only need this screen when asked by a technical sup-
port person for the network protocols that you’re using, but it’s handy
nonetheless.
✦Software: Okay, this heading shows something useful to the average
human being! This screen lists all the applications recognized on your
start-up volume, along with their version numbers (see Figure 6-4). If
you’re wondering whether you need to update an application with a
patch file (to fix bugs in the software) or update a file from the devel-
oper, you can look here to check the current version number for the
application. You also get a rather boring list of the extensions (or driv-
ers) used by Mac OS X applications.
✦Logs: Although interesting, the highly complex listings displayed under
this heading are usually valuable only to tech support personnel. They
document recent lockups, application crashes, and even system
crashes.

Tracking Performance with Activity Monitor
120
Tracking Performance with Activity Monitor
Our next stop in Maintenance City is a useful little application called Activity
Monitor, which is specially designed to show you just how hard your CPU,
hard drives, network equipment, and memory modules are working behind
the scenes. To run Activity Monitor, open the Utilities folder in your
Applications folder.
To display each different type of usage, click the buttons in the lower half of
the window; the lower panel changes to reflect the desired type. For example,
if you click System Memory, you see the amount of unused memory; click
CPU or Network to display real-time usage of your Mac’s CPU and network
connections.
You can also display a separate window with your CPU usage; choose
Monitor➪Show CPU Usage or press Ô+2. Figure 6-5 illustrates the two differ-
ent types of central processing unit (CPU, which is commonly called the
“brain” of your Macintosh) displays available from Activity Monitor:
✦Floating CPU window: (Bottom-left of Figure 6-5.) This is the smallest
display of CPU usage; the higher the CPU usage, the higher the reading
on the monitor. You can arrange the floating window in horizontal or
vertical mode from the Activity Monitor menu.
✦Standard window: (Above the floating window in Figure 6-5.) This is the
standard CPU monitoring window, which uses a blue thermometer-like
display. The display works the same as the floating window.
Processes For Dummies
“Mark, what’s that arcane-looking list doing in
the middle of the Activity Monitor window in
Figure 6-5?” I’m glad you asked. A process is 
a discrete task (either visible or invisible) 
that Panther performs in order to run your appli-
cations. (Some processes are executed 
by Panther just to keep itself running.) For
example, the Dock and Finder are actually
processes, as are Adobe Acrobat and iPhoto.
You can delete a specific process within
Activity Monitor. Just click the offending
process in the list and then click the Quit
Process button on the Activity Monitor toolbar.
But tread carefully, Mr. Holmes, for there’s
danger afoot. For example, deleting a system
process (like the Dock or Finder) can result in
all of Mac OS X locking up! Therefore, delete a
process only if instructed to do so by a support
technician. From the Apple menu, choose Force
Quit to terminate a misbehaving application
instead.

Whichever type of display you choose, you can drag the window anywhere
that you like on your Mac OS X Desktop. Use the real-time feedback to deter-
mine how well your system CPU is performing when you’re running applica-
tions or performing tasks in Mac OS X. If this meter stays peaked for long
periods of time while you’re using a range of applications, your processor is
running at full capacity.
You can even monitor CPU, network, hard drive, or memory usage right
from the Dock! Choose Monitor➪Dock Icon; then choose what type of real-
time graph you want to display in your Dock. (Feeling like a Panther power
user yet? I thought so.) When you’re monitoring CPU usage from the Dock,
the green portion of the bar indicates the amount of processor time used by
application software, and the red portion of the bar indicates the CPU time
given to the Mac OS X operating system.

Note, however, that seeing your CPU capacity at its max does not necessarily
mean that you need a faster CPU or a new computer. For example, when I’m
running applications such as Photoshop or Premiere, the Activity Monitor
on my G4 iMac is often pegged (indicating maximum use) for several sec-
onds at a time. The rest of the time, it barely moves. Whether a computer is
actually fast enough for you and the applications that you run is more of a
subjective call on your part.
Fixing Things with the Disk Utility
Another important application in your maintenance toolbox is the Disk
Utility, which you’ll find — no surprise here — in the Utilities folder within
your Applications folder. When you first run this program, it looks some-
thing like Figure 6-6, displaying all the physical disks and volumes on your
system.

123
Displaying the goods on your disks
The volume tree structure on the left of the Disk Utility window lists both
the physical disks and the partitions that you’ve set up. A partition is noth-
ing more than another word for volume, which is the formatted section of a
disk that contains data. A single physical hard drive can contain several par-
titions. The information display at the bottom of the Disk Utility window
contains data about both the volumes and the partitions on your hard drive.
To illustrate: On my system, clicking the drive labeled 38.2 GB (the physical
hard drive at the top of the tree) displays a description of the drive itself,
including its total capacity, interface (connection type), and whether the
drive is internal or external. (See Figure 6-7.) Clicking the tree entry for Disk
Wolfgang, however — that’s the name of the partition that I created when I
formatted the drive — displays information about the type of formatting,
the total capacity of the partition and how much of that is used, and the
number of files and folders stored on the partition (as shown in Figure 6-8).

Playing doctor with First Aid
Click the First Aid tab to display the controls that you see in Figure 6-9. Disk
Utility can be used to verify (or check) any disk (well, almost any disk) for
errors, as well as repair any errors that it finds. Here are the two exceptions
when the buttons are disabled:
✦The start-up disk: Disk Utility can’t verify or repair the start-up disk —
that’s Mac talk for the boot drive that contains the Mac OS X system
that you’re using at the moment — which makes sense if you think
about it because that drive is currently being used!
If you have multiple operating systems on multiple disks, you can boot
from another Mac OS X installation on another drive to check your cur-
rent start-up disk. Or, you can boot your system from the original Mac
OS X installation CD and run Disk Utility from the Installation menu.
Your start-up disk is automatically verified and repaired (if necessary)
during the boot procedure, so you really don’t need to worry about
checking the start-up disk.

✦Write-protected disks: Although you can use the Disk Utility to verify
CDs, DVDs, and write-protected removable disk drives (like a write-
protected Zip disk), it can’t repair them. (Sound of my palm slapping
my forehead.)
You also can’t repair a disk that has open files that are currently being
used. If you’re running an application from a drive or you’ve opened a
document that’s stored on that drive, you won’t be able to repair that
drive.
You can also elect to verify and repair permissions (also called privileges)
on a disk; these are the read/write permissions that I discuss in detail in
Book II, Chapter 6. If you can’t save or move a file that you should be able
to access, I recommend checking that drive for permissions problems.
Unlike fixing disk errors, you can verify and repair permissions on any
volume that contains a Mac OS X installation (whether it was used to boot
your Mac or not).
Figure 6-9:
The Disk

126
In order to verify or repair, you must be logged in as an administrator.
To verify or repair a drive, first select the target volume/partition in the list
at the left. To check the contents of the drive and display any errors, click
the Verify Disk button. Or, to verify the contents of the drive and fix any
problems, click the Repair Disk button. (I usually just click Repair Disk
because an error-free disk will need no repairs.) Disk Utility displays any
status or error messages in the scrolling list; if you’ve got eagle eyes, you’ll
note that the window can be resized so that you can expand it to display
more messages. (You can also drag the dot between the left and right panes
to expand the list.)
I generally check my disks once every two or three days. If your Mac is
caught by a power failure or Mac OS X locks up, however, it’s a good idea to
immediately check disks after you restart your Mac. (Remember: The start-
up volume is automatically checked and repaired, if necessary.)
A number of very good commercial disk repair utilities are on the market.
My favorite is Drive 10 from Micromat (www.micromat.com), shown in
Figure 6-10. However, Disk Utility does a good job on its own, and it’s free.
Erasing without seriously screwing up
“Danger, Will Robinson! Danger!” That’s right, Robot, it is indeed very easy to
seriously screw up and get Lost in Erase. (Man, I can’t believe I actually
typed such a bad pun. I have no shame.) Anyway, it’s time for another of
Mark’s Maxims. To paraphrase the rules for handling a firearm responsibly:
Never click this button unless you mean to use it.

Figure 6-11 illustrates the Erase controls within Disk Utility. You need only
erase a disk or volume when you want to completely wipe the contents of
that existing disk or volume. You can also erase a rewriteable CD (CD-RW)
or DVD (DVD-RW, DVD+RW, or DVD-RAM) from this tab.
✦Erasing an entire disk deletes all volumes on the disk and creates a
single new, empty volume.
✦Erasing a volume only wipes the contents of that specific volume, leaving
all other volumes on the physical disk untouched.
To erase, follow these steps:
1. From the Erase panel within Disk Utility, click the disk or volume icon
that you want to erase from the list on the left side of the screen.
2. Click the format that you want to use from the Volume Format drop-
down list.
Figure 6-11:
The Disk
Utility Erase
controls.

Fixing Things with the Disk Utility
128
Always choose Mac OS Extended entry from the Volume Format list
unless you have a specific reason to use the MS-DOS File System (for
compatibility with PCs running Windows) or the UNIX File System 
(for compatibility with UNIX/Linux machines). In some cases, Disk
Utility will force you to choose the Mac OS Extended (Journaled) entry
instead, but the end result is the same. Note that you do not need to
format a disk or volume with the MS-DOS File System just to read or
write a floppy or a Zip disk from a PC system — Mac OS X recognizes
MS-DOS removable media without a problem.
3. In the Name field, type the name for the volume.
If you’re erasing an existing volume, the default is the existing name.
4. If you’re erasing a disk, enable the Install Mac OS 9 Disk Driver check
box to specify whether you want to install drivers for native Mac OS 9
machines.
Without these drivers, the disk can’t be used with Mac OS 9 on another
Mac or if you reboot your Mac by using Mac OS 9. (Note that these
drivers are not required to use the disk in Classic mode.)
5. Click the Erase button.
In the sheet that appears, click Erase to confirm that you do actually
want to do the deleterious deed.
Partitioning the right way
From time to time, just about everyone wishes they had additional volumes
handy for organizing files and folders — or at least a little extra space on a
particular partition. If you find yourself needing another volume on a disk —
or if you need to resize the total space on existing volumes on a disk — click
the Partition tab within Disk Utility to display the controls that you see in
Figure 6-12. (Make sure you’ve selected a disk, not a partition.) From here,
you can choose a volume scheme, creating anywhere from 1 to 16 volumes
on a single disk.
You can’t monkey around with the partitions on a start-up disk because Mac
OS X is currently running on that disk — think about removing your own
appendix, and you’ll get the idea.
To set up the partitions on a disk, follow these steps:
1. From the Partition panel within Disk Utility, click the disk icon 
(left side of the pane) that you want to partition.
2. Click the first volume block in the partition list (under the Volume
Scheme drop-down list) to select it.

Book I
Chapter 6
The Joys 
of Maintenance

129
3. Click the Volume Scheme drop-down list and choose the total number
of volumes that you want on the selected disk.
4. Click in the Name field and enter the name for the first volume.
5. From the Format drop-down list, choose a format for the volume.
Always use Mac OS Extended or Mac OS Extended (Journaled) from the
Format list unless you have a specific reason to use the MS-DOS File
System (for compatibility with PCs running Windows) or the UNIX File
System (for compatibility with UNIX/Linux machines).
6. Type a total size for this volume in the Size field.
7. To install Mac OS 9 drivers on this disk, enable the Install Mac OS 9
Disk Drivers check box.
Figure 6-12:
The Disk
Utility
Partition
controls.

Fixing Things with the Disk Utility
130
Without these drivers, the disk can’t be used with Mac OS 9 on another
Mac or if you reboot your Mac by using Mac OS 9. (Again, Classic mode
doesn’t require these drivers.)
8. After you set up your first volume partition, mark the Locked for
Editing check box to prevent any further changes to that volume.
9. If you’re creating multiple volumes, click the next volume block to
select it and repeat Steps 4–8.
10. To delete a partition from your new scheme, click the unwanted
volume and then click the Delete button to remove it.
11. To split a partition from your new scheme into two volumes, click the
desired volume and then click the Split button.
12. When everything is set to your liking, click the Partition button to
begin the process.
If you suddenly decide against a partition change, click the Revert
button to return to the original existing partition scheme — however,
the Revert button is only available before you click the Partition button!
Check out the bar(s) with a handle separating the volumes in the partition
list. If you leave all your partitions unlocked (by leaving the Locked for
Editing check box disabled), you can click and drag these separator bars to
dynamically resize the volumes. This makes it easy to adjust the individual
volume sizes for the disk until you get precisely the arrangement you want.
If a volume is locked, it can’t be resized dynamically in this fashion.
RAID has nothing to do with insects
The final stop on the Disk Utility hayride isn’t for everyone — as a matter of
fact, only a Mac OS X power user with a roomful of hardware is likely to use
it. RAID, Redundant Array of Independent/Inexpensive Disks, is actually what
it says. In normal human English, a RAID set is a group of multiple separate
disks, working together as a team. Using RAID can
✦Improve the speed of your system
✦Help prevent disk errors from compromising or corrupting your data
The RAID controls within Disk Utility are illustrated in Figure 6-13. You’ll
need at least two additional hard drives on your system besides the start-up
disk, which I don’t recommend that you use in a RAID set.
To set up a RAID array in Mac OS X, follow these steps:
1. From the RAID tab of Disk Utility, click and drag the disks from the
list at the left to the Disk box.

2. Click the RAID Scheme drop-down list to specify the type of RAID that
you need.
• Stripe: Choosing this can speed up your hard drive performance by
splitting data between multiple disks.
• Mirror: Choosing this increases the reliability of your storage by
creating a mirror backup of that data across multiple disks.
3. Click in the RAID Set Name field and type the name for your RAID set.
4. From the Volume Format drop-down list, choose a format for the 
volumes.
Always use Mac OS Extended or Mac OS Extended (Journaled) from the
Volume Format list unless you have a specific reason to use the MS-DOS
File System (for compatibility with PCs running Windows) or the UNIX
File System (for compatibility with UNIX/Linux machines).

Updating Mac OS X
As any good software developer should, Apple constantly releases improve-
ments to Mac OS X in the form of software updates. These updates can
include all sorts of fun stuff, like
✦Bug fixes
✦Improvements and new features
✦Enhanced drivers
✦Security upgrades
✦Firmware upgrades
Apple makes it easy to keep Mac OS X up-to-date with the Software Update
controls in System Preferences (see Figure 6-14). Alternatively, you can click
the Apple menu and click Software Update. To check for new updates peri-
odically, enable the Check for Updates check box. Then from the drop-down
list box, choose how often you want these updates. (I suggest at least weekly,
if not daily.) For a manual check, make sure that you’re connected to the
Internet and then click the Check Now button.
To download updates automatically, mark the Download Important Updates
in the Background check box to enable it; the Big X politely downloads the
updates behind the scenes and then alerts you that they’re ready to be
installed. (With automatic downloading disabled, Mac OS X displays any
available updates with short descriptions, and you can toggle the installa-
tion of a specific update by enabling or disabling the check boxes next to it.)
I recommend installing all updates, even for hardware that you don’t have
yet. For example, I always install AirPort updates even though I don’t use an
AirPort connection at home. The reason? Often, the functionality covered by
an update may include system software that you do use, so you’ll still bene-
fit from installing it.
After you specify the updates that you want to install, click the Install
button to begin the update process. You might have to reboot after every-
thing has been installed.

I Demand That You Back Up Your Hard Drive
I know we’re friends, but there’s no excuse for not backing up your data. The
more valuable and irreplaceable that your documents are, the more heinous
it is to risk losing them. (I don’t get to use the word heinous in many of my
books, but it fits really well here.)
Although Apple does include the ability to create disk images and restore
them in the Disk Utility, I’m not going to recommend that you use disk images
for backups. (Insert sound of stunned silence here.) That’s because the
restore process can be confusing, and the disk image method doesn’t offer the
level of control that you need when it comes to backing up individual files and
folders (or selectively backing up by date or recent use). Only a bona fide
backup application gives you such flexibility and convenience . . . and that’s
why Panther power users turn to true-blue backup software for help.
If you’ve subscribed to Apple’s .Mac service, a back-up utility is included,
but it’s not a part of the default Mac OS X package. Therefore, if you’re 
not a .Mac member, you can turn to a commercial back-up application for
your salvation — my personal recommendation is Retrospect, shown in
Figure 6-15, from Dantz (www.dantz.com). This well-written “software
bungee cord” has saved my posterior more than once.
Figure 6-14:
Keep Mac
OS X up-to-
date with
Software
Update.

I Further Demand That You Defragment
134
Using Retrospect is cheap security, but if you can’t afford it at the moment,
take a second to at least back up your most important documents by copy-
ing them to a rewriteable CD or a Zip disk. Don’t trust a floppy (if your Mac
is actually old enough to sport a floppy drive); they’re far too unreliable.
With this poor man’s backup, even if you lose your entire hard drive, you
can still restore what matters the most.
I Further Demand That You Defragment
Defragmenting your hard drive can significantly improve its performance.
Using a defragmenter scans for little chunks of a file that are spread out
across the surface of your hard drive and then arranges them to form a con-
tiguous file. After a file has been optimized in this way, it’s far easier and
faster for Mac OS X to read than reassembling a fragmented file.
However, Apple dropped the ball on this one and didn’t include a defrag-
menter with Mac OS X. Luckily, the latest version of Micromat Drive 10 also
includes a defragmenting feature (see Figure 6-16), as does Speed Disk from
Norton (www.norton.com). If you have a defragmenter, I recommend that
you use it once a month.

Special Start-Up Keys for Those Special Times

Special Start-Up Keys for Those Special Times
Mac OS X includes a number of special keys that you can use during the
boot process — these keys really come in handy when you need to force
your operating system to do something that it normally wouldn’t, like boot
from a CD instead of the hard drive.
✦To boot from a CD or DVD: Restart your Mac while pressing the C key.
This is a great way to free up your start-up volume when you want to
test it or optimize it using a commercial utility.
✦To eject a recalcitrant disc that doesn’t show up on the Desktop:
Restart Mac OS X and hold down the mouse button — or if you have a
late-model Mac, press the Media Eject key as soon as you hear that mag-
nificent startup chord.
✦To force your Mac to boot in Mac OS X: Hold down the X key while
restarting or booting the Mac.
✦To display a system boot menu: Hold down the Option key while
restarting or booting the Mac, and you can choose which operating
system you want to use.
✦To prevent start-up applications from running during login: Hold
down the Shift key while you click the Login button on the Login screen.
If you don’t see the Login screen during startup, just hold down Shift
while Mac OS X boots until the Finder menu appears.

Crave the Newest Drivers
No chapter on maintenance would be complete without a reminder to keep
your hardware drivers current. Drivers are simply programs that allow your
Mac to control hardware devices, like a video card or a Small Computer
System Interface (SCSI) card that you’ve added to your Mac. The Mac OS X
Software Update feature that I discuss earlier in the section “Updating Mac
OS X” provides most of the drivers that you’ll need for things like printers,
USB and FireWire peripherals, and digital cameras, but it’s still very impor-
tant to check those manufacturer Web sites.
Like the software updates from Apple, updated drivers can fix bugs and
even add new features to your existing hardware, which is my definition of
something for nothing.

Chapter 7: Using Classic Mode
In This Chapter
 Understanding how Classic mode works
 Locating Classic applications, files, and folders
 Configuring Classic mode
 Restarting in Mac OS 9.2
T
o someone as familiar as you are with Mac OS X, using applications in
Mac OS 9 is like watching an evening of Lawrence Welk — you know that
this music used to be cutting-edge, and that tap-dancer used to be cool, but
now it all seems . . . well . . . horribly wrong. (I don’t mean to offend the
champagne-music crowd — Lawrence and the band were really quite good.
Perhaps it’s those unspeakable robin’s-egg blue tuxedos that give me such a
headache.)
We’re lucky because most of the popular Mac applications have been
updated for the Big X, but the process isn’t yet complete. Not every pro-
gram will run natively in Mac OS X — some popular applications still run
only in Classic mode — so it’s practically a sure thing that sooner or later
you’ll launch a program, see the bouncing number 9 in the Dock, and realize
that means Classic is revving up. For those times, this chapter will prove a
soothing balm.
Classic Mode Explained
Let’s start with a definition: Classic mode is actually an implementation of
Mac OS 9 that runs in Mac OS X. Think of it as a virtual session of Mac OS 9
that runs whenever you need it — although you won’t actually see the Mac
OS 9 session after it boots up. Instead, Classic runs in the background, 
providing breathing space for applications that wouldn’t otherwise run in
Mac OS X.

Cranking Up Classic
138
The beauty of Classic is that virtually all older applications run fine in
Classic mode, and they have absolutely no idea that they’re actually work-
ing under Mac OS X. Any problems that you’re likely to experience in Classic
mode stem from “confused” hardware that can’t communicate through
ports that are still controlled through Mac OS X, or the same “shared”
memory problems that plagued older versions of Mac OS. (Sigh.) In other
words, if a lockup could happen in a “real” Mac OS 9 session, it can also
happen in Classic mode . . . but luckily, the only thing that would crash is
the Classic environment itself, so the rest of your Mac OS X applications
should continue working without a hitch. (In fact, you can launch Classic
from System Preferences, as I show you later in this chapter, and try to run
the Classic application again without wreaking havoc on the rest of Mac OS X.)
If you need to use an application from time-to-time that simply won’t run
correctly under Classic mode at all, you might be able to take drastic meas-
ures and restart under Mac OS 9, which I demonstrate at the end of this
chapter. (Some newer Macintosh models won’t boot into Mac OS 9.)
Cranking Up Classic
The four methods of running Classic mode are
✦Double-click on an application without Cocoa or Carbon support. In
other words, launch an older program. As I mention earlier, you’ll see
Of Carbon and Cocoa . . .
First, a word about why Classic mode is
required in the first place — you can politely
brush past this section if you’re not interested
in the Grand Design, and I’ll catch up with you in
a paragraph or two.
Still here? Okay. Here’s the chop. Mac OS X
applications are written by using two software
development APIs (nerdspeak for Application
Program Interfaces). An API specifies the way
that a program communicates with the operat-
ing system. 
Mac OS X recognizes two programming APIs:
Carbon and Cocoa. A Carbon application runs
in both Mac OS 9.2 and Mac OS X; common
Carbon applications include Adobe Photoshop 7
and Roxio Toast. A Cocoa application runs only
under Mac OS X, such as Microsoft Office v. X.
Cocoa applications perform significantly better
than Carbon under Mac OS X, and Cocoa’s
structure allows software developers to finish
an application faster.
If a program supports either Carbon or Cocoa,
it’ll work within Mac OS X (with a Cocoa appli-
cation providing the better performance) —
however, if the program is older and was exclu-
sively written for earlier versions of Mac OS
without Carbon, it won’t run in Mac OS X, and
Classic mode automatically launches to run the
application in a comfortable environment.

the sprightly bouncing Classic mode icon appear in the Dock, and a min-
imal progress bar appears (as shown in Figure 7-1). Click the arrow next
to the progress bar to expand the Classic window and watch the boot
process, just as if you were actually staring at Mac OS 9. After Classic
mode has loaded, the Classic icon disappears from the Dock, the Mac
OS 9 boot window/progress bar disappears, and the application menu
and window appear.
Note that applications running in Classic use the Mac OS 9 menu bar,
and Classic mode windows have the older Mac OS 9 window controls
(see Figure 7-2). In fact, there’s an easy way to tell whether an applica-
tion is running in Classic mode: Just to look at the Apple logo in the
top-left corner of the screen! If it’s a solid-colored Apple, the active
application is a native Mac OS X application. On the other hand, if the
Apple appears as the traditional six-color logo, the active application is
running in Classic mode.
✦Launch Classic from System Preferences. Click the System Preferences
icon in the Dock and choose Classic settings to display the dialog that
you see in Figure 7-3. Click the Start button.
✦Launch Classic from the Mac OS X Finder menu bar icon. If you’ve
enabled the Show Classic Status in Menu Bar check box (on the same
Classic settings panel in System Preferences), you get a nifty Classic
icon on your menu bar — a new feature in Panther. You can click this
menu bar icon to start, stop, or restart Classic mode — or you can click
Open Classic Preferences to display the Classic settings panel. When
Classic is running, the menu bar icon is displayed in color; when Classic
isn’t running, the menu bar icon is displayed in gray.
✦Configure Classic to run automatically. To start Classic automatically
when you log in to Mac OS X — on a system where you’re the only user,
that means when you boot your computer — click the System Preferences
icon in the Dock and choose Classic settings. Mark the Start Classic
When You Log In check box to enable it, and then press Ô+Q to exit
System Preferences and save the change.

140
Mac OS X version 10.3 Panther introduces the ability to hide Classic in
the background when it runs automatically — mark the Hide Classic
While Starting check box to enable it, and you’ll never know that your
little friend is alongside you. With this check box disabled, you get the
standard Classic startup mode with the progress bar. (Oh, and one more
caveat to the “hidden” Classic mode: If you’ve enabled the Classic icon
on the Finder menu bar, the icon will always let you know that Classic is
starting up. The little snitch. . . .)
After Classic mode is running on your Mac, any number of Mac OS Classic
applications can use it — you only have to launch Classic once, and it
remains running until you log out, Mac OS X is restarted, or Classic mode
goes to sleep (more on this nocturnal behavior later in the section
“Configuring Classic Mode”).
To stop Classic mode — thus freeing up both system RAM and your proces-
sor, as well as improving the performance of other Mac OS X applications —
open System Preferences, choose Classic settings, and click Stop on the
Start/Stop pane. (Alternatively, if the Classic icon is displayed in your Finder
menu bar, just click it and choose Stop Classic from the menu.)
The six-color Apple means your machine is running in Classic mode.

Reaching That Antique Software

Reaching That Antique Software
If you upgraded from Mac OS version 8 or 9 to Mac OS X, you’ll be happy to
know that all those legacy applications that you used before are still avail-
able. You can find them in a number of places on your system:
✦Applications (Mac OS 9) folder: Mac OS X places all the applications
that existed on your drive in the old Applications folder into this new
folder — and, in turn, all the new Mac OS X applications added to your
system are stored in the Applications folder. Although slightly schizo-
phrenic, it’s a great solution that actually works. After you upgrade to
Mac OS X, simply look in the Applications folder for your Mac OS X
native applications and open the Applications (Mac OS 9) folder for
your older stuff.
Many new Mac OS X native applications that use the Carbon API will
also install an alias (also known as a shortcut to the Windows crowd) in
your Applications (Mac OS 9) folder so that you can easily run them
when you’ve restarted in Mac OS 9. If a Mac OS X application will run
under Mac OS 9 but didn’t automatically create an alias (how rude!), it
Figure 7-3:
The Classic

Preferences.

Configuring Classic Mode
142
only takes a second to add the alias yourself in the Applications (Mac
OS 9) folder. (For more about aliases, see Book I, Chapter 2.)
✦The Mac OS 9 Desktop: Yep, you heard right, you can still reach the
icons and programs on your Mac OS 9 Desktop, including folders and
aliases. Double-click the Desktop (Mac OS 9) icon on your Mac OS X
Desktop to display it, as illustrated in Figure 7-4, and you can run appli-
cations or work on documents to your heart’s content. (Any changes
that you make to this “Desktop in a Folder” in Mac OS X will naturally be
reflected when you restart in Mac OS 9.)
To reach your Mac OS 9 Desktop items from within the Finder window,
open the System Folder — remember, this is your Mac OS 9 System
Folder, not the Mac OS X System folder (note the whomping big loss of
the word Folder there; it’s important). Within, you’ll find the Desktop
Folder, which contains the same Mac OS 9 items as the folder on your
Desktop. Hang on, I need more Diet Coke . . . it always helps me when
I’m nearing a state of confusion.
Configuring Classic Mode
The default System Preferences settings for the Classic environment can be
tweaked to enhance performance or to change when Classic starts or how it
operates. These settings include the following:
✦Startup and Other Options: Click the Advanced tab to display the
options that you see in Figure 7-5. By using the drop-down list box, you
can elect to start Classic with extensions off, or to start the Classic
Figure 7-4:

Extensions Manager to individually toggle Control Panels and
Extensions on or off. Select the Use Key Combination option and type
up to five keys — one at a time — that should be simultaneously
pressed when you start Classic (which allows you to simulate Mac OS 9
startup keys). Note: These Advanced startup options work only when
you launch Classic manually from this panel using the Start Classic
button.
✦Putting Classic to sleep: Click and drag the slider to specify the amount
of inactivity that will trigger the Classic Sleep option. When Classic is
asleep, it uses much less system memory and doesn’t bog down your
Mac’s CPU — when a Classic application is launched, it takes Mac OS X
far less time to activate Classic from Sleep mode than it does to start
Classic from scratch. To disable the Classic Sleep option, move the
slider to Never. After it’s running, Classic will continue to remain active
in the background until you manually stop it (as I describe earlier in this
chapter).

✦Rebuilding your Classic Desktop: Click the Rebuild Desktop button to
regenerate the Classic Desktop file, which stores data on which icons go
with which Classic applications as well as which types of documents
link to which Classic applications. Normally, you need only do this if
your Classic applications no longer have the proper icons or if double-
clicking a document created with a Classic application no longer
launches the proper application.
To see what’s running in the Classic environment — something roughly akin
to asking, “I wonder how refrigerant is circulated in my central air condition-
ing system?” — click the Memory/Versions tab of the Classic System
Preferences dialog. Figure 7-6 illustrates two programs running, showing the
amount of memory that they’re actually using and the maximum amount of
memory that they’re allowed to have. To show what’s running in the back-
ground in Classic mode, mark the Show Background Processes check box
to enable it. This dialog also displays the version of Mac OS that Classic is
using. (If you’re not interested in what’s happening behind the curtain in
the Classic environment, you can gleefully forget that this tab ever existed
in the Classic System Preferences settings.)

Returning to Your Mac OS 9 Roots
If you need to take the plunge and travel back in time, you might be able to
restart your Mac in Mac OS 9 for as long as you like — simply change the
system Startup Disk! (Remember, this ability to restart using Mac OS 9
depends on what model of Macintosh you own — many newer Macs can
only run Mac OS 9 in Classic mode.)
Follow these steps in Mac OS X to return to the days of yore:
1. Click the System Preferences icon in the Dock.
2. Click the Startup Disk icon to display the settings that you see in
Figure 7-7.
3. Click the Mac OS 9 System Folder to select it.
Note that if you have multiple installations of Mac OS 9 on your system
on different hard drives — as I do — you’ll have to choose the proper
System Folder on the proper drive. For those with only one Mac OS 9
System Folder, all is well.
4. Click the Restart button and then click the Save and Restart buttons
on the confirmation sheet that appears.
After you finish your fun in Mac OS 9.2 and you want to return to Mac OS X,
follow these steps:

1. Click the Apple menu and choose the Control Panels menu item.
2. Click the Startup Disk submenu item.
3. Click the Mac OS X System Folder to select it.
If you have multiple Mac OS X installations or multiple drives, you can
click the triangle next to a drive to expand the display.
4. Click the Restart button.
Voilà! You’ve returned to Wonderland. Say hello to the White Rabbit 
for me.
Mac OS X also provides two neat “Choose your operating system
weapon” startup keys you can use when booting or restarting your
system. If you hold down the X key while booting or restarting, your
Mac boots into Mac OS X — in fact, the Startup Disk choice in System
Preferences is actually changed to the Mac OS X System folder on the
current boot drive, so this eliminates the need to follow the steps that 
I just outlined! (Pretty catchy, huh? Holding down X to start the Big X,
I mean.) Alternatively, if you hold down the Option key while booting
or restarting, your Mac displays a menu of all the available operating
systems on your system, and you can pick one. Note, however, that the
Option key does not change your Startup Disk setting, so the next time
that you reboot or restart, you revert to the startup operating system
that you selected in System Preferences.

hether the voice echoes from a living room, a home office, or a col-
lege computer lab, it’s all too familiar: a call for help. No matter how
well written the application or how well designed the operating system,
sooner or later you’re going to need support. That goes for everyone from
the novice to the experienced Mac owner to the occasional e-mail user to
the most talented software developer.
In this short but oh-so-important chapter, I lead you through the various
help resources available within Mac OS X as well as native Mac OS X applica-
tions. I show you how to tap additional resources from Apple, and I also
point you to other suppliers of high-quality (and even questionable) assis-
tance from sources on the Internet and in your local area.
Displaying the Help Viewer Window
Your first line of defense is the Mac OS X Help Viewer, as shown in Figure 8-1.
To display the Help Viewer from the Finder menu, click Help and choose
Mac Help or press the Ô+? keyboard shortcut. This Help menu is context-
sensitive, so it contains different menu items when you’re working inside an
application.
As shown in Figure 8-1, the Help Viewer is divided into three sets of controls:
✦Toolbar: You can hide or display the toolbar from the View menu. The
default toolbar includes navigational controls (Back and Help Center
buttons) and the Ask a Question (or Search) text box.

Displaying the Help Viewer Window
148
✦Quick Clicks: Clicking these links takes you directly to some of the most
frequently asked Help topics for the Finder (or the application you’re
using), such as “Connecting to the Internet” and “Setting up e-mail.” To
use a Quick Click, just click once on the question that you want to
pursue.
✦Apple Web site link: Click this link to display the latest Mac OS X news
and the latest Help topics from the Apple Web site.
I know that the Help Viewer looks a little sparse at first glance. However,
when you realize how much information has to be covered to help someone
with an operating system — check out the size of the book you’re holding,
for instance — you get an idea of why Mac OS X doesn’t try to cover every-
thing on one screen. Instead, you get the one tool that does it all: the Ask a
Question text box.

Searching for Specific Stuff
To search for the help topic you need, click in the Ask a Question text box,
type one or two words that sum up your question, and press Return.
(Although you can ask a full sentence question, I’ve found that the shorter
and more concise your search criteria is, the better the relevance of your
return.) For example, typing Playing a DVD displays the topics that you see
in Figure 8-2.
Note that the topics are sorted by approximate relevance first — for exam-
ple, because the topic Using DVD Player is smack-on accurate, it appears
first because it has the highest relevance. The next topic, Types of record-
able CD and DVD media, is somewhat more distantly related, so the rele-
vance is lower.
To sort the topics alphabetically or by their location within the Help system,
click the Topic or Location column headings, respectively. You can click a
column heading again to toggle the sort order between ascending and
descending.
Because the topic Using DVD Player sounds quite promising, double-click it
to display the topic text — this particular topic displays the text that you
see in Figure 8-3. (You can also single-click on a line to display a summary at
the bottom of the window.)

As I mention in the earlier section “Displaying the Help Viewer Window,” 
I heartily recommend that you visit the Apple Web site at www.apple.com
and surf wildly to and fro. You’ll often pick up on news and reviews that you
won’t find anywhere else on the Internet.
From the opening Web screen, you should click these two tabs during every
visit to the Apple site: the Hot News tab and the Mac OS X tab. These pages
give you
✦Articles about the latest news from Cupertino
✦Downloads of the latest Mac OS X freeware, shareware, and demo-ware

A number of different help avenues are available within Mac OS X applica-
tions as well. They include

and dialogs include a Help button, as shown in Figure 8-4. Click the
button marked with ? to display the text for the settings in that dialog

✦Pop-up help for fields and controls: Most Mac OS X applications dis-
play a short line of help text when you hover the mouse pointer on top
of a field or control, as shown in Figure 8-5 when I hover my mouse
pointer over the Equalizer button in iTunes. Sometimes it’s just the
name of the item; sometimes it’s a full descriptive line. Them’s the

Other Resources to Chew On
Although the Help Viewer can take care of just about any question that you
might have about the basic controls and features of Mac OS X, you might
also want to turn to other forms of help when the going gets a little rougher.
In this last section, I cover resources that you can call on when the Help
Viewer just isn’t enough.
Voice support
As of this writing, Apple provides voice technical support for Mac OS X at
1-800-275-2273 — however, exactly when you qualify for voice support and
exactly how long it lasts depends on a number of different factors, like
whether you received Mac OS X when you bought a new machine, or
whether you purchased a support plan from Apple.
You can also try the general online support site at www.info.apple.com —
it’s a great starting point for obtaining Mac OS X help.
Mac publications
You can refer to a number of great Mac-savvy publications, both printed and
online, for help. My favorites include
✦Macworld (www.macworld.com) and MacAddict (www.macaddict.com)
magazines, both in archaic hard copy and oh-so-slick online versions
✦MacGamer (www.macgamer.com), the online gaming resource for the
Macintosh
✦MacFixIt (www.macfixit.com), a well-respected troubleshooting site
devoted to the Mac that offers downloads, news, and discussion areas
In most of my books, I mention specific Internet newsgroups that cater to
the topic I’m discussing — however, virtually all the Mac-specific news-
groups around are devoted to illegally swapping pirated games and applica-
tions, so I won’t be covering them. Also, the help that you receive from
individuals in newsgroups is sometimes misguided — and sometimes down-
right wrong, so take any claims with a grain of salt.
As a general rule, never identify yourself or provide your snail-mail or e-mail
addresses in a newsgroup post! These messages are public, and they remain
“hanging around” in cyberspace on newsgroup servers for years — you’ll be
a prime target for spam (or even worse).

Other Resources to Chew On

Local Mac outlets and user groups
Finally, you can find local resources in any medium- to large-sized town or
city: A shop that’s authorized by Apple to sell and repair Macintosh comput-
ers can usually be counted upon to answer a quick question over the phone
or provide more substantial support for a fee. (For example, my local Mac
outlet sponsors inexpensive classes for new Mac owners.)
You may also be lucky enough to have a local Macintosh user group that
you can join — members can be counted on for free answers to your sup-
port questions at meetings and demonstrations. To find a group near you,
visit the Apple User Group Support site at www.apple.com/usergroups
and use the locator.

ac OS X is rugged, stable, and reliable — and as you can read earlier
in this mini-book (in Chapter 6), practicing regular maintenance 
can help eliminate problems caused by everything from power failures to
faulty drivers to cats upon the keyboard. However, sooner or later you 
will encounter what I like to call The Dark Moments . . . a blank screen, a
locked Mac, or an external device that sits there uselessly like an expensive
paperweight.
How you handle The Dark Moments defines you as a true Mac OS X power
user because most folks seem to fall into one of two categories: Either you
panic and beat your head against the wall (which really has little effect on
the computer, when you think about it), or you set your brow in grim deter-
mination and follow the troubleshooting models that I provide in this chap-
ter to locate (and hopefully fix) the source of the problem.
Don’t Panic!
My friend, this is the first — and most important — rule of troubleshooting,
and yet another of Mark’s Maxims:
Whatever the problem, you can fix it.
Most computer owners seem to forget the idea that a hardware or software
error can be fixed because they panic — they simply see The Problem, and
somehow they feel that they’ll never be able to use their computer again.
Although the situation might look grim, don’t ignore these facts:

The Troubleshooting Process
156
✦You don’t need to scrap your Mac. As long as you haven’t taken a
hammer or a chainsaw to your Mac, the problem is only temporary.
Sure, individual components do fail over time — heck, so do people —
but the problem is certainly something that can be tracked down and
fixed without scrapping your entire computer.
✦Don’t beat yourself up. As long as you haven’t installed a virus on pur-
pose or deleted half your system files to spite yourself, the problem isn’t
your fault. Sure, it’s possible that you might have done something by
accident, but don’t blame yourself unnecessarily.
✦Trust your Apple dealer. As long as an Apple dealer is in your area, you
can always get your computer repaired professionally if a component
has gone south. (In some cases, professional help is a necessity: For
example, I’d be a fool to try to fix a power supply or a monitor on my
own because both can pack a heavy electrical punch.)
✦Rely on your backup. As long as you’ve made a backup — you did back
up your hard drive, didn’t you? — you won’t lose much (if any) work. 
(I harp about backups further in Chapter 6 of this mini-book.)
Commit these facts to head and heart, and you can rest easy while you track
down and attack the real enemy — whatever’s causing the problem.
The Troubleshooting Process
When I first conceived this chapter, I had originally decided to divide this
section into separate hardware and software troubleshooting procedures.
However, that turned out to be impractical because often you won’t know
whether a problem is caused by hardware or software until you’re practi-
cally on top of it.
Therefore, here’s the complete 12-step troubleshooting process that I
designed while working as a consultant and Macintosh hardware technician
for more than a decade. Feel free to add your own embellishments in the
margin or include reminders with Post-it Notes.
If you’re not sure quite what’s producing the error, this process is designed
to be linear — meaning that it’s meant to be followed in order — but if you
already know that you’re having a problem with one specific peripheral or
one specific application, feel free to jump to the steps that concern only
hardware or software.

Chapter 9

The Troubleshooting Process
157
Step 1: Always try a simple shut down
You’d be amazed at how often a reboot (the process of shutting down and
restarting) can cure a temporary problem. For example, this can fix the
occasional lockup in Mac OS X or a keyboard that’s not responding because
of a power failure. If possible, make sure that you first close any open docu-
ments, or you might lose unsaved work. When troubleshooting, always do
a shutdown instead of simply restarting the computer because when 
Mac OS X shuts down, all the hardware components that make up your
system are reset.
If your Mac is locked tight and you can’t use the Shut Down command from
the Apple menu, you have two choices. First, press and hold the Power
button on your Mac for a few seconds (which turns your computer off). 
If this doesn’t work — and, from time to time, it actually doesn’t — you’ll
have to physically pull the power cord from the wall (or turn off the surge
suppressor, if you’re using one).
Step 2: Check all cable connections
Check all connections: the AC power cord and the keyboard cord, as well as
any modem or network connections and all cable connections to external
peripherals. Look for loose connectors — and if you’ve got a cat or dog,
don’t forget to check for chew marks. (Yep, that’s the voice of experience
talking there.) If you’ve recently replaced a cable — especially a network,
Universal Serial Bus (USB), or FireWire cable — replace it with a spare to
see whether the problem still occurs.
Step 3: Retrace your steps
If the problem continues to occur, the next step is to consider what you’ve
done in the immediate past that could have affected your Mac. Did you
install any new software or have you connected a new peripheral? If your
Mac was working fine until you made the change to your system, the prob-
lem likely lies in the new hardware or software.
✦If you added an external device: Turn off your Mac and disconnect the
peripheral. Then turn on the computer to see whether all proceeds nor-
mally. If so, then check the peripheral’s documentation and make sure
that you correctly installed the driver — the software provided by the
device manufacturer — and that you connected it properly to the right
port. (You can also use System Profiler, which I discuss later in this
chapter, to check to see whether your Mac recognizes the external
device.) To verify that the cable works, substitute another cable of the
same type or try the peripheral on another Mac.

The Troubleshooting Process
158
Make it a practice to check the manufacturer’s Web site for the latest
driver when you get new hardware. The software that ships in the box
with your new toy could have been on the shelf for months before being
sold, and the manufacturer has probably fine-tuned the driver in the
interim.
✦If you installed new software or applied an update/patch: Follow the
guidelines in Chapter 6 of this mini-book to uninstall the application and
search for any files that it might have installed elsewhere. (Searching by
date created and date modified can help you locate files that you recently
installed.) If this fixes the problem, it’s time to contact the developer
and request technical support for the recalcitrant program; you can
always re-install the program after the problem has been solved by the
developer.
Not all versions of Mac OS X are created equal. If you’ve recently upgraded
to a major or minor new release of Mac OS X, some of the applications
that you’ve been using without trouble for months can suddenly go on
the warpath and refuse to work (or exhibit quirky behavior). If this hap-
pens, visit the developer’s Web site often to look for a patch file that will
update the application to work with the new version of Mac OS X.
✦If you’ve recently made a change within System Preferences: It’s pos-
sible that you’ve inadvertently “bumped” something. For instance, you
might have accidentally changed your modem or network settings or
perhaps made a change to your login options. Verify the settings screens
that you visited to make sure that everything looks okay. Other locations
to check include the Printer Setup Utility (which I discuss in Book VI,
Chapter 4) and your Web browser’s Preference dialog. (I cover Safari in
Book IV, Chapter 5.)
Step 4: Run Disk Utility
Next, run Disk Utility (as shown in Figure 9-1) to check for disk errors and
permissions errors — especially permissions errors, which can wreak
absolute havoc on just about any application on your hard drive. (Click the
Disk Utility icon in the Utilities folder inside your Applications folder.
Chapter 6 of this mini-book provides all the details.)
Step 5: Run antivirus software
Run your antivirus software and scan your entire system for viruses, includ-
ing all system disks and removable disks. Although Mac OS X doesn’t come
with antivirus protection built in, the world-class program Norton AntiVirus
(www.symantec.com) that you see in Figure 9-2 constantly scans each file
that you open or download for infections.

Book I
Chapter 9
Troubleshooting
the X
The Troubleshooting Process
159
Download the latest virus update — usually called a signature file or data
file — to keep your virus protection current.
Step 6: Check the Trash
Check the contents of your Trash to make sure that you haven’t inadver-
tently tossed something important that could be causing trouble for an
application. Click the Trash icon in the Dock to open the Trash window and
peruse its contents. (Hint: Switch to list mode to see the file types.) To
restore items to their rightful place, drag them from the Trash back to the
correct folder on your hard drive.
Step 7: Check online connections
If you’re connected to an Ethernet network, a cable modem, or a digital sub-
scriber line (DSL), check your equipment to make sure that you’re currently
online and receiving packets normally. Your network system administrator
will be happy to help you with this, especially if you’re blood relatives.

Utility to

The Troubleshooting Process
160
Step 8: Disable troublesome Startup items
Disable any Startup items that might be causing trouble. As you can read in
Book II, Chapter 3, Startup items are automatically launched as soon as you
log in. For example, an older application that doesn’t fully support Mac OS X
can cause problems if used as a Startup item. You can do this from the
Startup Items settings in the System Preferences Accounts panel (as shown
in Figure 9-3); click the Apple menu, choose System Preferences, click
Accounts, and then click the Startup Items button.
Unfortunately, if a Startup item doesn’t display an error message, your old
friend Trial-and-Error is just about the only sure-fire way to detect which
item (if any) is causing the problem. Click an item to select it, click the
Remove button (marked with a minus sign), and then press Ô+Q to quit
System Preferences. Shut down and reboot your Mac to see whether the
problem has been solved. (If not, don’t forget to add the item again to the
Startup Items list.)
You can also disable Startup items entirely when you reboot. If the login
window appears when you reboot your computer, hold down the Shift key
and then click the Login button. If you don’t see the login window when you
reboot, hold down the Shift key when you see the progress bar in the
startup window and continue to hold down the key until the Finder appears.

Step 9: Turn off your screen saver
Another candidate for intermittent lockups is your screen saver, especially
if you’re running a shareware effort written by a 12-year-old with a limited
attention span. Display your System Preferences, choose Desktop & Screen
Saver, and click the Screen Saver button. You can deactivate the saver
entirely (by moving the Start Screen Saver slider to Never) or choose the
Computer Name saver (which is provided by Apple) from the Screen Savers
list.
Step 10: Check for write-protection
If you’re running a multi-user ship, check to make sure that another user
with administrator access hasn’t accidentally write-protected your docu-
ments, your application, or its support files. If possible, log in with an
administrator account yourself (as I describe in Book II, Chapter 5) and then
try running the application or opening the document that you were unable
to access under your own ID.
Step 11: Check your System Profiler
If you’ve reached this point in the troubleshooting process and haven’t
found the culprit, you’ve probably experienced a hardware failure in your
Macintosh. If possible, display the Hardware category within the Apple
System Profiler (see Figure 9-4) and make sure that it’s able to recognize and
use all the internal drives, ports, and external devices on your Mac. To start
the System Profiler, click the Apple menu, choose About This Mac, and then
click the More Info button.

Troubleshooting Problems with Classic Mode
162
Step 12: Reboot with the Mac OS X Installation CD
In case your Mac is in sad shape and won’t even boot from its hard drive,
here’s a last step that you can take before you seek professional assistance:
Reboot your Mac from the Mac OS X Installation CD-ROM. Hold down the 
C key immediately after you hear the startup chord (which boots your
system from the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive) and then run Disk Utility from
the Installation Apple menu that appears. Because you’ve booted the
system from the CD-ROM, you can verify and repair problems with your
startup hard drive. After you’re done, restart your system.
Troubleshooting Problems with Classic Mode
If you encounter problems running your older Mac OS 9 applications under
Classic mode, here are suggestions that you can follow that might help:
Figure 9-4:
Use System
Profiler to

Book I
Chapter 9
Troubleshooting
the X
Troubleshooting Problems with Classic Mode
163
✦Check memory allocations: Classic applications sometimes need addi-
tional memory. If a Classic application gets snooty and demands more
memory, select the Classic application in the Finder and then press Ô+I
to display the Mac OS 9.2 Info dialog. Click the drop-down list box and
choose Memory to display the settings that you see in Figure 9-5; I usu-
ally double the suggested size, using that amount for both the Preferred
Size and Minimum Size values. Exit the Info dialog to save your changes
and then try running the application again.
✦Disable extensions: If a Classic mode extension is wreaking havoc on
your system, you can disable extensions entirely from the Classic set-
tings in System Preferences. Usually, this will also end up disabling a
significant number of features, perhaps even including FireWire and USB
support in Classic mode. However, it might help you get Classic running,
which will allow you to disable the extension that’s causing the problem
(or even deleting it entirely from your computer). You can use the Classic
Extensions Manager to toggle individual extensions on and off, which
makes it easy to test Classic mode to see which specific extension is
causing the problem. Reboot in Mac OS 9 and select the Extensions
Manager control panel from the Apple menu.
Figure 9-5:

Do I Need to Reinstall Mac OS X?
164
✦Move startup and shutdown files: If a Classic mode startup or shut-
down application is causing problems, you can move the file from the
Startup Items and Shutdown Items folders in your Mac OS 9 System
folder. (The file itself is usually an alias, so you can simply delete it if
you like.)
Do I Need to Reinstall Mac OS X?
To be honest, this is a difficult question to answer. Technically, you should
never need to reinstall the Big X, but there’s also no reason why you can’t.
I can only think of two scenarios where reinstalling the operating system
will likely solve a problem: namely, if your system files have been so heavily
corrupted — by a faulty hard drive or a rampaging virus, for example — that
you can’t boot Mac OS X at all; or if the operating system displays the death-
dealing kernel panic on a regular basis. A kernel panic displays several lines
of unbelievably technical UNIX terminology on your screen, usually over-
writing whatever’s on the monitor at the time, ending with the option to
Reboot or Continue. (This is analogous to the infamous Windows Blue
Screen of Death — I’ve grown to hate that color of blue with a passion.)
If you receive kernel panics on an ongoing basis, something is really, really
wrong. Make sure that your documents are copied to a rewriteable CD or
network drive and don’t overwrite any existing backup that you have with a
new backup because the back-up application is likely to lock up as well.
To reinstall, you must reboot from your Mac OS X Installation CD-ROM. Hold
down the C key immediately after you hear your Mac’s startup chord. (Read
the earlier section “Step 12: Reboot with the Mac OS X Installation CD.”)
It’s Still Not Moving: Troubleshooting Resources
As I mention earlier in this chapter, you can pursue other avenues to get
help when you can’t solve a troubleshooting problem on your own. Mind
you, I’m talking about professional help from sources that you can trust.
Although you can find quite a bit of free advice on the Internet (usually on
privately run Web sites and in the Internet newsgroups), most of it isn’t
worth your effort. In fact, some of it is downright wrong. That said, here are
some sources that I do recommend.

The Mac OS X Help Viewer
Although most Mac OS X owners tend to blow off the Help Viewer when the
troubleshooting gets tough, that’s never the best course of action. Always
take a few moments to search the contents of the Help Viewer — click Help
from the Finder menu — to see whether any mention is made of the problem
that you’ve encountered.
The Apple Mac OS X Support site
Home to all manner of support questions and answers, the Mac OS X Support
section of the Apple Web site (www.info.apple.com/usen/macosx/) should
be your next stop in case of trouble that you can’t fix yourself. Topics include
✦Startup issues
✦Classic mode problems
✦Internet and networking problems
✦Printing problems
You can search the Apple Knowledge Base, download the latest updates and
electronic manuals, and participate in Apple-moderated discussion boards
from this one central location.
Your local Apple dealer
Naturally, an Apple dealer can provide just about any support that you’re
likely to need — for a price — but you can usually get the answers to impor-
tant questions without any coinage changing hands. Your dealer is also well
versed in the latest updates and patches that can fix those software incom-
patibility problems. Check your telephone book for your local dealer.

T
he Finder is the heart of Mac OS X — and we all know how heart surgeons
like to tinker, don’t we? (Ouch. Start again, shall we?)
The Finder is the heart of Mac OS X, and as you might expect, it’s highly
configurable. You can customize the Finder to present icons, or you can
peruse folders with a column view that can pack much more information
onscreen at one time. Some folks prefer the default Finder toolbar, and
others like to customize it with the applications and features that they use
most often.
Decisions like these can help you transform Mac OS X into Your Personal
Operating System — and every Mac OS X power user worth the title will take
the time to apply these changes because an operating system that presents
visual information the way that you want to see it is easier and more effi-
cient to use.
No need for a hammer or saw — when you’re building the Finder of your
dreams, the only tool that you need is your mouse!
Will That Be Icons or Buttons . . . or Even Columns?
The default appearance of a window in Mac OS X uses the familiar large-
format icons that have been a hallmark of the Macintosh operating system
since Day One — but there’s no reason why you have to use them. (In fact,
most Mac OS X power users whom I know consider the icon view mode
rather inefficient and slow.) Besides the icon view shown in Figure 1-1,
Mac OS X offers two other window view modes: list and column.

Will That Be Icons or Buttons . . . or Even Columns?
170
✦List view: List view displays the folders on the volume in a hierarchical
fashion. To display the contents of a folder, you can either click the
right-facing small triangle next to the folder name — it rotates down-
ward to indicate that you’ve expanded the folder — or you can double-
click the folder icon to display the contents in a Finder window. To
collapse the contents of the folder, click the small triangle again; it
rotates back to face the right. Figure 1-2 illustrates the same Finder
window in list view.
You can resize a column by dragging the right edge of the column 
heading.
✦Column view: Figure 1-3 shows the same window in column view, in
which the volumes on your Mac OS X system are displayed on the left.
Each column on the right represents a lower level of subfolders. Click
the volume, click the desired folder in the first second column to dis-
play its contents, and so forth. (Personally, this is my favorite view —
thanks, Apple! It’s efficient and fast as all get-out.) As you drill deeper,
the columns automatically shift to the left. When you click an item
(instead of a folder), the Finder displays a preview and a quick summary
of the selected item in the rightmost column.
Figure 1-1:

Book II
Chapter 1
Building the Finder
of Your Dreams
Will That Be Icons or Buttons . . . or Even Columns?
171
Each column has its own individual scroll bar (for those really, really big
folders), and you can drag the column handle at the bottom of the sepa-
rators to resize all the columns. When you hold down Option and drag a
column handle, only the column width to the left is adjusted.
Another of my pet peeves is cluttered disks. If you’re continually having prob-
lems locating files and folders, ask yourself, “Self, do I need to organize? Am
I — gasp — cluttered?” If your answer is yes, take an hour and organize your
files logically into new folders. (Remember, I’m talking your documents and
such — not your applications, which are usually where they need to be — in
your Applications folder.) Often, documents that you create end up as strag-
glers, usually located in the root folder of your hard drive, which sooner or
later ends up looking like a biker bar after Ladies Night. (The same can be said
of many Mac OS X Desktops, too.) By keeping your root folder and Desktop
clean and saving your files in organized folders, you’ll end up wasting less
time searching for files and more time actually using them.
To switch between the three modes, click one of the three view mode but-
tons on the Finder window toolbar (the current view is highlighted) or click
the View menu and choose As Icons, As List, or As Columns. Mac OS X
places a helpful check mark next to the current view mode.

You can work your customization magic on the Finder toolbar as well! In this
section, I show you how to customize that strip of icons across the top of
the Finder window that’s affectionately called the toolbar. Or, if you like,
you’ll discover how to dismiss it entirely to gain additional real estate for
the contents of your Finder window.
Hiding and showing the toolbar
You can toggle the display of the toolbar in an active Finder window in one
of three ways:
✦By clicking the toolbar button located at the upper-right corner of the
Finder window
✦By pressing Ô+Option+T
✦By choosing View from the Finder menu and then choosing Hide (or
Show) Toolbar

Hiding and showing the status bar
The status bar at the bottom of the Finder window displays a number of
helpful informational-type tidbits about the window’s contents. Depending
on what you’ve opened, the status bar can include
✦Statistics: See the number of items in the window and the amount of free
space remaining on the volume.
✦A write-protect icon: This icon looks like a pencil with a line running
through it, as shown in Figure 1-4. This indicates that you don’t have
write permissions for the contents of the window — or the volume
where the contents reside. (Note that this does not necessarily mean
that folders at a lower level are write-protected as well.) You’ll typically
see this icon when you’re viewing the contents of a CD or DVD, where
everything is write-protected.

✦The current automatic icon view setting: For windows in icon view, the
status bar can display either a grid icon (indicating that the icons are
set to snap-to-grid) or four tiny icons (indicating that the icons are dis-
played in a sorted order). You’ll discover more about these settings
later in the section “Configuring the View Options.”
To toggle the display of the status bar, choose View from the Finder menu
and then choose Show/Hide Status Bar.
Giving your toolbar big tires and a loud exhaust
The default icons on the toolbar include
✦Back and Forward: Like a Web browser, clicking the Back button moves
you to the previous window’s contents. If you use the Back button, the
Forward button appears. Click this to return to the contents that you
had before clicking the Back button.
✦View: Click this control to toggle between the three view modes (icon,
list, or column).
✦Action: Click this drop-down list box to display context-sensitive com-
mands for the selected items — in plain English, you’ll see the commands
that you would see if you held down Control and clicked the selection.
✦Search: Okay, I know it’s not technically an icon — but the Search box
is a member of the default toolbar family nonetheless. You can search
for a file or folder using this box — more on this later in the section
“Searching for Files from the Toolbar.”
But, as one of my favorite bumper stickers so invitingly asks, “Why be
normal?” Adding or deleting items from the toolbar is a great way to cus-
tomize Mac OS X. Follow these steps:
1. From the active Finder window menu, choose View➪Customize
Toolbar to display the window that you see in Figure 1-5.
Along with controls like Back, Forward, and View, you’ll find a number
of system functions, like Eject and Burn.
2. To add items to the toolbar, drag them from the Customize Toolbar
dialog up to the toolbar at the top of the window.
To add an item between existing buttons, drop it between the buttons,
and they obligingly move aside. If you get exuberant about your toolbar
and you add more icons than it can hold, a double-right arrow appears
at the right side of the toolbar — a click on the arrow displays a pop-up
menu with the icons that won’t fit.

175
In fact, the Customize Toolbar dialog isn’t necessary for some toolbar
modifications: You can also drag files, folders, and disk volumes directly
from the Desktop or other Finder windows and add them to your tool-
bar at any time. To remove a file, folder, or disk volume from the toolbar,
hold down Control and click the icon on the toolbar; then click Remove
Item from the pop-up menu — it vanishes like a CEO’s ethics.
You can always drag a file or folder into the Sidebar column at the left of
the Finder window — the Sidebar column is a separate entity entirely
from the toolbar.
3. To remove an item from the toolbar, drag it off to the center of the
window, amongst the other icons.
4. Naturally, you can swap item positions — just click an item, drag it to
its new spot, and then release the mouse button.
5. To choose the default toolbar configuration or to start over, drag the
default bar at the bottom of the window to the toolbar at the top.
This is the toolbar equivalent of tapping your ruby slippers together
three times and repeating, “There’s no place like home.”
6. To toggle between displaying the icons with accompanying text (the
default), the icon only, or a text button only, click the Show drop-
down list box at the bottom of the Customize Toolbar dialog.
7. After you arrange your toolbar as you like, click the Done button.

Searching for Files from the Toolbar
176
Searching for Files from the Toolbar
Need to find a file fast? The default toolbar has just what you need — the
Search field, which offers the ability to search for a string of text within your
filenames. (In fact, it’s a subset of the Find dialog that you see when you
press Ô+F; I cover the Find dialog in the next section.) To locate a file with
the Search field, follow these steps:
1. Click the drop-down list button at the left of the Search field and
select the locations that you want to search.
The button carries a magnifying glass. (The folks at Apple are really,
really into Sherlock Holmes . . . so am I!)
To search only a single folder or a group of folders, select them first and
then choose Selection from the Search field list.
2. Click in the Search box on the toolbar and type the text that you want

Searching for Files from the Find Dialog
Although the Search box on the toolbar is all that you’ll need to find most
files and folders, sometimes you need a little more flexibility and power to
locate what you need on your system. To do so, enter the Find dialog, where
you can create custom filename searches with more complex criteria or
even search within certain files themselves for the text that you specify. To
locate a file by using the Find dialog, follow these steps:
1. With the Finder active, display the Find dialog by pressing Ô+F (or
choose File from the Finder menu and then click Find).
Mac OS X displays the Find dialog that you see in Figure 1-7.
2. Click the Search In drop-down list box to specify where you want to
search.
You can choose Everywhere (your entire system, including network vol-
umes), Local Disks (just the volumes actually inside or connected to
Figure 1-7:
The Find
dialog is
ready to
pinpoint text
within your
files.

Searching for Files from the Find Dialog

your Mac), your Home folder, or Specific Places. When you choose
Specific Places, the Find dialog presents you with Add and Remove but-
tons that you can use to add particular volumes and folders. Typically,
you can leave this field set to Everywhere, which is the default.
3. To search for a specific filename, click in the text box to the right of
the Name and the Contains drop-down criteria lists and then type all
or part of the filename.
4. If you want to search for a text string within the document itself, click
in the text box to the right of the Content drop-down criteria list and
then type that text.
The text must appear just as you’ve typed it, so it’s always a good idea
to restrict what you’re searching for to a minimum of words that you’re
fairly sure will cause a match. (Content searching is not case-sensitive,
though.) Content searching works only when you’ve generated an index,
which I explain later in this section.
5. To include additional search criteria lines for either filename or con-
tent, click the button with the plus sign next to the last criteria line.
You can limit your results based on the date that the file or folder was
last modified, when it was created, the file type, the size, the extension,
or whether the file or folder is marked visible or hidden (such as a
system file). Figure 1-8 illustrates the Find dialog with all search criteria
active — if Mac OS X can’t find it with all this information, it’s just plain
not on your system!
You can also remove a search criteria line by clicking the button with
the minus sign.
6. After you add more specific search parameters, click the Search
button to begin the hunt.
Your search results appear, as shown in Figure 1-9.
You can click an entry name to reveal the location of a matching file or
folder, or double-click it to launch it.
7. Close this dialog to return to the Find dialog, where you can perform
another search if you wish.
8. Click the Close button in the Find dialog to return to the Finder.
As I mention earlier, searching by content requires that you index your files.
Essentially, this is a humongous database that Mac OS X builds that con-
tains cross-references to words in all the file types with decipherable text.
(This includes most word processing documents, text files, and Web pages.)
To generate an index for a folder or a disk volume, follow these steps:
1. Select the item in a Finder window and press Ô+I to display our old
friend, the Info dialog.

2. Click the triangle next to the Content Index heading to expand that
section of the dialog (see Figure 1-10).
3. Click the Index Now button to begin the indexing process.
After indexing completes, the Info dialog displays the time and date
when the item was last indexed.
On a full hard drive, indexing can take forever and a day (and another week
after that), so I recommend indexing only the folders that you need to
search — like those folders that contain your documents. You can delete an
index and re-index at any time, which will freshen the index with the latest
changes to your files.
Configuring the View Options
As I discuss at the beginning of the chapter, you’ve got a lot of control over
how Mac OS X presents files and folders in the Finder. In this section, I cover
how you can make further adjustments to the view from your windows.
(Pardon me for the ghastly cliché posing as a pun.)
Setting icon view options
First, allow me to provide a little detail on housekeeping in the Big X. After a
few hours of work, a Finder window in icon mode can look something like a
teenager’s room: stuff strewn all over the place, as demonstrated with my
Applications folder in Figure 1-11. To restore order to your Desktop, click in
any open area of the active window and then choose View➪Clean Up. This
command leaves the icons in approximately the same position but snaps
them to an invisible grid so that they’re aligned, as shown in Figure 1-12.

Configuring the View Options
182
Now that things are in alignment, work with the icon view options.
(Naturally, you’ll want the active Finder window in icon view first, so click
View and choose As Icons, or press Ô+1.) From the Finder menu, choose
View➪Show View Options — or press that swingin’ Ô+J shortcut — to dis-
play the View Options dialog that you see in Figure 1-13. (Remember that
these are the options available for icon view; I discuss the options for list
and column view later in this chapter.)
Note these first two radio buttons, which also appear in the list View
Options dialog:
✦This Window Only: Select the This Window Only radio button to apply
the changes that you make only to the Finder window that opens when
you open the selected item — in other words, the item that appears in
the window’s title bar.
For example, any changes made to the settings in Figure 1-13 will affect
only my Applications folder because it was the active Finder window
when I pressed Ô+ J. (Note: The window name also appears as the title
of the View Options dialog.)
✦All Windows: Select the All Windows radio button to apply the changes
that you make to all Finder windows that you view in your current mode.
Of course, Mac OS X remembers the changes that you make within the View
Options dialog, no matter which view mode you’re configuring. Now, on to
the other changes that you can make from this dialog, which include
Figure 1-13:

✦Resizing your Desktop icons: Click and drag the Icon Size slider to
shrink or expand the icons on your Desktop. The icon size is displayed
in pixels above the slider.
✦Resizing icon label text: Click the up- and down-arrows to the right of
the Text Size drop-down box to choose the font size (in points) for icon
labels.
✦Moving icon label text: Select either the Bottom (default) or the Right
radio button to choose between displaying the text under your Desktop
icons or to the right of the icons.
✦Snap to Grid: Enable this check box to automatically align icons to a grid
within the window, just as if you had used the Clean Up menu command.
✦Show Item Info: With this check box enabled, Mac OS X displays the
number of items within each folder in the window.
✦Show Icon Preview: If you enable this check box, the Finder displays
icons for image files using a miniature of the actual picture. (A cool fea-
ture for those with digital cameras — however, this does take extra pro-
cessing time because Mac OS X has to load each image file and shrink it
down to create the icon.)
✦Keep Arranged By: To sort the display of icons in a window, enable this
check box and choose one of the following criteria from its drop-down
list: by name, date modified, date created, size, or item type.
✦Choosing a background: To select a background for the window, select
one of three radio buttons here:
• White: This is the default.
• Color: Click a color choice from the color block that appears if you
make this selection.
• Picture: Select this radio button and then click the Select button to
display a standard Open dialog. Navigate to the location where the
desired image is stored, click it once to select it, and then click
Open.
After all your changes are made and you’re ready to return to work, click the
dialog’s Close button to save your settings.
Setting list view options
If you’re viewing the active window in list view, choose View➪Show View
Options to display the View Options dialog that you see in Figure 1-14.

Configuring the View Options
184
Like in icon view, select from one of the two top radio buttons to apply the
changes that you make in this dialog to this window only or to all windows
that you view in list mode. The settings include
✦Resizing your Desktop icons: You can choose from two sizes of Desktop
icons.
✦Resizing icon label text: Click the up- and down-arrows to the right of
the Text Size drop-down box to choose the font size (in points) for icon
labels.
✦Show Columns: Enable the check boxes under this heading to display
additional columns in list view, including the date that the item was
modified, the creation date, the size, the item type, the version (sup-
plied by most applications), the label color, and any comments that
you’ve added in the Info dialog for that item. (In my personal opinion,
the more columns that you add, the more unwieldy the Finder gets, so
I advise disabling the display of columns that you won’t use.)
✦Use Relative Dates: Enable this check box to display modification dates
and creation dates with relative terms, such as Today or Yesterday. If this
freaks you out, disable this check box to force all dates to act like adults.
✦Calculate All Sizes: Enable this check box to have Mac OS X display the
actual sizes of folders, including all the files and subfolders they con-
tain. (Handy for figuring out where all your disk space went, no?) Note:
Using this option takes processing time, so I recommend that you avoid
using it unless you really need to see the size.
To save your settings, click the dialog’s Close button.

Setting column view options
To make changes to view options in column view mode, choose View➪Show
View Options to display the View Options dialog that you see in Figure 1-15.
You only have three column view options, and any changes that you make to
this dialog are always reflected in every column view:
✦Resizing icon label text: Click the Text Size drop-down box to choose
the font size (in points) for icon labels.
✦Show Icons: Enable this check box to display icons in the columns — if
this option is disabled, the icons don’t appear, and you’ll gain a little
space.
✦Show Preview Column: If this check box is enabled, clicking a file in
column mode will display a thumbnail (reduced image) and preview
information in the right-most column, as shown in Figure 1-16.
If you store a slew of QuickTime movies and digital images on your
drive, the Preview column is great. (You can even play a QuickTime
movie from the Preview column.)
Click the dialog’s Close button to save your settings and return to the
Finder.

Setting Finder Preferences
Finally, you can change a number of settings to customize the Finder itself.
From the Finder menu, click Finder and choose the Preferences menu item
to display the Finder Preferences dialog that you see in Figure 1-17.
In the General section, the preference settings include
✦Displaying icons on the Desktop: Enable these check boxes to display
your hard disks, removable volumes (including CDs, DVDs, and Zip
disks), and connected network servers.
✦New Finder Windows Open: Click the drop-down list box to specify the
spot where a new Finder window should open. By default, a new
window displays the contents of your Home folder.
✦Always Open Folders in a New Window: When this check box is
enabled, double-clicking a folder will open it in a new Finder window, as
did earlier versions of Mac OS. (If disabled, the contents of the folder
appear in the same Finder window, which makes it easier to focus on
just the folder you need at the moment.)

Setting Finder Preferences
187
✦Open New Windows in Column View: When you enable this check box,
each new Finder window that you open automatically uses column view.
(If disabled, the new window uses the last view mode you used.)
✦Spring-loaded Folders and Windows: It sounds a little wacky, but using
this feature can definitely speed up file copying! If this check box is
enabled, you can drag an item on top of a folder — without releasing the
mouse button — and after a preset time (controlled by the Delay slider), a
spring-loaded window appears to show you the folder’s contents. At that
point, you can either release the mouse button to drop the file inside the
folder (upon which the window disappears), or you can drag the icon on
top of another subfolder to spring it forth and drill even deeper.
The Labels preference panel is a simple one — just click next to each label
color to type your own text for that label. (I’ve gotta recommend red for
deadlines and green for contracts . . . call me sentimental.)
From the Sidebar preferences panel, you can choose which default items
should appear in the Finder window Sidebar column. Your choices include
locations (like your Home and Applications folders), network servers,
removable media, the Desktop itself, and — naturally — your hard drives.
To add a default item to the Sidebar column, select the corresponding check
box to enable it, or disable the check box to banish that item forthwith.
The Advanced preference settings include
✦Always Show File Extensions: If this check box is enabled, the Finder
displays the file extensions at the end of filenames, à la Windows. This
Figure 1-17:

Setting Finder Preferences
188
comes in handy for some applications, where everything from a docu-
ment to a preference file to the application itself all share the same icon.
However, I find extensions distasteful and leave things set with the
default of extensions off.
✦Show Warning Before Emptying the Trash: By default, this check box
is enabled, and Mac OS X will display a confirmation dialog before allow-
ing you to — in the words of Mac OS X patrons around the world — toss
the Bit Bucket. If you’re interested in speed and trust your judgment
(and your mouse finger), you can disable this setting.
✦Languages for Searching File Contents: Click the Select button under
this heading to specify which languages the Finder should use when
indexing files for the Find dialog — naturally, the fewer the languages
you choose, the faster the entire indexing process becomes.
When you’ve made the desired changes to the Finder Preferences, click the
dialog’s Close button to save your settings and return to the Finder.

 Cleaning and sorting the Mac OS X Desktop
“T
weak! Tweak!” It’s not the cry of some exotic bird — that’s the call of
the wild Mac Power User. Power users like to tweak their Mac OS X
Desktops just so, with that menu color, this background, and those applica-
tions in the Dock. Non-computer types just can’t understand the importance
of the proper arrangement of your virtual workplace: When things are famil-
iar and customized to your needs, you’re more productive, and things get
done faster. In fact, if you’ve set up multiple users on your computer under
Mac OS X, the Big X automatically keeps track of each user’s Desktop and
restores it when that person logs in. (For example, when you use the Mac,
you get that background photo of Farrah Fawcett from the ’70s while your
daughter gets Britney Spears.)
In this chapter, I show you what you can do to produce a Desktop that’s
uniquely your own, including tweaks that you can make to the background
and your Desktop icons. I’ll also show you how to use Desktop Stickies
instead of a forest of paper slips covering your monitor.
With your Mac OS X Desktop clad in the proper harmonious colors — yes,
that can be your favorite photo of Elvis himself — and your new Dock icons
ready for action, you are indeed prepared for whatever lies ahead in your
computing world!
Changing the Background

owner who didn’t change his or her background when presented with the
opportunity. Favorite backgrounds usually include
✦Humorous cartoons and photos that can bring a smile to your face
(even during the worst workday)
✦Scenic beauty
✦Photos of family and friends (or the latest Hollywood heartthrob)
✦The company logo — I’m not sure it does much for morale, but it does
impress the boss
If you do decide to spruce up your background, you have three choices: You
can select one of the default Mac OS X background images, choose a solid
color, or specify your own image. All three backgrounds are chosen from the
Desktop & Screen Saver panel, located within System Preferences (as illus-
trated in Figure 2-1).

You can also hold down Control, click on the Desktop, and choose Change
Desktop Background from the pop-up contextual menu (or right-click, if
you’re using a heathen mouse with multiple buttons).
Picking something Apple
To choose a background from one of the collections provided by Apple,
click one of these groups from the list at the left:
✦Apple Background Images: These default backgrounds range from
simple patterns to somewhat strange and ethereal flux shapes. (You’ll
have to see them to understand what I mean.)
✦Nature: Scenic beauty: blades of grass, sand dunes, snowy hills . . . that
sort of thing.
✦Abstract: Even weirder twisting shapes in flux, this time with bright con-
trasting colors. Good for a psychiatrist’s office.
✦Solid Colors: For those who desire a soothing solid shade — more on
this in the next section.
✦Pictures Folder: This displays the images saved in the Pictures folder
by the active user.
✦Choose Folder: You can open a folder containing images and display
them instead. (I discuss this in more detail in a page or two.)
If you see something you like, click the thumbnail, and Mac OS X displays it
in the well and automatically refreshes your background so that you can see
what it looks like. (By the way, in the Apple universe, a well is a sunken
square area that displays an image — in this case, the background image
that you’ve selected.)
Mac OS X can manipulate the way that the background appears on your
Desktop. Click the drop-down list box next to the well and you can choose to
✦Tile the background: This repeats the image to cover the Desktop. (This
is usually done with pattern images to produce a smooth, creamy, seam-
less look.)
✦Fill the screen: This can be used with a solid color to get uniform 
coverage.
✦Stretch the background to fit the Desktop: If your Desktop image is
smaller than the Desktop acreage, this works — but be warned, if you
try to stretch too small of an image over too large a Desktop, the pixi-
lated result can be pretty frightening. (Think of enlarging an old Kodak
Instamatic negative into a 16 x 20 poster. Dots, dots, dots.)
✦Center the image on the Desktop: This is my favorite solution for
Desktop images that are smaller than your resolution.

Changing the Screen Saver
192
Note that this drop-down list appears only if the Desktop picture that you
select is not one of the standard Apple images. All the pictures in the Apple
Background Images, Nature, Abstract, and Solid Colors categories are auto-
matically scaled to the size of your screen.
To change your Desktop background automatically on a regular basis, enable
the Change Picture check box and then choose the delay period from the
drop-down list box. To display the images in random order, also enable the
Random Order check box; otherwise, Mac OS X displays them in the order
that they appear in the folder.
I just gotta have lavender
As I mention earlier, for those who want their favorite color without the dis-
traction of an image, one can choose from a selection of solid colors. You can
choose from these colors the same way that you’d pick a default Mac OS X
background image (as I mention in the previous section).
Selecting your own photo
Finally, you can drag your own image into the well from a Finder window to
add your own work of art. To view thumbnails of an entire folder, click the
Pictures Folder (to display the contents of your personal Pictures folder) or
click Choose Folder to specify any folder on your system. (Alternatively, you
can drag a folder from the Finder to the thumbnail window.) Click the
desired thumbnail to embellish your Desktop.
Changing the Screen Saver
Screen savers are another popular item. Because I cover the Screen Saver
preferences in Chapter 3 of this mini-book, I’ll simply illustrate how to

Adding Stickies
195
Adding Stickies
Stickies are interesting little beasts — I don’t know their genus or phyla, but
they’re certainly handy to have around. To be technical for a moment, a
Stickie is actually nothing more than a special type of application window,
but these windows remain on your Desktop as long as the Stickies applica-
tion is running.
I use Stickies for anything that a Post-it Note can handle, including
✦Reminders that you don’t want to misplace
✦Snippets of text that you want to temporarily store while your Mac is
turned off (without launching a behemoth like Word or digging for
TextEdit)
✦Boilerplate (repeated and standard) text that you’re constantly includ-
ing in your documents, like your address
✦A quick note that includes someone’s e-mail address or phone number
✦Today’s Dilbert cartoon from www.dilbert.com
A Stickie can contain data pasted from the Clipboard, or you can simply type
directly into the Stickies application window. Stickie windows can include
graphics and different fonts and colors. You can even locate specific text
from somewhere in your vast collection of Stickies by using the Find com-
mand. (And you don’t use up our bark-covered friends of the forest, either.)
In Book I, I discuss the Mac OS X Services menu — you can make a Stickie
note from the Finder Services menu, as well.
Follow these steps to stick your way to success:
1. Open your Applications folder and run the Stickies application to 
display the new window that you see in Figure 2-4.
The text cursor is already idling in the new window. (The other windows
are Stickies, too, but they contain display text from the application. If
you like, you can close them.)
2. Type text in the window or press Ô+V to paste the contents of the
Clipboard into the window.
You can also import the contents of an existing file into a Stickie — just
click File and then choose Import Text to display a standard Open dialog.
3. You can add text formatting, change the text font, and change the
color of the font from the Font menu.
From the Note menu, you can also choose to make the Stickie translu-
cent. (No pressing reason, they just look cool.)

Adding Stickies
196
4. To change the Stickie’s color, click the Color menu and choose the
appropriate hue.
5. Resize and drag the Stickie window to the desired location.
To shrink and expand the Stickie window, click the icon at the upper-right
corner or press Ô+M to toggle between a miniaturized view (showing
only the title bar) and the expanded view.
To automatically run the Stickies application each time that you log on, open
the Accounts settings in System Preferences and click your account in the
list. Click the Startup Items button and add Stickies to the list by clicking the
plus button.
To delete a Stickie, simply click the Close button at the upper-left corner of
the Stickie window. Or, click on the Stickie to make it the active note and then
click Close. Stickies display a dialog to confirm that you want to close the
note; click Save to save the contents in a file or click the Don’t Save button
to close the note and discard its contents.
To close the Stickies application completely, click any note and press Ô+Q —
the application will remember the position and contents of each note until
you launch it again.

Customizing the Dock
197
Customizing the Dock
In terms of importance, the Dock — the launch pad for applications and doc-
uments that appears on your Desktop — ranks right up there with the com-
mand center of a modern nuclear submarine. As such, it had better be easy
to customize, and naturally, Mac OS X doesn’t let you down.
Adding applications and extras to the Dock
Why be satisfied with just the icons that Apple places in the Dock? You can
add your own applications, files, and folders to the Dock as well.
✦Adding applications: You can add any application to your Dock by
simply dragging its icon into the area to the left of the separator line
(which appears between applications and folders or documents); the
existing Dock icons will obligingly move aside to make a space for it
wherever you like.
Attempting to place an application on the right of the separator line will
send it to the Trash (if the Trash icon is highlighted when you release
the button), so beware.
✦Adding files and folders: Folders and volume icons can be added to the
Dock by dragging the icon into the area to the right of the separator line.
(Attempting to place these to the left of the separator line will open an
application with the contents, which usually doesn’t work.) To open the
location in a Finder window, click and hold the mouse button (or press
Control when you click) to display a Dock menu like the one you see in
Figure 2-5, where you can open documents and run applications. Now
that, my friends, is genuine sassy!
✦Adding Favorites: You can drag any URL from Safari directly into the
area to the right of the separator line. Clicking that icon automatically
opens your browser and displays that page. (Safari gets the treatment in
Book IV, Chapter 5.)
To remove an icon from the Dock, just click and drag it off the Dock — you get
a rather silly (but somehow, strangely satisfying) animated cloud of debris,
and the icon is no more. Note, however, that the original application, folder,
or volume is not deleted — just the Dock icon is permanently excused. If you
like, you can delete almost any of the default icons that Mac OS X installs in
the Dock; only the Finder and Trash icons must remain in the Dock.

If you can’t delete items from the Dock, you’re using a Managed account —
that’s a Standard user account with certain limitations set. (In this case,
your account is set to Some Limits, and your administrator has disabled the
Modify the Dock check box in your account.) You’ll need an Admin-level
user to log in; then visit the Accounts panel in System Preferences and
enable the check box again. For more information on user accounts, see
Chapter 5 of this mini-book.
Resizing the Dock
You can change the size of the Dock from the Dock settings in System
Preferences — I explain this in more detail in Book II, Chapter 3 — but
here’s a simpler way to resize the Dock, right from the Desktop.
Move your mouse cursor over the separator line in the Dock, and the cursor
turns into a funky line with arrows pointing up and down. This is your cue to
click and drag while moving the mouse up and down, which will expand and
shrink the Dock, respectively.
You can also hold down the Control key and click when the funky line cursor
is visible — this allows you to change your Dock preferences without the
hassle of opening System Preferences and displaying the Dock settings.

Arranging Your Precious Desktop
Finally, consider the layout of the Desktop itself. You can set the options for
icon placement from the Finder View menu. Just like the options for Finder
windows that I cover in Chapter 1 of this mini-book, you can clean up and
arrange your Desktop by name, date, size, or kind.
The View Options for the Desktop are slightly different than the View Options
for a Finder window in icon view. (Garner the scoop on setting these prefer-
ences in Chapter 1 of this mini-book.) First, you choose a background for the
Finder from System Preferences. Also, you don’t have to worry about whether
the options are global or not . . . you only have one Desktop, after all.

with System Preferences
In This Chapter
 Displaying and customizing settings in System Preferences
 Saving your changes
 Changing settings
L
ike the Mac OS 9 Control Panel before it, the System Preferences window
is the place to practice behavior modification in Mac OS X. The settings
that you specify in System Preferences will affect the majority of the applica-
tions that you use as well as the hardware that you connect to your Mac,
your Internet and network traffic, the appearance and activity on your
Desktop, and how Mac OS X handles money, dates, and languages. Oh, and
don’t forget your screen saver.
In this chapter, I discuss the many settings in System Preferences — you’ll
discover what does what and how you can customize the appearance and
operation of Mac OS X.
The Preferred Way to Display the Preferences
Apple has made it easy to open the System Preferences window. Just click
the System Preferences icon (looks like a wall light switch, next to the Apple
logo) in the Dock, and the window shown in Figure 3-1 appears. You can also
open the window by clicking the Apple menu and selecting the System
Preferences item.
Note that the System Preferences window has its own toolbar, which you
can customize with the icons that you use the most. Simply drag the desired
icon from the System Preferences window and drop it on the toolbar to add
it. To display all the System Preferences panels at any time, click the Show
All button in the toolbar’s upper-left corner.
You can also display all the System Preferences panes in alphabetical order,
which can make it easier to choose a pane if you’re unsure what group it’s
in. Choose View➪Organize Alphabetically. (Note that you can also select any
pane directly from the View menu.)

Saving Your Preferences
202
Saving Your Preferences
You’ll note that there’s no Save or Apply button on the System Preferences
window. Illustrating the elegant design of Mac OS X, simply quitting System
Preferences automatically saves all the changes that you make. (However,
some panes in System Preferences have an Apply Now button that you can
click to apply your changes immediately.) Like any other Mac OS X applica-
tion, you can quit the System Preferences window by pressing Ô+Q or by
choosing System Preferences➪Quit System Preferences.
Let’s Get Personal
The first stop on your tour of the System Preferences window is the Personal
section. No singles ads here — this section is devoted to settings that you
make to customize the appearance and operation of your Desktop and login
account.
Appearance preferences
The Appearance group appears in Figure 3-2.
Figure 3-1:
Set your
System

203
These settings are
✦Appearance: From this drop-down list, choose a color to be used for
buttons, menus, and windows.
✦Highlight Color: From this drop-down list, choose a color to be used to
highlight selected text in fields and drop-down list boxes.
✦Place Scroll Arrows: Select either radio button here to put the scroll
bar arrow buttons together (at the bottom of the scroll bar, in the lower-
right corner of the window) or at the top and bottom of the scroll bar.
✦Click in the Scroll Bar To: By default, Mac OS X jumps to the next or
previous page when you click in an empty portion of the scroll bar.
Mark the Scroll to Here radio button to scroll the document to the
approximate position in relation to where you clicked. (You can also
choose smooth scrolling, which looks cool — but many folks think that
it’s too slow compared with the default scrolling speed.) If you enable
the Minimize When Double Clicking a Window Title Bar check box, you
can minimize a Finder or application window by simply double-clicking
the window’s title bar.

204
✦Number of Recent Items: The default number of recent applications and
recent documents — available from the Recent Items item in the Apple
menu, which you can read more about in Book I, Chapter 3 — is 10. To
change the default, click either of the drop-down list boxes here and
choose up to 50. (Personally, I like 20 or 30 for each.)
✦Font Smoothing Style: Click this drop-down list for choices to make the
text on your monitor or flat-panel appear more like the printed page.
The best choices are Standard (for a typical CRT monitor) and Medium
(for a typical flat-panel LCD display).
✦Turn Off Text Smoothing for Font Sizes: Below a certain point size, text
smoothing isn’t much good for most on-screen fonts. By default, any
font displayed at 8 points or smaller isn’t smoothed, which is suitable
for a high-end video card and monitor. If you have an older monitor or a
low-end video card, you can speed up the display of text by turning off
text smoothing for fonts up to 12 points.
Desktop and screen saver preferences
Figure 3-3 illustrates the settings in the Desktop & Screen Saver group.
The settings here are
✦Current Desktop Picture: You can drag a picture from the thumbnail
field at the bottom half of the screen and drop it into the well (the
square empty box in Figure 3-3) to use it as your Desktop background.
To display a different image collection or open a folder of your own
images, click the Choose Folder entry in the left column and browse for
your heart’s desire. (To add an entire folder of images as a collection,
drag a folder to the well.)
✦Arrangement: As I explain in Chapter 2 of this mini-book, you can tile
your background image, center it, and stretch it to fill the screen. The
Arrangement control appears only when you’re using your own pic-
tures, so you won’t see it if you’re using a desktop image supplied by
Apple.
✦Change Picture: Enable this check box to change the Desktop back-
ground automatically after the delay period that you set, including each
time that you log in and each time that your Mac wakes up from sleep
mode.
✦Random Order: To display screens randomly, enable the Random Order
check box — otherwise, the backgrounds are displayed in the sequence
in which they appear in the thumbnail strip.

Click the Screen Saver tab and you’ll see the following settings:
✦Screen Savers: In the Screen Savers list at the left, click the screen saver
that you want to display an animated Preview of on the right. To try out
the screen saver in full-screen mode, click the Test button. (You can end
the test by moving your mouse.) If the screen saver module that you
select has any configurable settings, click the Configure button to display
them. (You can tell whether it has configurable settings by whether the
Configure button is enabled or disabled.) Finally, click the Open Energy
Saver button to jump to the Energy Saver System Preference settings,
where you can control how and when Mac OS X enters sleep mode.
✦Activation: Click and drag the slider here to specify the period of inac-
tivity that will trigger the screen saver. To disable the screen saver,
choose the Never setting at the far right of the slider.
✦Use Random: Just what it says — if this check box is enabled, a different
screen saver module is used each time that the screen saver is activated.

206
✦Hot Corners: You can click any of the four drop-down list boxes at the
four corners of the screen to specify that corner as an activation hot
corner (which immediately activates the screen saver) or as a disabling
hot corner (which prevents the screen saver from activating). As long as
the mouse pointer stays in the disabling hot corner, the screen saver
will not kick in — no matter how long a period of inactivity passes. Note
that you can also set the Exposé activation corners from here.
Dock preferences
The Dock group is shown in Figure 3-4.
Settings here are
✦Dock Size: Move this slider to change the overall size of the Dock.
✦Magnification: With this check box enabled, a Dock icon will magically
expand like the national deficit when you move your mouse cursor over
it. You can move the Magnification slider to specify just how much mag-
nification is right for you.
This feature is useful for helping you click a particular Dock icon if
you’ve resized the Dock smaller than its default dimensions, or if you
have a large number of items in the Dock.

207
✦Position on Screen: Choose from three radio buttons to make that
crazy Dock appear at the left, bottom, or right edge of your Desktop.
✦Minimize Using: By default, Mac OS X animates a window when it’s
shrunk into the Dock (and when it’s expanded back into a full window).
From the Minimize Using drop-down list, you can choose from a genie-
in-a-bottle effect or a scale-up-or-down-incrementally effect. To demon-
strate, choose an effect and then click the Minimize button (the yellow
button in the upper-left corner) on the System Preferences window.
If you don’t like these minimizing effects or you’re running on an older
G3 Mac, you can turn minimizing effects off to save processing time and
speed up Mac OS X.
✦Animate Opening Applications: By default, Mac OS X has that happy,
slam-dancing feeling when you launch an application: The application’s
icon bounces up and down in the Dock two or three times to draw your
attention and indicate that the application is loading. If you find this
effervescence overly buoyant or distracting, disable this check box.
✦Automatically Hide and Show the Dock: If you like, the Dock can stay
hidden until you need it, thus reclaiming a significant amount of
Desktop space for your application windows. Enable this check box to
hide the Dock whenever you’re not using it.
To display a hidden Dock, move your mouse pointer over the edge of
the Desktop where it’s hiding.
Exposé preferences
Figure 3-5 illustrates the Exposé settings — new in Panther — that you can
configure in this group.
The settings here are
✦Active Screen Corners: These four drop-down list boxes operate just
like those in the Screen Savers panel, but they control the operation of
Panther’s Exposé feature. Click one to specify that corner as an All
Windows corner (which displays all windows on your desktop), an
Application Windows corner (which displays only the windows from the
active application), or a Desktop corner (which moves all windows to
the outside of the screen to uncover your Desktop). Note that you can
also set the Screen Saver Start and Disable corners from here.
✦Keyboard: Click each drop-down list box to set the key sequences for
all three Exposé functions (as I just explained): All Windows,
Application Windows, and Desktop.

Let’s Get Personal
208
International preferences
The International group appears in Figure 3-6.
✦Language tab: Choose the preferred order for language use in menus
and dialogs as well as the standards that Mac OS X will use for each
script style.
✦Formats tab: Find these settings here:
• Date: You can select a region and use its date conventions (month-
day-year versus day-month-year), or you can build a custom format
for both the long date (Saturday, September 28, 2003) and short date
(9/28/2003) used throughout Mac OS X. The changes that you make
are immediately reflected in the sample box at the bottom of the
window.
• Time: Like Date, you can select a region to use the preset time con-
ventions. You can choose 12-hour or 24-hour (military) time formats,

change the time separator (colons, a period, or a dash), and specify
different suffixes for morning (a.m.) and evening (p.m.).
• Numbers: These convention settings determine the separators used
for large numbers or numbers with decimals, as well as the currency
symbol that you want to use and where it appears in a number. You
can also choose between standard (US) and metric measurement
systems.
✦Input Menu tab: Each check box toggles the keyboard layouts available
from the Input menu. You can click the Options button to toggle the
shortcuts for switching layouts and input methods, as well as toggle
automatic synchronization between the active font (where the input
cursor is onscreen) and the keyboard layout that Mac OS X uses.

Security preferences
The Security group is shown in Figure 3-7.
Settings here are
✦FileVault: These controls allow you to set the Master Password for
FileVault encryption within the current user’s Home folder — which
makes it virtually impossible for others to access those files. Only an
Admin-level user can set the Master Password. After the Master
Password has been set, you can click the Turn On FileVault button to
enable FileVault encryption for the user who’s currently logged in; the
user’s Login password becomes their FileVault password as well.
✦Require Password to Wake This Computer from Sleep or Screen
Saver: If you enable this check box, Mac OS X will require that you enter
your Login password before the system will return from a sleep state or
exit a screen saver.

set these global security features that affect all user accounts — you
can choose to disable the automatic logon feature, force Mac OS X to
require a Login password each time that a System Preference pane is
opened, or automatically log off any user after a certain amount of 
inactivity.

Choices here are
✦When You Insert a Blank CD: Click this drop-down list box to specify
the action that Mac OS X should take when you load a blank CD-R or 
CD-RW. You can choose to be prompted or to open the Finder, iTunes,
or Disk Copy. Additionally, you can open another application that you
select, run an AppleScript that you select, or ignore the disc.

iTunes is launched.
✦When You Insert a Picture CD: Choices from this drop-down list spec-
ify what action Mac OS X should take when you load a picture CD. By
default, iPhoto is launched.
✦When You Insert a Video DVD: Choices from this drop-down list spec-

The two panels here are
✦Display: Click the resolution that you want to use from the Resolutions
list on the left and then choose the number of colors (from the Colors
drop-down list) to display. In most cases, you’ll want to use the highest
resolution and the highest number of colors. You can also choose a
refresh rate (from the, ahem, Refresh Rate drop-down list). Again, gener-
ally the higher the refresh rate, the better. Move the Brightness slider to
adjust the brightness level of your display. (Note that these settings are
different depending on what type of display you’re using — for example,
a Mac with a CRT monitor will have more settings to choose from than a
flat-panel LCD system.)
Enable the Show Displays in Menu Bar check box if you’ll be switching
resolutions and color levels often. You can also set the number of
recently used modes that will appear in the Displays menu.
✦Color: Click a display color profile that will control the colors on your
monitor. To create a custom ColorSync profile and calibrate the colors
that you see on your monitor, click the Calibrate button to launch the
Display Calibrator. (You can also launch it from your Utilities folder
within your Applications folder.) This easy-to-use assistant will walk you
step-by-step through the process of creating a ColorSync profile
matched to your monitor’s gamma and white-point values.
Energy Saver preferences
The Energy Saver group is shown in Figure 3-10.
The three tabs here are
✦Sleep: Move the Put the Computer to Sleep When It Is Inactive For slider
to specify when Mac OS X should switch to sleep mode — the Never set-
ting disables sleep mode entirely. To choose a separate delay period for
blanking your monitor, enable the Put the Display to Sleep When the
Computer Is Inactive For check box and move the delay slider. You can
also power-down the hard drive to conserve energy and prevent wear
and tear (an especially good feature for laptop owners).
✦Schedule: If you want to start your Mac at a scheduled time, enable the
Start Up the Computer check box; then choose the desired schedule.
Click the up and down arrows next to the time display to set the startup
time. If you like, you can also set your Mac to shut down or sleep by
using the Shut Down drop-down list.

It’s All about the Hardware
214
✦Options: These settings can toggle events that can wake Mac OS X from
sleep mode, including a ring signal from the modem or a network con-
nection by the network administrator. If you’d like to put your Mac into
sleep mode by pressing the Power button, enable the Allow Power
Button to Sleep the Computer check box. You can also set Mac OS X to
restart automatically after a power failure, which is a good idea if you’ll
be running a Web or File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server on your
machine. (Read more about this in Book VII, Chapter 4.)
Keyboard and mouse preferences
The Keyboard & Mouse group is shown in Figure 3-11.
The three panels here are
✦Keyboard: Move the Key Repeat Rate slider to alter the rate at which a
keystroke will repeat. You can also adjust the Delay Until Repeat slider
to alter how long a key must be held down before it repeats. To test
your settings, click in the sample box and hold down a single key.

✦Selected Printer in Print Dialog: Click this drop-down list box to select
the installed printer that should act as the default printer throughout
your system. If you choose Last Printer Used, Mac OS X uses the printer
that received the last print job.
✦Default Paper Size in Page Setup: Will that be US Letter or Tabloid?
Click this drop-down list box to specify the default paper size for future
print jobs.
This panel also offers a one-click method of sharing your printers across
your network: Enable the Share My Printers with Other Computers check
box, and Mac OS X takes care of the rest. Nice.

To receive faxes on your Mac, you must first enable the Receive Faxes on
This Computer check box. After faxing has been turned on, you can config-
ure the other settings, which include
✦My Fax Number: Enter the phone number that others will call to reach
your Mac.
✦When a Fax Arrives: You can determine how many times the phone will
ring before your Mac answers the incoming call. By default, Mac OS X
saves the incoming fax to your Shared Faxes folder, but you can change
that location — or, if you like, you can select an e-mail address where
the fax will be sent, or you can choose to print the incoming fax on the
printer that you specify. And check it out: If you like, you can send your
fax to all three destinations (a disk folder, an e-mail address, and a
printer)!
If you want others on your network to be able to send faxes using your Mac,
enable the Let Others Send Faxes through This Computer check box.

bar icon.
The three tabs here are
✦Sound Effects: From this panel, you can choose the system alert sound
and the volume for alerts. You can also choose to mute application and
Finder menu sound effects, as well as toggle the sample sound effect
when the volume keys are pressed on your Mac’s keyboard (or from the
Volume slider).
✦Output: Use these settings to choose which audio controller your Mac
should use for playing sound. Unless you’ve installed additional audio
hardware, this should remain set to your Built-in Audio Controller. You
can adjust the balance between the left and right channels for the
selected output controller.

you can add a password that others have to enter before they can
access your public folder. For a complete description of iDisk, see Book
IV, Chapter 4.
I recommend that you enable the Create a Local Copy of Your iDisk and
Choose the Synchronize Automatically option; this will allow iDisk to
run much faster because Mac OS X can read and write by using your
local iDisk copy on your hard drive. Your Mac will regularly synchronize
the data on your local hard drive across the Internet with the iDisk on
the Apple server.

You can create a new Location by clicking the Location drop-down list at
the top of the dialog — Mac OS X prompts you for a name — or you can
edit your existing Locations by choosing Edit Locations from this list.
(Automatic is the default, and it does a pretty good job of figuring out what
settings you need.) As I mention earlier in the book (Book I, Chapter 3), cre-
ating Locations makes it easy to completely reconfigure your Network pref-
erences when you connect your computer to other networks: for example,
when you take your laptop to a branch office. You can also set up Locations
to accommodate different ISP dial-up telephone numbers in different towns.
If you need to create a new Location that’s very similar to an existing
Location, click the Location drop-down list box and choose Edit Locations.
Then select the Location that you want to copy and click the Duplicate
button. The new Location that you create will contain all the same settings
(without several minutes of retyping), so you can easily edit it and make
minor changes quickly.
When you select Built-in Ethernet from the Show drop-down list box, the
tabs displayed are
✦TCP/IP: These settings are provided either automatically (by using
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol [DHCP]) or manually (by using
settings provided by your network administrator). For more details on
TCP/IP settings, see Book IV, Chapter 1 and Book V, Chapter 2.
✦PPPoE: The settings that you enter here — if necessary — are used for
Point-to-Point over Ethernet connections. If you’re not using PPPoE to
connect to your ISP, you can forget about the settings in this dialog;
if you are using PPPoE, see Book IV, Chapter 1 for more details.
✦AppleTalk: If you’re connecting your Mac to older Macs via an
AppleTalk network, enable the Make AppleTalk Active check box and
choose an active Zone to join from the AppleTalk Zone drop-down list
box. Automatic configuration should work in nearly every AppleTalk
environment, but if you want to specify the Node ID and Network ID for
your computer manually, choose Manually from the Configure drop-
down list box.
Note that AppleTalk can only be active on one port within a location —
for example, if you have AppleTalk active for Ethernet, you can’t select
AppleTalk for the wireless port in the same location. (You can, however,
define different locations for AirPort and Ethernet, both with AppleTalk
active.)
✦Proxies: Network proxy servers are used as part of a firewall configura-
tion to help keep your network secure, but in most cases, changing
them can cause you to lose Internet functionality if you enter the wrong
settings.

Sharing the Joy: Internet & Network
222
Most folks using a telephone modem, cable modem, or digital subscriber
line (DSL) connection should leave these settings alone. Enable and
change these settings only at the request of your network administrator.
If you’ve enabled your Mac OS X firewall and you use FTP to transfer
files, enable the Passive FTP Mode check box on the Proxies tab — I rec-
ommend that you enable this setting to allow downloading from some
Web pages as well.
✦Ethernet: From this panel, you can configure the settings for your
Ethernet network interface card. I strongly recommend that you leave
the Configure drop-down list box set to Automatically (unless specifi-
cally told to set things manually by your system administrator or that
nice person from Apple tech support).
When you select Internal Modem from the Show drop-down list box, the
tabs displayed are
✦TCP/IP: You can configure your Internet connection for Point-to-Point
Protocol (PPP), AOL dialup, or enter the settings manually — the
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) dial-up con-
nection that you choose determines what fields are available. Your ISP
will supply you with these settings.
✦PPP: These settings are used for a Point-to-Point Protocol connection
over a telephone modem. Again, your ISP will provide you with the right
values to enter here. If you’re supplied with a secondary telephone
number to dial when the primary is busy, enter it into the Alternate
Number field.
If you’re concerned about who’s using your Internet connection — or
you want to add an extra layer of security when you dial out — disable
the Save Password check box, and Mac OS X will prompt you each time
for your Internet account password.
✦Proxies: Some ISPs use proxy servers for their dialup accounts to main-
tain security, but (as I mention earlier in this section) changing these
settings willy-nilly is inviting disaster. Leave them disabled unless given
specific instructions on what to set by your ISP.
✦Modem: Click the drop-down Modem list box and choose the brand and
model of your modem. If Mac OS X detects an internal modem, it’s used
by default.
I strongly recommend that you enable both the Enable Error Correction
and Compression in Modem and the Wait for Dial Tone Before Dialing
check boxes because they will provide you with the best performance
and the fastest speeds.

You can also select tone or pulse dialing and whether you want to hear
the two modems conversing. (If the caterwauling bothers you, turn off
the Sound option.) If you like, Mac OS X can notify you with an alert
sound if you receive an incoming call while you’re connected to your
ISP — just enable the Connection check box. If you live outside the
United States, click the Change button to select the proper Country
Setting; this governs how your modem dials your ISP. Finally, I recom-
mend that you enable the Show Modem Status in Menu Bar check box,
which gives you a visual reference on your connection status.
To enable and disable your network ports, click the Show drop-down list box
and choose Network Port Configurations. You can enable the On check box to
toggle individual ports — for instance, if you don’t use your internal modem,
you can turn it off. And you can drag configurations into any desired order to
specify which ports Mac OS X should use first when connecting.
QuickTime preferences
The QuickTime group is shown in Figure 3-17. For complete details on
QuickTime, streaming media, and viewing movies downloaded from the
Web, see Book III, Chapter 6.

If you’ve purchased a registration code for QuickTime Pro or Player Pro,
click the Registration button to enter it.
The five panels here are
✦Plug-In: These settings determine how QuickTime acts when it’s used as
a Web browser plug-in. Enable the Play Movies Automatically check box
to toggle automatic playback of movies that you’ve downloaded from
the Web. If you’ll be viewing downloaded QuickTime movies often, it’s
a good idea to enable the Save Movies in Disk Cache check box — this
improves the playback performance.
When the Enable Kiosk Mode check box is enabled, the options avail-
able from the Player window no longer include the ability to save
movies or change QuickTime settings — this is a good idea when your
kids will be downloading and watching movies from the Web.
If you need to change the MIME file types that QuickTime will play from
a Web page, click the MIME Settings button. (These are the different
types of multimedia files that you’ll encounter on the Web, like video,
audio, and photographs.) However, I recommend that you use the
default settings because otherwise you might end up downloading a file
type that you can’t use because you’ve disabled it.
Often, third-party media players will, in effect, take over the MIME file
types from QuickTime — naturally, this is what you want, if you like the
new player application. However, if you decide that the new player is
not your style, you can return QuickTime to its rightful place as Kahuna
of the Web Downloads by displaying the MIME settings, clicking the Use
Defaults button, and then clicking OK.
✦Connection: Click the Connection Speed drop-down list to choose the
data transfer speed closest to your connection rate. This optimizes
QuickTime’s streaming video performance to match your connection. If
you’re not using DSL, a network Internet connection, or a cable modem
connection, make sure that you disable the Allow Multiple Simultaneous
Streams check box.
Click the Instant-On button to enable or disable streaming playback the
moment that you start to receive the media (without queuing a signifi-
cant amount first, which takes time). The faster your Internet connec-
tion is, the less time you’ll need to queue a media stream.
If you receive protocol error messages from QuickTime, click the Trans-
port Setup button and then click the Auto Configure button. Mac OS X will
choose the correct transport protocol and port ID for your connection.
✦Music: You need only visit this panel if you’ve added a software-based
music synthesizer (such as Deck or VST) to Mac OS X — if so, you can
click its entry here and click Make Default to use it instead of
QuickTime’s built-in synthesizer.

✦Media Keys: If you play MP3 or MOV files that require secure media
keys, you can click the Add button and enter the category and key from
this panel. To edit a key, select it from the list and click the Edit button.
To remove a key from the list, select it and click the Delete button.
✦Update: By default, QuickTime checks for new updates automatically,
but you can check for new updates immediately by clicking the Update
Now button. You can also add QuickTime enhancement software from
other companies by clicking the Install New 3rd-Party QuickTime
Software button and then clicking the Update Now button.

Click in the Computer Name text field to change the default network name
assigned to your Mac during the installation process. Your current network
address is listed, but you can change your network settings by clicking the
Edit button.
The three tabs here are
✦Services: Each entry in the services list controls a specific type of 
sharing, including Personal File Sharing (with other Macs), Windows
Sharing (with PCs running Windows), Personal Web Sharing, Remote
Login, FTP Access, Apple Remote Desktop, Remote Apple Events, and
Printer Sharing. To turn on any of these services, enable the On check
box for that service. To turn off a service, choose it from the list and
click the Stop button that appears.
From a security standpoint, I highly recommend that you enable only
those services that you will actually use. A Mark’s Maxim to remember:
Poking too many holes in your firewall is not a good thing.™
✦Firewall: As I discuss in Book IV, Chapter 6, Mac OS X includes a built-in
firewall. You can enable the firewall from this panel — when the firewall
is on, communication to any service not allowed in the list is blocked.
(In firewall-speak, these entries are called rules because they determine
what’s allowed to pass through to your Mac.)
To enable communications with a service, select the entry in the list
and enable the On check box. Click the New button to specify a new rule
by entering a port and assigning it a name. After you create a new rule,
it appears in the list, and you can toggle it on and off like any of the
default rules. Click the Edit button to edit the selected rule; click the
Delete button to remove the selected rule.
If you’re using an Internet or network connection, I strongly urge you to
enable the firewall (but only after you’ve reviewed Book V, Chapter 2).
However, if you suddenly can’t connect to other computers or share
files that you were originally able to share, it’s time to review the rules
that you’ve enabled from this panel.
✦Internet: If you want to share the Internet connection from this
Macintosh, click the port to use — this will almost always be the Built-in
Ethernet option — and then click Start.

Each user on your system has an entry in this list. The panels here change,
depending on the access level of the selected account. They can include
✦Password: Click in these text fields to enter or edit the account name,
password, and password hint for the selected user.
Click the Address Book Card button to edit the card that you’ve marked
in the Address Book as My Card. Mac OS X launches the Address Book,
and you can edit your card to your heart’s content. (For the complete

✦Picture: From the Picture panel, you can either choose one of the
thumbnail images provided by Apple to represent you or click Edit to
drag a new image from the Finder.
✦Security: Click the Security tab to enable or disable FileVault encryption
protection for the files in your Home folder, as I discuss earlier in this
chapter.
✦Limitations: This panel is only available when you’re adding or editing a
Standard level account — you can choose to assign no limitations, or
you can click Some Limits to disable certain features within Mac OS X.
Click Simple Finder to strictly limit this user’s access, as well as assign
that person the Simple version of the Finder. For more information
about assigning limitations, refer to Book II, Chapter 5.
✦Startup Items: The applications that you add to this list will launch
automatically each time that the current user logs in to Mac OS X. To
add an application, click the Add button (which carries a plus sign),
navigate to the desired application and select it, and then click the Add
button. (Alternately, you can simply drag an item from a Finder window
into the Startup Items list.) To remove an application from the list, click
to select it and then click the Remove button (which has a minus sign).
Each application can be launched in a hidden state — meaning that its
window doesn’t appear on the Desktop. To toggle an item as hidden or
visible, enable the Hide check box next to the desired application.
The order that Startup Items are launched can be changed by dragging
entries in the list into the desired sequence.
A word about the Login Options button — click it to set a number of global
options that control how users log in. For example, you can choose to dis-
play either a Name field (followed by a Password field) on the Login screen
(which means that the user must actually type in the correct username) or a
list of users, from which a person can select a user ID. (If security is a con-
sideration, use the Name and Password option.)
If you choose, you can log in automatically as the selected user by clicking the
Login Options button and enabling the Automatically Log in As <Username>
feature. The Login Options panel also allows you to enable or disable Fast
User Switching, which I discuss in Book II, Chapter 5.
You can prevent anyone from restarting or shutting down the Mac from
the Login screen by enabling the Hide the Restart and Shut Down Buttons
check box.

The three panels here are
✦Start/Stop: You can select from multiple Mac OS 9 System folders when
launching Classic, and you can elect to start Classic automatically when
the current user logs in. (Personally, I don’t use Classic often, so I don’t
run it automatically at login — therefore saving those system resources
for my other applications.) If you’d rather be prompted before Classic is
launched, enable the Warn Before Starting Classic check box. You can
launch Classic manually from this panel by clicking Start; if Classic is
encountering problems, you can click the Restart or the Force Quit but-
tons as well.
Note that you can monitor the status of Classic mode by enabling the
Show Classic Status in Menu Bar check box — this can be a boon for
those who use many legacy applications from the days of Mac OS 9.
✦Advanced: Three special start-up options are available from the drop-
down list — and only when you use the Start Classic button on this
panel. (As you might expect, these options are typically only for debug-
ging and troubleshooting.) You can elect to start Classic with all exten-
sions turned off, or you can open the Extensions Manager to toggle
Figure 3-20:

individual extensions on and off within Classic. Finally, you can choose
Use Key Combination from the drop-down list to start or restart Classic
when you press a shortcut sequence of up to five keys.
To use preferences from the current user’s Home folder, enable the Use
Mac OS 9 Preferences from Your Home check box. If this is disabled,
preferences from the System folder that you choose on the Start/Stop
panel are used. You can specify the amount of inactivity before Classic
switches to sleep mode, and you can rebuild the Classic Desktop, which
is a good idea if custom icons disappear or documents that once had
recognized file types are no longer recognized.
✦Memory/Versions: This panel displays information on both Classic and
the applications that it’s running. To show background processes that
would normally be invisible, mark the Show Background Applications
check box to enable it.

The three tabs here are
✦Date & Time: To set the current date, click the date within the mini-
calendar; to set the system time, click in the field above the clock and
type the current time.
You can’t set these values manually if you use a network time server. To
automatically set your Mac’s system time and date from a network time
server, enable the Set Date & Time Automatically check box and then
choose a server from the drop-down list that corresponds to your loca-
tion. (Of course, you need an Internet connection to use a network time
server.)
✦Time Zone: Click your approximate location on the world map to
choose a time zone or click the Closest City drop-down list and choose
the city that’s closest to you (and shares your same time zone).
✦Clock: If you enable the Show the Date and Time check box, you can
choose to view the time in text or icon format. The clock can appear on
the menu bar or in its own window. You can also optionally display sec-
onds, AM/PM, and the day of the week; have the time separator charac-
ters flash; or use a clock based on 24 hours. If you choose a clock
window, you can even specify the transparency of that window so that it
won’t interfere with applications behind it.
Personally, I get a big kick out of my Mac announcing the time on the
hour . . . plus, it helps pull me back into the real world. (You’ve got to eat
sooner or later.) Anyway, if you’d like this helpful reminder as well, enable
the Announce the Time check box on the Clock tab, and click the drop-
down list to select an hour, half-hour, or quarter-hour announcement.
Software Update preferences
The Software Update settings are shown in Figure 3-22.
The two panels here are
✦Update Software: I recommend enabling the Check for Updates check
box — and I also recommend that you choose Daily or Weekly from the
drop-down list box. (You can also elect to download critical updates in
the background automatically while you continue working.) To check
immediately, click the Check Now button.
✦Installed Updates: Click this tab to display a list of the updates that
you’ve already applied to Mac OS X. You can open the list as a log file as
well, which will allow you to cut and paste text.

Speech preferences
Figure 3-23 illustrates the Speech settings — for a discussion of how these
settings are used, visit Book VII, Chapter 3.
The three panels here are
✦Speech Recognition: This tab has three tabs of its own: On/Off, Listening,
and Commands. From the Recognition System drop-down list box, you
can choose from either the Apple Speakable Items system or a third-party
system that you’ve installed — if you go with a third-party system, the
tabs will vary according to the recognition software that you select.
• On/Off: With this feature toggled on (by selecting the On radio
button next to Apple Speakable Items Is), you can control Mac OS X
with spoken commands. If you’re going to use Apple Speakable
Items, enable the Turn On Speakable Items at Login check box.
Click the self-named button to open the Speakable Items Folder from
this panel. (I discuss speech in Book VII, Chapter 3.) From the Play
Sound drop-down list, you can indicate what sound effect Mac OS X
will play when it recognizes a speech command. (Optionally, Mac OS X
can confirm the command by speaking it if you enable the Speak
Confirmation check box.)

• Listening: Here you can change the Speakable Items Listening key
(Esc by default) and specify whether your Mac should listen only
while the key is pressed or whether the Listening key toggles listen-
ing on and off. You can also change the name of your computer and
whether that name is required before a command. If you have more
than one microphone, you can select which one you want to use as
well as set the input volume. Otherwise, leave these settings as
they are.
• Commands: Here you can select which types of commands that will
be available as well as whether exact wording of command names is
required. Read more about these settings in Book VII, Chapter 3.
✦Default Voice: Here’s a fun panel — click a voice in the list at the left,
and Mac OS X will use that voice to speak to you from dialogs and appli-
cations. You can set the Rate (from Slow to Fast) and play a sample by
clicking the Play button. (Try Zarvox, Bubbles, and Pipe Organ.)
✦Spoken User Interface: These settings specify when Mac OS X will talk
to you. The Talking Alerts feature actually speaks the text within alert
dialogs — to toggle it on, enable the Speak the Alert Text check box.

Move the Wait Before Speaking slider to specify how much time your
Mac should wait before reading the dialog to you. You can also option-
ally announce when an application wants your attention, the text that’s
under the mouse pointer, and the selected text when you press a key
that you specify.
Startup Disk preferences
Figure 3-24 illustrates the Startup Disk settings.
To select a start-up disk, click the desired start-up folder from the scrolling
icon list.
Mac OS 9 System folders have a 9 icon, and Mac OS X folders have the famil-
iar blue X logo. Mac OS X displays the version numbers of each system and
the physical drives where each system resides.
If you’re planning on rebooting with an external Universal Serial Bus (USB)
or FireWire start-up disk, that disk must already be connected, powered on,
and recognized by the system before you display these settings.
Select the Network Startup icon if you’d like to boot from a System folder on
your local network — typically, such a folder is created by your network
administrator.

tion should be used, click the Zoom Options button. From the sheet that
appears, you can set the minimum and maximum Zoom magnification
increments. From the keyboard, use Ô+Option++ (plus sign) to zoom in
and Ô+Option+– (minus sign) to zoom out. Optionally, you can display a
preview rectangle of the area that will be included when you zoom.
Mac OS X can also smooth images to make them look better when
zoomed. If you prefer white text on a black background, click the Switch
to White on Black button. Note that depending on your display settings,
it might be easier on the eyes to use grayscale display mode by clicking
the Set Display to Grayscale button.
✦Hearing: If you need additional visual cues to supplement the spoken
and audio alerts in Mac OS X, click this tab and enable the Flash the
Screen Whenever an Alert Sound Occurs check box. To raise the overall
sound volume in Mac OS X, you can click the Adjust Sound button to
display the Sound System Preferences settings, where you can drag the
Volume slider to the right.
✦Keyboard: These settings help those who have trouble pressing key-
board shortcuts or those who often trigger keyboard repeats (repetition
of the same character) accidentally. If you mark the Sticky Keys radio
button, you can use modifier keys individually that will be grouped
together automatically as a single keyboard shortcut. (You can option-
ally specify that Mac OS X should sound a beep tone when a modifier
key is pressed and whether the modifier keys should be displayed
onscreen.)
Sticky Keys can be toggled on from the keyboard by pressing the Shift
key five times. Turn Slow Keys on to add a pause (of the length that you
specify) between when a key is pressed and when it’s actually acted
upon within Mac OS X. You can optionally add a key-click sound each
time that you press a key. To turn keyboard repeat off entirely, click the
Set Key Repeat button, which opens the Keyboard preference settings
that I discuss earlier.
✦Mouse: With Mouse Keys active, you can use the numeric keypad to
move the mouse pointer across your screen. Mouse Keys can be toggled
on and off by pressing the Option key five times. Drag the delay and
speed sliders to specify how long you must hold down a keypad key
before the pointer starts to move as well as how fast the pointer should
move across the screen. You can also click the Open Keyboard
Preferences button to turn on Full Keyboard Access, which I mention

hether you’re setting up Mac OS X for use in a public library or
simply allowing your 12-year-old to use your Mac in your home
office, configuring Panther for multiple users is a simple task. However, you
must also consider the possible downsides of a mismanaged multi-user
system: files and folders being shared that you didn’t want in the public
domain, users logging in as each other, and the very real possibility of acci-
dental file deletion (and worse).
Therefore, in this chapter, I show you how to take those first steps before
you open Pandora’s box — setting login options, configuring the personal
account that you created when you first installed the operating system, and
protecting your stuff. (Network administrators call this security check-up
locking things down.)
How Multi-User Works on Mac OS X
When you create multiple users in Mac OS X, each person who uses your
Macintosh — hence the term user — has a separate account (much like an
account that you might open at a bank). Mac OS X creates a Home folder for
each user and saves that user’s preferences independently from other users.
When you log in to Mac OS X, you select (or provide) a username and a pass-
word, which identifies you and tells Mac OS X which user has logged on —
and therefore, which preferences and Home folder to use.
Each account also carries a specific level, which determines how much con-
trol the user has over Mac OS X and the computer itself. Without the proper
account, for example, a user might not be able to display many of the panels
in System Preferences.

How Multi-User Works on Mac OS X
238
The three account levels are
✦Root: Also called System Administrator, this uber-account can change
anything within Mac OS X — and that’s usually A Bad Thing, so it’s actu-
ally disabled as a default. (This alone should tell you that the Root
account shouldn’t be toyed with.) For instance, the Root account can
seriously screw up the UNIX subsystem within Mac OS X, or a Root user
can delete files within the Mac OS X System Folder.
Enable the System Administrator account and use it only if told to do so
by an Apple technical support technician. To enable the Root account,
you must launch NetInfo Manager, which is stored in the Utilities folder
inside your Applications folder.
✦Administrator: (Or Admin for short.) This is the account level that you
were assigned when you installed Mac OS X. Note: The Administrator
account should not be confused with the System Administrator account!
It’s perfectly okay for you or anyone you assign to use an Administrator
account. An Administrator can install applications anywhere on the
system, create/edit/delete user accounts, and make changes to all the
settings in System Preferences. However, an Administrator can’t move or
delete items from any other user’s Home folder, and Administrators are
barred from modifying or deleting files in the Mac OS X System Folder.
A typical multi-user Mac OS X computer will only have one
Administrator — like a teacher in a classroom — but technically,
you can create as many Administrator accounts as you like. If you do
need to give someone else this access level, assign it only to a compe-
tent, experienced user whom you trust.
✦Managed: A Managed user account (often called a Standard account) is
the default in Mac OS X. Standard users can install software and save
documents only in their Home folders and the Shared folder (which
resides in the Users folder), and they can change only certain settings in
System Preferences. Thus, they can do little damage to the system as a
whole. For example, each of the students in a classroom should be given
a Standard-level account for the Mac OS X system that they share.
You can also use the Limitations feature to fine-tune what a Standard
account user can do. (I discuss Limitations at length in the next chapter.)
The next chapter of this mini-book covers the entire process of creating and
editing a user account.

Configuring Your Login Screen
239
Configuring Your Login Screen
Take a look at the changes that you can make to the login process. First,
Mac OS X provides three methods of displaying the login screen:
✦Logging in with a list: To log in, click your account username in the
list, and the login screen displays the password prompt. Type your
password — Mac OS X displays bullet characters to ensure security —
and press Return (or click the Log In button).
✦Logging in with username and password: Type your account username
in the Name field and press Tab. Then type your password and press
Return (or click the Log In button).
✦Auto Login: With Auto Login set, Mac OS X automatically logs in the
specified account when you reboot. In effect, you never see the login
screen unless you click Log Out from the Apple menu. (Naturally, this is
an attractive option to use if your computer is in a secure location —
like your office — and you’ll be the only one using your Mac.)
To specify which type of login screen you see — if you see one at all — head
to System Preferences, click Accounts, and then click the Login Options
button.
✦To set Auto Login, display the Login Options settings and select the
Automatically Log in As check box to enable it. Click the account name
drop-down list box and choose the account that should automatically log
in. When Mac OS X displays the user Name and Password sheet that you
see in Figure 4-1, type the corresponding password and then click OK.
Never set the Auto Login feature to an Admin-level account unless
you’re sure to be the only one using your Mac — if the computer is
rebooted, you’re opening the door for anyone to simply sashay in and
wreak havoc!
✦To determine whether Mac OS X uses a list login screen, you must again
visit the Login Options settings panel (see Figure 4-2). Select the List
of Users radio button for a list login screen or select the Name and
Password radio button for a simple login screen where you must type
your username and password.

Configuring Your Login Screen
240
To change settings specific to your account — no matter what your access
level — log in with your account, open System Preferences, and click
Accounts. From here, you can change your account password and picture,
the card marked as yours within the Address Book, and the Startup Items
launched automatically when you log in. (Peruse more information on the
Address Book in Book I, Chapter 5.)
To log out of Mac OS X without restarting or shutting down the computer,
choose the Apple menu and then either choose Log Out or just press
Ô+Shift+Q. You’ll see the confirmation dialog shown in Figure 4-3. Although
Mac OS X will display the login screen after two minutes, someone can still
saunter up and click the Cancel button, thereby gaining access to your stuff.
Therefore, make it a practice to always click the Log Out button on this
screen before your hand leaves the mouse!

Locking Things Down
242
You can also enable Fast User Switching from the Login Options panel. This
new feature allows another user to sit down and log in while the previous
user’s applications are still running in the background. When you enable
switching, Panther displays the currently active user’s name at the right
side of the Finder menu bar. Click the name and a menu appears; click Login
Window, and another user can then log in as usual. Even though you’re play-
ing musical chairs, the Big X remembers what’s running and the state of
your Desktop when you last left it. (When you decide to switch back,
Panther prompts you for that account’s login password . . . just in case,
you understand.)
Locking Things Down
If security is a potential problem and you still need to share a Mac between
multiple users, lock things down. To protect Mac OS X from unauthorized
use, take care of these potential security holes immediately:
✦Disable the Sleep, Restart, and Shut Down buttons: Any computer can
be hacked when it’s restarted or turned on, so disable the Restart and
Shut Down buttons on the login screen. (After a user has successfully
logged in, Mac OS X can be shut down normally by using the menu item
or the keyboard shortcuts that I cover earlier.) Open the Accounts panel
in System Preferences, click the Login Options button, and enable the
Hide the Sleep, Restart, and Shut Down Buttons check box. Press Ô+Q
to quit and save your changes. (You can find more about restarting and
shutting down in Book I, Chapter 2.)
✦Disable list logins: With a list login, any potential hacker already knows
half the information necessary to gain entry to your system — and often
the password is easy to guess. Therefore, set Mac OS X to ask for the
username and password on the Login screen, as I describe earlier. This
way, someone has to guess both the username and the password, which
is a much harder proposition.
✦Disable Auto Login: A true no-brainer. As I mention earlier in the chap-
ter, Auto Login is indeed very convenient. However, all someone has
to do is reboot your Mac, and the machine automatically logs in one
lucky user! To disable Auto Login, display the Accounts panel in System
Preferences and click the Login Options button; then disable the
Automatically Log In As <username> check box.
✦Disable the password hint: By default, Mac OS X obligingly displays the
password hint for an account after three unsuccessful attempts at enter-
ing a password. Where security is an issue, this is like serving a hacker a

piece of apple pie. Therefore, head to System Preferences, display the
Accounts settings, click each user’s account in the list, and make sure
that the Password Hint box is empty.
✦Select passwords intelligently: Although using your mother’s maiden
name for a password might seem like a great idea, the best method of
selecting a password is to use a completely random group of mixed let-
ters and numbers. If you find a random password too hard to remember,
at least add a number after your password, like dietcoke1 — and no, that
is not one of my passwords. (Nice try.)
For even greater security, make at least one password character 
uppercase.
Starting Applications Automatically After Login
Here’s one other advantage to logins — each account can have its own
selection of applications that run automatically when that user logs in.
These applications are Startup Items. (For the Mac OS 9 old-timers, these are
the same as the Startup Items in days gone by.) A caveat or two:
✦The users setting their Startup Items must be logged in. Only the user
can modify his or her own Startup Items.
✦Users must have access to System Preferences. If the person is using a
Standard-level account, it must be set to No Limits, or Some Limits with
the Open All System Preferences check box enabled.
Ready? Let’s begin. Open System Preferences and click Accounts. Then click
an Admin account to select it, and finally, click Startup Items (see Figure 4-4).
Including an application in your Startup Items list is easy: Click the button
with the plus sign to navigate to the desired application, select it, and then
click Add. (Alternatively, you can just drag items from a Finder window and
drop them directly into the list.) Note that items in the list are launched in
order — if something needs to run before something else, you can drag the
item entries into any sequence.
To launch the application in hidden mode — which might or might not dis-
play it in the Dock, depending on the application itself — click the list entry
for the desired item and enable its Hide check box.

 Avoiding keychains
I
n the previous chapter, I introduce you to the different Mac OS X multi-
user account levels and the login process. If you’re ready to share your
Mac with others, you discover here how to add new accounts and edit exist-
ing accounts in this chapter. Oh, and yes, I also show you how to frag —
that’s multiplayer game-speak for delete — accounts that you no longer
need. I also demonstrate how to add optional powers (capabilities) to an
individual user account and how to avoid using a keychain to make it easier
to store that pocketful of passwords that you’ve created on the Internet.
Yes, that’s right. Mac OS X actually has a feature that I don’t want you to use.
Read on to find out more.
Adding, Editing, and Deleting Users
All multi-user account chores take place in a single System Preferences pane.
(Cue James Bond theme song.) The Accounts pane is the star of this chapter,
so open System Preferences and click the Accounts icon.
If you haven’t added any users to your system yet, the Users list should look
like Figure 5-1. You should see only your account, which you set up when you
installed Mac OS X, set to Administrator (Admin) level.
Adding an account
To add a new user account, follow these steps:
1. In the Accounts pane in System Preferences, click the New User
button — which carries a plus sign — to display an empty user
record that you see in Figure 5-2.

Adding, Editing, and Deleting Users
246
2. In the Name text box, type the name that you want to display for this
account (both in the Accounts list and on the Login screen) and then
press Tab to move to the next field.
Mac OS X automatically generates a short name for use in iChat AV and
various network applications — it’s also the name of the folder that Mac
OS X creates on the computer’s hard drive for this user. You can keep
the default short name or type a new one, but it must not contain any
spaces. For more on iChat AV, jump to Book IV, Chapter 3. (I’ll wait for
you here.)
3. Press Tab again.
4. In the Password text box, type the password for the new account.
As always, Mac OS X displays bullet characters for security.

5. Press Tab, type the password again in the Verify text box, and press
Tab again.
6. If you decide to use the password hint feature that I describe in the
previous chapter, you can enter a short sentence or question in the
Password Hint text box. (Remember, it’s optional.)
The hint is displayed after three unsuccessful attempts at entering the
account password.
I recommend that you do not use this option — if you do, make sure that
the hint is sufficiently vague! Press Tab to continue.
7. Click the Picture tab to specify the thumbnail image that will appear
in the Login list next to the account name.
Apple provides a number of good images in the scrolling strip — just
click one to select it.

8. To add your own picture, click Edit to drag a new image from the
Finder into the Images well; then click Set.
Alternatively, you can click the Take Video Snapshot button to grab a
picture from your iSight or other video camera connected to your Mac.
Most cool.
9. Click the Security tab to specify whether the new user will have
Admin or Standard access.
Note that you can also set FileVault security from this pane — for the
details, see the sidebar “So you like your privacy . . .”.
10. To grant this account Administrator-level access, enable the Allow
User to Administer This Computer check box.
11. If the new user will have Standard access, you can click the
Limitations button to block access to certain Mac OS X functions.
• No Limits: Click this button to allow the user complete Standard-level
access.
• Some Limits: Click this button to disable the check boxes as neces-
sary to restrict the forbidden functionality. Mac OS X displays the
label Managed under the user’s name and image in the Accounts list.
• Simple Finder: Click this button to limit a user account to the Simple
Finder and specific applications. The label Simplified appears under
that account in the list.
More on these limits in the later section, “Setting Limitations.”
12. After all the fields are correct (and you’ve selected just the right
image to capture the user’s personality — a more difficult task than
you might think), click OK to finish and create the account.
The new account now shows up in the Accounts list and in the Login
screen.
Editing an existing account
If you have Administrator access, it’s a cinch to make changes to an existing
account from the Accounts panel in System Preferences. Follow these steps:
1. Click the account that you want to change in the Accounts list.
2. Edit the settings that you need to change.
3. After you make the changes, press Ô+Q to save them and close the
System Preferences dialog.

So you like your privacy . . .
These days, everyone’s interested in securing
their personal files from prying eyes — granted,
this isn’t a problem if you’re the only one 
using your Mac. However, if you’re sharing a
computer in a multi-user environment, you
might want a little more protection for those all-
important Fantasy Football formations that you’ll
unleash next season.
Never fear, Panther is here with a new feature
called FileVault, which provides Home folder
encryption that should prevent just about
anyone except the NSA or FBI from gaining
access to the files in your Home folder. You can
enable the FileVault feature from the Accounts
panel in System Preferences; click the desired
account, and then click the Security tab to dis-
play the settings that you see here. Two pass-
words control access to your Home folder when
FileVault is active:
 The Master Password can unlock any
Home folder for any user. Only someone
with an Admin account can set the Master
Password. The Master Password must be
set before you can turn on the FileVault fea-
ture for any account on your system.
 Your Login Password unlocks your Home
folder.
Personally, I love this feature, and I use it on all
my Macs running Panther. Yet there is a risk
involved — insert ominous chord here. To wit:
DO NOT forget your Login Password, and make
doggone sure that your Admin user remembers
that all-important Master Password! Mac OS X
displays a dire warning for anyone who’s con-
sidering using FileVault: If you forget these
passwords, you can’t retrieve any data from
your Home folder. Period. As Jerry Reed says,
“It’s a gone pecan.”

Deleting an existing account
To wipe an account from the face of the earth, follow these steps:
1. Click the account that you want to delete in the Accounts list.
2. Click the Delete User button (which is smartly marked with a minus
sign).
Mac OS X displays the confirmation sheet that you see in Figure 5-3.
Note that the contents of the user’s Home folder are saved in a file in
the Deleted Users folder (just in case you need to retrieve something). If
you’re absolutely sure you won’t be dating that person again, click the
Delete Immediately button (which doesn’t save anything in the Deleted
Users folder).
3. Click OK to verify and delete the account or click Delete Immediately
to zap it completely. Click the Cancel button to abort and return to
the Accounts list.
Setting Limitations
Administrators are special people. Just ask one; you’ll see. Anyway, when
an administrator creates or edits the account for a Standard-level user,
Mac OS X offers two other levels of specific rights — Limitations — that can
be assigned on an individual account basis. Note: Limitations are available
only for Standard-level users; administrators don’t need them because an
Administrator-level account already has access to everything covered by
Limitations.

When do you need Limitations? Here are three likely scenarios:
✦You’re creating accounts for corporate or educational users, and you
want to disable certain features of Mac OS X to prevent those folks from
doing something dumb. Just tell ’em you’re streamlining the operating
system. (Yeah, that’s it.) For example, you might not want that one par-
ticular kid making CD copies of The Illustrated Anarchist’s Cookbook in
the classroom while you’re gone. Therefore, you disable the ability for
that account to burn CDs or DVDs.
✦In the same environment, you might want to give a specific Standard-level
account the ability to view all the settings in System Preferences. If Roger
in Accounting is both helpful and knowledgeable — oh, and add trustwor-
thy in there, too — you might want to give him this capability so that he
can make necessary changes to the system while you’re on vacation.
✦You want one or more users to access one — and only one — application
on the system, or perhaps just two or three applications. To illustrate: In
my years as a hospital hardware technician, we had a number of comput-
ers that were used solely to display patient records. No Word, no e-mail,
nothing but the one program that accessed the medical records database.
We called these machines dumb terminals, although they were actually
personal computers. (This trick also works well if you’re a parent and
you’d like to give your kids access without endangering your valuable
files. Just don’t call your computer a dumb terminal lest your kids take
offense. That’s experience talking there.) If you want to allow access to a
specified selection of applications, you can set them in that account’s
Limitations.
Time to review what each of the settings does. To display the capabilities for
a Standard account, click the account in the list and click the Limitations tab;
then click the Some Limits tab (see Figure 5-4).
The settings are
✦Open All System Preferences: When this check box is enabled, this
option allows the user to change any setting throughout System
Preferences, just as if the account were Administrator-level.
✦Modify the Dock: Enable this check box, and the user can remove appli-
cations, documents, and folders from the Dock in the Full Finder. (If you
don’t want the contents of the Dock changing according to the whims of
other users, it’s a good idea to disable this check box.)
✦Change Password: Enable this check box to allow the user to change
the account password. If the user isn’t allowed to open all System
Preferences settings, this check box is disabled.

Setting Limitations
252
If you’re creating a single Standard-level account for an entire group of
people to use — for example, if you want to leave the machine in kiosk
mode in one corner of the office or if everyone in a classroom will use
the same account on the machine — I recommend disabling the ability
to change the account password. (Oh, and please do me a favor . . .
don’t create a system with just one Admin-level account! Instead, keep
your one Admin-level account close to your bosom and create a
Standard-level account for the Unwashed Horde.)
✦Burn CDs and DVDs: Disable this check box to prevent the user from
recording CDs or DVDs via the built-in disc recording features in Mac OS
X. (Note, however, that if you’ve loaded a third-party recording program
like Toast, the user can still record discs with it.)
✦This User Can Only Use These Applications: When this option is
enabled, you can select the specific applications that will appear to
the user. These restrictions are in effect whether the user has access to
the Full Finder or just the Simple Finder (which I cover in a second).

To allow access to all the programs in the specified folders —
Applications, Utilities, and Applications (Mac OS 9) — click the Allow
All button. To restrict access to all applications, click the Uncheck All
button. You can also toggle the restriction on and off for specific appli-
cations that Mac OS X finds in these folders; click the right-arrow icon
to expand the list and then either mark or clear the Allow check box for
the desired programs.
To add a new application to the Allow list, drag its icon from the Finder
and drop it in the list. Alternatively, click the Locate button and navigate
to it, click the application to select it, and then click Add. After you add an
application, it appears in the Others section of the Allow list, and you can
toggle access to it on and off like the applications in the named folders.
You can restrict your Standard-level users even further by assigning them
the Simple Finder set of limitations. The default Simple Finder, as shown
in Figure 5-5, is a highly simplified version of the regular Mac OS X Finder.
The simplified Dock contains only the Finder icon, the Trash, and folders
for the user’s approved applications, documents, and shared files.
This is the network administrator’s idea of a foolproof interface for Mac
OS X: A user can access only those system files and resources needed to
do a job, with no room for tinkering or goofing off.

Note that a Standard-level user can still make the jump to the full version of
the Finder — click Finder and choose Run Full Finder. The user will have to
enter a correct Administrator-level username and password.
You can also change the Auto Login account from the Accounts panel. Click
the Login Options button under the Accounts list, and then enable the
Automatically Log in As <username> check box to enable it (see Figure 5-6).
Click the drop-down list box to choose the account that will automatically
log in when Mac OS X starts up. This is yet another good feature for those
preparing a Mac for public use — if you set the Auto Login to your public
Standard-access account, Mac OS X automatically uses the right account if
the Mac is rebooted or restarted.
You can always choose Log Out from the Apple menu to log in under your
own account. If you need to temporarily disable the Auto Login feature with-
out changing which account it uses, disable the Automatically Log in As
<username> check box.

Using Keychains — NOT
Before I leave this chapter, I’d like to discuss a Mac OS X feature that’s been
around since the days of Mac OS 9: the keychain. Your account keychain
stores all the username/password combinations for Web sites, file servers,
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers, and the like, allowing you to simply
waltz in and start using the service (whatever it is). Sounds handy, doesn’t
it? And it can be, but you’d better watch your step.
I will be perfectly honest here: I hate account keychains. With a passion,
mind you. As a consultant, Webmaster, and the SYSOP (an ancient Bulletin
Board Service acronym meaning System Operator) of an Internet-based
online system, I know what a hassle it is for users to remember separate
passwords, and I feel that pain. However, three massively big problems are
inherent with using keychains:
✦Anyone can log on as you. If your keychain is unlocked, which happens
automatically when you log in, all someone has to do is sit at your desk,
visit a site or connect with a server, and bam! They’re on. As you. Think
about that. And then think how many times you get up from your desk,
just for a second, to grab another Diet Coke or a doughnut.
✦You’ll forget your passwords. If the keychain file is corrupted — and it
can happen — your passwords have gone to Detroit without you. Either
you’ve got them on paper hidden somewhere, they’re on your recent
backup, or it’s time to change your online persona.
✦Keychains need yet another stinkin’ password. Yep, that’s right — your
keychain can be locked (either manually or, with the right settings, auto-
matically), and you have to remember yet another password/passphrase
to unlock your keychain. “When, oh when will the madness end?”
From a security standpoint, keychains should be completely off-limits for
anyone who’s interested in maintaining a well-locked-down machine. After all,
most folks can completely take care of all their Internet and network connec-
tions with a handful of passwords, and that’s no big deal for anyone to remem-
ber. Unfortunately, Panther creates a keychain automatically for every user, so
you have to monitor (and delete) your keychain data manually. (Sigh.)
However, if you’re the only person using your Mac and it resides in your
home — personally, I’d prefer a bank vault — and you absolutely must use
keychains, you can display them all for the current account from the
Keychain Access application (see Figure 5-7), conveniently located in
Utilities within your Applications folder. Click the Attributes tab and then
click an item in the keychain list to display or edit all its information.

Using Keychains — NOT
256
Heck, just think about what I just wrote — anyone can display and edit server
and site information just by launching this application! That includes your
nephew Damien — you know, the one who considers himself the hacker extra-
ordinaire. (While I’m at it, I should mention that it’s just as bad to set the Auto
Login feature — which I discuss earlier in this chapter — to an Admin-level
account. One reboot, and you’re rolling out the red carpet for the little rascal.)
Click the Access Control tab to display the settings that you see in Figure
5-8, one of which I strongly recommend. To minimize the damage that some-
one can do with your keychain, you can enable the Confirm Before Allowing
Access radio button (and for yet another level of security, enable the Ask for
Keychain Password check box). Of course, you’re probably thinking, “Well,
Mark, that pretty much eliminates the purpose of quick, convenient access
without passwords, doesn’t it?” Yes, indeed it does, but at least your online
identity is somewhat safeguarded.
Click the Password toolbar button to add a new password. Type a name for
the item, the username that you typically type to gain access, and the pass-
word for that server or site. Then click Add and cross your fingers.

the Save As text box. By default, the keychain file is created in the Keychain
folder — a good idea — but if you’d like to store it elsewhere, click the
down-arrow button next to the Where list box and navigate to the desired
folder. When you’re ready, click the Create button. Now you need to enter

N
ow here’s a topic that any Mac OS X power user can sink fangs into —
the idea that a document on a multi-user system can be everyone’s
property, allowing anyone in your family, workgroup, or highly-competitive
mob to make whatever changes are necessary, whenever they like.
Of course, potential pitfalls lurk — even in the Apple world, there’s no such
thing as an operating system that’s both powerful and perfectly simple.
However, I think you’ll find that our dear friends from Cupertino have done
just about as well as can be expected and that the settings that you use to
share documents are fairly easy to understand and use.
Prepare to share!
Sharing over a Network versus 
Sharing on a Single Mac
First, allow me to clear up what I’ve found to be a common misconception
by using another of Mark’s Maxims.
Sharing documents on a single computer is fundamentally different
from the file sharing that you’ve used on a network.™
True, multiple users can share a document over a network, which is a topic
that you’ll find covered in Book V. But although the results are the same, the
way that you share that same document on a single machine betwixt multi-
ple users is a completely different turn of the screw. In this section, I discuss
the factoids behind the matter.

Sharing over a Network versus Sharing on a Single Mac
260
No network is required
Although reiterating that no network is required is seemingly the most obvi-
ous of statements, many otherwise knowledgeable Mac OS X power users
seem to forget that sharing a document over a network requires an active
network connection. (Note the word active there.) Unless you physically
copy the document to your hard drive — which defeats the purpose of doc-
ument sharing — any loss of network connectivity or any problem with your
network account will result in a brick wall and a brightly painted sign read-
ing, “No luck, Jack.” (Or perhaps it’s flashing neon.)
On the other hand, a document shared on a multi-user Mac in the home or
classroom is available whenever you need it. As long as the file is located
in the Shared folder, the file privileges are set correctly, and you know the
password (if one is used), then — as they say on Star Trek — “You have the
conn” whether your network connection is active or not.
Relying on a guaranteed lock
Sharing documents over a network can get a tad hairy when multiple users
open and edit the document simultaneously. Applications such as Office v. X
and AppleWorks have methods of locking the document (giving one person
exclusive access) when someone opens it or saves it. However, you always
face the possibility that what you’re seeing in a shared network document is
not exactly what’s in the document at that moment.
A multi-user system doesn’t need such exquisite complexity. You’re the one
sitting at the keyboard, and you have control: This is what network adminis-
trators call a guaranteed lock on that document file. Refreshing, isn’t it?
Ahh, but now Panther introduces a new feature, called Fast User Switching —
I discuss it in Book I, Chapter 2 — that allows other users to remain logged in
“behind the scenes” while another user is at the keyboard. Therefore, if you
enable Fast User Switching, it’s conceivable that two users could have the
same document open at the same time. To prevent this, you can simply turn
off Fast User Switching from the Accounts panel in System Preferences. (Click
Accounts, click Login Options, and clear the Enable Fast User Switching
check box.)
Most places are off limits
Network users are often confident that they can blithely copy and move a
document from one place to another with the greatest of ease, and that’s
true. Most shared network documents created by an application — such as
a project outline created in Word, for example — carry their own sharing
information and document settings internally. Thus, you can move that

261
same file to another folder on your hard drive, and the rest of the network
team can still open it. (Um, if they have the network rights to access the new
folder, of course.)
This isn’t the case when it comes to multi-user documents. As you can read
in Chapters 4 and 5 of this mini-book, Mac OS X places a rather tight fence
around a Standard-level user, allowing that person to access only the con-
tents of certain folders. In this case, your document must be placed in the
Shared folder for every Standard-level user to be able to open it. If everyone
using the document has Administrator access, you can then store the file in
other spots on your system; as long as the permissions are set, you’re set.
And speaking of permissions. . . .
Permissions: Law Enforcement for Your Files
Files are shared in Mac OS X according to a set of rules called permissions,
the ownership of the file (typically the person who saved the document the
first time), and an access level specified as a group. The combination of priv-
ileges, ownership, and group determines who can do what with the file.
When you (or the person with the administrator account on your Mac) cre-
ated your user account, you were automatically granted ownership of your
Home folder and everything that it contains as well as any files or folders
that you store in the Shared folder or another user’s Public folder.
Three possible actions are allowed through permissions:
✦Read Only: This action allows the user to open and read the file, which
includes copying it to another location.
✦Read & Write: This permission grants full access to the file, including
opening, reading, editing, saving, and deleting. Read & Write permission
also allows the user to copy or move the file to another location.
✦No Access: This is just what it sounds like — the user can’t open the
file, copy it, or move it.
No matter what permissions you’ve set, only the System Administrator (or
Root user) can copy items into another user’s Home folder. Take my word
on this one: Simply consider that this can’t be done. (Trust me on this.)
Read all about the perils of enabling the System Administrator account in
Chapter 4 of this mini-book.
These permissions are set in the Info dialog for a file or folder. If you’re set-
ting the permissions for a folder, you can also elect to apply those same set-
tings to all the enclosed items within the folder.

Permissions: Law Enforcement for Your Files
262
To set permissions, follow these steps:
1. Click the item to select it, press Ô+I (or choose Finder➪File) and then
choose the Get Info menu item.
Mac OS X displays an Info dialog like you see in Figure 6-1.
2. Click the right arrow next to the Ownership & Permissions heading
to expand it, as shown in Figure 6-2.
If necessary, click the right arrow next to the Details subheading to
expand it as well.

Because I’ve selected a folder, the Apply to Enclosed Items button
appears at the bottom of the section.
3. If you’re the file’s owner, you can click the lock icon to change the
owner.
Typically, the Owner drop-down list box is disabled.
The drop-down list box displays all the users with accounts on this
machine, as well as some less savory choices such as nobody, system,
and unknown. Don’t choose any of these.
Perhaps I should be a little less tactful here: Never choose an owner
other than yourself or another recognized Standard-level user — you
can potentially prevent yourself from accessing the file in the future!
4. The first Access drop-down list box determines the access level for
the file’s owner.
This will likely be set to Read & Write, and it’s a good idea to leave it
alone. If you’re the file’s owner, you’re likely not a security risk.
5. Assign permissions for an entire group — this is a good idea for limit-
ing specific files and folders to only Administrator access.
Choose the group from the Group drop-down list and select the desired
access permission from the second Access drop-down list box. If you
have only Administrator accounts, the drop-down list is disabled.
6. Set the permission for the Others drop-down list (otherwise known as
“I’m going to lump everything else into this category”).
If a user isn’t the owner of an item and doesn’t fit into any group that
you’ve selected, this access permission setting for this file applies to
that user.
7. If you’re setting permissions for a folder, Mac OS X can automatically
change the permissions for all the items contained in the folder to the
same settings. Click the Apply to Enclosed Items button, and Mac OS X
displays the confirmation dialog that you see in Figure 6-3.
Generally, it’s a good idea not to override the permissions for all the
items in a folder, so click the Apply to Enclosed Items button only when
necessary.
8. Click OK to proceed or click Cancel to abort the process.
9. After all the permissions are correct, click the Close button to save
your changes and return to your friendly Finder.

Permission and Sharing Do’s and Don’ts
264
Permission and Sharing Do’s and Don’ts
After you get the basics of sharing files and assigning permissions under
your belt, you need to master when to change permissions and why you
should (and shouldn’t) modify them. Follow these common-sense guidelines
when saving documents, assigning permissions, and choosing access levels:
✦Do use your Shared folder. The Shared folder is the center of proper
document sharing. I know there’s a strong urge to create a new docu-
ment in your Home folder, but you’re just making more work for your-
self because you’ll end up copying that document from your Home
folder to the Shared folder. Instead of an extra step, store a document
that’s intended to be shared in the Shared folder — where it belongs in
the first place.
✦Don’t assign permissions just to protect a file from deletion. Remember,
if all you need to do is prevent anyone (including yourself) from deleting
an item, you don’t need to go to all the trouble of changing permissions.
Instead, just display the Info dialog for the item and select the Locked
check box to enable it, which prevents the item from being deleted from
the Trash until the Lock status is disabled.
✦Do review the contents of a folder before changing permissions for
enclosed items. That confirmation dialog doesn’t appear just for kicks.
For example, if you set a highly sensitive, private document with per-
missions of No Access for everyone but yourself and then you apply
less-restrictive permissions globally to the folder that contains the 
document, you’ve just removed the No Access permissions, and anyone
can open your dirty laundry. (Ouch.) Therefore, make sure that you
open the folder and double-check its contents first before applying
global permissions to the items it contains.
✦Don’t change permissions in the Applications or Utilities folders. If
you have Administrator-level access, you can actually change the per-
missions for important applications like Mail, Address Book, iTunes,

and Internet Explorer, as well as their support files. This spells havoc
for all users assigned to the Standard-access level. Be polite and leave
the permissions for these files alone.
✦Definitely don’t change System ownership. Mac OS X is stable and reli-
able. Part of that stability comes from the protected state of the System
folder, as well as a number of other folders on your hard drive. As you
can see in Figure 6-4, displaying the Info dialog for the System folder
shows that the Owner is set to system, and the Group is set to wheel (a
term from the UNIX world that encompasses all administrator
accounts).
Do not change any permissions for any files owned by the System
unless specifically told to do so by an Apple support technician. Do
not monkey with System-owned items.
Sharing Stuff in Office v. X
Many Mac OS X applications offer their own built-in document-sharing 
features. For example, Microsoft Office v. X includes both file-level and 
document-sharing features. Because Office v. X is the most popular produc-
tivity suite available for Mac OS X, I discuss these commands in this final
section.

Document-sharing features
You’ll find a number of commands that help multiple users keep track of
changes that have been made in a shared Office document. Probably the
most familiar is the Word revision tracking features (heavily used during the
development of this book), but there are others as well:
✦Revision marks: If several users edit a document, how can you tell
who did what? By using revision marks, which apply different colors to
changes made by different editors, those additions and deletions can be
accepted or rejected individually at a later date. If Johnson in Marketing
adds incorrect material, you can easily remove just his changes. In a
worst-case scenario, you can actually reject all changes and return the
document to its pristine condition. Figure 6-5 illustrates revision marks
in action.
✦Compare Documents: Using this feature allows you to compare a revised
document with the original (if, of course, you still have the original file
handy). I use Compare Documents only if revision marks weren’t turned
on before editing began.

267
✦Comments: Editors can also converse within a document by using
embedded Comments. These don’t change the contents of the Word file
like revision marks do but store commentary and notes in a behind-the-
scenes kind of way. (Think of a Mac OS X Stickie that appears within a
document.) Again, the author of each comment is listed, allowing for
(sometimes heated) communication within the body of a document.
Figure 6-6 illustrates the Comments pane in a Word document (see the
lower portion of the document).
✦Highlighting: You’ve heard the old joke about the secretary who. . . .
Well, anyway, a traditional highlighter marker is pretty useless on a
computer monitor (leaving a nasty mess for the next user to clean), but
Word allows multiple highlighting colors for identifying text. (And for
the occasional practical joke — nothing like adding eight different high-
lighting colors to that important proposal. Just make sure that your
résumé is up-to-date.)
File-level sharing features
Along with the document-level sharing commands, you’ll also find that
Office v. X applications also offer sharing features that control access to the
document file itself.

Password protection
You can add password protection to any Office v. X document. Follow these
steps with a document created within Word, Excel, or PowerPoint:
1. Choose File➪Save As.
2. In the Save As dialog that appears, click Options to display the Save
Preferences panel that you see in Figure 6-7.
3. To password-protect the document, enter a password in the Password
to Open field.
This password must be provided when opening the document.
If you like, you can enter another password in the Password to Modify
field. This second password would then also be required to modify the
document.
Both passwords are case-sensitive.
4. Click OK to save the preference changes and return to your document.
Versions
If you like, Word can save multiple versions of a document in a single file.
Each version is identified by the date and time when it was saved, the user
who saved it, and an additional comments line. Choose File➪Versions to dis-
play the Versions dialog that you see in Figure 6-8. Note that you can choose

Figure 6-9 illustrates the Protect Document dialog in Word, where you can
effectively write-protect certain elements. In this Office application, you can

Password Protection in AppleWorks
Like with Office v. X, you can set a password to prevent other users from
opening an AppleWorks document. With the document loaded in
AppleWorks version 6, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Properties to display the document Properties dialog, as
shown in Figure 6-10.

 Doing things the hub way
 Digitizing your life
 Making your digital devices work together
H
uzzah! After years of empty promises of professional-quality media
features for home and school — most of them coming from that silly
Gates person in Redmond — Apple has taken on the challenge and formu-
lated a recipe for digital success.
By using tightly integrated hardware and software (where everything works
smoothly together), Apple gives you the ability to easily organize and pro-
duce your own multimedia with the iLife suite of digital tools, which includes
iMovie, iDVD, iPhoto, and iTunes. That same software also provides fantastic
editing capabilities. Finally (and this is very important) — to paraphrase Will
Smith in the movie Men in Black, “Apple makes these programs look good.”
First, Sliced Bread . . . and Now the Digital Hub
In today’s overloaded world of personal electronic devices, people can try
to juggle as many as five or six electronic wonders. Each device typically
comes with its own software, power adapter, and connectors to the outside
world. Although managing one or two devices isn’t terribly difficult, as the
number of devices increases, so do the headaches. When you have a half-
dozen cables, power adapters, and software to cart around, the digital life
can become pretty bleak. (And quite heavy. You’ll need more than a fanny
pack to lug all that gear around.)

What Does Digital Mean, Anyway?
274
To combat this confusion, Apple came up with the idea of a digital hub,
whereby your Macintosh acts as the center of an array of electronic devices.
By using standardized cables, power requirements, built-in software, and
even wireless connections via Bluetooth (the new standard for short-range
wireless communications between devices), the Macintosh — along with its
operating system, Mac OS X — goes a long way toward simplifying your
interaction with all the electronic gadgets that you use.
Given the hub terminology, think of the digital hub as a wagon wheel. (See
Figure 1-1.) At the center of the wheel is your Macintosh. At the end of each
spoke is a digital device. Throughout the rest of Book III, I give you the
skinny on each device, but this chapter gives you the overview and tells you
how they all work together.
What Does Digital Mean, Anyway?
Computers are handy machines. They can process information very quickly
and never get bored when asked to do the same task millions of times. The
problem is that despite their propensity for reliability and speed, they aren’t
so hot in the intuition department. You have to tell them how to do every-
thing (and most of them only talk to application developers and program-
mers). Computers know only one thing — numbers — although they do
know numbers very, very well.

What Can I Digitize?
275
In fact, binary (the language of computers) has only two values — one and
zero, which represent on and off, respectively. (Think of a light switch that
toggles: The earliest computers were simply banks of switches that filled up
an entire room.) To work with a computer in meaningful ways, you have to
describe everything to a computer with numbers — or, if you prefer, digits.
By describing audio in numerical digits, you suddenly have something that a
computer can work with. Toss a computer as many numbers as you want,
and it can handle it. The scientists who figured this out knew that they had
a good thing going, so they proceeded to convert anything that they could
get their hands on into . . . well . . . digits. (Sorry about that atrocious pun.)
Anyway, this resulted in some interesting technologies, most of which you’ll
surely recognize:
✦Audio CDs: The music is represented as numbers and is stored on a
plastic disc.
✦Digital video: Images and sound are stored together on your hard drive
or a DVD as one really, really long string of numbers.
✦Digital fingerprints (no pun intended that time): Your fingerprint is
converted into numerical data, which a computer can use to compare
against fingerprint data from other people.
✦Automated telephone operators: When you call a phone operator these
days, you often aren’t speaking to a real person. Rather, the computer
on the other end of the line converts your voice into digits, which it
uses to interpret your words. (At other times, I think I’m talking to a real
person, but it’s hard to tell.)
What Can I Digitize?
As you’ve probably guessed by now, practically anything can be digitized.
As long as you can represent something as numbers, you can digitize that
data. Whether it’s photographs, video, or audio, your Mac is adept at digitiz-
ing data and processing it.
Photographs
Perhaps the most popular of digital devices, the digital camera has trans-
formed photography forever. By using sophisticated electronics, digital cam-
eras convert the image that you see through the camera viewfinder into an
image made purely of numbers.

The Software That Drives the Hub
276
After this numeric information is transferred to your Macintosh, your com-
puter can cut, twist, fade, label, and paint your digital images. Because num-
bers are the only materials involved, you won’t need scissors, paint, or
adhesive tape to edit images. (Advertising photographers can say good-bye
to the old fashioned airbrush.) Your Macintosh does it all by manipulating
those numbers. It cuts down on the messy art supplies and gives you the
comfort of being able to go back in time — something that anyone who’s not
so handy with scissors can appreciate.
Music
As I mention earlier in this chapter, audio CDs are one application of music
represented as digital data. The physical CD is just a piece of plastic with a
metal coating, but you don’t even really need CDs any longer. Your Macintosh
can digitize audio for storage on your hard drive, too, which brings up
another important point. Not only is digital information palatable to a com-
puter, but it’s also very portable. You can store it on any number of storage
devices, such as an iPod or an external FireWire drive.
Video
When you photograph a scene multiple times per second and then replay
the sequence, you get (tah-dah!) moving pictures. In the analog (as opposed
to digital) world, this would be a strip of celluloid film or a strip of magnetic
tape. In the digital world, such a sequence of photographs is called DV, or
digital video. After you take your digital video, you can transfer that data to
your Macintosh to further manipulate it: You can edit it and add transitions,
text, and other effects.
DVD
Like a CD-ROM or a hard drive, a DVD is simply a means of storing digital
data. Although you can use it to save many different kinds of data, its most
common use is for presenting video content. The Macintosh digital hub can
produce DVDs by using any digital information that you give it.
The Software That Drives the Hub
At the heart of your digital hub is your Macintosh. To use and manipulate all
the data that arrives at your Mac, your computer needs software, which pro-
vides instructions on what to do with the information that you send.
Fortunately, Apple has fashioned some of the most attractive and easy-to-use
software ever written to help you manipulate and manage your digital
lifestyle. The list of software that belongs to the digital hub includes

✦iPhoto: Use iPhoto to download, manipulate, and organize your favorite
digital photographs.
✦iTunes: iTunes offers the ability to create and manage your music col-
lection. You can purchase and download audio tracks from the Apple
Music Store. iTunes can even burn CDs!
✦iMovie: Every film director needs a movie-editing suite. iMovie gives
you the chance to set up Hollywood in your living room with outstand-
ing results.
✦iDVD: As home video moves toward the digital realm, iDVD becomes
an essential tool for authoring your own DVD media. Home movies will
never be the same!
✦iCal: To help keep your hectic digital lifestyle in order, iCal offers com-
plete calendar features. Besides tracking your dates and appointments
on your Mac, you can publish calendars on the Web or share them with
different parts of the digital hub. (Or, if you’ve got an iPod like me, you
can even download your appointments and carry ’em with you.)
✦iSync: With so many digital devices at your disposal, it gets hard to keep
them all straight. iSync is software for automatically synchronizing con-
tact and calendar information between cellphones, your personal digital
assistant (PDA), an iPod, the Mac OS X Address Book, and iCal.
iPhoto
What good is a camera without a photo album? iPhoto, Apple’s photography
software, serves as a digital photo album. Check out the cool contact sheet
view in Figure 1-2. Use it to help you arrange and manage your digital photos.
Beyond its functions as a photo album, iPhoto also gives you the ability to
touch-up your images through cropping, retouching, scaling, rotating, and
red-eye reduction (photographically speaking, not morning-after speaking).
Besides offering editing features, iPhoto also works automatically with your
digital camera. Simply plug in the camera to your Mac’s Universal Serial Bus
(USB) port, and iPhoto knows it’s there. Need to transfer photos from the
camera to your photo album? iPhoto can do that, too.
When you complete a collection of photographs that you find interesting,
use iPhoto to help you publish them on the Internet or even to create your
very own coffee-table book. (The latest in high-tech: a paper book.) And for
those of you who still want that nifty wallet print to show off at work or a
poster to hang on your wall, you can print them with your own printer or
order them online through iPhoto. Orders made with iPhoto show up in
your mailbox a few days later.

The Software That Drives the Hub
278
iTunes
To help you wrangle your enormous music collection, Apple offers iTunes
(see Figure 1-3). For starters, iTunes is a sophisticated audio player for all
your digital audio files. But iTunes is also handy for converting audio tracks
from audio CDs to a number of popular digital audio file formats, such as
AAC, MP3, and AIFF. After you import or convert your music into computer
files, iTunes helps you manage and maintain your music collection. You can
even listen to streaming online “radio stations,” 24 hours a day.
The latest version of iTunes introduces the Apple Music Store, where you
can preview hundreds of thousands of songs for up to 30 seconds each with-
out spending a dime. If you hear something that you’d like to buy, you can
use your credit card to purchase and download your music (either as indi-
vidual tracks for 99 cents each, or as a complete album for a package price).
After the music that you’ve bought is comfortably nestled in iTunes, you can
play it on your Mac, burn it to an audio CD, or download it to your iPod.
Why do I keep harping on the iPod? Well, as a proud owner of one, I’m glad
you asked: Apple’s iPod is a versatile, lightweight audio player with hidden
extras that James Bond would covet. It has enough capacity to store your
entire collection of music, but it’s small enough to fit into your shirt pocket.
With iTunes, you can instantly exchange songs between your Macintosh and
your iPod. You can also use iTunes to create audio and MP3 CDs for play-
back elsewhere. And the iPod even works as honest-to-goodness, back-up

storage . . . you see, it also functions as a standard external FireWire hard
drive. It can display text files and play games; you can carry even your
Address Book contacts and iCal appointments with you with aplomb. (For
the lowdown on iPod, peruse Book III, Chapter 2.)
iMovie
You needn’t restrict yourself to still images: Hook up your digital camcorder
to your Mac as well. Use iMovie, the easy-to-use video editing application
shown in Figure 1-4, to create and edit digital movies. With stunning video-
editing candy like transitions, sound effects, and video effects, iMovie turns
your home movies into professional productions that you’ll be proud to
share with friends and family. Finally, you can have a home movie night
without putting everyone to sleep.
iDVD
Of course, after you create a video masterpiece, you probably want to save
it on a DVD for preservation and future viewing. To help you in your endeav-
ors, use iDVD to create — or, as video professionals call it, author — DVD
movies. With the preset templates, iDVD will have you cranking out stunning
DVDs with interactive menus in no time, ready to use with any DVD player.

Can I Use All This Stuff at Once?
What makes the digital hub idea even juicier is that it’s an interoperable
model. Let’s pause to appreciate that. (What, you don’t speak engineer? No
problem!) In plain English, the digital hub allows you to use digital media
from one part of the hub with another part of the hub. Thus, the individual
parts of the digital hub can work together to complement each other. To
illustrate, consider some digital sharing scenarios:
✦You shoot a great photograph of your kids. It’s so great, in fact, that
you’d like to use it as the title page of your family’s home movie. With
the digital hub, you can use that same photograph in iMovie to create
your home flick. When you’re done with that, transfer the whole thing
to a DVD by using iDVD, and your masterpiece is safe for decades of
viewing. One image just worked its way through three parts of the digi-
tal hub.
✦Your band just recorded a catchy song for its latest album. You use
iTunes to convert the track from the demo CD to AAC format. From
there, you add the song to the soundtrack of the music video that you’re
creating with iMovie. Then you burn the finished project to DVD to show
prospective agents. Again, one piece of media has traveled through three
parts of the digital hub!

✦Your band becomes popular and starts to play some impressive gigs. To
document your band’s rise to stardom, your friend films a concert with
a DV camcorder. You use iMovie to transfer the video to your Macintosh
and create clips of your favorite performances of the concert. After that,
it’s a simple matter to author to DVD with iDVD, extract the audio from
the video for use as an MP3, and grab an image from the video for a
band scrapbook that you’re creating with iPhoto. Now you’ve attained
honest-to-goodness DHH (shorthand for Digital Hub Heaven). You’ve tra-
versed the entire hub, easily sharing the media along the way.
Lest I forget, I should mention the other advantage of the digital hub: The
media that you swap between all your “iApplications” remains in digital form,
so it never loses quality! In the previous example of shooting a concert, for
instance, that concert footage never lost quality while it was being transferred
to DVD, converted to MP3, or pasted into your iPhoto album. Unlike archaic
VHS tape, you don’t have to worry about whether your source is second-
generation — and you can forget degradation and that silly tracking control.

ood news! It’s time to throw out your Dad’s Hi-Fi (you know, the one
with the four-inch speakers that you’re embarrassed to show your
friends). That’s because every installation of Mac OS X comes with the
newest gadget in town: a great stereophonic audio application called iTunes
4. With it, you can listen to your favorite songs, organize your music collec-
tion, listen to radio stations from around the world, buy music online, burn
CDs, and much more! iTunes has so many features that you’ll soon find
yourself wondering why you even own a stereo at all. In no time, you’ll be
pondering how much new speakers with a subwoofer will cost for your Mac.
In this chapter, I show you how to play audio CDs and Internet downloads,
but that’s just the beginning. You discover how to use iTunes’ Library to get
one-click access to any song in your collection. I even show you how to tune
into Internet radio, burn audio CDs (if you have the necessary hardware),
plug in your iPod, and buy the latest hits from the Apple Music Store. (And
I demonstrate how to make your iTunes interface look just as good as your
music sounds.)
Just in case, though, keep your Dad’s Hi-Fi . . . it might fetch a hefty sum as
an antique on eBay.
What Can I Play on iTunes?
Simply put, iTunes is an audio player; it plays audio files. These files can be
in any of many different formats. Some of the more common audio formats
that iTunes supports are
✦MP3: The small size of MP3 files has made them popular for file trading
on the Internet. You can reduce MP3 files to a ridiculously small size (at

Playing an Audio CD
284
the expense of audio fidelity), but a typical CD-quality, three-minute pop
song in MP3 format has a size of 3–5MB.
✦AAC: A recent introduction from Apple, AAC is an audio format that’s
very similar to MP3; in fact, AAC files are a little smaller, with the same
recording quality. However, the new format also supports a built-in copy
protection scheme that prevents AAC music from being widely distrib-
uted on Macs. (Luckily, you can still burn AAC tracks to an audio CD,
just like MP3 tracks.) The tracks that you download from the Apple
Music Store are in AAC format.
✦AIFF: The standard Macintosh audio format produces sound of the 
highest quality. This high quality, however, also means that the files are
typically large. A typical pop song in AIFF format has a size of 30–50MB.
✦WAV: Not to be outdone, Microsoft created its own audio file format
(WAV) that works much like AIFF. It can reproduce sound at higher qual-
ity than MP3, but the file sizes are large, like AIFF.
✦CD audio: iTunes can play audio CDs. Because you don’t usually store
CD audio anywhere but on an audio CD, file size is no big whoop.
Playing an Audio CD
Playing an audio CD in iTunes is simple. Just insert the CD in your computer’s
disk tray, close the tray, start iTunes by clicking its icon in the Dock, and click
the Play button. The iTunes interface resembles that of a traditional cassette
or CD player. The main playback controls of the iTunes are Play, Previous
Song, Next Song, and the Volume Slider, as shown in Figure 2-1.
Click the Play button to begin listening to a song. While a song is playing, the
Play button toggles to a Stop button. As you might imagine, clicking that
button again stops the music. If you don’t feel like messing around with a
mouse, you can always use the keyboard. The spacebar acts as the Play and
Stop buttons. Press the spacebar to begin playback; press it again to stop.
Click the Next Song button to advance to the next song on the CD. The
Previous Song button works like the Next Song button but with a slight
twist: If a song is currently playing and you click the Previous Song button,
iTunes will first return to the beginning of the current song (just like an
audio CD player). To advance to the previous song, double-click the
Previous Song button. To change the volume of your music, click and drag
the volume slider.
Your mother was right: Listening to loud music can and will damage your
hearing, especially considering that most computer speaker systems are
much closer to your ears than a typical stereo. (Not to mention the punch
provided by those iPod headphones.) Consider yourself warned, and turn
that thing down!

Playing a Digital Audio File
In addition to playing audio CDs, iTunes can also play the digital audio files
that you download from the Internet or obtain from other sources in the WAV,
AAC, AIFF, and MP3 file formats. Enjoying a digital audio file is just slightly
more complicated than playing a CD. After downloading or saving your audio
files to your Mac, open the Finder and navigate to wherever you stored the
files — then simply drag them from the Finder into the Library entry in the
iTunes Source list. (The added files appear in the iTunes Library. Go figure.)
If you happened to drop the file on top of a Playlist name in the Source list,
iTunes adds it to that particular Playlist as well as the main Library. (More
about Playlists in a bit.) Think of the Library as a master list of your music.
To view the Library, select it in the left-hand column of the iTunes player, as
shown in Figure 2-2.
To play a song, just double-click it in the Library. Alternatively, you can use
the playback controls (Play, Previous Song, Next Song) that I discuss earlier
in this chapter (refer to Figure 2-1).
Note that the Source list of iTunes can list up to five possible sources for
music:
✦Library: I talk about this in this section.
✦iPod: If you’re lucky to enough have one connected.
✦Apple Music Store: I discuss this later in this section, “Buying Music the
Apple Way.”
✦Audio CD: A standard audio CD . . . anything from the Bee Gees to Foo
Fighters.
✦iTunes Radio: Think Internet radio stations, which I discuss further in
the section “iTunes Radio.”
Notice also that the Library lists information for each song that you add to
it, such as
✦Song Name: The title of the song
✦Time: The length of the song
✦Artist: The artist who performs the song
✦Album: The album on which the song appears
If some of the songs that you’re adding don’t display anything for the title,
album, or artist information, don’t panic; most MP3 files have embedded
data that iTunes can read. If a song doesn’t include any data, you can always
add the information to these fields manually. I show you how later in the
section “Setting or changing the song information manually.”

Clicking any of the column headings in the Library causes iTunes to reorder
the Library according to that category. For example, clicking on the Song
Name column heading will alphabetize your Library by song title — I click the
Time heading often to sort my Library according to the length of the songs.
Browsing the Library
After you add a few dozen songs to iTunes, viewing the Library can become
a task. Although a master list is nice for some purposes, it becomes as cum-
bersome as an elephant in a subway tunnel if the list is very long. To help
out, iTunes can display your Library in another format, too — besides one
huge list, the Library also has a browsing mode. To view the Library in
browsing mode, click the Browse button in the upper right-hand corner of
iTunes, as shown in Figure 2-3.
The Browse mode of iTunes displays your library in a compact fashion,
organizing your tunes into three sections:
✦Artist
✦Album
✦Song Name
Figure 2-2:

Selecting an artist from the Artist list causes iTunes to display that artist’s
albums in the Album list. Select an album from the Album list, and iTunes
displays that album’s songs in the bottom section of the Browse window.
(Those Apple software designers . . . always thinking of you and me.)
Finding songs in your Library
After your collection of audio files grows large, you might have trouble locat-
ing that Swedish remix version of “I’m Your Boogie Man.” To help you out,
iTunes has a built-in Search function. To find a song, type some text into the
search field of the main iTunes interface. As you type, iTunes tries to find a
selection that matches your search text. The search is quite thorough, show-
ing any matching text from the artist, album, song title, and genre fields in the
results. For example, if you type Electronic into the field, iTunes might return
results for the band named Electronic or other tunes that you classified as
electronic in the Genre field. (The section “Know Your Songs” later in this
chapter tells you how to classify your songs by genre, among other options.)
Click the magnifying glass at the left side of the Search field and you can
restrict the search even more: by Artists, Albums, Composers, and Songs.
Figure 2-4 shows the iTunes search function in action: I typed love into the
search field, and iTunes returned every song title containing that word.

“Will I trash my Count Basie?”
And now a very special Mark’s Maxim for
novice iTunes users:
iTunes will watch your back when you trash
tracks. ™
To illustrate: Suppose that you delete a song
from the Library that is only located in the
iTunes music folder (which you didn’t copy into
iTunes from another location on your hard
drive). That means you’re about to delete the
song entirely, and there’ll be no copy remaining
on your Mac at all. Rest assured, though, that
iTunes will promptly prompt you to make sure
that you really want to move the file to the Trash.
(I get fearful e-mail messages all the time from
readers who are loath to delete anything from
iTunes because they’re afraid they’ll trash their
digital music files completely.)
Remember: If you delete a song from the Library
that also exists elsewhere on your hard drive
(outside the reach of the iTunes music folder), it
won’t be deleted from your hard drive. In fact, if
you mistakenly remove a song that you meant
to keep, just drag it back into iTunes from the
Finder. ’Nuff said.

Removing old music from the Library
After you spend some time playing songs with iTunes, you might decide that
you didn’t really want to add 40 different versions of “Louie Louie” to your
Library. (Personally, I prefer either the original or the cast from the movie
Animal House.) To remove a song from the Library, click the song to select it
and then press the Delete key on your keyboard.
You can also remove a song from the Library by dragging it to the Trash in
your Dock. Cool!
Keeping Slim Whitman and Slim Shady
Apart: Organizing with Playlists
As I mention earlier, the iTunes Library can quickly become a fearsomely
huge beastie. Each Library can hold up to 32,000 songs: If your Library
grows anywhere near that large, finding all the songs in your lifelong collec-
tion of Paul Simon albums is not going to be a fun task. Furthermore, with
the Library, you’re stuck playing songs in the order that iTunes lists them.
To help you organize your music into groups, use the iTunes Playlist feature.
A Playlist is a collection of some of your favorite songs from the Library. You
can create as many Playlists as you want, and each Playlist can contain any
numbers of songs. Whereas the Library lists all available songs, a Playlist
displays only the songs that you add to it. Further, any changes that you
make to a Playlist only affect that Playlist, leaving the Library intact.
To create a Playlist, you can do any of the following:
✦Choose File➪New Playlist.
✦Press Ô+N.
✦Click the New Playlist button in the iTunes window (the plus sign button
in the lower-left corner). Figure 2-5 shows a newly created Playlist (the
toe-tappin’ untitled playlist) before any tunes have been added.
All Playlists appear in the Source list. To help organize your Playlists, it’s a
good idea to . . . well . . . name them. (Aren’t you glad you’ve got this book?)
For example, suppose that you want to plan a party for your polka-loving
friends: Instead of running to your computer after each song to change the
music, you could create a polka-only Playlist. Select and start the Playlist at
the beginning of the party, and you won’t have to worry about changing the
music the whole night — you can concentrate on the accordion. To load a
Playlist, select it in the Source list; iTunes displays the songs for that Playlist.

Know Your Songs
291
The same song can appear in any number of Playlists because the songs in
a Playlist are simply pointers to songs in the Library — not the songs them-
selves. Add and remove them at will to any Playlist, secure in the knowledge
that the songs will remain safe in the Library. Removing a Playlist is simple:
Select the Playlist and then press Delete.
Removing a Playlist does not actually delete all those songs from your
Library.
Know Your Songs
Besides organizing your music into Elvis and non-Elvis Playlists, iTunes gives
you the option to track your music at the song level. Each song that you add
to the Library has a complete set of information associated with it. iTunes
displays this information in the Info dialog with the following fields:
✦Name: The name of the song
✦Artist: The name of the artist who performed the song
✦Composer: The name of the astute individual who actually wrote the song
Figure 2-5:
Click the
New Playlist
button to
create a

Know Your Songs
292
✦Album: The album where the song appears
✦Year: The year the artist recorded the song
✦Track Number: The position of the song on the original album
✦Genre: The classification of the song (such as rock, jazz, or pop)
You can display this information by clicking on a song name and pressing
Ô+I — the fields appear on the Info tab.
Setting the song information automatically
Each song that you add to the iTunes Library might or might not have song
information included with it. If you add music from an audio CD, iTunes will
connect to a server on the Internet and attempt to find the information for
each song on the CD. If you download a song from the Internet, it often
comes with some information embedded in the file already; the amount of
included information depends on what the creator supplied. (And believe
me, it’s often misspelled as well — think Leenard Skeenard.) If you don’t
have an Internet connection, iTunes can’t access the information and will
display generic titles instead.
Setting or changing the song information manually
If iTunes can’t find your CD in the online database or someone gives you an
MP3 with incomplete or inaccurate information, you can change the infor-
mation yourself. To view and change the information for a song, perform the
following steps:
1. Select the song in either the Library or a Playlist.
2. Press Ô+I or choose File➪Get Info.
3. Edit the song’s information on the Info tab, as shown in Figure 2-6.
Keep in mind that the more work you put into setting the information of the
songs in your Library, the easier it is to browse and use iTunes. Incomplete
song information can make it more difficult to find your songs in a hurry. If
you prefer, you don’t have to change all information about a song (it just
makes life easier later if you do). Normally, you can get away with setting
only a song’s title, artist, and genre — the more information you put in, how-
ever, the faster you’ll locate songs and the easier they’ll be to arrange.
iTunes tries to help by automatically retrieving known song information, but
sometimes you have to roll up your sleeves and do a little work. (Sorry, but
the DataElves are out to lunch.)

Ripping Audio Files
293
Ripping Audio Files
You don’t have to rely on Internet downloads to get audio files: You can create
your own MP3, AIFF, and WAV files from your audio CDs with iTunes. The
process of converting audio files to different formats is ripping. (Audiophiles
with technical teeth also call this process digital extraction, but they’re usually
ignored at parties by the popular crowd.) Depending on what hardware or
software you use, each has its own unique format preferences. For example,
an iPod likes MP3 or AAC files, but your audio CDs are not in that format.
Being able to convert files from one format to another is like having a per-
sonal translator in the digital world. You don’t need to worry if you have the
wrong format: You can simply convert it to the format that you need.
The most common type of ripping is to convert CD audio to MP3 format. To
rip MP3s from an audio CD, follow these simple steps:
1. Launch iTunes by clicking its icon in the Dock.
Alternatively, you can locate it in your Applications folder.
2. Choose iTunes➪Preferences.
3. In the Preferences window that appears, click the Importing tab.
4. Select MP3 Encoder from the Import Using pop-up menu and then
click OK.

5. Load an audio CD into your Mac.
The CD title shows up in the iTunes Source list, which is on the left side
of the iTunes interface. The CD track listing appears on the right side of
the interface.
6. Clear the check box of any song that you don’t want to import from
the CD.
All songs on the CD have a check box next to their title by default.
Unmarked songs will not be imported.
Notice that the Browse button changes to Import.
7. After you select the songs that you want added to the Library, click
the Import button.
Tweaking the Audio for Your Ears
Besides the standard volume controls that I mention earlier in this chapter,
iTunes offers a full equalizer. An equalizer permits you to alter the volume of
various frequencies in your music, allowing you to boost low sounds, lower
high sounds, or anything in between. Now you can customize the way that
your music sounds and adjust it to your liking.
To open the Equalizer (as shown in Figure 2-7), do one of the following:
✦Choose Window➪Equalizer.
✦Press Ô+2.
✦Click the Equalizer button (refer to Figure 2-1).
The Equalizer window has an impressive array of 11 sliders. The leftmost
slider is for setting the overall level of the Equalizer, and the remaining slid-
ers represent various frequencies that the human ear can perceive. Setting a
slider to a position in the middle of its travel will cause that frequency to
play back with no change. Move the slider above the midpoint to boost that
frequency; conversely, move the slider below the midpoint to reduce the
volume of that frequency.
Continue adjusting the equalizer sliders until your music sounds the way that
you like it. When you close the Equalizer window, iTunes will remember your
settings until you change them again. If you prefer to leave frequencies to the
experts, the iTunes Equalizer has several predefined settings to match most
musical styles. Click the pop-up menu at the top of the Equalizer window to
select a genre, as shown in Figure 2-8.

iTunes Radio
Although it’s not a radio tuner in the strictest sense, iTunes Radio can locate
virtual radio stations all over the world that send audio over the Internet —
a process usually called streaming amongst the “In” Internet crowd. iTunes
can track down hundreds of Internet radio stations in a variety of styles with
only a few mouse clicks.
To begin listening to Internet radio with iTunes, click the Radio icon located
directly beneath the Library icon in the Source list. The result is a list of more
than 20 types of radio stations, organized by genre, as shown in Figure 2-9.
When you expand a Radio category by clicking its triangle, iTunes queries a
tuning server and locates the name and address of dozens of radio stations
for that category, as shown in Figure 2-10. Whether you like Elvis or not-Elvis
(those passing fads, like new wave, classical, or alternative), there’s some-
thing here for everyone. The Radio also offers news, sports, and talk radio.

loads the station, and begins to play it.

“What’s with the numbers next 
to the radio station names?”
I’m glad you asked: They indicate the amount of
data that each must send through your Internet
connection for things to sound their best. The
larger the number, the faster your connection
needs to be to receive it: For example, users with
cable modem (a fast network connection for the
home), digital subscriber line (DSL; an even
faster connection for the home), or T1 (a super-
fast connection typically used by businesses)
connections can easily listen to the fastest
streams, which typically rate at 128 Kbps.
Analog dial-up modem users will want to aim for
a station that transmits in slower streams, such
as 56 or 24 Kbps. As the stream rate increases,
the quality of the sound that you hear improves.
Therefore, you should choose the fastest rate
that your particular connection can handle for
the best-sounding audio.

A New Kind of Radio Station

Tuning in your own stations
Although iTunes offers you a large list of popular radio stations on the Web,
it’s by no means comprehensive — eventually, you might run across a radio
station that you’d like to hear, but it’s not listed in iTunes. Luckily, iTunes
permits you to listen to other stations, too. To listen to a radio station that
iTunes doesn’t list, you’ll need the station’s Web address.
In iTunes, choose Advanced➪Open Stream (or press Ô+U). In the Open
Stream dialog that appears (as shown in Figure 2-11), enter the URL of your
desired radio station and then click OK. Within seconds, iTunes will tune in
your station.
Radio stations in your Playlists
If you find yourself visiting an online radio station more than once, you’ll be
glad to know that iTunes supports radio stations in its Playlists. To add a
radio station to a Playlist from the Radio, do the following:
1. Open the category that contains the station that you want to add to
your Playlist.
2. Locate the station that you would like to add to your Playlist and drag
it from the Radio list to the desired Playlist on the left.
If you haven’t created any Playlists yet, see the section “Keeping Slim
Whitman and Slim Shady Apart: Organizing with Playlists” earlier in this
chapter to find out how.
Adding a radio station that doesn’t appear in the Radio list is a bit trickier
but possible nonetheless. Even though iTunes allows you to load a radio sta-
tion URL manually, it doesn’t give you an easy way to add it to the Playlist.
Follow these steps to add a radio station to a Playlist:
1. Add any radio station from the Radio to your desired Playlist.
2. Press Ô+I or choose File➪Get Info to bring up the information dialog
for that station.

iSending iTunes to iPod
If you’re lucky enough (like me) to own an iPod, you’ll be happy to know that
iTunes has features for your personal jukebox as well. The iPod is Apple’s
MP3 player, which is a portable device (about $299) that can hold literally
thousands of songs. This great gadget and those like it are likely to soon
replace Sony Discman and Walkman as the preferred portable music player.
You connect your iPod to your Macintosh with a FireWire cable (which is
included, natch). After the iPod is connected, it automatically synchronizes
to the Playlists in iTunes. The iPod and the iTunes software communicate
with each other and figure out what songs are in your iTunes Library (as
compared with the iPod Library). If they discover songs in your iTunes
Library that are missing from your iPod, the songs automatically transfer to
the iPod. Conversely, if the iPod contains songs that are no longer in iTunes,
the iPod automatically removes those files from its drive.
Go back and reread that last sentence above about the iPod automatically
removing files from its drive. (I’ll wait here.) Apple added this feature in an
effort to be attentive to copyright concerns. The reasoning is that if you con-
nect your iPod to your friend’s computer, you won’t be able to transfer songs
from the iPod to that computer. Of course, you could always look at it from
the marketing perspective as a feature that makes sure your Mac and iPod
are always in total sync. Whatever the case, pay close attention and read all
dialogs when connecting to a Mac other than your own, or you might wipe
out your iPod’s library.
The best thing I can say about the iPod and iTunes combination is . . . well . . .
that there isn’t anything else to say about them. The auto-sync feature is so
easy to use, you forget about it almost immediately.

Burning Music to Shiny Plastic Circles

Burning Music to Shiny Plastic Circles
Besides being a great audio player, iTunes is adept at creating CDs, too.
iTunes makes the process of recording songs to a CD as simple as a few
mouse clicks — making the modern version of a compilation (or mix) tape
is easier than getting a kid to eat ice cream. iTunes lets you burn CDs in one
of three formats:
✦Audio CD: This is the typical kind of commercial music CD that you buy
at a store. Most typical music audio CDs store 700MB of data, which
translates into about 80 minutes of music.
✦Data CD: A standard CD-ROM is recorded with the MP3 files. This disc
can’t be played in any standard audio CD player (even if it supports
MP3 CDs, which I discuss next). Therefore, you can only listen to these
songs by using your Mac and an MP3 player like iTunes 4, or a PC run-
ning Windows.
✦MP3 CD: Like the ordinary computer CD-ROM that I just described, an
MP3 CD holds MP3 files in data format — however, the files are arranged
in such a way that they can be recognized by audio CD players that sup-
port the MP3 CD format (especially boomboxes and car stereos). Because
MP3 files are so much smaller than the digital audio tracks found on tradi-
tional audio CDs, you can fit as many as 160 typical 4-minute songs on
one disc. These discs can also be played on your Mac via iTunes.
Keep in mind that MP3 CDs are not the same as the standard audio CDs that
you buy at the store, and you can’t play them in older audio CD players that
don’t support the MP3 CD format. Rather, this is the kind of archival disc
that you burn at home for your own collection.
First things first: Before you burn, you need to set the recording format. Open
the iTunes Preferences by choosing iTunes➪Preferences; then click the
Burning tab. Select the desired disc format by enabling the corresponding
radio button. Click OK to close the Preferences window when you’re finished.
The next step in the CD creation process is to build a Playlist. Create a new
Playlist and add to it whatever songs you would like to have on the CD. (See
the earlier section “Keeping Slim Whitman and Slim Shady Apart: Organizing
with Playlists” if you need a refresher.) With the songs in the correct order,
select the Playlist. When you do, the Browse button changes into a Burn
Disc button, as shown in Figure 2-12. Click that button to commence the CD
burning process. iTunes will let you know when the recording is complete.

Buying Music the Apple Way

After you download iTunes plug-ins, you need to install them in a specific
place to ensure that iTunes can find them. To install a plug-in, follow these
steps:
1. Open a Finder window.
2. Click your Home folder icon in the locations list at the left side of the
window.
3. From the Home folder, navigate to the /Library/iTunes/iTunes
Plug-ins folder.
4. Add any new plug-ins that you’ve downloaded to this folder.
5. Restart iTunes to use the new plug-in.
Of course, some plug-ins have an actual installer application, in which case
you don’t need to locate the iTunes Plugins folder. The installer should
place the necessary files in the appropriate place for you.
Buying Music the Apple Way
Before we wave goodbye to the happy residents of iTunes iSland, I won’t
forget to mention the hottest spot on the Internet for buying music: the
Apple Music Store, which you can reach from the cozy confines of iTunes.
(That is, as long as you have an Internet connection. If you don’t, it’s time to
turn the page to the next chapter.)
Figure 2-14 illustrates the “lobby” of this online audio store. Click the Music
Store item in the Source list, and after a few moments, you’ll be presented
with the latest offerings. Click the Choose Genre drop-down list to browse
through the store according to musical genre, or click the Power Search link
to search by song title, artist, album, or composer. The Back/Forward but-
tons at the top of the Music Store window operate much like those in Safari,
moving you backward or forward in sequence through pages that you’ve
already seen. A click on the Home button (which, through no great coinci-
dence, looks like a miniature house) takes you back to the Store’s main page.
To display the details on a specific album or track, just click it. If you’re
interested in buying just certain tracks (for that perfect road warrior mix),
you get to listen to several seconds of any track — for free, no less. To add a
song or album to your Music Store shopping cart, click the Add Song or Add
Album button. When you’re ready to buy, click the Shopping Cart item in the
Source list and then click the Buy Now button. (At the time of this writing,
tracks are 99 cents a pop, and an entire album is typically $9.99 . . . what a
bargain!)

The Music Store creates an account for you based on your e-mail address,
and it also keeps secure track of your credit card information for future pur-
chases. After you use the Music Store once, you never have to login or
retype your credit card information again.
The tracks that you download are saved to a separate Playlist called
Purchased Music — after the download is finished, you can play them, move
them to other Playlists, burn them to an audio CD, or ship ’em to your iPod,
just like any other track in your iTunes Library.
Remember all those skeptics who claimed that buying digital audio could
never work over the Internet because of piracy issues and high costs? Well,
bunkie, hats off to Apple: Once again, Apple has done something the right way!

In This Chapter

 Tweaking the appearance of photographs
 Sharing photos with your friends
F
or years, the Macintosh has been the choice of professional photogra-
phers for working with digital images — not surprising, considering the
Mac’s graphical nature. Apple continues this tradition with iPhoto, which is
a photography tool for the home user that can help you organize, edit, and
even publish your photographs. (It sports more features than a handful of
Swiss army knives.) After you shoot your photos with a digital camera, you
can import them into iPhoto, edit them, and publish them. You’re not lim-
ited to photos that you take yourself, either; you can edit, publish, and
organize all kinds of digital image files. You can even create a photo album
and use the iPhoto interface to order a handsome hard-bound copy shipped
to you.
In this chapter, I walk you through an overview of what iPhoto can do. After
that, I give you a brief tour of the controls within iPhoto so you can see what
features are available to you, including features for managing, printing, and
publishing your photos.
What iPhoto Can Do
iPhoto performs many different types of tasks. From your camera to the
printed page and everything in between, iPhoto steps you through the
process of digital photography:
✦Import: Digital cameras are everywhere these days, so it’s important for
your Macintosh to quickly and easily connect with them. iPhoto takes
the guesswork out of working with a digital camera. Simply plug any
supported digital camera into your Mac’s USB port, open iPhoto, and
click a button or two. (I give you the details later in the section
“Importing Images 101.”) iPhoto automatically imports the images that
you’ve taken. If iPhoto doesn’t recognize your camera, it’s likely either
out of battery power or is not supported.

Delving into iPhoto
308
✦Organize: Ansel Adams would be shocked that a digital camera has no
film (while your kids don’t even raise an eyebrow). Instead, most of
today’s digital cameras use memory modules called cards, which are
instantly reusable. For that reason, you might find yourself taking many
more pictures than usual — and as your collection of photographs
grows, you’ll need some help keeping them all organized (perennial
favorites like paper albums and shoeboxes are out). iPhoto is, at its
core, a digital photo album that you can use to organize, sort, and
search your photographs in seconds. iPhoto offers many great features
to help you manage your digital equivalent of a shoebox full of photos.
You’ll never lose an important photo again.
✦Edit: After you see the images from your camera on your computer
monitor, you realize that your dog Lucifer has red eyes (no big surprise
there), your ocean pictures are upside down, and the campfire photos
are too dark. With a traditional film camera, you’d probably toss that
campfire photograph in the trash; thankfully, iPhoto has an array of
image-editing tools that make the bad photos good and the good ones
better.
✦Publish: With all these photographs on your computer, you decide that
it would be nice to pass a few on to Grandma, post a couple on your
Web site, and print the rest. iPhoto guides you through a number of
ways to share your photographs with others. From print to the Internet
to e-mail to CD-ROM, iPhoto takes away the hassle of working with
images on a computer with a simple-to-use interface.
Delving into iPhoto
The iPhoto interface continues in the vein of other iLife iApps, using only
one window (plus the occasional dialog) to work all its magic. The main
iPhoto window is split into three sections: its Toolbar, the Album List, and
the Viewer. Figure 3-1 shows the three main sections of the iPhoto window.
✦Toolbar: The iPhoto Toolbar is the main control center for iPhoto. At
the top of the Toolbar is a row of buttons (see Figure 3-1). They give you
one-click access to the various modes of iPhoto.
When you change modes, the Toolbar panel changes to reflect the func-
tions available in that mode. For example, click the Edit button to view
the editing functions, such as Crop, Brightness/Contrast, or B & W
(black and white). Click the Book button to see the controls necessary
to publish a hard-bound photo album.
✦Album List: To the left side of the iPhoto interface is the Album List
(refer to Figure 3-1). This is where you organize your photo albums or
select them for viewing.

309
✦Viewer: The largest portion of the iPhoto interface is the Viewer (see
Figure 3-1). The Viewer, where you see your photographs when you
browse through photo albums, is also the main window for editing indi-
vidual images and laying out photo books.
Importing Images 101
After you have the iPhoto basics under your belt, it’s time to get busy.
Before you do anything else with iPhoto, you need to import some photo-
graphs into it. iPhoto provides a couple of ways to import photos, depend-
ing on the source of the image.
Importing images from a digital camera
To import photographs from your digital camera, follow these simple steps:
1. Connect your digital camera to your Macintosh.
Plug one end of a USB cable into your camera and the other end into
your Macintosh’s USB port. Then prepare your camera to download
images; for most models, that means simply turning on the camera.
2. Launch iPhoto.
Figure 3-1:
The iPhoto
window
has three
main parts.

Importing Images 101
310
Launch iPhoto by clicking its icon in the Applications folder. The first
time that you launch iPhoto, you have the option of setting its auto-
launch feature. If you turn on auto-launch, iPhoto will launch whenever
you connect a camera to your Mac. If you want to change the auto-
launch setting at a later date, you can access it via the Preferences
menu of Apple’s Image Capture utility, also located in the Applications
folder.
3. Click the Import mode button on the iPhoto Toolbar, as shown in
Figure 3-2.
This sets iPhoto in Import mode. While in Import mode, the Toolbar
panel changes to reflect import operations. At the rightmost side of the
Toolbar panel is another Import button.
4. Click the second Import button to import your photographs from the
camera.
While you import images from your camera, iPhoto displays a small preview
in the Toolbar panel. iPhoto sticks the newly imported images in the Photo
Library, which is the warehouse for all your images.
Click to bring up Import settings.

311
Importing image files
Besides images that you shot with your digital camera, you can also import
any image file on your system into the Photo Library. This could include
images that friends have sent you, that you’ve downloaded off the Internet,
or that you’ve created in a graphics program such as Photoshop. You can
import image files in one of two ways:
✦Choose File➪Import: When you click on the menu, iPhoto displays the
standard Open dialog. From there, you can choose your favorite image
files for import.
✦Drag-and-drop: Drag files from the Finder and drop them in the iPhoto
window. iPhoto instantly adds them to the Photo Library.
If you drag a folder of images into iPhoto, it creates a film roll — a famil-
iar method of organizing things, of course — with the folder name as the
roll name. Within that roll are all of your images.
iPhoto recognizes a variety of popular graphics formats, so none of your
image files will feel left out. You can add images with the following formats:
✦JPEG
✦GIF
✦PICT
✦TIFF
Note that the iPhoto Import function also works with removable hard
drives, external CD/DVD drives, and USB Flash drives. If you can move to a
location in the Open dialog, you can import from it. (Downright versatile,
don’t you agree?)
Organizing with Photo Albums
After you build up your Photo Library by importing photographs with your
camera, your hard drive, and other storage media, you might become over-
whelmed with the volume of images at your disposal. The easiest way to
organize your images for quick access is to use the iPhoto Photo Album
feature.

Organizing with Photo Albums
312
Creating a new Photo Album
To create a new Photo Album, do one of the following:
✦Choose File➪New Photo Album.
or
✦Click the + button at the bottom of the Photo Album List.
Either method brings up the New Album dialog, as shown in Figure 3-3. Type
the name for your new photo album and click OK.
Note that you can rename your Photo Album anything you like. Just click in
the Album field — under the Album List, if you haven’t noticed it yet — and
edit the name.
Adding photos to a Photo Album
After you have your newly created, empty Photo Album in place, add some
photographs to it. Click the Photo Library icon in the Album List (refer to
Figure 3-3) to view all the images in your collection. Drag any photograph
that you want from the Photo Library to your new album in the Photo
Album List; iPhoto instantly adds it to the album, without a single drop 
of glue.
Figure 3-3:

Book III
Chapter 3
Focusing on 
iPhoto
Organizing with Photo Albums
313
“Hey, Mark, isn’t this going to use more of my precious hard drive terri-
tory?” Don’t worry — you’re not making copies of the photograph: iPhoto
simply creates a reference to the image in the Photo Library and adds it to
your Photo Album.
To view the photographs that you’ve added to a Photo Album, click that
album’s icon in the Photo Album List. The images instantly appear in the
Viewer.
Note the size-changing slider at the lower right corner of the Viewer — you
can use it to enlarge or reduce the size of the thumbnail images in the
Viewer. (Gee, those good folks in Cupertino think of everything!)
Removing photos from a Photo Album
If you suddenly discover that your boyfriend or girlfriend is now an ex-
boyfriend or ex-girlfriend, you’ll probably want some way to remove those
unwanted photographs from your Photo Album. (Or maybe your relation-
ship is still rock-solid, but you just want to change the location of a photo
from one Photo Album to another.) Whatever the case, iPhoto makes it a
cinch to remove photographs from a Photo Album. Follow these steps:
1. Select the Photo Album from the Photo Album list.
2. In the Viewer, select the photo that you want to remove from the
Photo Album.
3. Press Delete.
Keep in mind that removing a file from a Photo Album doesn’t remove it
from the Photo Library. (Remember that the Photo Album is just an assort-
ment of links to your photos.) To really remove that image of your “ex,” you
need to navigate to the Photo Library and delete the picture there, too.
Deleting a Photo Album
It’s just as easy to remove a Photo Album (and every image that it contains)
from your collection as it is to remove photos from that Photo Album. To
delete an entire Photo Album, here’s the overly complex, terribly involved
process:
1. Select the Photo Album in the Photo Album list.
2. Press Delete.
Told you it was easy!

The Art of Organizing with Keywords
314
If you mistakenly delete a Photo Album, you can immediately use iPhoto’s
Undo feature — press Ô+Z, and your last action is reversed. However, if
you’ve already gone too far and you can’t use Undo to restore an album, you
can always re-create it manually because the images within that Photo
Album still reside in the Photo Library. Simply create the empty Photo
Album again (as I demonstrate earlier), open the Photo Library folder in the
Finder, and drag the files into the album again.
The Art of Organizing with Keywords
Using Photo Albums is a great way to organize your photo collection, but it’s
just the start of what iPhoto can do: You can also assign keywords to images
to help you organize your collection. Keywords give you the opportunity to
quickly search through your photos later. You can use iPhoto’s standard
keywords or create your own. For example, you could organize your photos
according to important family events. Birthday photos would get one key-
word; graduation photos would get another. Later you can search for that
birthday shot where the cake caught on fire or the graduation where the
valedictorian fainted. When you use keywords, they’re just a few keystrokes
away. Remember this Mark’s Maxim:
Using keywords to organize your photos takes time, but it’s worth it.
To begin using the keyword feature, select one or more photos in the
Viewer. Then display the Keywords dialog by choosing Edit➪Keywords —
or, for those who prefer fingers, press Ô+K. iPhoto displays the Keywords/
Search dialog, as shown in Figure 3-4.
Figure 3-4:
Hey,
Archibald,
check 
out the
keywords!

Book III
Chapter 3
Focusing on 
iPhoto
The Art of Organizing with Keywords
315
Click the keyword that you want to attach to the selected images and then
click Assign. Straightforward, just like I like it.
iPhoto comes stocked with a handful of useful preset keywords:
✦Favorite
✦Family
✦Kids
✦Vacation
✦Birthday
The Checkmark keyword causes a small checkmark-in-a-circle icon to appear
in the bottom right-hand corner of any image that gets that assignment. For
example, you might temporarily mark your favorite photographs with the
Checkmark keyword. Then it’s a cinch to retrieve just your favorites by
searching for the Checkmark keyword.
You can also display the keywords assigned to each photo in the Viewer.
(Check out Figure 3-4 to see what this looks like.) Choose View➪Keywords
to toggle the display of Keywords on and off.
Customizing your own keywords
Besides the keywords that are included in iPhoto by default, you can create
a number of custom keywords . . . after all, not everything fits in Family or
Birthday. To create your own keywords, follow these steps:
1. Press Ô+K to display the Keywords/Search dialog.
2. Select New from the drop-down list box at the top of the dialog.
3. Type your own custom keyword name into the edit box that appears
(Figure 3-5).
Note that you can also rename existing keywords (by choosing Rename
from the drop-down list), but keep in mind that they will affect all
images that already use that keyword. You can also delete a keyword:
Select it in the list, click the Keywords drop-down list, and then click
Delete from the list.

The Art of Organizing with Keywords
316
Searching for keywords
As I mention earlier, the more keywords that you assign, the easier it is to
use iPhoto. As your photo collection grows, it can become unmanageable —
to help you out, iPhoto lets you search for photos by using the keywords
that you assigned to the images. To search for images using keywords, do
the following:
1. Press Ô+K to display the Keywords/Search dialog.
2. Hold down the Command key and click as many keywords as you
would like to search by.
3. Click the Search button.
The Viewer displays only the photos that have all the keywords that
you request. Figure 3-6 shows the keyword of Automobiles selected as
well as the results from my album. However, if I had searched for
Automobiles and Airplane, nothing would show because I don’t have a
single photo in my album that carries both the keywords Automobiles
and Airplane.
Use the Search tool as a quick and easy way to build a Photo Album. To
create a Photo Album of pictures of your wedding, for example, you could
search for the keyword Wedding (assuming you assigned that keyword to
your wedding pictures) and then drag the results of the search to a Photo
Album in the Album List. Convenient and sassy to boot!

Look, Ma,

To search for a specific string of text within photo filenames or titles, click
in the Search box and type the text. No need to press Return because iPhoto
narrows the search while you type!
Taking Care of Business: Basic Editing
Okay, let’s face it: Sometimes mere mortals like you and I don’t take the
greatest photographs. For those times, iPhoto provides a helping hand with
several important editing features — you can save your dark photos from
the Trash and improve “keepers” into honest-to-goodness art.
To begin editing your photographs, select the photo that you want to edit
and click the Edit button in the iPhoto Toolbar — this displays the Edit
panel of the Toolbar, as shown in Figure 3-7. (And yes, that’s my close per-
sonal friend James Brown . . . he likes my soulful ’64 Cadillac.)
The editing tools include
✦Crop: This lets you trim off any unwanted edges of the photo and focus
on the photo’s subject.
✦Enhance: This is a one-click solution that automatically adjusts the
color and contrast of the image.

✦Red-Eye: No more vampires! Remove the evil-looking red-eye phenome-
non from your photos.
✦Retouch: Remove minor imperfections in photographs by blending
them into the surrounding area.
✦B & W (black and white): For that vintage look, you can also convert
color pictures to black and white.
✦Brightness/Contrast: These controls allow you to fix photos that are too
dark, too light, or washed-out.
✦Navigation arrows: Click these to advance to the previous or next
image.
Constrain and crop
Sometimes your photos have additional clutter around the edges. To get rid
of this problem with traditional photographs, you’d resort to a pair of scis-
sors to cut off the unwanted portion of the image. Professional photogra-
phers call this cropping. Digital image-editing software packages (including
iPhoto) have borrowed this term. The Crop feature of iPhoto gives you the
ability to remove unwanted stuff from around the edges of your otherwise
perfect photographs, like the strange guy who blundered into the corner of
your perfect Grand Canyon composition.

Edit button

To crop a photo, you must first select what portion of the image that you
want to keep by clicking and dragging on the image in the Viewer. As you
drag, a rectangle appears indicating what part of the image you want to
keep, as shown in Figure 3-8. Everything outside of this rectangle will disap-
pear after a crop operation.
After you select the portion that you want to remain, click the Crop button
in the Edit panel to remove the rest. If you would like to constrain your
selection to a specific size, select that size from the Constrain pop-up menu
to the left of the Crop button. This lets you resize a photograph according to
a preset size. (For example, certain aspect ratios are better for certain
media — a 4 x 3 ratio looks best in an iDVD project or a bound book,
whereas a 4 x 6 is perfectly proportioned for printing a postcard.)
“Hey, I didn’t want that to happen!” (Yep, time to mention Undo again.) You
can always remove any editing change you’ve just made to an image; just
press Ô+Z or choose Edit➪Undo. iPhoto offers a multiple Undo function, so
you can press Ô+Z multiple times to backtrack through your changes.

Enhance
Things can’t get much easier than this — if the colors in your image look
drab, you can click the Enhance button to automatically increase (or
decrease) the color saturation and automatically improve the contrast
within the photo. (Note that this is different from the manual contrast con-
trol that I discuss later.) Everything’s done for you, so there are no settings
to change. To compare the even fresher-smelling photo with the earlier ver-
sion, press the Control key, and you’ll see the un-enhanced image. When you
release the Control key, the enhancement is applied again, so you can com-
pare the results.
You can click Enhance more than once to continue improving the image, but
sooner or later, iPhoto can make no additional adjustments.
The Enhance button only works when no part of an image has been selected
with the rectangle (that way, the controls will affect the entire image). If you
need to deselect a portion of the photo, just click anywhere in the image
outside the selected area, and the selection rectangle disappears like beer at
a football game.
Retouch
Do you suffer from spots or specks in an otherwise-perfect image? Click the
Retouch button and the cursor turns into a crosshair; click and drag the
cursor across the imperfection in short movements to remove it. Again, you
can hold down and release the Control key to compare the retouched ver-
sion of the image with the fixed photo.
Naturally, Retouch won’t add detail to an image, so it won’t add highlights to
your girlfriend’s hair or fix the dented fender on your Harley — instead, it’s
best used to clean up specks within a solid band of color, like a photo of a
sunset. I find Retouch especially handy with pictures that I’ve scanned from
slides and existing photographs.
Brightness/Contrast
Shooting photographs that look perfect is a tough task, and sometimes
things don’t work out the way that you plan. If your images turn out too
dark or light, iPhoto can help you clean up after the fact. To adjust the
brightness and contrast of an image, simply move the Brightness/Contrast
sliders until the image looks the way that you want.
Like Enhance, the Brightness and Contrast sliders only work when nothing’s
been selected.

Red-eye removal
Have you ever picked up your photographs from the local photo developer
only to discover that the subjects in your photographs all look like rather
unsettling red-eyed zombies? Red-eye is a phenomenon that occurs when
the camera captures light reflecting off the retinas of eyeballs. This problem
isn’t limited only to human eyes, either. Even Spot, your loving canine pal,
can have that “Demon Doggy” possessed look! To help exorcise these red-
eye problems from your photographs, iPhoto gives you a Red-Eye filter.
To remove red-eye problem in your photographs, select the eyeball in ques-
tion by clicking and dragging around the eyeball in the Viewer. Then click
the Red-Eye button in the Edit panel. Your red-eye problem disappears in an
instant.
Unlike Brightness and Contrast, the Red-Eye function only works when an
image has a selection. (But hey, you can select anything red in a photo and
apply the red eye filter . . . the results can be mind-blowing!)
Black and white
In the old days, photographers had to cart around two rolls of film if they
wanted to shoot in color and black-and-white. These days, you can simply
shoot in color because iPhoto can do the black-and-white conversion for
you. It’s really simple, too! Just click the B & W button to convert an image
from color to shades of gray.
If you change your mind and want to revert to a color image, choose
Edit➪Undo to see colors again. For an interesting artistic effect, you can
select just a portion of a photo with the Crop tool and click the B & W
button to turn just the selected area to black and white.
Don’t forget to rotate!
Although it’s not technically an Edit mode feature, rotation is a sort of edit,
so I discuss it here. This feature is useful for viewing those images where
you held the camera sideways to fit that tall building into the viewfinder.
To rotate an image, simply click the Rotate button at the left-hand side of
the Toolbar, as shown in Figure 3-9. The default rotation is in a counter-
clockwise direction. Hold the Option key while you click the rotate button
to rotate in a clockwise direction.

Producing Your Own Coffee-Table Masterpiece
Computerized photo albums are fun and all, but sometimes people long for
the real photo albums of the past. They like to turn pages, put it on the
shelf, and view it without a computer screen. For those folks, iPhoto offers a
way to create and print your own professional-quality photo album. Use
iPhoto to create a Photo Album (the digital kind), tweak its formatting until
you’re satisfied, and then transmit your finished product via the Internet to
a vendor who will print, bind, and send you a copy of your finished album,
for a small fee, of course. Here’s how:
1. Create a new Photo Album in iPhoto by choosing New➪Photo Album
or clicking the + button at the left edge of the Toolbar.
The name of the album is editable, so you can name it to your liking.
2. Click the Photo Library icon at the left side of the iPhoto interface
and drag your favorite photos into the new Photo Album.
These images will appear in your bound photo album.
When preparing a photo album that will be printed on paper, use the
highest quality images available. It takes higher-resolution images to
look good on paper (as compared with your Mac’s monitor).
3. After you complete the preparation of your Photo Album in iPhoto,
select that Photo Album in the Photo Album List by clicking it.

The Photo Album List appears on the left side of the iPhoto interface.
4. Click the Book button in the Toolbar, as shown in Figure 3-10.
In Book mode, the Viewer changes in subtle ways. It displays the cur-
rent image at the top of its display and adds a scrolling row of thumb-
nail images below it, as shown in Figure 3-10. This row of images
represents the current order of the various pages in your book. Clicking
any of these thumbnails causes the Viewer to load that image into its
display area.
5. Rearrange the page order to suit you by dragging the thumbnail of
that page from one location to another in the row.
6. In the Book panel below the Toolbar, you can adjust a variety of set-
tings for the final book, including the book’s theme, page numbers,
and comments.
7. Make sure that the Show Guides check box is enabled in the Book
panel.
Besides photos, you can also add text to the pages of your photo album.
(Nothing on the order of Stephen King or Tom Clancy — more like cap-
tions with short descriptions.) Selecting Show Guides draws faint blue
boxes in the Viewer that show where you can add text.
8. Click any one of the Guide boxes and begin typing to add text to that
page.

iPhoto displays the book, allowing you to scan through the pages of
your creation to make sure that it looks exactly as you wish. When
you’re satisfied with the results of the photo book, it’s time to publish it.
10. Click the Order Book button.
In a series of dialogs that appear, iPhoto guides you through the final
steps to order a bound hardback book. (Don’t forget your credit card.)
A fast connection to the Internet like cable or DSL is very handy for this
process. The images that you must submit are too large for a slow
dialup connection.
Remember, you can also save that book as a PDF file and print it later
(either on your own inkjet printer, or a nicer one at the copy shop down
the lane)!
Sharing Photos with Friends and Family
Besides creating a photo book, iPhoto offers many other ways for you to
share your photos. Click the Organize button in the Toolbar to see the possi-
bilities, shown in Figure 3-11.

Here are the different ways that you can share your photos with iPhoto:
✦Print: Don’t forget about your computer’s printer — it’s mundane,
I know, but you can print photographs from iPhoto with your inkjet or
laser printer.
✦SlideShow: Display a slide show presentation of your photos in iPhoto,
complete with background music.
✦Email: Send photos to your friends via e-mail. You’ll need an active
Internet connection. (Go figure, indeed.). iPhoto will launch your default
e-mail client when you’re ready to send your photographs.
✦Order Prints: Order photographic quality prints of your favorite
images. Kodak prints the photographs for you and will ship them wher-
ever you want them to go.
✦Order Book: Allows you to order a bound book, as I demonstrate in the
previous section.
✦HomePage: Publish your photos on your Web site.
✦.Mac Slides: Publish your photos as a slide show on your iDisk, where
others with .Mac accounts can view it.
✦Desktop: Change your Desktop picture to one of your iPhoto images.
✦Burn: Leads you through the process of recording your images on a
blank CD or DVD.
Before I leave iPhoto 2, I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention a comprehensive
guide that goes into more detail than this chapter: iPhoto 2 For Dummies,

lfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, George Lucas, and Ridley Scott —
those guys are amateurs! Welcome to the exciting world of movie
making on your Mac, where you call the shots. With iMovie, you can try your
hand at all aspects of the movie-creating process, including editing and spe-
cial effects. Built with ease-of-use in mind, iMovie lets you perform full-
blown movie production on your Macintosh with a minimum of effort.
Don’t let iMovie’s fancy buttons and flashing lights fool you: This application
is a feature-packed tool for serious movie production. The iMovie controls
work the same as many top-notch, movie-editing tools that professionals
use. From basic editing to audio and video effects, iMovie has everything
that you need to get started creating high-quality movies.
The iMovie Interface
To launch iMovie, either navigate to the Application folder and double-click
the iMovie icon or click the iMovie icon that’s hanging out in the Dock.
When you first launch iMovie, perhaps the first thing that you’ll notice is
that the window fills most of the screen, even when it’s resized as small as
possible (as shown in Figure 4-1). In fact, you can’t run iMovie 3 at resolu-
tions less than 1024 x 768.

The iMovie Interface
328
This seemingly rude behavior is actually a requirement. If you think about it,
creating and editing a movie requires a lot of elbow room (both on your
monitor and on your hard drive). To hide the iMovie window, press either
Ô+H or Ô+Tab to switch to other applications that are running. (You can
also use the Exposé key, F9.)
You’ll notice that the interface consists of three main parts:
✦Monitor: The Monitor is the big, black, square viewer where you watch
movies.
✦Tool palettes: The iMovie Tool palettes appear on the right side of the
iMovie interface. They offer one-click access to an array of movie-
building tools.
Just above the Tool palettes is the Clips pane. The contents of the Clips
pane vary, depending on which of the Tool palette buttons you’ve
selected. Clicking the Clips button displays the Clips pane, for example,
which is where iMovie stores your movie clips for use in full-length
movies that you create. Clicking the Audio button whisks you to a pane
with audio files in it. iMovie stores your audio clips here, which you can

also use in any movie that you create. A click on Photos allows you to
add still images from your iPhoto library (as demonstrated by the versa-
tile Figure 4-1). The Transitions, Titles, and Effects tools let you twist,
turn, and label your movies like the pros do. Finally, the iDVD button
displays the Chapter List, which I discuss in Book III, Chapter 7 — it’s
used with iDVD 3, where you can build a DVD movie with your finished
masterpiece.
✦Viewers: The viewers are where you compose your movie masterpiece.
There are two main tabs here: the Clips viewer and the Timeline viewer.
I cover these in more detail later.
The Powers of Three
The minimalist approach of iMovie provides power with simplicity (some-
thing that the average Joe can appreciate). Instead of the nested windows
and cryptic film jargon of traditional movie-editing packages — which also,
by the way, tend to cost hundreds or thousands of dollars a pop — iMovie
reduces the clutter to three elements. Use this trio of tools, and you’ll be on
your way to movie-making bliss.
Monitor
The Monitor is the largest of all the interface elements in iMovie — it func-
tions just like the video monitor and control deck that a traditional film
editor uses. You can think of it as iMovie’s screen, where you view clips and
preview your movie while you edit it. (Check it out in Figure 4-2.) When you
launch iMovie for the first time, the Monitor appears black, indicating that
you haven’t created a movie yet. (Apple is, if anything, eminently sensible.)
On subsequent launches of iMovie, it displays the most recent movie project.
Nestled directly beneath the iMovie Monitor are the playback controls (see
Figure 4-2). Resembling buttons on a conventional CD player, the iMovie
playback controls let you play, stop, and return to the beginning of movies
that display in the Monitor.
In addition to the buttons that control playback, the Monitor sports other
important controls. The scrubber bar contains the playback head, which
tells you visually where you are in the movie. The playback head is a blue tri-
angle positioned directly below the Monitor. While your movie plays, the
playback head moves to indicate the current location of playback. The play-
back head isn’t just a visual indicator, though: It also has an important func-
tion. You can also click and drag the playback head to move forward or back
in the current movie.

The Powers of Three
330
All the remaining Monitor button controls affect the playback head’s posi-
tion with one click. Table 4-1 lists the various playback controls and how
they affect the playback head’s position.

✦DV Camera/Edit Mode switch: Toggles between video from your
camera and the movie that you’re editing with iMovie
The DV Camera/Edit Mode switch affects how you import video from a
camera. Read more about this in the upcoming section “Working with Clips
(Not the Paper Kind).”
Palettes
The palettes occupy the rightmost portion of the iMovie interface and offer
a complete set of tools for creating movies. Divided into seven sections, the
palettes house the building blocks that you need to construct your cine-
matic masterpiece as well as your connection to iDVD. (Refer to Figure 4-1.)
Throughout the creation process, you’ll use the tools located in the palettes
to build the content of your movie. Table 4-2 describes the role that each
palette plays in the movie-making process.

Viewers
The final stops on the iMovie interface tour are the viewers — located at the
bottom of the screen, your trusty viewers are the heart of editing operations
in iMovie, where you add audio and video clips to construct the perfect
movie. As shown in Figure 4-3, they offer a visual representation of the order
in which the various clips appear in a movie.

The Movie-Making Process
332
As you can see in Figure 4-3, the viewer interface has two modes:
✦Clip viewer: Displays the sequence of video clips in a movie — this is
the mode shown in Figure 4-3.
✦Timeline viewer: Displays the duration and juxtaposition of the various
audio and video clips in a movie. (I think it’s safe to say that’s the only
appearance of the word juxtaposition in this particular tome.)
The Movie-Making Process
After you’re on friendly terms with the three main sections of the iMovie
window, follow this simple six-step process to create professional looking
movies in minutes. I go into more detail about each of these steps in the
following sections.

1. Import and edit your movie footage.
The first step in creating a movie is to import movie clips into iMovie
either from your digital video camcorder or from video clips already
on your hard drive. You will use these clips to construct a full-length
movie.
2. Add clips from the Clips pane to the Timeline.
After you prepare your movie clips, you can add them to the movie. 
By using drag-and-drop, it takes only a few seconds to add the movie
segments found in the Clips pane to your full-length movie.
3. Apply transitions, effects, photos, and text to the movie.
With your movie clips in place, it’s a snap to enhance them with visual
effects and transitions. You might also want to spice up the movie with
titles and credits.
4. Import or record audio clips.
Great movies look even better when accompanied by great audio. You
can import audio into iMovie from MP3 files, audio CDs, your iTunes
Playlists, or even what you’ve recorded yourself with a microphone.
5. Add audio from the Audio pane to the Timeline.
Drag audio clips from the Audio pane to the Timeline to arrange your
movie’s soundtrack. (And yes, you documentary fans will find it easy to
add narration.)
6. Preview, build, and burn the final product.
After you build the next Gone with the Windows — sorry, couldn’t help
that one — iMovie makes it a snap to preview your creation. Then it’s
just a few clicks before your project becomes a movie. iMovie helps you
distribute your completed movie as well: You can burn it to a CD-ROM,
import it into iDVD for use on a movie DVD, or export it into QuickTime
for online distribution.
The remainder of this chapter guides you through the details of these steps.
Before you know it, you’ll be showing that upstart Spielberg a thing or two
without setting foot out of your home.
Working with Clips (Not the Paper Kind)
The first step for creating a movie is to add video clips to the Clips pane.
These clips usually form the bulk of the video that you use in the completed
movie. iMovie is flexible in that it permits you to import video clips from
more than one source:

Working with Clips (Not the Paper Kind)
334
✦Import from a digital video camcorder: Connect a DV camcorder to
your Macintosh to transfer video.
✦Import from files: Import any DV clip directly from your hard drive.
If your favorite movie clip isn’t in DV Stream format, you can export it
from QuickTime Pro. Then import it into iMovie. See Book III, Chapter 6
for more on QuickTime Pro.
After you import your video, you can perform a variety of editing functions
on the clip: You can edit clips together to tell a story; edit out mistakes or
bad footage; apply audio, transitions, and effects; and even add titles, for
that cinematic touch.
Adding clips from media files
iMovie allows you to import many different kinds of media files. From graph-
ics to video to audio files, iMovie has you covered. Table 4-3 lists the most
common file formats that iMovie can import into your project.
Table 4-3
File Types That iMovie Understands
File Type
What It’s Used For
AIFF
Audio from an audio CD
MP3
Compressed audio
JPEG
Standard for still images from the Web, scanners, or a digital 
camera
GIF
Standard for still images from the Web, scanners, or a digital 
camera
PSD
Images from Photoshop
DV
Video
The file type dictates what happens when you import that file. For example,
when you import an image or video file, the file goes directly into the Clips
pane. In contrast, importing an audio file automatically places it in the
movie at the audio pointer’s current location. To import an audio or video
file, choose File➪Import. Select a file to import in the Open dialog and click
OK. The imported file appears in the Clips pane or the Audio pane, depend-
ing on the file type.
Still images can also be parked on the Clips pane — a holdover from earlier
versions of iPhoto, where pictures were handled like static video clips.
Therefore, photographs can actually be added to your movie from either the
Clips pane (for imported photos) or the Photos pane (for pictures from your
iPhoto collection).

Adding clips from your camcorder
Adding clips from your DV camcorder is just as simple as playing a movie.
To retrieve video from your camcorder, do the following:
1. With a FireWire cable, connect a FireWire-compatible camera to your
Macintosh and set it to VTR (or Playback) mode.
If your camera is not FireWire compatible, you should be able to buy an
adapter. Setting your camera to VTR mode allows remote control of the
camcorder by iMovie. If you’re not sure how to set VTR mode on your
camera, consult its manual.
2. In iMovie, slide the DV Camera/Edit Mode switch to the Camera posi-
tion, which is labeled with a miniature camcorder icon (refer to
Figure 4-2).
This initiates the camera capture mode. When you set this mode, an
Import button appears above the Play button.
Who needs a camcorder?
If you’re a serious couch potato — one of those
folks who are permanently affixed to their living
room furniture, constantly awaiting this TV
show or that one — rejoice! Hardware devices
are on the market that can capture your favorite
programs as digital video, providing you with yet
another source of iMovie video clips. (The
signal can come from a cable-ready TV or from
a standard analog video source like a VCR.)
After you create a video clip by using one of
these video capture devices, you can then
import the clip into iMovie.
For example, the EyeTV unit from Elgato
Software is practically a complete solution for
digitizing analog video: It comes with a built-in,
cable-ready TV tuner and a hardware MPEG
encoder (the hardware that can create a DV
stream from analog video). For around $200,
EyeTV can provide the somewhat mundane
convenience of watching TV on your Mac’s
monitor, along with the ability to “pause” a live
TV show . . . but for me, the real treat is creating
digital video from all those old VHS family
reunion videos that are currently collecting dust
in your closet. EyeTV is a Universal Serial Bus
(USB) device, so it works with just about any
Mac that can run Mac OS X. Each hour of video
takes up about 650MB of hard drive space, so a
high-capacity 200GB FireWire hard drive sud-
denly looks most attractive indeed.
For the complete details on EyeTV, visit the
Elgato Software Web site at www.elgato.
com. And don’t forget to honor the copyrights
on the material you capture from TV broad-
casts, commercial video tapes and DVDs —
consult a lawyer if you plan on distributing any
movies that include copyrighted material.

3. Find the video.
Click the Monitor’s playback buttons to locate the video on your cam-
corder that you wish to import, fast-forwarding or rewinding until you
find the correct footage, watching your progress in the Monitor. When
you find the video, stop the playback and position the playback head a
few seconds prior to the place where the desired video begins. When
you’re ready, click the Play button again.
4. When the video that you want to capture appears in the Monitor,
click the Import button, as shown in Figure 4-4, to begin transferring
that video from the camcorder to your Macintosh.
5. Stop the video.
Click the Import button again to stop the video transfer.
Imported video from a camcorder transfer appears in the Clips pane.
Click the Import button.

Editing video clips
iMovie gives you several different ways to edit your video clips. You can
copy, trim, and crop your video clips to your heart’s content; and if you
mess up along the way, an instant fix is but a click away.
Copying video clips
Sometimes you’ll want to work on multiple copies of the same video clip.
This gives you the ability to try out different edits on the same piece of
footage without altering the original. To duplicate a video clip, do the 
following:
1. Select a clip in the Clips pane.
The selected clip turns blue.
2. Press Ô+C or choose Edit➪Copy.
3. Press Ô+V or choose Edit➪Paste.
A new copy of the video clip appears in the Clips pane.
Of course, you can also follow the Macintosh convention of Option-dragging
a clip from its cell on the pane to an empty cell or to the Timeline. Doing so
makes a copy wherever you release the mouse.
Cropping, splitting, and trimming video clips
Cropping, splitting, and trimming are three important editing functions that
iMovie affords you. Here’s the skinny on these functions:
✦Crop: Deletes everything from the clip except a selected region
✦Split: Breaks a single clip into multiple clips
✦Trim: Deletes a selected region from the clip
To perform any of these functions, you must first select a region of a clip.
Choose a clip in the Clips pane. This causes the clip to appear in the
Monitor. Position the playback head at the beginning of the region that you
wish to select. Then Shift+click anywhere on the scrubber bar to the right of
the starting point. (iMovie places markers at the edges of the selection, and
you can further adjust the selection by dragging them.) A region turns
yellow when you select it. After you select a region, perform the editing
operation.

Basic Composition the iMovie Way
338
✦Crop: Choose Edit➪Crop. Everything but the selected region disappears.
✦Split: Choose Edit➪Split Video Clip at Playhead. The clip instantly splits
into two clips.
✦Trim: Choose Edit➪Clear. The selected region disappears. (If you have a
section of video selected in the middle of a larger clip, two clips will
remain: one with the video before the selection, and one with the video
after the selection.)
Naming video clips
As your movie project grows, you’ll want to take care to label your clips.
This helps to remind you when you return to the project later. It’s also a
godsend when you begin working on multiple copies of the same clip.
Otherwise, you have no easy way to differentiate two identical clips because
they appear the same in the Clips pane.
To edit the name of a clip, click the text of the clip name near the clip’s
bottom edge. When the text appears in a text edit box, type a new name 
for the clip — and then press Return to brand the clip with the new name,
pardner. (You can also change the clip name from the Get Info dialog.)
Basic Composition the iMovie Way
After you import and edit some video clips, it’s finally time to begin creating
a movie. Adding video to your movie is a simple drag-and-drop operation.
Adding clips to a movie
Before you add clips to your movie, select the desired viewer tab. The Clip
viewer displays clips in sequential order, with each clip occupying the same
amount of space in the Timeline. The Timeline viewer displays clips with
lengths that are relative to their duration. For example, a 30-second clip will
appear as half the length of a 60-second clip when you view clips in the
Timeline viewer. See Figure 4-5.
To add a clip to your movie, drag it from the Clips pane to the desired loca-
tion in the Timeline. Constructing a movie is just a matter of repeating this
step with the various clips that you want to add to your movie.

Book III

Transitions for the Masses
339
Removing clips from a movie
Eventually you’ll add a clip that you soon decide doesn’t belong in your
movie; to delete a clip from a movie, select the clip in the Timeline and
press Delete. The clip disappears, and any clips that follow the deleted
selection slide to the left to fill the void.
iMovie has its own Trash, which appears at the bottom of the application
window — you can drag unwanted items from the pane or from the viewers
and drop them on top of this icon to delete them. You can empty the iMovie
Trash at any time by choosing File➪Empty Trash.
If you mistakenly remove a clip that you intended on keeping, press Ô+Z or
choose Edit➪Undo to cancel the delete operation.
Rearranging clips in a movie
If you decide at some point that certain clips are in the wrong order, it’s a
cinch to change. Simply drag a clip in the Clip viewer. Release the mouse
when the clip reaches the desired destination; clips in the Timeline will
move apart to make room for the nomadic clip.
Transitions for the Masses
Stringing together a bunch of video clips to make a movie is cool stuff, but
that’s only a small fraction of what iMovie can do. Beyond simple editing,
iMovie offers a set of video transitions for you to use in your movies.
Clips in the Clip Viewer

Figure 4-5:

Transitions for the Masses
340
Transitions are video effects that perform their magic at the point where two
clips connect. They help smooth out the joint between the two clips. If
you’re a television viewer, you see transitions all the time — any time that
the screen fades to or from black, you’re seeing a transition in action.
(Remember the cool swirling bat from the old Batman TV series?)
iMovie gives you a small group of transitions from which to choose. These
can be displayed by selecting the Trans button in the Tool palette, as shown
in Figure 4-6. 
Clicking on any one of the transitions in the Transitions pane causes a brief
preview of the effect to automatically play in the preview window at the top
of the pane. You can vary the duration of the transition with the Speed
slider. The list of available transitions provided free with iMovie is short,
but it covers most of the basic movie needs:
✦Circle Closing: Video shrinks with a circular viewport (like a lens 
shutter) to the next clip.
✦Circle Opening: Video expands with a circular viewport to the next clip.
✦Cross Dissolve: Video dissolves from one clip to the next.
✦Fade In: Video fades in from black.
Click the Trans button.

✦Fade Out: Video fades out to black.
✦Overlap: Video fades from one clip to another.
✦Push: Video slides to an edge of the screen over time. Select which edge
by clicking the directional arrows that appear when you select the Push
transition.
✦Radial: Video wipes in a circular motion around the center, like a radar
screen.
✦Scale Down: Video shrinks over time to reveal a clip behind it.
✦Warp Out: Video wipes from the center outward to the next clip.
✦Wash In: Video fades in from white.
✦Wash Out: Video fades out to white.
For those who just can’t get enough, Apple offers a number of additional
transitions, effects, and audio clips for free at www.apple.com/imovie. You
can also purchase many transitions and special effects as add-on packages
from third-party developers.
To add a transition to your movie, drag the desired transition from the
Transitions pane to the Timeline. A transition merges two clips together, so
you’ll want to drop the transition in an appropriate location — in between
two clips. If you change any settings of a transition, make sure to click the
Update button. It refreshes the preview of that transition in your movie.
Transitions are a wonderfully subtle way to improve the look of your movie.
Use them judiciously to emulate professional movie and television editing.
(Too many transitions within a movie can distract your audience from your
message — unless, of course, you’re filming an episode of Laugh-In 2004.) To
give you a feel for how the pros do it, pay attention when you watch televi-
sion or movies and focus on the transitions. Sometimes the simplest transi-
tion can have a dramatic effect on a movie.
Even Gone with the Wind Had Titles
Besides transitions, professional movies and videos have text, and lots of it;
from the title at the beginning of a movie to the litany of names that scroll by
in the credits after the movie, movie editing clearly demands sophisticated
text-editing abilities. With over a dozen title styles to choose from, iMovie
can handle most text tasks that you throw at it.
The Titles pane is where you can find the text features of iMovie. Figure 4-7
shows you the basic layout of the Titles pane.

Even Gone with the Wind Had Titles
342
The Titles pane changes to accommodate different amounts of text depend-
ing on which title style you choose. Otherwise, the controls for the title
styles are identical for each effect. Table 4-4 lists the settings and functions
that are common to all title styles.

To begin working with Titles, select a text style from the pane. At the bottom
of the Titles pane, you can change the text for any title style, as shown in
Figure 4-7. When you alter the text of the style and any of its parameters, the
miniature preview at the top of the Titles pane updates to reflect the
changes. After you successfully adapt the text style to match your needs,
you can add it to a movie by dragging the title style from the list to the
Timeline (see Figure 4-8). When you do, the title appears in the Timeline as a
movie segment.
Like deleting a movie clip, removing a title from your movie requires a click
of the mouse and one key press. Click the title in the Timeline to select it
and then press Delete to remove it from the movie. Should you delete a title
accidentally, press Ô+Z to undo the operation.
What Good Is a Movie without Special Effects?
Although iMovie can produce some nice transitions and titles, it doesn’t
stop there. It also comes stocked with a handful of cool video effects for you
to use in your movies.

Adding Effects to a movie
To work with Effects in your movies, follow these five easy steps:
1. In the Timeline, click a movie clip.
The clip changes to a yellow color to indicate that you selected it 
successfully.
2. Open the Effects pane by clicking the Effects button in the Tool
palette and then select an effect.
In the Effects pane, choose an effect from the list of available effects by
clicking the effect’s name.
3. Adjust the effect.
From the effect’s controls, tweak its settings to suit your needs. The
Effect In and Effect Out sliders let you phase in an effect a certain
amount of time from the beginning of the clip and then phase it out
before it ends. While you adjust the effect’s parameters, the results
appear in the miniature preview window at the top of the Effects pane.
4. Preview the effect at full size.
After you choose and adjust the effect to your liking, you might want to
see what it will look like in action. Click the Preview button to see a pre-
view of the effect in the Monitor.
5. Apply the effect.
If you’re happy with the results of the effects preview, it’s easy to perma-
nently add it to the movie clip by clicking the Apply button.

Hey, There’s a Photo in My Video!
346
When you apply an effect to a movie clip, iMovie begins building the movie
effect — the faster your Mac is and the more memory you have, the faster
the effect is finished. To track the progress of an effect being built, iMovie
displays a small red line in the movie clip found in the Timeline. While the
build progresses, this red line grows until it spans the entire length of the
clip. If you try to preview the clip before it’s built, you’ll still be able to view
it but at a lower quality. This temporary preview permits you to view the
effect while iMovie builds the real effect.
Hey, There’s a Photo in My Video!
Of course, not everything has to move around like Fred Astaire within your
frame — you can use still images to begin your film, add a background, or
slap an old-fashioned Intermission placard right in the middle of your movie!
In fact, iMovie 3 now features a cool panning feature called the Ken Burns
Effect, which is named after the man responsible for all those great docu-
mentaries on public television: The camera slowly pans and zooms across a
static photograph, bringing motion to your images (and suddenly adding
interest to that snapshot of Uncle Milton at the Grand Canyon).
Click the Photos button in the Tool palette to display the Photos pane
shown in Figure 4-10. It operates much like the Clips pane — just click and
drag an image from the pane to the Timeline or Clip viewer. To display other
images from your iPhoto Library (or any of your iPhoto albums), click the
drop-down list box and then click the desired album.

Now for the Ken Burns Effect — man, that really sounds like an avant-garde
jazz group, doesn’t it? Anyway, mark the Ken Burns Effect check box to
enable it. You can set the duration of the pan and the total zoom throughout
the effect. Click the Reverse button to reverse the pan and zoom out
instead.
Unlike the other preview windows in iMovie, you can click and drag the
image in the preview window to set the starting and finishing points for the
Ken Burns Effect.
Working with Sound
In addition to video and graphics, iMovie is adept at working with sound.
With iMovie, you can use your favorite audio files, music CDs, and micro-
phone to create professional-sounding soundtracks. (Sorry, John Williams
is not included.)
Adding sound to a movie
All audio that you add to a movie resides in one of the two audio tracks in
the Timeline. The audio tracks (see Figure 4-11) are visible only in the
Timeline viewer tab.
Figure 4-11:
Audio tracks
contain
music and
sound.

Working with Sound
348
To begin working with audio in iMovie, open the Audio pane by clicking the
Audio button in the Tool palette. Note that the Audio pane is split into the
Audio Library and Voice Recorder sections (which has an input level meter
for your microphone and a record button).
Using the built-in sound effects
To get you started with audio in your movies, iMovie gives you a set of pre-
recorded sound effects, as shown in Figure 4-12. These make great back-
ground noises to enhance your movies. To preview any one of the sounds,
click the drop-down list at the top of the pane, click iMovie Sound Effects,
and then double-click the desired sound.
To add the sound to your movie, drag the sound effect from the Audio pane
and drop it on the Timeline at the bottom of the screen. When you do, the
audio clip appears in one of the audio tracks for the movie. Feel free to
move the sound effect clip anywhere in the track by dragging it, or change
the length of the effect by clicking the arrows at the ends of the clip and
dragging them. This gives you precise control over when the sound plays so
that you can synchronize it with video events.

Adding your own sound effects
If you’d like to add your own sound effects to the Audio pane, you need to
do a little work in the Finder. Drag your favorite AIFF files in the Finder to
your Sound Effects folder (which is located in your home folder under
Library➪iMovie➪Sound Effects).
Restart iMovie to see your new sound effects in the Audio pane. With a
quick drag, you can add the new audio files to your movie.
Recording voice-overs for your movie
Sometimes you might want to narrate a segment of your movie rather than
rely on sound effect files. Fortunately, iMovie gives you the ability to do
just that. By using the Voice Recorder section of the Audio pane (refer to
Figure 4-12), you can record your voice and add it to the audio track of your
movie. What’s more, you can record your voice as you watch the movie
playing in real-time. This allows you to perfectly synchronize any narration
you speak with the video onscreen. (Somebody deserves a raise in
Cupertino!)
To record your voice, perform the following steps:
1. Position the playback head at the place in your movie where you’d
like to begin recording narration.
The playback head tells you where you are in the movie. You can posi-
tion the playback head in either the Monitor or the Timeline viewer.
2. Open the Audio pane by clicking the Audio button.
3. (Optional.) On the Monitor playback controls, click Play.
By clicking Play, you are able to view the video in your movie. By watch-
ing the video while you narrate, you can synchronize your speech to the
video track. This step is optional because you don’t have to play a
movie while recording a narration. Slower Macs might have trouble
playing and recording audio at the same time.
4. Back in the Audio pane, click the Record Voice button to begin
recording.
When you speak, the meter in the Audio pane will help you monitor the
incoming volume level.
5. Click Stop in the Audio pane.
When you complete the recording process, iMovie displays the newly
recorded segment in the Timeline in an orange color. Now you can
manipulate the audio in the Timeline just as you would any other movie
or audio clip. If you aren’t happy with the result, you can always press
Delete to remove the audio clip and return to Step 4.

Importing audio from a CD
Wondering about adding music from an audio CD? No problem! Figure 4-13
shows a number of tracks I can use from a music CD.
To import clips from an audio CD, follow these steps:
1. Insert an audio CD into your Mac’s CD drive.
2. Open the iMovie Audio pane.
3. Click the drop-down list box and click Audio CD.
If your Mac is connected to the Internet, the song titles appear in the
Audio pane. Without the connection, you see generic track titles, such
as Track 01 and Track 02 (check it out in Figure 4-13).
4. Click whichever song you’d like to import into iMovie.
5. Drag it into your Timeline viewer.
When you’re finished importing a song from an audio CD, it appears in the
Timeline in one of the audio tracks.
Removing sound from a movie
To remove an audio clip from your movie, select it in the Timeline and press
Delete. Removing an audio clip does not have any effect on the position of
other audio clips. This ensures that your audio clips stay in sync with exist-
ing video clips.

Completing Your Cinematic Masterpiece
Are you done, Mr. Hitchcock? Congratulations, you’ve made it through the
movie-making process! You’ve shot, composed, and edited your own movie,
but now what? Like any good filmmaker, the goal of creating a movie is to
have people watch it — therefore, iMovie gives you more than one way to
export your movies for viewing.
✦Digital video camcorder: Transfer your completed movie back to the
camcorder and take it with you.
✦QuickTime movies: Millions of Macs and PCs around the world have
QuickTime software. These computers can view iMovie movies, too! The
great part about QuickTime movies is that you can use them in a variety
of applications, from Web pages to PowerPoint presentations.
✦iDVD: iMovie can prepare your movies for use with iDVD — including
chapter markers, which I discuss shortly. The iDVD application lets you
create a DVD. Read more about iDVD in Book III, Chapter 5.
Each type of export has its specific purposes and uses — the medium that
you choose depends on your audience, video quality needs, and desired
format.
Exporting to a camcorder
To export your completed movie to a DV camcorder, choose File➪Export
Movie. In the dialog that appears, choose To Camera in the Export pop-up
menu. iMovie presents you with settings (as shown in Figure 4-14) for
exporting to the camcorder. As the dialog warns you, be sure that your
camera is in VTR mode and has a writeable tape in it.

Exporting to QuickTime
QuickTime is a multimedia engine in use on millions of computers every-
where. Its popularity makes it a natural for many different uses:
✦CD-ROM video
✦Internet delivery
✦High-quality playback from hard drive or removable disk
To export your completed movie to a QuickTime file, choose File➪Export. In
the dialog that appears, choose To QuickTime from the Export pop-up
menu. iMovie presents you with settings for exporting to QuickTime. From
the Formats pop-up from, as shown in Figure 4-15, choose the option that
best fits the intended use of your movie.
Exporting to iDVD
If your movie is destined to be part of an iDVD project, click the iDVD button
(in the Tool palette) to display the iDVD pane that you see in Figure 4-16.
Click the Create iDVD Project button, and iMovie will save your movie (if
necessary) and automatically launch iDVD with your movie as a new iDVD
project. Life is good, don’t you agree? (For a full discussion of iDVD, run —
don’t walk — to Chapter 5 of Book III.)
Here’s another neat function within the iDVD pane — you can choose to add
chapter markers in iMovie before you export it to iDVD. (In case you haven’t
used markers while watching DVD movies, they allow you to jump immedi-
ately to certain points in the film — for example, each scene in a DVD movie
is likely to have a chapter marker assigned to it, so you can jump directly to
your favorite scenes.)

DVDs! Using iDVD 3
In This Chapter
 Putting together your DVD Menu
 Adding media to a DVD
 Burning a DVD for your friends and family
A
nd now, yet another proud moment in Apple history: the arrival of a
powerful DVD recorder in an affordable computer. The SuperDrive
allows you to create and view your own professional-quality CDs and DVDs.
Apple includes iDVD 3 free with today’s SuperDrive-equipped Macs — with
iDVD, you can easily create beautiful DVD presentations with animation and
interactive menus. And that, friends and neighbors, is the definition of cool.
In this chapter, I show you the basics of creating your first home-cooked
DVD movie — you’ll even have fun doing it!
What Am I Doing, Anyway?
Creating a DVD is a unique process: Combining talents in art, video, and
presentation, DVD authoring demands that you dabble in all these skills. At
its core, a DVD is simply a collection of digital video files — unlike a CD-ROM
or videotape, however, a DVD also has a fancy presentation and navigation
system built into it. With the DVD authoring tools of iDVD, you can
✦Create a menu with buttons, text, and background music and images to
enable viewers to navigate your DVD.
✦Add still and moving images to your DVD.
✦Burn the DVD to a disc for permanent storage and distribution to
friends, family, and co-workers.
Apple overcomes the complexity of DVD authoring with its powerful iDVD 3
software — use it to create professional-looking menu systems to present
your videos and digital slideshows. Then, when you’re ready, a few clicks
burn the presentation, videos, and slideshows onto a DVD using your
SuperDrive. In fact, iDVD 3 will only burn a disc on a system that has a
SuperDrive. (Apologies to the CD-RW crowd.)

Mastering Menus
356
Use iDVD to reduce the process of creating a DVD to three simple steps:
1. Customize the Menu.
The Menu of a DVD is the main screen that viewers use to navigate the
completed DVD. You can use one of the menus supplied by Apple, or
you can create your own.
2. Add media.
What’s a DVD without movies? Use drag-and-drop to fill your DVD with
movie files from iMovie, photographs from iPhoto, and music from
iTunes. (Read more on these in Chapter 4, Chapter 3, and Chapter 2 of
this mini-book, respectively.)
3. Preview and burn a DVD.
You can preview your DVD at any point during the design process.
When you’re satisfied with the results, slip a blank DVD-R in the drive
and click the mouse to burn a finished product.
I go into more detail on each of these steps throughout this chapter.
Mastering Menus
As a Macintosh owner, you’re no doubt familiar with the term menu. When it
comes to DVD authoring, however, menu takes on a new meaning. Instead of
the traditional menus that display when you click towards the top of your
screen in Mac OS X, a DVD Menu is the name of the entire DVD screen that
your viewers will see, including all the buttons that you see.
When you launch the iDVD 3 application, you immediately see a default DVD
Menu, as shown in Figure 5-1. Like that of any commercial DVD movie, you’ll
see this DVD Menu when you load the completed DVD in your favorite DVD
player.
Four components make up a typical DVD Menu:
✦Background image or movie: The backdrop picture that appears
behind all the controls
✦Buttons: Icons that represent the video clips and slideshows on the DVD
✦Background music: The background music that plays while the menu is
displayed
✦Titles: Text that appears in your DVD Menu

Book III
Chapter 5
Burn Those DVDs!
Using iDVD 3
Mastering Menus
357
You can change the look and style of the background, buttons, and titles by
using one of the Apple-provided themes, or you can customize all parts of
the DVD Menu by using your own images, fonts, and buttons.
Themes
If you can’t draw a stick figure and you didn’t have a single class in graphic
arts — like yours truly — you’ll be happy to know that iDVD offers several
professional-looking, pre-packaged themes for you to use. A theme is just a
group of settings that determine the look and feel of your DVD Menu. (Many
thanks, Apple. Especially from those of us who can’t draw a stick figure with-
out an eraser handy.)
To view the included themes, click the Customize button in the lower-left
corner of the iDVD window. When you do, a drawer pops out from the side
of the window, as shown in Figure 5-2.
The Themes drawer contains a panel with buttons, which subdivides the
drawer into six sections:
✦Themes: The Themes panel is where you select one of the included
themes for your DVD Menu.
✦Settings: Select the Settings panel to tweak the settings of your theme,
like the background or audio track.
Figure 5-1:

358
✦Audio: Click this button to organize and import audio from your hard
drive or audio CDs.
✦Photos: The Photos panel allows you to select images from your iPhoto
libraries or import them from other locations on your system.
✦Movies: Manage your existing collection of movie clips or import clips
from iMovie.
✦Status: The Status tab gives you some extra information about the files
in your DVD presentation.
Use choices from the Themes and the Settings tabs in the iDVD drawer to
personalize your DVD Menu to match your tastes. Start with the Themes tab
panel to choose from a list of professional themes.
Clicking any one of these themes updates the DVD Menu to reflect your
selection. A theme contains a background image, a button style, and settings
that affect the onscreen text.
After playing around with the iDVD themes, you might begin to wish for
more of them. Fortunately, iDVD doesn’t lock you into using one of its themes.
You can customize one of the included themes to match your own style.
Setting the background
The first thing that you see when you pop your DVD into your DVD player
is the background image. The rest of the DVD Menu controls hang out on
top of this picture. Besides the beautiful images that iDVD provides in its

themes, you’re free to use any other image that you prefer: You can use still
or motion images as a background and even add background music.
Adding a still background
To change the background of your DVD Menu, perform the following steps:
1. Click the Customize button in the main iDVD window.
This opens the iDVD drawer.
2. Click the Settings tab in the Theme drawer, as shown in Figure 5-3.
From here, you can set the various aspects of your DVD Menu.
3. Drag an image from the Finder and drop it into the Image/Movie well
in the Background section.
In Apple-Talk (power user pun intended), a well is a box that holds an
image or movie — you see a thumbnail preview of its contents. A well
also acts as the target for a drag-and-drop operation like this one.
iDVD updates the DVD Menu to reflect your new background choice.
Adding a moving background
The fun doesn’t stop there, though. Not only can you use any image from
your collection as the backdrop to your DVD Menu, but you can also use
any QuickTime movie to animate the background. Outstandingly sassy!
Figure 5-3:

When you choose a movie to use as a background, make sure that it’s a
short clip, preferably no longer than 30 seconds. To make it look really pro-
fessional, try making the end of the movie clip sync with the beginning of
the movie. Because the short clip loops continuously, you don’t want too
much of a visual difference between the first and last frames of the clip.
To liven up your background with a movie, follow these steps.
1. Click the Customize button in the main iDVD window.
The iDVD drawer opens.
2. Click the Settings tab in the Theme drawer.
The Settings tab enables you change the various aspects of your DVD
Menu.
3. Drag a movie from the Finder and drop it into the Image/Movie well.
4. In the main DVD window, click the Motion button (bottom-right) to
see how your background video looks in action.
5. Click the Motion button again to stop the background motion.
A word on image dimensions
For best results, make sure that your back-
ground image has the same dimensions as dig-
ital video — 640 x 480 pixels. If the dimensions
of your image don’t match the dimensions of
digital video, iDVD will stretch or shrink the
image to fit, which might have undesirable
effects. When your image is stretched and
skewed to fit the DVD Menu, Aunt Harriet might
end up looking like the Ogre from Shrek. (Don’t
forget that you can resize images in iPhoto to
help you with this step.)
Because a TV set has a different aspect ratio
than a digital video clip, activating the Show TV
Safe Area option, which you can find under the
Advanced menu, is also a good idea. This draws
a smaller rectangle within the larger full-screen.
If you place your buttons within this smaller rec-
tangle and make sure that the important parts
of the background image also appear within it,
you can be certain that any television will be
able to display the DVD properly. Go outside of
this “safe area,” and you might end up cutting
Aunt Harriet’s head off in the background image
or losing some of your most cherished clips.
You can use QuickTime player or iPhoto to
change the dimensions of your background
image for import into iDVD. For example, you
can use the iPhoto crop feature to alter the
overall shape of the image and then resize it
within iPhoto. Use the Size setting when you
export the image from iPhoto and then save the
file in the Pictures folder located in your Home
folder so that you can find it easily later. 
For more on working in iPhoto, see Book III,
Chapter 3.

Adding audio to your menu
You can make your customized background even cooler — oops, I meant
more professional — by adding some audio to the mix. To add some back-
ground music or audio to your DVD Menu, follow these steps:
1. Click the Customize button in the main iDVD window.
The iDVD drawer opens.
2. Click the Settings button in the Theme drawer.
Use choices here to change the background audio that plays while view-
ing your DVD Menu.
3. Drag an audio file from the Finder and drop it into the Audio well.
iDVD will accept AIF, MP3, AAC, and WAV files. If you’re using a moving
Menu, its audio track will appear in the Audio well. You can choose to
either keep that audio or to delete it and use another audio file in its
place. If you’re a .Mac subscriber, you can download dozens of free,
professional-quality audio clips that make good background audio for 
a DVD.
4. Click the Motion button in the main iDVD window (bottom-right) to
hear the background audio of your DVD Menu.
5. Click the Motion button again to stop the audio.
When your DVD is complete, your viewers will hear the custom audio play
whenever the main DVD Menu is displayed. Here are some suggestions for
adding some extra style or mood to your DVD Menu system:
✦Play a rendition of “Happy Birthday” for a birthday DVD.
✦Play the “Wedding March” or the song you first danced to as the back-
ground for a wedding DVD.
✦Bring back memories of the family vacation in the backseat of the car
with a DVD that plays “99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall” as the back-
ground music.
With a little imagination, you can probably come up with numerous ideas to
personalize the audio that accompanies your DVD projects.
Adding Media Files to Your DVD
With the background of your DVD Menu in place, it’s time to start adding
some content to the project — either video or still images. With iDVD, you
can add your movies or photographs to a DVD presentation. It’s a great way

Adding Media Files to Your DVD
362
to present and preserve your photographs and videos for years to come . . .
never again will your guests groan when you announce that you want to
show them home movies.
Adding a Movie Button
iDVD displays video clips in the Menu with small buttons. These Movie
Buttons display small previews of the video. To play the video, the user just
selects the Button. To create a Movie Button, you need to add some video
content to your DVD. To do so, drag a QuickTime movie file from the Finder
and drop it into your DVD Menu. When you do, a Movie Button appears in
the DVD Menu, as shown in Figure 5-4.
A Movie Button serves two important purposes:
✦Preview: Displays a small thumbnail image of the movie
✦Navigation: Permits a person to navigate the DVD
After you drag a movie file into your DVD Menu and create a Movie Button,
you can place the button anywhere in the DVD Menu that you wish. To repo-
sition a Movie Button, simply click it and drag it to the desired destination.
By default, Movie Buttons snap to an imaginary grid when relocated — to
position Movie Buttons outside the confines of this grid, select the Free
Position option in the Settings drawer.
An iDVD Menu limits you to six Movie Buttons. If you’d like to have more
than that, add a folder by clicking Folder — which automatically creates a
submenu — and drag another six movie files into the submenu.

Setting the Movie Button style
Like the Menu backgrounds, you can also customize Movie Buttons. To
adjust your Movie Buttons, do the following:
1. Click the Customize button in the main iDVD window.
The iDVD drawer opens.
2. Click the Settings button in the Theme drawer.
3. Click any Movie Button from the DVD Menu to select it.
When you select a Movie Button, a small slider appears above it. Move
this slider to set the default thumbnail picture for that Button in the
Menu. If you select the Movie check box, the Movie Button animates in
the Menu.
To create a button with a still image instead of a movie clip, drag an
image file from a Finder window and drop it on top of the button.
4. Adjust the button’s properties in the Button section of the Settings
panel, shown in Figure 5-5.
You can customize Movie Buttons in several different ways. Table 5-1
describes the settings and what they do.

Adding a Slideshow Button
In addition to movies, iDVD 3 gives you the chance to place your favorite
digital images on the DVD. In the same way that iDVD handles movies as
Movie Buttons in the DVD Menu, you can add a group of images to the Menu
as Slideshow Buttons. Slideshow Buttons are nearly identical to Movie
Buttons, with one exception: They play back a sequence of digital photo-
graphs instead of a movie. Click the Slideshow button at the bottom of the
iDVD window to add . . . uh . . . well, a Slideshow Button. (It’s not easy to
write these books, you know.)
When you add a Slideshow Button, iDVD rearranges the buttons in the DVD
Menu to account for the new button.
Add images to the Slideshow
With a new Slideshow Button in place, you can add images to it by following
these steps:
1. Double-click the Slideshow Button that you just added to the Menu to
open the Slideshow window.
2. To add images to the Slideshow, drag your favorite images from the
Finder to the Slideshow window.
Feel free to drag several photos at once. After the photos are in the
Slideshow window, you can drag them around to change their order of
appearance as shown in Figure 5-6.
You can also click on the Photos tab in the Customize window, which
displays all of the images in your iPhoto Library (as well as the albums
you’ve defined there). Images can be dragged from the Photos tab to the
Slideshow window.

(or click the Audio tab in the Customize window and select an audio
track from iTunes).
4. When you’ve completed setting up your Slideshow, click the Return
button to return to the main Menu.
Setting the Slideshow Button preview
Because multiple images comprise a Slideshow, iDVD gives you the opportu-
nity to select which image you want for the DVD preview. To choose an
image as the preview, click the Slideshow Button that you added to the
Menu to select it. A slider appears above the Slideshow Button. Move this
slider to scroll through the various images in the Slideshow. When you find
the image that you want to use for the Slideshow Button in the DVD Menu,
click the Slideshow Button again to finish the task.
Customizing Titles
Your DVD Menu isn’t just a container of images, movies, and sound. It can
do text, too! Labeling items in your DVD Menu makes it easier to use, and
iDVD makes it a cinch. You can find titles in your DVD Menu in two different
locations:
✦Main Title: The main Title usually appears at the top of the DVD Menu.
It’s the text that uses the largest font.
✦Button captions: Each Movie Button and Slideshow Button has its own
caption (a Title).
Figure 5-6:

Use a Title to label a video clip with a description or add a date for future
reference. As your collection of DVDs grows, you’ll be glad that you took the
time to properly label your Menu and Movie Buttons.
To change the text of the Title or the captions below Movie Buttons, select
the text by clicking it. When you do, a rectangle with a cursor appears to
indicate that you can now edit the text. Type the text that you want to
appear and then press Return when you’re finished; see the results in
Figure 5-7.
As I mention earlier in the chapter, you can also customize the font, color,
and position of the various Titles by clicking the Customize button at the
bottom of the iDVD window.
Checking Things Out with a Preview
Hey, you’re now a DVD-authoring professional! (Although you’re not getting
paid like one.) You’ll no doubt want to see the results of your efforts. It’s a
good idea to review your work often to make sure that the results are up to
your stellar ambitions. To help you out, iDVD 3 gives you a full-featured
Preview mode, where you can view your DVD creation much as you would
with a traditional DVD player. To preview your DVD, just click the Preview
button at the bottom-right of the main iDVD window.

Previewing your DVD project also gives you the opportunity to check your
content. After all, you don’t want the “Wedding March” to play in the back-
ground of your birthday party footage or “The Old Gray Mare” at your in-
laws’ anniversary bash. Because you eventually want to commit this DVD
presentation to real DVD media, it makes sense to scrupulously preview
your presentation; you’ll avoid wasting DVD-Rs.
Saving and Burning a DVD
After your DVD Menu is complete and the project looks great in Preview, it’s
time for the final step in the process. iDVD makes it just as easy to burn
your DVD as it was to lay out the menu and add media to it.
1. Click the Burn button at the bottom of the iDVD window to begin
recording a DVD.
When you click it, the Burn button changes into something that looks
like a serious nuclear warning. (No need to run for cover, though.
iDVD 3 is powerful . . . but not that powerful.)
iDVD asks you to insert a blank DVD-R into the SuperDrive. When this
happens, you might see a message that reads like this:
Disc Insertion... Waiting for Device to Become Ready...
2. Insert a blank DVD-R into the SuperDrive.
3. After you load the disc, wait a moment for iDVD to recognize that the
ball is in its court.
iDVD begins the process of burning the DVD. The length of this process
varies depending on a few factors:
• DVD burner speed: The faster the drive, the shorter the wait
• Amount of material: The more content on your DVD, the longer the
wait
As the burning proceeds, iDVD updates you with progress messages.
Don’t worry if you don’t understand all the messages that it displays.
The language of the DVD creation process is a technical one, and some-
times iDVD speaks this language. Just ignore the messages as the burn-
ing proceeds.
Because iDVD has to encode all the content before the burn can take
place, it might take a couple of hours to create a DVD. After the first
DVD is done, though, iDVD lets you create additional DVDs in a fraction
of the time. It will keep asking you for additional discs until you cancel
the operation.

Saving and Burning a DVD

(Insert plug here.) If you want to find out what all these messages
mean — as well as how to burn all sorts of data, audio, and exotic 
CD and DVD formats — I would naturally recommend CD and DVD
Recording For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by yours truly (Wiley Publishing,
Inc.). It’s a comprehensive guide to everything optical for both Macs
and Windows PCs.
4. When iDVD completes the burning process, remove the disc from the
drive and pop it into any consumer-grade DVD player.
Alternatively, you can leave the DVD in the drive, fire up DVD Player by
clicking its icon in the Applications folder, and view your new work of
art right on your Mac.
If you have any experience with DVDs at all, you’ll soon notice one big differ-
ence between a copy of Lord of the Rings that you rent from your local video
store and the DVDs that you create with iDVD: Although iDVD 3 is great for
presenting video clips and image slideshows in a menu format, the applica-
tion can’t create a DVD that plays all video clips on the disc as one continu-
ous movie. For that, you need to create a complete movie in iMovie and use
chapter marks (a feature I discuss in the previous chapter) — this allows
iDVD to create a disc that can be played from beginning to end!
Personally, such a limitation is no big deal — but if you need industrial-
strength DVD authoring, Apple produces software called DVD Studio Pro 2,
which allows you to author DVDs like those that you find in the store. The
learning curve is a little steeper, naturally, and the application carries a pro-
fessional price tag hovering around the $1,000 mark. However, with a little
effort, DVD Studio Pro 2 can be mastered by anyone who’s an expert at
iDVD!

 Viewing movies
 Listening to audio
 Converting media to different formats
 Keeping track of your favorite media
 Tweaking QuickTime preferences
QuickTime is a set of exciting technologies that gives you access to the
greatest multimedia experience around. Despite its power, don’t be
surprised if you don’t even realize that you’re using it sometimes. Built with
the average Joe in mind, QuickTime takes multimedia to new heights with-
out forcing its users to become rocket scientists in the process. And dig that
sassy chrome sheen — not bad for a software application!
QuickTime Can Do That?
QuickTime was created by Apple to perform all sorts of multimedia func-
tions. Although it’s normally associated with movie playback, QuickTime
can do much more. Whether movies, audio, animation, or music, QuickTime
acts as the main engine that drives all your multimedia needs.
✦Media player: QuickTime’s main claim to fame is playing all sorts of
media — and I do mean all sorts. Table 6-1 lists some of the media types
that QuickTime can play.
The real beauty of QuickTime is that it transparently handles playback
of all these media formats and more. You don’t even really have to know
what each of these formats is to play them. QuickTime takes care of that
for you.
✦File converter: The world of multimedia includes all kinds of file for-
mats: So many, in fact, that it can take a rocket scientist to figure them
all out. Fortunately, beyond its abilities as a world-class media player,
QuickTime also has a full suite of conversion tools at its heart. QuickTime
can import many kinds of media and spit them back out into practically

any other format that it supports. Again, QuickTime handles the messy
details behind the scenes for you. You don’t need to know a .mov file
from an .mp4 file to import and export to and from either format.
QuickTime’s got you covered.
✦Internet media tool: When it comes to using media from the Internet,
QuickTime is in a league all its own. With its plug-in feature, QuickTime
takes its functionality to the Web browser. In addition to playing the
usual movies and audio files found on the World Wide Web, QuickTime
can play (or display) 3-D scenes and animations. If that weren’t enough,
QuickTime even lets you interact with some media. For example, with
QuickTime, you can navigate within 3-D worlds or play Flash games.

Playing Media with QuickTime
QuickTime makes a world of movies, audio, graphics, and music instantly
available to you. Whether you want to view professional movie trailers or
listen to a garage band’s new single, QuickTime faithfully reproduces nearly
any media format that you feed it.
At the center of the action: QuickTime Player
At the heart of QuickTime’s playback functionality is the QuickTime Player
application. To launch QuickTime Player, double-click its icon in the Finder,
which appears in the following figure. You can also launch QuickTime Player
from the Finder by double-clicking a media file that QuickTime can play.
(See Table 6-1 earlier in this chapter for a listing of these file types.)

Don’t make the mistake of thinking that QuickTime and QuickTime Player
are the same thing: QuickTime is a technology that hides in the background
waiting for instructions to do something with media; QuickTime Player is an
application that uses the QuickTime technologies. You’ll do media conver-
sions, playback, and editing with QuickTime Player. What you won’t see is
the QuickTime technology in action behind the scenes.
You can also launch QuickTime Player from its oh-so-convenient Dock icon.
For more on the Dock, read Book II, Chapter 3.
QuickTime has two versions: free or Pro. The main differences between the
free and Pro versions of QuickTime lie in the QuickTime Player application
itself. The free version just plays media, and the Pro version adds extra fea-
tures to QuickTime Player, such as converting ’twixt different media formats
and full-screen playback. If you’re using QuickTime Pro, all items listed in
this chapter will work as described. If, however, you notice that a feature is
dimmed out or missing altogether, you might be using the free QuickTime
license. To find out whether you’re using a free or Pro license, open the
System Preferences and navigate to the QuickTime panel. If you’ve regis-
tered as a QuickTime Pro user, you can find its registration information here,
as shown in Figure 6-1. If you’re not a registered user, you can purchase the
upgrade at www.apple.com/quicktime. The upgrade will cost you $29.99,
at the time of this writing.
Opening QuickTime movies
To begin viewing and hearing — aw, what the heck, how about absorbing —
multimedia files, choose File➪Open from the QuickTime Player application.
This isn’t the only way to open a file with QuickTime Player, though. Some of
the other ways to open files with QuickTime Player are

✦Drag a file to the QuickTime Player icon in the Dock.
✦Double-click the media file in the Finder. If it has a QuickTime-style icon
(a blue letter Q), it will automatically open in QuickTime Player.
Operating QuickTime Player
When you open a QuickTime file, QuickTime Player creates a new window to
display it. All QuickTime Player windows share some common features.
✦Close, Minimize, and Zoom controls: These three controls appear at
the top left-hand corner of most windows in Mac OS X. You probably
recognize them by their colors: red, yellow, and green, respectively.
✦Resize handle: Drag the lower right-hand corner of QuickTime Player to
resize its movie for playback. Hold Shift while dragging to break free
from constrained resizing. If the document contains sound media only,
the window will grow or shrink in a horizontal direction when you
resize it.
Any resizing that you perform makes no changes to the original file.
QuickTime provides it for your convenience during playback.
Although some window features are common to all QuickTime Player win-
dows, many features depend on the type of media that you wish to play.
Table 6-2 lists some of the window features that you might find and the
media types associated with those features.

scenes each time that it opens a media file. Although you might think that

there are different combinations of controls in QuickTime Player, the reality
is that the various media windows are more similar than they are different.
Figure 6-2 shows the location of various QuickTime Player controls.
Playing media
Playback begins like you might suspect — by clicking the Play button. While
a file is playing, the Play button toggles to a Stop button. Click that button to
stop playback, which toggles the button back to Play.
Clicking the buttons with double-arrows on them advances the playback
head at high speed in the direction of the arrows. If the file has audio in it,
you will hear the playback at high speed, which sounds like an episode of
those helium-inhaling Chipmunks (remember? Meee, I waaant a hooola
hooop.). Despite its comical sound, it’s helpful for quickly scanning through
a file. Click the buttons with a single arrow to advance to the beginning or
end of a file.
You can also advance through the file by dragging the playback head in
either direction. This action is permissible while the file is playing or when
it’s stopped. Unlike when you use the buttons, however, you miss out on the
high-speed sound and video.
To adjust the volume of a movie, simply move the volume slider left or right.
You can control playback by using the keyboard as well. Table 6-3 summarizes
the keyboard shortcuts for playback.

Advanced playback features
QuickTime Player offers advanced playback features that go beyond simple
play and stop functions. Keep in mind, however, that some of the advanced
features of QuickTime Player are meant only for registered QuickTime Pro
users. The general rule is that registered Pro users of QuickTime Player can
modify QuickTime content. If you aren’t registered as a QuickTime Pro user,
you can take advantage of only playback features in QuickTime Player.
Video playback
To adjust video playback quality, choose Movie➪Show Video Controls or
press Ô+K. When you do, a small adjustment bar arises like magic from the
bottom edge of your movie. The first setting that you’ll probably see is
Brightness. Click the text in this adjustment to select the next setting,
Contrast. The video settings that you can change are
✦Brightness
✦Contrast
✦Tint
✦Color
To change a setting, click the colored lines that span the adjustment bar.
You can immediately view the results of any video changes that you make.
Figure 6-3 demonstrates one of the video controls in action.
Audio playback
You can also tweak the audio playback of any file that has one or more
soundtracks. To open the audio playback controls, either click the miniature
equalizer to the right of the Timeline or choose Movie➪Show Sound Controls.
With the audio controls, you can alter the following:

After you change the audio to your satisfaction, click the miniature equal-
izer again or choose Movie➪Hide Sound Controls. Figure 6-4 shows the
advanced audio controls.
Looping features
Sometimes you might want to play a piece of media more than once. In
these situations, you need to loop the playback. To force a movie to loop,
choose Movie➪Loop or press Ô+L. Press Ô+L again to turn off looping.
If you want to get fancy, you can also play a movie in a forward direction
followed by playback in reverse. Apple calls this looping back and forth. To
do this, choose Movie➪Loop Back and Forth.

Movie info
To see more information about the files that you’re playing, ask the expert:
QuickTime Player. To view basic information about a movie, choose Window➪
Show Movie Info or press Ô+I. The resulting window displays the following
data:
✦Source: Location of the file
✦Format: Compressor and dimensions of the file
✦Movie FPS: Preferred rate of playback in frames per second (fps)
✦Playing FPS: Actual rate of playback in fps (available during playback
only)
✦Data Size: Size of the file
✦Data Rate: Preferred rate of playback (in bytes per second)
✦Current Time: Position of the playback head (in units of time)
✦Duration: Length of the movie file (in units of time)
✦Normal Size: Default movie dimensions
✦Current Size: Actual movie dimensions (if you’ve resized the movie
since opening the file)
These bits and pieces of information are read-only, which means that you
can’t change them from the Movie Info window.
Movie properties
In addition to general movie information, you can also peek inside a
QuickTime movie to see what makes it tick. To display the Movie Properties
window, choose Movie➪Get Movie Properties or press Ô+J. Figure 6-5
shows the Movie Properties window when you first open it.

The Movie Properties window displays the tracks via the pop-up menu on
the top left of the Movie Properties window. Selecting a track causes the
pop-up menu on the top right to display a set of properties that pertain to
the selected track. Figure 6-6 demonstrates the Track and Properties pop-up
menus in action.
Unlike the Movie Info window, the Movie Properties window does let you
change many aspects of a movie. For example, to resize, skew, or even
rotate a movie’s video track, follow these steps:
1. With QuickTime Player, open a QuickTime movie.
2. Press Ô+J to open its Movie Properties window.
3. From the Tracks pop-up menu of the Properties window, choose the
first available Video Track.
Figure 6-6:
Select
tracks and

erties from

Back on track
Every file that you open with QuickTime Player
consists of one or more tracks. A track contains
one (and only one) type of media. For example,
a typical QuickTime movie might comprise two
tracks:
 Video track: Stores the video data of the
movie
 Sound track: Stores the audio data of the
movie
In contrast, opening an audio file with
QuickTime Player might have only a single
sound track. Other files don’t have a video or
sound track at all: Shockwave and Flash (.swf)
files, for example, usually contain only one Flash
track. MIDI files have yet another type of track.
Luckily, QuickTime makes it simple for you to
ignore these technical trivia facts altogether
(which most of us prefer).

4. From the Properties pop-up menu, select Size.
5. Click the Adjust button.
Red adjustment handles appear in the movie player. Resize and rotate
to your heart’s content!
6. When you’ve adjusted the track’s size to your liking, click the Done
button.
With a similar approach, you can change many other properties of a track,
such as Annotations settings.
QuickTime: The Super Converter
QuickTime Pro also makes a great tool for converting media files. As your
collection of multimedia grows, you’ll eventually find yourself wishing that
certain files were in a different format. For example, you might want to con-
vert a QuickTime movie to a DV file for use with iMovie. With a few clicks,
QuickTime Pro can open a media file in one of dozens of formats and con-
vert it to most any other format that QuickTime understands. To do so, you
must import the file into QuickTime and then export it into the format that
you prefer.
Importing files
For most operations, you can open a file with QuickTime Player by using the
usual File➪Open menu item. For some formats, however, this won’t work. In
these instances, QuickTime gives you the chance to import a file. The differ-
ence between open and import is subtle but important: If QuickTime can
natively handle a file’s media, you can use the Open menu. If it can’t handle
a media’s data natively, it must import the file. The import process converts
the file to a format that QuickTime can use. To start the import process, just
choose File➪Import.
For example, QuickTime doesn’t normally display text files. Using the
Import command, however, converts a text file into a movie file. Then you
can view the text in a traditional movie player window. Figure 6-7 shows an
imported text file movie.

Exporting files
After you open or import a media file, QuickTime Pro will let you export it to
one of many formats — for example, you might export a QuickTime movie to
an AVI movie for those Windows users who don’t have QuickTime installed.
To export a movie, choose File➪Export. In the dialog that appears (as shown
in Figure 6-8), select the desired output format from the Export pop-up
menu. Each export type also has a set of options. To view them, click the
Options button on the right side of the Export dialog.

Although QuickTime Player and Pro are great at actively importing, export-
ing, and altering all kinds of media, most Mac OS X owners don’t care about
these features. For those who could care less what the media type is for an
e-mail attachment, QuickTime transparently handles the chore of displaying
the file without having to know all the technical details behind it. With
QuickTime as your ally, you can watch the latest Star Wars movie trailer,
view an image in a Web page . . . or, if you’re like me, you can listen to Bob
Hope jaw with Bing Crosby (if you have a collection of classic radio shows in
MP3 format). QuickTime makes a great tool for viewing and exploring all
sorts of exciting multimedia content.
Favorites
The quickest way to keep track of your media files is with the Favorites
menu. It offers one-click access to the media files that you use most. To add
a file to the Favorites menu, do the following:
1. Open your favorite media file.
2. Press Ô+D or choose Favorites➪Add Movie as Favorite.
Now, anytime you want to watch and/or hear this file, you simply choose it
from the Favorites menu.
You can remove files later from the Favorites menu by performing these
steps:
1. Choose Favorites➪Show Favorites.
2. In the Favorites window that appears, select the file that you wish to
remove.
3. Press the Delete key to remove the file from the Favorites menu.
Free content for all
QuickTime Player offers you one-click access to a variety of multimedia
content, including news, entertainment, and educational features. Naturally,
an Internet connection is required. To view the QuickTime Player Content
Guide, click the Q button in the lower right-hand corner of the Player 
(see Figure 6-9).
When you do, a new window opens in the Player, as shown in Figure 6-10.
This is the Content Guide’s main menu. From here, you can click any of the
provided links just as you might click a link in a Web page.

QuickTime and your browser
QuickTime is equally at home in a Web browser. Like the QuickTime Player
application, the QuickTime Web plug-in offers convenient playback utilities
directly in your Web browser. To view a movie in a browser window, simply
navigate to a Web page that contains a QuickTime movie; QuickTime auto-
matically loads the movie and plays it in the Web page. In many cases, you
can even save a movie from a Web page — just click the triangle icon at the
far right of the movie controller. A menu appears, giving you two options to
save the movie, as shown in Figure 6-11. Choosing Save As Source saves the
file in the format in which you originally downloaded it; choosing Save As
QuickTime Movie converts the file to a QuickTime movie.

Tweaking QuickTime
After you become comfortable with using QuickTime for media playback,
you might want to expand your horizons. QuickTime has many features —
so many, in fact, that it requires two different Preference windows to handle
them all.
Setting QuickTime Player Preferences
To open QuickTime Player Preferences, choose QuickTime Player➪General
Preferences. A General Preferences window appears with a number of set-
tings that affect how the QuickTime Player application works.
Working with QuickTime Preferences
To open the Preferences for QuickTime, do one of the following:
✦Open System Preferences and navigate to the QuickTime panel.
✦Using the QuickTime Player application, choose QuickTime Player➪
QuickTime Preferences.
Click the various tabs of the QuickTime Preferences, as shown in Figure 6-12,
to change its settings.
The QuickTime Preferences consist of five tabs of settings:
✦Plug-In: To play QuickTime content, your browser uses a QuickTime
plug-in. Configure the plug-in’s settings here.
✦Connection: QuickTime can tailor your online multimedia experience to
the speed of your Internet connection. Tell QuickTime what speed your
connection uses, and it takes care of the rest.

A
ll the creative capabilities of the Mac OS X digital hub are a lot of fun,
but at some point, you’re going to want to take a break from work. In
recent years, DVDs have exploded onto the home entertainment scene;
because of its high fidelity, convenience, and seemingly limitless storage
capacity, the DVD has taken consumers by storm. The idea of an honest-to-
goodness theater in your home is now within the grasp of mere mortals
(with, coincidentally, merely average budgets). Mac OS X has everything
that you’ll need to enjoy a night at the movies without ever leaving home.
In fact, I can highly recommend the new 17-inch iMac G4 or the 17-inch
PowerBook for those wide-screen classics.
The DVD Hardware
Before you watch one second of film, it’s a good idea to get your setup in
order. Playing DVDs requires a bit of hardware; fortunately, most recent
Macintosh computers come equipped with the stuff that’s necessary to
watch DVDs.
To play DVD movies, you’ll need either an internal DVD-compatible drive in
your Macintosh or an external DVD drive with a FireWire connection. Note:
DVD-ROM drives can only play discs, while others, like the SuperDrive, can
both play and record discs. Either type of drive will work fine for watching
movies on your Mac.
You can watch any standard DVD that you purchase at your local video
store, as well as any DVD that you create with iDVD. (For more on iDVD,
iRead Book III, Chapter 5.)

The DVD Player: It’s Truly Shiny
386
The DVD Player: It’s Truly Shiny
To watch Frodo Baggins, Don Corleone, or James Bond, you’ll need DVD
player software. Mac OS X comes stocked with the perfect tool for the task:
DVD Player.
Apple’s DVD Player application is included with Mac OS X. You can find DVD
Player here:
/Applications/DVD Player
But instead of rooting through the Finder, you can launch DVD Player an
even easier way: Simply insert a DVD into the drive. As soon as you do, your
Mac recognizes the disc and launches DVD Player by default for you. (Time
for another round of well-deserved gloating about your choice of personal
computer.)
This automatic behavior can be curbed, however. You can control what
action Panther takes (if any) when you load a DVD via the CDs & DVDs panel
within System Preferences. For all the details, visit Book II, Chapter 3.
However you choose to start DVD Player, you’ll notice that it offers two
windows:
✦Controller: The small, silver-colored, remote control-looking interface
that holds all the controls for the Player.
✦Viewer: The large window where you view your DVD movies.
If you’re already using a traditional DVD player, you’ll be right at home with
Apple’s DVD Player. Even if you’ve never used a traditional DVD player, it’s
not much different than using a software-based audio player like iTunes.
Using the Controller
The Controller is the command center of the DVD Player software. Arranged
much like a VCR or tape deck, all the familiar controls are present. Check it
out in Figure 7-1. (If your controller is facing in the other direction, don’t
panic — the controller can be switched between horizontal and vertical ori-
entations from the Controls menu.)

Controller. Apple software usually has some goodies hidden beneath the
surface, and DVD Player is no exception. The controls in DVD Player have a
few functions that might not be obvious to the casual user. These are listed
in the third column of Table 7-1.

As I mention earlier, you can switch the Controller between horizontal and
vertical orientation, which can make it easier to fit onscreen. Choose
Controls➪Use Horizontal Controller (or Use Vertical Controller, depending
on the current orientation). Those with keyboard shortcut fever can press
Ô+Option+C, which toggles between the orientations.
Keep your eyes on the Viewer
As soon as you begin playing around with the DVD Player controls, you’ll
notice activity in the Viewer window, shown in Figure 7-2.

Jumping right to the flying-monkey action
Movies on DVD are divided into chapters that
enable you to jump directly to that point. That
way, you can jump right to the scene, say,
where the flying monkey guards march into the
Wicked Witch’s castle in The Wizard of Oz. (Or
skip that egg-hatching scene in Alien that
always makes you nauseous.) You can navigate
to chapters, play the movie from the beginning,
or check out special bonus features (such as
trailers and documentaries) from the DVD’s
main menu.

You can think of the Viewer window as a television inside your Macintosh if
it helps, but DVD Player goes one step further. Unlike a television screen,
the Viewer has some nice tricks up its sleeve: For example, you can resize
the Viewer window by using one of the four sizes listed in the Video menu
(half, normal, maximum, and full-screen sizes). This is useful for watching 
a movie in a small window on your Desktop while you work with other
applications.
If you’re in it for the entertainment factor only, you’ll probably want to
resize the Viewer to fill the screen. I like to watch movies in full-screen
mode, which you can toggle with the Ô+0 (zero) keyboard shortcut.
Taking Advantage of Additional DVD Features
As anyone with a little DVD experience knows, DVDs can do a lot more than
those archaic tapes that you used to feed your VCR. Apple has included
several functions that allow you to explore the extra features and content
provided with a DVD movie.
Controller extras
To use the additional Controller features, double-click the small tab at the
rightmost (or bottom) edge of the DVD Player Controller. When you do, a
trick drawer slides out displaying the extra controls. (See Figure 7-3.) You
can also display or hide the drawer with the Controls➪Open Control Drawer
menu command or by pressing Ô+] (that’s the right bracket key).
Table 7-2 summarizes the functions that you can perform with these addi-
tional controls.

Although you won’t find a Bookmark button on the Controller, DVD Player
can set them nonetheless. A bookmark is a spot that you specify in a movie
that you can return to at any time, like a favorite scene. To set a bookmark
at the current spot in the movie, click the Controls menu and click Add
Bookmark or press Ô+= (the equal sign key). DVD Player even allows you to
name the bookmark so it’s easier to remember. To return to a bookmark,
choose Go➪Bookmarks and click the desired bookmark.
DVD Player preferences
The DVD Player application has a variety of settings that you can access and
adjust via its preferences window. To open the preferences window, choose
DVD Player➪Preferences. This brings up the preferences dialog, as shown in
Figure 7-4.
This window consists of four panels:
✦Player: Settings that affect how DVD Player operates
✦Disc Setup: Settings for Audio, Subtitles, Language, and the Web
✦Full Screen: Settings that determine your Viewer window configuration
✦Windows: Settings for displaying onscreen information during playback
The advantage of these preference settings is that you can customize your
copy of DVD Player to match your needs or desires. (Thanks yet again to the
Cupertino Crowd!)
Player
Despite its moniker, the Player settings of DVD Player seem to have more to
do with discs than the Player. As you can see in Figure 7-4, three subsections
make up the Player settings, yet only two of them have something to do with
discs. Strange, but true!

✦When DVD Player Opens: These two settings affect what happens
when you launch the DVD Player application. You can force DVD Player
to play in full screen mode and automatically begin playback every time
that you start the application.
✦When a Disc Is Inserted: One lonely option appears in this subsection.
Besides automatic playback on startup, you can also make DVD Player
start playing a disc automatically when the application is already run-
ning. (To illustrate: If this check box is disabled, loading a new disc will
not automatically start it playing if DVD Player is already running.)
✦Start Playing Discs From: If you have to quit DVD Player for some
reason, the application is smart enough to remember where you were . . .
and you can choose to begin watching from the beginning, from the last
position (where you were when you stopped the last time), or from a
default bookmark. Alternatively, just select Always Ask, and DVD Player
will prompt you each time that this situation crops up.
Do you answer a lot of telephone calls while you sneak a quick DVD movie
at work? If so, use the Enable Closed Captioning When DVD Player Is Muted
feature . . . if you have to press the Mute button on your keyboard while a
movie is playing, DVD Player automatically adds the subtitles/closed cap-
tions so that you can keep up with the dialog. Super sassy!

Disc Setup
The second tab of the Player preferences window consists of three sections,
as shown in Figure 7-5.
✦Language: Sprechen Sie Deutsch? DVDs are designed to be multilanguage
aware. Feel like brushing up on your German, Spanish, or Chinese? You
can control the language used for the audio, subtitling, and menus in
this section; of course, your choices are limited to those options
included on the DVD.
✦Internet: One lonely setting resides in the Internet section. Some DVDs
can access information on the Internet. Mark this check box to allow
that function.
✦Audio: Click this drop-down list box to specify the default audio output
signal that you’d like to use.
Multiple languages and Web access are not mandatory features of a DVD, so
don’t be surprised if you see variations of support when it comes to these
settings.
Full Screen
These preference settings (as shown in Figure 7-6) control the default screen
display settings within DVD Player.
✦Viewer: Click the drop-down list box to choose the default size for the
Viewer window when you first start DVD Player. To allow the Viewer
window to be resized with the mouse, mark the Resizable Viewer check
box to enable it.
✦Controller: I generally like to hide the Controller after a defined time of
inactivity; select the Hide Controller If Inactive For xx Seconds check
box if you agree. To set the delay period, click in the seconds box and
type a new value.
✦Displays: These options specify how DVD Player shares your Desktop
with others: politely or downright rude. You can choose to automati-
cally dim other monitors while a movie is playing (if you have more
than one display connected to your Mac), and DVD Player can stay in
full-screen mode even if another application actually has the active
window. Finally, you can choose to remove the menu bar altogether,
which helps cut down on interruptions and accidents if small hands are
nearby.

✦Options: Mark the Display Status Information check box, and DVD
Player adds a small text box at the top-left corner of the Viewer window.
In this text box, you see the name of the last task that you performed
with DVD Player. For example, click the Stop button to see the word Stop
displayed in the Viewer on top of the video beneath it. You can also set
the Controller to fade away instead of just disappearing — it’s eye
candy, but doggone it, it’s good eye candy!
✦Floating Overlays: If you do decide to display status information, you
can click the two color buttons to specify the text color for the status
information and closed caption text. If your Mac has a powerful-enough
video card, you can choose to make these lines of text semitransparent
to boot. (Think Return of the Son of Eye Candy.)
Don’t forget to click OK to save any changes that you make to your DVD
Player preferences.
Now that you have your DVD Player customized to your liking, get out the
popcorn, pull up your favorite recliner, and let the movies roll!

In This Chapter
 Selecting an Internet service provider (ISP)
 Understanding how your Mac gets on the Internet
 Setting up your Internet connection
I
’ll be honest — the Internet is a terribly complex monster of a network.
If you tried to fathom all the data that’s exchanged on the Internet and
everything that takes place when you check your e-mail for Aunty Joan’s
fruitcake recipe, your brain would probably melt like a chocolate bar in the
Sahara Desert. There’s a shoebox full of archaic things tucked under the
Internet: communications protocols, routing addresses, packets, servers, and
other hoo-hah that’s beyond the grasp of just about everyone on the planet.
Luckily for regular folks like you and me, Mac OS X closes the trapdoor on
all these details, keeping them hidden (as they should be). You don’t have to
worry about them, and the obscure information that you need in order to
establish an Internet connection is kept to a minimum. In fact, the happiest
computer owners that I’ve met think that the Internet is a little blinking light
on their modem: If the light blinks in the proper manner, all is well. (I don’t
argue with them.)
In this chapter, I provide help and advice to those who are searching for an
on-ramp to the Information Superhighway — and I lead you through the pro-
cedure of adding an Internet connection under Mac OS X. (In other words,
we’ll get your light blinking properly.)
Note: If you entered your Internet configuration information while you were
in the First Use Wizard during the installation of Mac OS X — or if you
upgraded to Mac OS X from Mac OS 9, and you already had a working
Internet connection — you can skip this chapter! The information contained
herein is only for those who add or change their Internet connectivity after
installing Mac OS X.
Shopping for an ISP
Before you can connect to the Internet, you must sign up for Internet access.
If you already have an ISP (acronym-speak for an Internet service provider) or
your company provides Internet access, smile quietly to yourself and skip to

the next section. Otherwise, hang around while I discuss what to look for in
an ISP and how to locate one in your local area.
ISPs are as thick as Louisiana mosquitoes these days, and often they’re
judged solely by the amount that they charge for basic access. Cost defi-
nitely is a factor — but it’s not the only thing that should determine your
choice in a service provider. Consider these guidelines when choosing or
switching ISPs:
✦Local calling rates: If you live in a rural area, check to make sure that
all prospective ISPs offer local calling rates. Believe me, no matter how
much fun and how useful the Internet is, it’s not worth hours of long-
distance charges.
✦Broadband service: Many ISPs now offer digital subscriber line (DSL)
and cable modem access. Collectively, these connections are called
broadband because they offer the fastest method of transferring infor-
mation to and from the Internet. If you have a home business, a large
family, or students — or you telecommute to your office — using broad-
band can make your life much simpler.
✦Quality technical support: A 24-hour/7-day telephone support line is a
godsend for the Internet novice — don’t settle for voice support during
business hours. Forget e-mail support, too; your e-mail application will be
dead and gone if your Internet connection gives you problems. (Sound of
palm whacking forehead.)
✦Static IP addresses: A static IP address — the unique number that identi-
fies your computer on the Internet — allows you to set up a professional
Web server or File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server. (More on these adven-
tures later in the book.) Most ISPs charge an additional amount for a
static IP address, so it’s not really a good idea for a typical Mac owner at
home. Suffice it to say, however, that a business or organization running
a Web server or FTP server will benefit from a static IP address.
✦E-mail accounts: Investigate how many individual accounts that you
receive with various ISPs. Also, find out whether you can maintain them
yourself through a Web site. If so, that’s a good sign. Additionally, if the
prospective ISP provides a Web site where you can read and send e-mail
messages, you can stay on top of your e-mail even while you’re on the
road or vacationing halfway across the globe.
✦Web space: If you want your ISP to host your Web site, this is a no-
brainer: The more space you get, the better. A minimum of 5MB is
acceptable, but most ISPs provide 10MB or 20MB these days. Also,
beware of ISPs that will charge you for your Web site if it receives a large
amount of traffic: It can be expensive to host a popular Web site if you
join one of these ISPs.

Chapter 1

Internet

399
✦Domain name service: Finally, the better class of ISP also offers a
domain name service, which allows you to register something like 
yournamehere.com. For the most professional appearance, you can
usually pay a yearly fee, and the ISP takes care of all the details in set-
ting up your own .com or .org domain name.
Locating an ISP is much easier in the modern Internet-savvy world than it
was just two or three years ago. In the order that you should try them, here
are the tricks that I recommend for finding your local ISPs:
✦Check with your cable or telephone companies. If you’re already sub-
scribing to cable service in your area, you’re likely to be a candidate for
cable Internet access. Also, many local phone companies offer DSL
access, but that access area is often limited to certain locations. Call the
customer service numbers for these companies and check out what
they offer — and don’t forget that a broadband cable or DSL connection
is always more expensive than an old-fashioned, dialup connection.
(“Maude, did you see the Internet bill this month?”)
✦Get recommendations from friends and neighbors. Folks love to give
free advice: Ask them how much they’re paying, how reliable the con-
nection has been, and how well they rate the ISP’s technical support.
✦Check your phone directory. Check the phone book for Internet service.
✦Investigate ISP Web sites. If you have Internet access at work, a friend’s
house, or your local public library, you can surf to The List (thelist.
internet.com) where you can search for ISPs within your area code
and location.
Investigating Various Types of Connections
Next, consider the types of connections that are available under Mac OS X
to link your Mac to said ISP. You can choose from four pathways to digital
freedom:
✦A dialup connection: Old-fashioned, yes. Slow as an arthritic burro,
indeed. However, an analog (or telephone modem) connection is still the
primary method for reaching the Internet for most computer owners. It’s
the cheapest method available, and all you need for this type of connec-
tion is a standard telephone jack and a modem. If you remember your
classic iMac commercials, any Mac that can run Mac OS X should have
a built-in modem.
✦A broadband connection: Be it through DSL (which uses a standard
telephone line) or cable (which uses your cable TV wiring), broadband

Investigating Various Types of Connections
400
Internet access is many times faster than a dialup connection. Plus, both
these technologies are always-on, meaning that your computer is auto-
matically connected to the Internet when you turn it on and that connec-
tion stays active. With DSL or cable, there’s no squeaky whine that
accompanies your modem making a connection each time that you want
to check your movie listings Web site. Both DSL and cable require a spe-
cial piece of hardware (commonly called a modem, but it really isn’t);
this box is usually thrown in as part of your ISP charge. Broadband con-
nections usually require a professional installation, too.
✦A satellite connection: If you’re really out there — miles and miles away
from any cable or DSL phone service — you can still get high-speed
Internet access. The price for a satellite connection is usually much
steeper than a standard DSL or cable connection, but it’s available any-
where you can plant your antenna dish. Plus, a satellite connection is
actually faster than other types of broadband access. Older satellite
technologies actually require you to use a dialup connection — and the
antenna could only receive, not send — but recently, a number of ISPs
have started to offer satellite systems that both send and receive
through the dish.
✦A network connection: The last type of connection concerns those
Macs that are part of a local area network (LAN) either at the office or in
your home. If your Mac is connected to a LAN that already has Internet
access, you don’t need an ISP at all, and no other hardware is required:
Simply contact your network administrator, buy that important person
a steak dinner, and ask to be connected to the Internet. On the other
hand, if your network currently has no Internet access, you’re back to
Square One: You’ll need one of the previous three types of connections.
Oh, please! Not ISDN!
If you’re thinking, “Hey, Mark, you forgot
ISDN!,” allow me to reply, “So did everyone
else.” I don’t mean to anger all those prophets
who predicted that we’d all be using Integrated
Services Digital Network (ISDN) by now, but the
truth is that ISDN has turned into a joke.
Essentially, ISDN was the ancestor of DSL,
which actually realized the potential of the idea.
ISDN, which was the first broadband connec-
tion method to use regular phone lines, was
supposed to revolutionize the Internet five or six
years back (along with curing male pattern
baldness and explaining UFO abductions).
Unfortunately, ISDN technology requires all
sorts of very complex and expensive hardware,
and it really isn’t as fast as all that — most cable
modem Internet access is much faster.
(Consider what happens to the first entry in just
about any technological advance . . . sigh.)
ISDN was quickly eclipsed by the other broad-
band technologies . . . therefore, its abbrevia-
tion has come to mean It Still Does Nothing, and
anyone with an option to use DSL or cable
should give ISDN a wide berth.

After you connect one of your computers on your network to the Internet,
you can use an Internet sharing device to allow all the computers to share
that Internet connection. Book V, Chapter 5 goes into all the details on shar-
ing an Internet connection on a network.
Setting Up Your Internet Connection
Okay, so you sign up for Internet access, and your ISP sends you a sheet of
paper covered with indecipherable stuff that looks like Egyptian hieroglyph-
ics. Don’t worry; those are the settings that you need to connect to your ISP.
After you get them in Mac OS X, you should be surfing the Web like an old pro.
Before you jump into this configuration, make sure that you’ve configured
the Internet settings within System Preferences, as I discuss in Book II,
Chapter 3. That way, you’ll already have entered your default e-mail and
Web settings.
Using your internal modem
Follow these steps to set up your Internet connection if you’re using your
Mac’s internal modem:
1. Click the System Preferences icon in the Dock and choose Network.
2. Select Internal Modem from the Show drop-down list.
3. Click the TCP/IP tab (as shown in Figure 1-1) and enter the settings
for the type of connection that your ISP provides:

• If your ISP tells you to use PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol): Click the
Configure IPv4 drop-down list and choose Using PPP. If your ISP pro-
vided you with DNS Server or Search Domain addresses, type them
now in the corresponding boxes.
• If you’re using AOL: Click the Configure IPv4 drop-down list and
choose AOL Dialup. If AOL provided you with DNS Server or Search
Domain addresses, click in the corresponding box and type them now.
• If you’ll use a manual connection: Click the Configure IPv4 drop-
down list box and choose Manually. Then click in the IP Address,
DNS Servers, and Search Domains fields and enter the respective set-
tings provided by your ISP.
4. Click the PPP tab to display the settings shown in Figure 1-2.
5. In their respective fields, enter the account name, password, tele-
phone number, and (optionally) the service provider name and an
alternate telephone number provided by your ISP.
6. Press Ô+Q to exit System Preferences and save your changes.

3. Enter the settings for the type of connection that your ISP provides:
• If your ISP tells you to use Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
(DHCP): Select Using DHCP from the Configure IPv4 drop-down list,
and your ISP can automatically set up virtually all the TCP/IP set-
tings for you! (No wonder DHCP is so popular these days.)
• If you won’t be using DHCP: Select Manually from the Configure
IPv4 drop-down list box. Then enter the settings provided by your
ISP in the IP Address, Subnet Mask, Router, and DNS Servers fields.
4. If your ISP uses PPPoE (Point-to-Point over Ethernet), click the PPPoE
tab to display the settings shown in Figure 1-4.
5. Mark the Connect Using PPPoE check box to enable it and then enter
the account name and password.
If your ISP includes the Service Provider name and a PPPoE Service
Name, you can enter those as well.
6. To allow everyone who uses your Mac to access the Internet with this
account, mark the Save Password check box to enable it.

I recommend that you enable the Show PPPoE Status in Menu Bar check
box. When you do, Mac OS X displays a menu bar icon that lets you
know the status of your PPPoE connection.
7. Press Ô+Q to exit System Preferences and save your changes.
If you need help entering Internet settings or you want to know more about
what you’re actually doing, I discuss these settings in depth in Book V,
Chapter 1.
Connecting with a Dialup ISP (The Hard Way)
Before you leave the serene confines of this chapter, I’d like to demonstrate
how to use the Internet Connect application to connect to your ISP via your
internal modem. (As I mention earlier in this chapter, most connections
made over a network, DSL line, or cable modem won’t need to use Internet
Connect.) You can also use this application to connect if you’re using a DSL
line with PPPoE or an AirPort connection. Many ISPs that provide high-
speed access for Macs offer PPPoE, which provides more efficient communi-
cations than the older PPP protocol that you might have used in the past.
Further, if you’re using an AirPort wireless connection, you can launch
Internet Connect to take advantage of an existing Internet connection avail-
able through your wireless network.

To be honest, I always like Mac OS X to connect automatically when I’m
using a modem — I hate excess mouse movements, which usually lead to a
bad case of Rodent Elbow. To automate your connection, follow these steps:
1. Re-open the Network settings in System Preferences and choose
Internal Modem from the Show drop-down list.
2. Select the PPP tab, click the PPP Options button, and then enable the
Connect Automatically When Needed check box.
Refer to Figure 1-2.
3. Click OK.
4. Press Ô+Q to exit System Preferences.
You can forget about using Internet Connect! (The same trick works
with PPPoE, which you can reach from the PPPoE tab on the Built-in
Ethernet settings.)
Follow these steps to connect to the Internet manually:
1. Open your Applications folder, launch the Internet Connect applica-
tion, and click the Internal Modem toolbar button, which displays the
Internal Modem dialog that you see in Figure 1-5.
2. From the Configuration drop-down list box, choose Modem Configura-
tion, Built-in Ethernet (for a DSL PPPoE connection), or AirPort.
3. Select the connection options for the hardware that you’re using:
• Modem connection: Type the telephone number provided by your
ISP into the Telephone Number text box and then type your pass-
word in the Password box (if prompted). I recommend that you
enable the Show Modem Status in Menu Bar check box, too.

• PPPoE connection: Type your password in the Password text box
(if prompted).
• AirPort connection: If you have an AirPort/AirPort Extreme card
installed, click the Turn AirPort On button (if AirPort is currently
powered off) and select the network that provides your Internet
access from the Network drop-down list box.
4. Click the Connect button, sit back, and watch the fun!
Note that you don’t have to click the Connect button if your AirPort (or
AirPort Extreme) Base Station is already connected to your ISP.

O
kay, how many of you can function without e-mail? Raise your hands.
Anyone? Anyone at all?
I suppose that I can function without my Internet e-mail, but why should I?
Mac OS X includes a very capable and reliable e-mail client, which has been
substantially improved for version 10.3 (affectionately called Panther by
everyone but Bill Gates).
In this chapter, I discuss the features of Apple Mail and show you how
everything hums at a perfect C pitch. However, you’ll have to sing out,
“You’ve got mail!” yourself. Personally, I think that’s a plus, but I show you
how you can add any sound that you like.
Know Thy Mail Window
To begin our epic e-mail journey, click the Mail icon in the Dock. Figure 2-1
illustrates the Mail window. Besides the familiar toolbar, which naturally car-
ries buttons specific to Mail, you’ll find the following:
✦Status bar: This heading bar displays information about the current
folder — typically, how many messages it contains, but other data can
be included as well. You can hide and show the Status bar from the View
menu, or you can press the Ô+Option+S keyboard shortcut to hide and
show it.

✦Message list: This resizable scrolling list box contains all the messages
for the folder that you’ve chosen. To resize the list larger or smaller,
drag the handle on the bar that runs across the window; you can also
resize the columns in the list by dragging the edges of the column head-
ing buttons.
To specify which columns appear in the message list, choose View➪
Columns. From the submenu that appears, you can toggle the display
of specific columns. You can also sort the messages in the message list
from the View menu; by default, messages are sorted by the Date
Received.
✦Drawer: The extension to the right of the main Mail window is the
Drawer. You can click any of the folders to switch the display in the 
message list. The Drawer can be hidden or shown from the View menu
by clicking the Mailboxes button on the toolbar, or you can press the
Ô+Shift+M keyboard shortcut to hide and show it. The Drawer is also
automatically hidden when you maximize the Mail window.
✦Preview box: This resizable scrolling list box displays the contents of
the selected message, including both text and any graphics or attach-
ments that Mail recognizes.
Mail uses the following folders (some of which appear only at certain times):
✦In: Mail you’ve already received.
✦Out: Messages that Mail is waiting to send.
Figure 2-1:

✦Drafts: Draft messages waiting to be completed.
✦Sent: Mail you’ve already sent.
✦Trash: Deleted mail. Like the Trash in the Dock, you can open this folder
and retrieve items that you realize you still need. Alternatively, you can
empty the contents of the Trash at any time by pressing the Ô+K short-
cut or by choosing Mailbox➪Erase Deleted Messages.
✦Junk: Junk mail. You can review these messages or retrieve anything
you want to keep by choosing Message➪Transfer. After you’re sure
there’s nothing left of value, you can delete the remaining messages
straight to the Trash.
✦Import: Messages that you’ve imported from another e-mail application,
or an earlier version of Mac OS X Mail.
You can add new personal folders to the Drawer to further organize your
messages. Choose Mailbox➪New Mailbox and then type the name for your
new folder in the Name box. Click OK to create the new personal folder.
Messages can be dragged from the message list and dropped into the desired
folder in the Drawer to transfer them. From the Message list, select the mes-
sages that you want to move, choose Message➪Transfer, and then click the
desired destination folder.
Also note that the Search box (upper-right) in the Mail toolbar looks a little
different. Click the down arrow in this field, and from the drop-down list that
appears, you can specify whether Mail should search for the text that you’ve
entered there within the entire text of a message or just in the From, To, or
Subject fields.
Setting Up Your Account
By default, Mail includes one (or more) of these accounts when you first
run it:
✦The account that you entered when you first installed Mac OS X: Go
back to the beginning — literally, Book I, Chapter 1 — to read about the
first use wizard that I discuss at the beginning of this book. If you
entered the information for an e-mail account, it’s available.
✦Your .Mac account: If you registered for a .Mac service account, it will
be included.
✦Upgraded accounts: If you upgraded an existing Mac OS system, your
existing Mail accounts will be added to the Accounts list in Mail.

Setting Up Your Account
410
Speaking of the Accounts list, choose Mail➪Preferences to display the
Accounts dialog that you see in Figure 2-2. From here, you can add an
account, edit an existing account, or remove an account from Mail. Although
most folks still have only one e-mail account, you can use a passel of them.
For example, you might use one account for your personal e-mail and one
account for your business communications. To switch accounts, just click
the account that you want to use from this list to make it the active account.
Adding an account
To add a new account within Mail, click the Add Account button, which car-
ries a plus sign (see bottom-left, Figure 2-2) to display the dialog that you
see in Figure 2-3 and then follow these steps:
1. On the Account Information panel, click the Account Type drop-down
list box and choose the protocol type to use for the account.
You can select an Apple .Mac account, a Post Office Protocol (POP)
account, a Microsoft Exchange account, or an Internet Message Access
Protocol (IMAP) account. If you’re adding an account from an Internet
service provider (ISP), refer to the set-up information that you received
to determine which is right. Most ISP accounts are POP accounts.
2. In the Description field, name the account to identify it within Mail
and then press Tab to move to the next field.
For example, Work or Mom’s ISP are good choices.
3. In the Email Address field, type the e-mail address supplied by your
ISP and then press Tab to move to the next field.
Figure 2-2:

Accounts
list, where

clear (about

4. In the Full Name field, type your full name — or, if this is to be an
anonymous account, enter whatever you like as your identity — and
then press Tab.
Messages that you send will appear with this name in the From field in
the recipient’s e-mail application.
5. If you’re entering a POP or IMAP account: In the Incoming Mail
Server field, type the name of the incoming mail server (supplied by
your ISP) and then press Tab.
6. In the User Name field, type the user name supplied by your ISP for
login to your e-mail account and then press Tab.
This is sometimes different from the username and password that you
use to connect to the Internet.
7. In the Password field, type the password supplied by your ISP for
login to your e-mail account.
Again, this might be different from your connection password.
8. Click the Outgoing Mail Server drop-down list box; if the outgoing
server appears in this list, select it.
This is often the case if you’re adding another new account provided by
your ISP.
If the outgoing mail server doesn’t appear in the list, click Add Server in
the list, enter the server address provided by your ISP in the Server
Options dialog, and then click OK to return.

Luckily, the defaults for the Outgoing Mail Server settings will work like a
charm for 99 percent of us. However, if your ISP or network administra-
tor tells you that you must make changes to your outgoing mail server
settings, click the Server Settings button (either while adding or editing
an account). You can specify a port number, toggle Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL) support, and select your authentication type. Because all that stuff
sounds like a medieval Gregorian chant to most computer owners, just
enter these server settings if you’re told to do so.
9. Click OK.
You’re done! The new account appears in the Accounts list.
You can specify advanced settings for an account. I cover those in the sec-
tion “Fine-Tuning Your Post Office,” later in this chapter.
Editing an existing account
Need to make changes to an existing account? Choose Mail➪Preferences
and click the account that you want to change. Mail displays the same set-
tings that I explain in the previous section.
Deleting an account
If you change ISPs or you decide to drop an e-mail account, you can remove
it from your Accounts list. Otherwise, Mail can annoy you with error mes-
sages when it can no longer connect to the server for that account. Display
the Mail Preferences window, select the account that you want to delete,
and then click the Remove button (which is graced by a minus sign).
Naturally, Mail will request confirmation before deleting the folders associ-
ated with that account. Click OK to verify the deletion or click the Cancel
button to prevent accidental catastrophe.
Receiving and Reading E-Mail Wisdom
The heart and soul of Mail — well, at least the heart, anyway — is receiving
and reading stuff from your friends and family. (Later in this chapter, I show
you how to avoid the stuff you get promising free prizes, low mortgage rates,
and improved . . . um . . . performance. This is a family-oriented book, so
that’s enough of that.)
After you set up an account (or select an account from the Accounts list),
it’s time to check for mail. Use any of these methods to check for new mail:

Book IV
Chapter 2
Using Apple Mail
Receiving and Reading E-Mail Wisdom
413
✦Click the Get Mail button on the toolbar.
✦Choose Mailbox➪Get New Mail in All Accounts or press Ô+Shift+N.
✦Choose Mailbox➪Get New Mail and then choose the specific account to
check from the submenu.
This is a great way to check for new mail in another account without
going through the trouble of making it active in the Preferences window.
Mail can also check for new messages automatically — more on this in the
upcoming section “Checking Mail automatically.”
If you do have new mail in the active account, it appears in the Message list
(and the Mail icon in the Dock sports a bright red number indicating how
many new messages you’ve received). As you can see in Figure 2-4, new
unread messages appear marked with a dot (it’s blue) in the first column.
The number of unread messages is displayed next to the In folder icon in
the Drawer.
Mail also displays the number of new messages that you’ve received on its
Dock icon. If you’ve hidden the Mail window or sent it to the Dock, you can
perform a quick visual check for new mail just by glancing at the Dock.

Reading and deleting your messages
To read any message in the message list, you can either click the desired
entry (which displays the contents of the message in the preview box) or
you can double-click the entry to open the message in a separate message
window, complete with its own toolbar controls.
To quickly scan your mail, click the first message that you want to view in
the list, and then press the down-arrow key when you’re ready to move to
the next message. Mail displays the content of each message in the preview
box. To display the previous message in the list, press the up-arrow key.
The latest version of Mail allows you to read your messages grouped within
threads. A thread contains an original message and all related replies, which
makes it easy to follow the flow of an e-mail discussion (without bouncing
around within your Inbox, searching for the next message in the conversa-
tion). Choose View➪Organize by Thread, and the replies in the current
folder are all grouped under the original messages and sorted by date. To
expand a thread, click the original message to select it; then press the right-
arrow key (or choose View➪Expand All Threads). To collapse a thread,
select the original message and press the left-arrow key (or choose
View➪Collapse All Threads).
To delete a message from the message list, click the desired entry to select
it and then click the Delete button in the toolbar (or press the Del key). To
delete a message from within a message window, click the Delete button in
the toolbar.
Replying to mail
What? Aunt Harriet sent you a message because she’s forgotten where she
parked her car last night? If you happen to know where her priceless ’78
Pinto is, you can reply to her and save her the trouble of retracing her steps.
Displaying all Mail headers
Mail actually hides the majority of the heading
lines that help identify and route an e-mail mes-
sage to its rightful destination. By default, all
you’ll see is the filtered heading, which includes
only the From, Date, To, and Subject fields. This
is great unless for some reason you need to dis-
play the entire message header in all its arcane
madness. If you do, press Ô+Shift+H. You can
toggle back to the filtered heading by pressing
the same shortcut.

Book IV
Chapter 2
Using Apple Mail
Receiving and Reading E-Mail Wisdom
415
If Aunt Harriet isn’t in your Address Book yet, this is a good time to add her.
With the message entry selected in the list, choose Message➪Add Sender to
Address Book or just press the convenient Ô+Y keyboard shortcut. The
person’s name and e-mail address are automatically added to your Address
Book. To add more information in the Address Book, however, you have to
open that application separately. (Read through Book I, Chapter 5 for the
skinny on the Address Book.)
To reply to a message in Mail, follow these steps:
1. To respond to a message from the message list, click the desired mes-
sage entry and then click the Reply button on the toolbar.
To respond to a message that you’ve opened in a message window, click
the Reply button on the toolbar for the message window.
If a message was addressed not just to you but also to a number of dif-
ferent people, you can send your reply to all of them. Instead of clicking
the Reply button, click the Reply All button on the Mail window toolbar.
(This is a great way to quickly facilitate a festive gathering, if you get
my drift.)
You can also add carbon copies of your message to other new recipi-
ents, expanding the party exponentially; more on carbon copies later in
the section “Raise the Little Flag: Sending E-Mail.”
If you’d like to send your reply under a different account, click the
Account drop-down list box and choose the account — this is a handy
method of re-routing a message that you received with your home
e-mail account to your office account.
Mail opens the Reply window that you see in Figure 2-5. Note that the
address has been automatically added and that the default Subject is Re:
<the original subject>. Mail automatically adds a separator line in the mes-
sage body field that reads On <day><date>at<time>, <addressee>
wrote:, followed by the text of the original message; this is done so that
the addressee can remember what the heck he or she wrote in the first
place to get you so happy/sad/angry/indifferent. The original text is
indented and colored blue to set it apart. If you like, you can click in the
Subject line and change the default subject line; otherwise, the cursor is
already sitting on the first line of the text box, so you can simply start
typing your reply.
2. After you complete typing your reply, you can select text in the mes-
sage body and apply different fonts or formatting.
To change your reply’s formatting, click the Fonts button on the mes-
sage window toolbar. From the window that appears, you can choose the

Receiving and Reading E-Mail Wisdom
416
font family, the type size, and formatting such as italic or bold for the
selected text. Click the Close button on the Fonts window to continue.
(If you like menus, you can also choose Format from the menu and make
changes from there.)
To apply color to the selected text, click the Colors button on the mes-
sage window toolbar and then click anywhere in the color wheel that
appears to select that color. You can also vary the hue by moving the
slider bar at the right of the Colors window. After you find the color that
expresses your inner passion, click the Close button on the Colors
window to continue.
3. To add an attachment, click the Attach button on the toolbar.
Mail displays a familiar file Open dialog. Navigate to the to-be-attached
file, select it, and click the Open button to add it to the message. (More
on attachments in the upcoming section “Attachments on Parade.”)
4. When you’re ready to send your reply, you have two options. You can
click the Send button to immediately add the message to your Out
folder, or you can click the Save As Draft button to store it in your
Drafts folder for later editing.
After a message is moved to the Out folder, it is sent either immediately
or at the next connection time that you specify in Mail Preferences
(more on this in the section “Checking Mail automatically,” later in the
chapter). However, saving the message to your Drafts folder will not
send it. Read the next section for the skinny on how to send a message
stored in your Drafts folder.

Chapter 2

When you reply to a message, you can also forward your reply to another
person (instead of the original sender). The new addressee receives a mes-
sage containing both the text of the original message that you received and
your reply. To forward a message, click the Forward button on the Mail tool-
bar instead of Reply or Reply to All.
If you don’t want to include the text of the original message in a reply, choose
Mail➪Preferences➪Composing and disable the Quote the Text of the Original
Message check box.
By default, Mail checks your spelling as you type and also underlines any
words that it doesn’t recognize. (Very Microsoftian.) I like this feature, but
if you find it irritating, you can turn it off. Just choose Mail➪Preferences➪
Composing and disable the Check Spelling as I Type check box.
Hey, what does MIME mean?
First, a note of explanation about Internet
e-mail. (Don’t worry about notes; you won’t be
tested on this stuff.) Decades back, Internet
e-mail messages were pure text, composed
only of ASCII characters — that means no
fancy fonts, colors, or text formatting. However,
as more and more folks started using e-mail, the
clarion call rang forth across the land for more
attractive messages (as well as attachments,
which I cover in the section “Attachments on
Parade”). Therefore, the MIME encoding stan-
dard was developed. In case you’re interested,
MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions — a rather cool (and surprisingly
understandable) acronym.
Originally, virtually all e-mail programs recog-
nized MIME, but then the Tower of Babel prin-
ciple kicked in, and now there are actually
multiple versions of MIME. Apple Mail uses the
most common variant of MIME, so most folks
who receive your e-mail should be able to see
them in all their glory (even under Windows).
However, if one of your addressees complains
that he got a message containing unrecogniz-
able gobbledygook and a heading that mentions
MIME, he’s using an e-mail client application
that either doesn’t support MIME or supports a
different version. (Of course, that person could
have unknowingly turned MIME support off as
well.) You have two possible solutions: You can
ask the addressee to double-check whether
MIME is enabled on his end in their e-mail appli-
cation, or you can disable MIME when sending
a message to that particular person. When
you’re composing an original message or a
reply, you can use pure text by choosing
Format➪Make Plain Text. (Naturally, this pre-
vents you from doing anything fancy, and files
that you attach to a plain text message might
not be delivered correctly.)

Raise the Little Flag: Sending E-Mail

Raise the Little Flag: Sending E-Mail
To compose and send a new message to someone else, follow these steps:
1. Click the New button on the Mail toolbar or choose File➪New
Message (or avail yourself of the handy Ô+N keyboard shortcut).
Mail opens the New Message window that you see in Figure 2-6.
2. Enter the recipient’s (To) address by
• Typing it in directly
• Pasting it in after copying it to the Clipboard
• Dragging an e-mail address from your Address Book
• Or (my favorite) clicking the Address button, which shows you the
scaled-down version of the Address Book (the Addresses window)
that you see in Figure 2-7
From the Addresses window, click the address that you want to use and
then click the To button. To pick multiple recipients, hold down the
Shift key while you click the multiple addresses. Click the Close button
on the Addresses window to close it and then press Tab.
If you’ve got a huge number of entries in your Address Book, use the
Search field on the Addresses window toolbar, which operates just like
the Finder window Search box.

3. When Mail highlights the Cc field (the spot where you can send
optional carbon copies of the message to additional recipients), you
can type the addresses directly, use the contents of the Clipboard, or
display the Addresses window.
If you use the Addresses window, select the addresses that you want to
use and click the Cc button. Then click the Close button on the
Addresses window and press Tab.
Looking for the Blind Carbon Copy field? To display it, choose View➪
Bcc Header. (A blind carbon copy is a message sent to multiple recipi-
ents, just like a regular carbon copy, but the recipients aren’t listed
when the message is displayed — that way, the other recipients won’t
know who else got a copy of the message.)
4. In the Subject field, enter the subject of the message and then
press Tab.
Your text cursor now rests in the first line of the message text box —
type, my friend, type like the wind! It’s considered good form to keep
this line short and relatively to the point.
5. When you’re done typing your message, select any of the text that
you’ve entered and use the toolbar features I describe in the earlier
section “Replying to mail” to apply different fonts or formatting.
Click the Fonts button in the message window toolbar to open a window
of formatting choices. (Click its Close button to continue.) If you like
menus, you can also click Format and make changes from there.

6. Add color to any selected text, if you like.
Just click the Colors button in the message window toolbar and make
choices there; when the hue is perfect, click the Close button on the
Colors window to continue.
7. To add an attachment, click the Attach button on the toolbar, navi-
gate to the to-be-attached file in the dialog that appears, select the
file, and then click Open to add it to the message.
8. When your new message is ready to post, either click the Send button
to immediately add the message to your Out folder or click the Save
As Draft button to store it in your Drafts folder (without actually send-
ing it).
To send a message held in your Drafts folder, click the Drafts folder in the
Drawer to display all draft messages. Double-click the message that you
want to send, which will display the message window — you can make edits
at this point, if you like — and then click the Send button on the message
window toolbar.
If you don’t have access to an Internet connection at the moment, Mail
allows you to work off-line. This way, you can read your unread messages
and compose new ones on the road to send later. After you regain your
Internet connection, you might need to choose Mailbox➪Online Status➪
Go Online (depending on the connection type).
What? You Get Junk Mail, Too?
Spam — it’s the Crawling Crud of the Internet, and I hereby send out a lifetime
of bad karma to those who spew it. However, chucking the First Amendment
is not an option, so I guess we’ll always have junk mail. (Come to think of it,
my paper mailbox is just as full of the stuff.)
Thankfully, the latest version of Apple Mail has a net that you can cast to
collect junk mail before you have to read it. The two methods of handling
junk mail are
✦Manually: You can mark any message in the message list as Junk Mail.
Select the unwanted flotsam in the message list and then click the Junk
button on the Mail window toolbar, which marks the message as you
see in Figure 2-8. (Ocean-front property in Kansas . . . yeah, right.) If a
message is mistakenly marked as junk but you actually want it, display
the message in the preview box and then click the Not Junk button at
the top of the preview box.

Book IV
Chapter 2
Using Apple Mail
What? You Get Junk Mail, Too?
421
✦Automatically: Apple Mail has a sophisticated Junk Mail filter that you
actually train to better recognize what’s junk. (Keep reading to discover
how.) After you train Mail to recognize spam with a high degree of accu-
racy, turn it to full Automatic mode, and it will move all those worthless
messages to your Junk folder.
You customize and train the Junk Mail filter from the Preferences dialog
(available from your trusty Mail menu); click Junk Mail to show the settings.
By default, Mail starts in Training mode, using the When Junk Mail Arrives,
Leave It in My Inbox option. This means that it takes its best shot at deter-
mining what’s junk. When you receive more mail and mark more messages
as junk (or mark them as not junk), you’re actually teaching the Junk Mail
feature how to winnow the wheat from the chaff. In Training mode, junk
messages are not actually moved anywhere — they’re just marked with a
particularly fitting, grungy brown color.
After you’re satisfied that the Junk Mail filter is catching just about every-
thing that it can, display this submenu and choose the Move It to the Junk
Mailbox (Automatic) option. Mail creates a Junk folder and prompts you for
permission to move all junk messages to this folder. After you review every-
thing in the Junk folder, you can delete what it contains and send it to the
Trash folder. To save a message from junkdom, click the Not Junk button in
the preview window and then drag the message from the Junk folder mes-
sage list to the desired folder in the Drawer.
Figure 2-8:
“Be gone,
demons of
Junk Mail!”

Attachments on Parade
422
If you don’t receive a lot of spam — or you want to be absolutely sure that
nothing gets labeled as junk until you review it — then display the Junk Mail
submenu and then choose the Off menu item.
By default, Mail now exempts certain messages from Junk Mail status based
on three criteria: if the sender is in your Address Book, if you’ve sent the
sender a message in the past, or if the message is addressed to you with
your full name. To tighten up your Junk Mail filtering to the max, you might
want to disable these check boxes as well.
To reset the Junk Mail filter and erase any training that you’ve done, choose
Junk Mail➪Reset. Then click the Yes button to confirm your choice. To dis-
play the Junk rule and edit it if necessary, choose Junk Mail➪Advanced.
(I discuss filtering rules at length at the end of this chapter.)
Attachments on Parade
Attachments are a fun way to transfer files through e-mail. However, remem-
bering these three very important caveats is imperative:
✦Attachments can contain viruses. Even a message attachment that was
actually sent by your best friend can contain a virus — either because
your friend unwittingly passed one along or because the virus actually
took control of your friend’s e-mail application and replicated itself
automatically. (Ugh.)
Is it a Mark’s Maxim, or is it a dire warning? (It’s both!)
Never send or receive attachments unless you have an up-to-date
antivirus scanning application running.™
✦Corpulent attachments don’t make it. Most corporate and ISP mail
servers have a 1–3MB limit for the total size of a message — and the
attachment counts toward that final message size. Therefore, I recom-
mend sending a file as an attachment only if it’s less than 1MB (or 
perhaps 2MB) in size. If the recipient’s e-mail server sends you an auto-
mated message saying that the message was refused because it was too
big, this is the problem.
✦Not all e-mail applications and firewalls accept attachments. Not all
e-mail programs support attachments in the same way, and others are
simply set for pure text messages. Some corporate firewalls even reject
messages with attachments. If the message recipient gets the message
text but not the attachment, these are the likely reasons.
With that said, it’s back to attachments as a beneficial feature. Follow these
steps to save an attachment that you receive:

Book IV
Chapter 2
Using Apple Mail
Fine-Tuning Your Post Office
423
1. Click the message with an attachment in your message list.
Having trouble determining which messages have attachments? Choose
View➪Columns and then click the Attachments item from the submenu
that appears to toggle it on. Now messages with attachments appear
with a tiny paper clip icon in the entry.
If Mail recognizes the attachment format, it displays or plays the attach-
ment in the body of the message; if not, the attachment is displayed as a
file icon.
2. To open an attachment that’s displayed as a file icon, hold down
Control, click the file icon, and then choose Open Attachment from
the pop-up menu that appears.
If you know what application should be used to open the attachment,
click the Open With button and choose the correct application from the
submenu that appears.
3. To save an attachment, hold down Control, click the attachment (how-
ever it appears in the message), and then choose Save Attachment
from the pop-up menu.
In the Save dialog that appears, navigate to the location where you want
to save the file and then click Save.
Fine-Tuning Your Post Office
Like all other Apple software, Mail is easily customized to your liking. In this
section, I discuss some of the preferences that you might want to change.
Adding sound
To choose a sound that plays whenever you receive new mail, choose Mail➪
Preferences➪General. Either click the New Mail Sound drop-down list box and
choose one of the sounds that Apple provides or choose Add/Remove from
the drop-down list to choose a sound file from the Sounds folder (which, in
turn, is located within your Library folder). Choose None from the drop-down
list to disable the new mail sound altogether.
Checking Mail automatically
By default, Mail automatically checks for new mail (and sends any mail in
your Out folder) every five minutes. To change this delay period, display the
General panel in the Preferences dialog, choose the Check for New Mail
drop-down list box, and then choose one of the time periods. To disable
automatic mail checking, choose Manually; you can click the Get Mail tool-
bar button to manually check your mail any time you like.

Fine-Tuning Your Post Office
424
Automating message deletion
If you like, Mail can be set to automatically delete sent mail and Junk mes-
sages (as well as permanently erase messages that you relegate to the Trash).
To configure these settings, display the Accounts list in the Preferences
window, click the desired account, and then click the Special Mailboxes tab.
To delete Sent messages automatically, enable the Erase Copies of Sent
Messages When drop-down list box and choose the delay period or action.
You can choose to delete mail after a day, a week, a month, or immediately
upon quitting Mail. Alternatively, you can leave this field set to Never, and
Mail will never automatically delete any messages from the Sent folder.
To delete Junk messages automatically, click the Erase Messages in the Junk
Mailbox When drop-down list box and choose the delay period or action.
(They’re the same as the options available for Sent mail.)
To delete messages from the Trash, click the Erase Deleted Messages When
drop-down list box and choose the delay period or action — again, the
choices are the same as those for Sent messages.
Adding signatures
To add a block of text or a graphic to the bottom of your messages as your
personal signature, follow these steps:
1. Choose Mail➪Preferences➪Signatures.
2. From the Signatures pane that appears, click the Add Signature button.
3. Type a descriptive name for the signature in the Description box and
then press Tab.
4. Type the signature itself in the text entry box or copy the signature to
the Clipboard and paste it into the text entry box.
Because downloading a graphic in a signature takes long — and because
some folks still use plain text e-mail — avoid the temptation to include
large graphics in your signature.
If you enter a block of formatted text, click the Make Plain Text button
to reduce those fancy fonts to plain text.
5. Click OK to save the signature.
6. If you have multiple signatures, click the Automatically Insert
Signature drop-down list to choose which one you want to use or to
use them all randomly or in sequence.
If you use specific signatures for different subjects, you can also enable the
Show Signature Menu on Compose Window check box, which allows you to
switch signatures from the Compose window.

Changing the status of an account
Sometimes you won’t be able to reach one of your accounts. For example,
maybe you’re on the road with your laptop and you’re unable to access your
office network. Apple Mail allows you to enable and disable specific accounts
without the hassle of deleting an account and then having to add it again.
To disable or enable an account, choose Preferences➪Accounts and click
the desired account; click the Advanced tab and then enable (or clear) the
Enable This Account check box as necessary.
If you disable an account, you should also disable the Include When
Automatically Checking for New Mail check box to make sure that Mail 
doesn’t display an error message. You can always check any account for
new mail by choosing Mailbox➪Get New Mail and then choosing the desired
account name from the submenu.
Automating Your Mail with Rules
Before I leave the beautiful shores of Mail Island — “GILLIGAN!” — I’d be
remiss if I didn’t discuss one of its most powerful features: the ability to
create rules, which are automated actions that Mail can take. With rules, you
can specify criteria that can perform actions such as
✦Transferring messages from one folder to another
✦Forwarding messages to another address
✦Highlighting or deleting messages
To set up a rule, follow these steps:
1. Choose Mail➪Preferences and then click the Rules button on the 
toolbar.
Mail displays the Rules dialog, as shown in Figure 2-9.
Figure 2-9:
The
Rules list.

Automating Your Mail with Rules

2. To duplicate an existing rule, highlight it in the list and then click the
Duplicate button. (For this demonstration, however, create a rule
from scratch by clicking the Add Rule button.)
3. In the Description field, type a descriptive name for the new rule and
then press Tab to move to the next field.
4. Click the If drop-down list to specify whether the rule will be trig-
gered if any of the conditions are met or whether all conditions must
be met.
5. Because each rule requires at least one condition, click the target
drop-down list boxes to see the target for the condition.
These include whom the message is from or to, which account received
the message, whether the message is marked as junk, and whether the
message contains certain content. Select the target for the condition.
6. Click the Criteria drop-down list box to choose the rule’s criteria.
The contents of this drop-down list box change depending on the condi-
tion’s target. For example, if you choose From as the target, the criteria
include Contains, Does Not Contain, Begins With, and so forth.
7. Click in the expression box and type the text to use for the condition.
For example, a completed condition might read
Subject Contains Ocean-Front
This particular condition will be true if I get an e-mail message with a
subject that contains the string Ocean-Front.
8. Add more conditions by clicking the plus sign button at the right of
the first condition.
To remove any condition from this rule, click the minus sign button next
to it. Remember, however, that every rule needs at least one condition.
9. To specify what actions will be taken after the condition (or condi-
tions) has been met, click the first Perform the Following Actions
drop-down list box to see the action that this rule should perform.
Then click the second drop-down list box and then select the action
for the rule.
Choices include transferring a message from one folder to another, play-
ing a sound, automatically forwarding the message, deleting it, and
marking it as read.
Each rule requires at least one action.

Book IV
Chapter 2

Automating Your Mail with Rules

10. Depending on the action that you select, specify one or more criteria
for the action.
For instance, if I select Set Color as my action, I must then choose
whether to color the text or the background as well as what color
to use.
Like the plus button next to the conditions, you can also click the plus
button next to the first action to perform more than one action. To
remove an action, click the minus button next to it.
11. When the rule is complete, click OK to save it.
Here’s an example of a complex rule:
If the message were sent by someone in my Address Book AND the
Subject field contains the text FORWARD ME, forward the message to
the e-mail address fuadramses@mac.com.
This is a good example of an automated forwarding rule. With this rule in
place and Mail running on Mac OS X, any of my friends, family, or co-workers
can forward urgent e-mail to my .Mac account while I’m on vacation. To trig-
ger the rule, all the sender has to do is include the words FORWARD ME in the
message subject. And if the sender isn’t in my Address Book, the rule doesn’t
trigger, and I can read the message when I get home. Mondo sassy.
Each rule in the Rules dialog can be enabled or disabled by toggling the
Active check box next to the rule. You can also edit a rule by selecting it in
the Rules dialog and then clicking the Edit button. To delete a rule com-
pletely from the list, select it and then click the Remove button; Mail will
prompt you for confirmation before the deed is done.

 Setting up iChat AV

 Adding Buddies
 Inviting a Buddy to chat
 Sending an Instant Message
 Sending and receiving files via iChat AV
 Ignoring those who deserve to be shunned
T
hroughout man’s history, our drive has been towards communication —
from the earliest cave paintings, through written language, to the tele-
graph, the telephone, and the cellular all-in-one PDA that the guy in the
SUV in front of you is using . . . and he’s arguing with someone and he’s not
paying attention and . . . (whump).
So much for the learned and scholarly introduction — forget that silly cellu-
lar phone and your complicated calling plan! As long as you have Mac OS X
and an Internet connection, you can instantly chat with your friends and
family whether they’re across the aisle in another cube or halfway across
the world — and, by golly, if you both have a Web cam or DV camcorder
connected to your computers, you’ll see each other in glorious, full-color
video! This modern marvel is iChat AV, and it fulfills the decades-old promise
of the video telephone quite well, thank you.
In this chapter, I show you how to gab with the following folks:
✦Others who use iChat AV (either on your local network or on the
Internet)
✦Anyone who uses AIM — that’s short for America Online (AOL) Instant
Messaging
✦Folks who participate in AOL chat rooms

Configuring iChat
430
Configuring iChat
When you first run iChat AV, you’ll see the dialog shown in Figure 3-1. Type
the first name (your name) that you want to use in the First Name field,
press Tab, and then type the surname that you want to use. (Yes, you can
even use Bullwinkle Moose — just leave out the middle initial J.)
By default, iChat AV uses the .Mac account that you set up when you first
installed Mac OS X. In this case, your .Mac Account Name and Password are
automatically entered for you, and you’re good to go. However, if you’re
already using AIM and you’d like to use your existing AIM account, click the
Account Type drop-down list and choose AIM; then enter your AIM name
and password instead.
iChat will also ask whether you’d like to enable Rendezvous messaging. As
you can read in Chapter 1, Book V, think of Rendezvous as plug-and-play for
your local network. In iChat, Rendezvous messaging displays a separate
window where you can see (and yak with) anyone on your local network
without having to know his iChat name — that’s because Rendezvous auto-
matically announces all the iChat AV users who are available on your net-
work. If you have others using iChat AV or AIM on your local network, go for
this option; if you’re not connected to a local network, however, Rendezvous
messaging isn’t necessary. Also, if you’re on a public AirPort/AirPort
Extreme network or if you’re connecting to the Internet with a modem
through dialup, I recommend disabling Rendezvous messaging. (For all
that’s cool about AirPort and its faster sibling AirPort Extreme, see Book V,
Chapter 4.)
After you finish these configuration necessities, iChat AV displays the Buddy
List window (or, if you enabled Rendezvous messaging, two windows) that
you see in Figure 3-2. Remember that your Rendezvous window displays
only those iChat AV folks on your local network.

A few things to note here about the Buddy List window:
✦If you don’t like your picture, don’t panic. By default, iChat AV uses
your user account thumbnail image as your visual persona. However,
you can add a picture to your iChat iDentity — sorry, I couldn’t resist
that — by dragging an image to the well next to your name at the top of
the Buddy List window. If necessary, iChat AV will ask you to position
and size the image so that it will fit in the (admittedly limited) space.
This picture is then sent along with your words when you chat. In later
figures for this chapter, I borrow the smiling face of Wolfgang Amadeus
Mozart.
Click your image to display your recent thumbnails — this way, you can
even use a different thumbnail image for each of your many moods.
(Geez.) Also, you can click Edit Picture from the pop-up menu and cap-
ture a new thumbnail with your Web/DV camera.
✦Check out the buttons along the bottom of the window(s). In order,
these buttons are
• Add a New Buddy (which I cover in the next section)
• Start a Text Chat (plain, old-fashioned chatting via the keyboard)
Figure 3-2:
iChat AV
and
Rendezvous:

tion at its

Configuring iChat
432
• Start an Audio Chat (chatting with your voice, using microphones)
• Start a Video Chat (the ultimate chat, where the parties can both
see and hear each other)
Using these buttons can handle about 90 percent of the commands
that you need to give while using iChat AV, so use ’em! (Note that the
Rendezvous window doesn’t have an Add a New Buddy button because
the Buddy List in the Rendezvous window is automatically populated by
other iChat AV folks on your local network.)
✦Hey, look, there’s a new menu bar icon! When you’re running iChat AV,
the application adds a balloon menu bar icon next to the clock display
in the upper-right corner of your screen. Click it to display the options
that you see in Figure 3-3. You can change your online/offline status,
immediately invite a Buddy for a chat, or display the Buddy List (which
I discuss later in the section “Will You Be My Buddy?”).

433
Changing Modes in iChat AV
To launch iChat AV, you can click its icon from the Dock or launch it from its
iChat AV application icon (which you’ll find in your Applications folder). Or,
you can click its menu bar icon, which is grayed out when you’re offline. If
you’re not already familiar with the terms online and offline, here’s the
scoop: When you’re online, folks can invite you to chat and communicate
with you. When you’re offline, you’re disconnected: iChat AV isn’t active,
you can’t be paged, and you can’t chat.
Even when you’re offline, you can choose Available from the friendly balloon
menu bar icon, which will automatically switch iChat AV to online mode. Or
you can click a Buddy name directly, which will automatically switch iChat
AV to online mode and open the paging window for that Buddy. (Naturally,
you have to have the proper network or Internet connection first.)
You can use another mode, Away, whenever iChat AV is running and you’re
still online but not available. For example, if I’m away from my Mac for a few
minutes, I leave iChat AV running but I switch myself to Away mode. My
Buddies get a message saying that I’m Away, so they won’t bother trying to
contact me. When I return to my computer, I simply move my mouse, and
iChat AV intelligently inquires as to whether I’d like to return to Available
mode. You can also use the menu bar icon to switch from Away to Available
(or my other favorite mode, Twiddling My Thumbs). Refer to Figure 3-3 to see
these choices.
Speaking of modes, you, too, can create a custom mode — like Bored stiff!
or Listening to the Pointy-Haired Boss — and use it instead of the somewhat
mundane choices of Available and Away. To do this, display the Buddy List
window, click the word Available beneath your name (refer to Figure 3-2),
and a drop-down list appears. To choose an existing mode, click it; modes
with a green bullet are online modes, and red bullet modes are offline
modes. Click the Custom menu item for either color to open an edit box;
type the new mode there and then press Return. The new mode is automati-
cally added to your mode list. You can also switch modes from this drop-
down list.
Will You Be My Buddy?
I know that question sounds a little personal, but in iChat AV, a Buddy is
anyone whom you want to chat with, whether the topic is work related or
your personal life. iChat AV keeps track of your Buddies in the Buddy List.
You can also add them to your Address Book or use the AIM entry in an
Address Book contact to generate a new Buddy identity.

Will You Be My Buddy?
434
To add a new Buddy, follow these steps:
1. Choose iChat➪Buddies➪Add a Buddy, or click the Add a New Buddy
button at the bottom of the iChat AV window, or press Ô+Shift+A.
iChat AV displays the sheet that you see in Figure 3-4.
2. To create a Buddy entry from an Address Book contact who has an
Instant Messaging username, click the entry to select it, and then
click the Select Buddy button.
3. To add a brand-new person who’s not already in your Address Book,
click the New Person button to display the sheet that you see in
Figure 3-5.
4. In this new sheet, select the proper account type (either .Mac or AIM),
press Tab, and then type the person’s Instant Messaging account name.
If you like, you can also add your own picture to represent that person
(instead of using the icon that he provides). Just locate the image file
that you want to use within a Finder window and drag the image to the
Buddy Icon well.
You can also optionally enter the person’s real name and e-mail address,
and iChat AV obligingly creates an entry in your Address Book for your
new Buddy.

5. Click Add to save the Buddy information.
Even when you add a new Buddy and that name appears in the Buddy List,
don’t be surprised if the name actually fades out after a few seconds — that
indicates that the person is offline and unavailable. You can also tell when a
person is available if her name appears with a green bullet in the Buddy List.
You can also specify a number of actions that iChat AV should take if a
Buddy logs in or out of Instant Messaging, or if a Buddy changes his or her
status to Available. To display these actions, click the desired Buddy’s entry
in your Buddy List and then press Ô+Shift+I. Click the drop-down list box
at the top of the Info dialog, click Actions, and then choose the event that
should trigger the action from the Event drop-down list. Enable the desired
check box to specify whether iChat AV should play the sound that you
select, speak a line of text, and/or bounce the iChat AV icon in the Dock.
Chat! Chat, I Say!
Turn your attention to getting the attention of others — through inviting
others to chat. You don’t have to actually invite someone to chat. For exam-
ple, you can send an Instant Message just by double-clicking the desired
entry in the Buddy List. However, good chatting etiquette implies inviting
someone to a conversation rather than barging in unannounced. Also, using
the invitation method opens a true chat window, which makes it easier to
engage in longer conversations.
If you want to join an AIM chat already in progress, choose File➪Go to Chat
(or press Ô+G). Depending on the service being used, you might have to
specify both the type of chat and the specific chat room name.
At this point, it’s time to draw your attention to the green phone and video
icons next to each person in your Buddy List (as well as next to your own
name at the top of the list). If the green phone icon appears next to both
your name and your buddy’s name, you can enjoy a two-way audio (or
voice) chat. If both you and your buddy are lucky enough to have FireWire
Web cams or DV cameras connected to your Macs, you can jump into a real-
time, two-way video chat, complete with audio. Apple’s offering, the iSight
camera, is probably the best-known (and best-looking) FireWire camera on
the market.
If your Mac has a microphone or video camera hooked up but you don’t see
these icons, click the Audio menu and make sure that the Microphone
Enabled and Camera Enabled menu items are selected.
To invite someone, click the desired Buddy from the Buddy List, click
Buddies, and then choose Invite to Chat (or press Ô+Option+C). You can

Chat! Chat, I Say!
436
also click directly on the phone or camera icon next to the person’s name
in your Buddy List. iChat AV displays the Group Chat window that you see
in Figure 3-6, which also doubles as an Invitation window.
You can invite additional Buddies to enter the chat by clicking the plus
button at the bottom left of the Participants list and choosing another
Buddy.
Type your invitation text into the entry box at the bottom of the window. If
you’d like to use bold or italic text, highlight the text and press Ô+B for Bold
(B) or Ô+I for Italic (I). You can also add a Smiley face to your invitation
text: Click in the desired spot in the text, click the Smiley button to the right
of the text entry field, and then choose the proper Smiley from the list. To
send the invitation text, press Return.
The recipient of your chat invitation can decline or accept your chat invita-
tion. You’ll be notified (as delicately as possible) if the chat has been declined.
To invite a buddy to an audio chat, select that person in the Buddy List,
click the Buddies menu, and then choose Invite to Audio Chat (or One-Way
Audio Chat, if only one of you has a microphone). A video invitation works
in a similar fashion: Click Buddies and choose either Invite to Video Chat or
Invite to One-Way Video Chat, depending on the hardware available.
If the chat is accepted, iChat AV displays a message saying that the Buddy
whom you invited has joined the chat, and you now can begin the chat. You
don’t have to alternate sending messages back and forth between partici-
pants — everyone in a chat can compose and send messages at the same
time — but I personally like to alternate when I’m chatting one-on-one. See
the volley in Figure 3-7. By the way, you might notice that AIM users are rep-
resented by the AIM “Running Dude” icon (unless they change it, or you
assign an icon picture of your own as I describe in the previous section).

You can resize the Chat window by using the handle at the bottom-right
corner, just like most other application windows in Mac OS X.
As you can see in Figure 3-8, you can change fonts and colors while compos-
ing a line of text. Simply select the text and then choose Format➪Show
Fonts and Format➪Show Colors (or press Ô+T and Ô+Shift+C) to display
the Fonts and Colors windows, respectively. These windows can be resized

Sending Files with iChat AV
438
To save the discussion in a chat, choose File➪Save a Copy As. In the dialog
that appears, type a name for the chat file, select a location where you want
to store the file, and then click Save. To automatically save transcripts of all
your chats, choose iChat➪Preferences and click Messages; then select the
Automatically Save Chat Transcripts check box to enable it. To specify
where the transcripts should be saved, click the Open Folder button.
When the iChat AV window is active, a number of display choices can be
made from the View menu, including
✦Show as Text: Each line that you write and receive in a chat can be dis-
played in balloons, just like your favorite comic — the default — or as
simple text.
✦Show Names and Pictures: Each line can be displayed with the individ-
ual’s picture, just the name, or both the name and picture.
✦Background display: Choose the Set Chat Background menu item to
choose a graphic to use for the Chat window. To return to the original
appearance, choose the Clear Background menu item.
Click the Buddy List, and the View menu offers a different set of controls:
You can sort your Buddy List by first name, last name, or availability, and
you can also toggle the display of offline Buddies. These options are also
available from the Buddy List toolbar.
To close a chat, click the Close button on the Chat window.
Sending Files with iChat AV
To send a file to a Buddy, click the desired entry in the Buddy List and then
choose Buddies➪Send a File, use the Ô+Option+F keyboard shortcut, or
drag the file from a Finder window to the person’s entry in the Buddy List.
You’ll see the dialog shown in Figure 3-9, which indicates that the recipient
is being offered a file transfer request. If the file request is accepted by your
Buddy, the transfer begins and is saved where the recipient specifies on
their system.

Figure 3-10 illustrates the reverse: I’m receiving a file from a Buddy. From the
Incoming File Request pane that appears when someone sends me a file, I
can either click the Decline button (to decline the file transfer) or the Save
File button (to save the incoming file to any spot on my system).
Always check any files that you receive from iChat AV with your antivirus
scanning software before you run them!
Eliminating the Riffraff
Here I need to explain something that I hope you won’t have to use — what
I like to call the Turkey Filter. (iChat AV is a little more subtle — you just
ignore people.)
To ignore someone in a chat group, click their name in the list and choose
Buddies➪Ignore Person. When someone is ignored in a chat group, you
won’t see anything that he types or have to respond to any file transfer
requests from that person.
If only it were that easy to ignore someone when he’s standing close to you.
Anyway, if the person becomes a royal pain, you can also choose to block
that person entirely — that way, the offensive cur won’t even know that
you’re online, and he can’t reach you at all. Click the person in the list and
choose Buddies➪Block Person — the deal is done.

Chapter 4: Expanding Your
Horizons with iDisk
In This Chapter
 Setting up iDisk
 Using files and folders on your iDisk
 Using public files
I
f you ask the average Mac owner what’s available on the Internet, you’ll
likely hear benefits such as e-mail, Web surfing, and instant communica-
tion via iChat AV. What you probably won’t hear is, “Convenient, trouble-free
storage for my files and folders.”
You might have tried to use one of the dozens of storage sites on the Internet
that allow you to upload and download files from a personal file area via your
Web browser. Unfortunately, these Web-based storage sites are slow in trans-
ferring files, lacking in convenience, and typically offer only a small amount
of space. As a result, most computer owners decide that the idea of online
storage is neat . . . but impractical.
In this chapter, I show you what real online storage is all about. I’m talking
about iDisk, which is the online storage feature that’s integrated into the
Mac OS X Finder. No jury-rigged Web site is necessary (although you can use
one if you’re not on a Mac). I’ll admit that online storage won’t replace the
hard drives on your Mac, but with a .Mac subscription, you can easily make
use of online storage for backups and sharing files with your friends . . .
from anywhere on the planet!
So how do you actually use iDisk? That’s the simple part! To use iDisk within
Mac OS X, just do what comes naturally — it works like any other removable
volume’s Finder window. You can copy and move files and folders to and
from your iDisk, create new subfolders (except in the Backup and Software
root folders, which are read-only), and delete whatever you don’t need.

Grabbing Internet Storage for Your Mac
442
Grabbing Internet Storage for Your Mac
To set up iDisk on your Mac OS X system, you’ll need a .Mac account. You did
create one during the installation of the Big X, right? These trial accounts are
limited to 20MB of storage, and the trial account is active for only 60 days.
Therefore, if you decide that you like iDisk, you should subscribe to .Mac; a
subscription increases your online treasure chest to 100MB of iDisk storage.
To subscribe, visit http://mac.com and follow the prompts to join from
there. (At the time of this writing, the subscription fee is $100 per year.)
With a .Mac account active, iDisk is automatically available. To see how
much storage you’re using and to configure access to your Public folder,
open System Preferences, click the .Mac icon, and then click the iDisk tab
to display the settings that you see in Figure 4-1. (You can also click the
Buy More button on this panel to subscribe to Apple’s .Mac service.)
Pinning down your iDisk
So where exactly are your files kept when 
you use your iDisk? In earlier versions of Mac
OS X, your acre of storage farmland always 
sat on one of Apple’s iDisk file servers — per-
haps in Cupertino, perhaps elsewhere. These
server computers are especially designed to
store terabytes (TB) of information (1TB equals
1,000GB), and they’re connected to the Internet
via high-speed trunk lines. (And yes, they do
have a firewall.)
However, beginning with Panther, you can elect
to keep a local copy of your iDisk storage
area — usually called a mirror — on your Mac’s
hard drive. (Because Macs have copious hard
drives, reserving 100MB is no problem.) Before
you scratch your head wondering why you’re
duplicating your iDisk files on your computer,
here’s the reason: If you do decide to keep a
local copy of your files, you can work on them
even when you’re not connected to the
Internet! Panther automatically synchronizes
any files that you’ve updated locally with your
remote iDisk whenever you connect to the
Internet. (If you use multiple Macs at different
locations, think about being able to access the
latest copies of your files from any of them, right
from the Finder!)
This nifty mirror also greatly speeds up things
when you’re browsing the contents of your
iDisk or perhaps loading and saving an iDisk
document; that’s because you’re working with
your local copy, and Mac OS X updates any
changes that you make to the corresponding
remote file on the iDisk server. You can tell that
things are updating when that funky little yin
yang, circular doodad — the thing next to your
iDisk in the Finder window — is rotating in its
animated fashion. (And yes, I have it on good
authority . . . that’s what the Apple software
developers call it, too.)
You’re not required to use a mirror, however. To
disable the mirroring feature and return to the
remote-only operation of old, clear the
Synchronize Your iDisk with a Copy on Your
Computer check box on the iDisk settings panel
to disable it. Remember, though, that with the
mirroring feature turned off, you must have an
Internet connection to use iDisk, and things will
move more slowly because you’re accessing
everything across the Internet.

Book IV
Chapter 4
Expanding Your
Horizons with iDisk
Understanding What’s on Your iDisk
443
The iDisk Disk Space bar graph illustrates how much of your current iDisk
territory you’re using. (Note that the account shown in Figure 4-1 is an eval-
uation account, so it shows only a total of 20MB.)
You can specify the access privilege level for other .Mac users from this
panel as well. Select the Read-Only radio button to prevent any other .Mac
user from copying files to your Public folder, or select the Read-Write radio
button to allow others to save files there. No matter which privilege level you
choose, you can also set a password that other .Mac users must type before
they’re allowed access to your Public folder. (More on the Public folder in the
next section.) If you’ve already set a password, you can change it by clicking
the Password button and typing the new word in the Password box. Retype
the word in the Confirm box to verify it; then click the OK button to save the
change and return to the .Mac System Preferences panel.
Understanding What’s on Your iDisk
Unlike the physical hard drive in your Mac, your iDisk never needs format-
ting or defragmenting, and you’ll never have to check it for errors — how-
ever, the structure of an iDisk is fixed, so you can’t just go crazy creating
your own folders. In fact, you can’t create new folders at the root — the top
level — of your iDisk at all, but you can create new folders inside most of
the root folders.
Now that you’re thoroughly rooterized, here are the folders that you’ll find
hanging out in your iDisk:
✦Documents: This folder holds any application documents that you want
to store . . . things like spreadsheets and letters. No one but you can
access these items.
Figure 4-1:
Your iDisk
information

Preferences.

Opening and Using iDisk
444
✦Pictures: This folder is the vault for your JPEG and GIF images, includ-
ing those that you want to use with iCards or your Web pages.
✦Movies: QuickTime movies go here — again, you can add the movies
stored here to your Web pages. (I cover QuickTime like a blanket in
Book III, Chapter 6.)
✦Public: This is the spot to place files that you specifically want to share
with others, either directly through iDisk or with your Web pages. If
you’ve allowed write access, others can copy files to your Public folder
as well.
✦Sites: The Web pages that you store here can be created with Apple’s
HomePage utility — which is available to all .Mac members — or you
can use your own Web page design application and copy the completed
site files here.
✦Music: This is the repository for all of your iTunes music and playlists —
the contents can be added to your Web pages. (iTunes is the star of
Chapter 2 in Book III.) Mine is stuffed full of Mozart, Scarlatti, and that
Bach fellow.
✦Backup: This is a read-only folder that contains the backup files created
with the .Mac Backup application. You can, however, copy the files in
this folder to a removable drive on your system for an additional level
of safekeeping.
✦Library: Another read-only folder. This spot contains the configuration
data and custom settings that you’ve created for other .Mac features.
✦Software: Apple provides this read-only folder as a service to .Mac
members; it contains a selection of the latest freeware, shareware, and
commercial demos for you to enjoy. To try something out, open the
Software folder and copy whatever you like to your Mac OS X Desktop.
Then you can install and run the application from the local copy of the
files.
Opening and Using iDisk
When you’re connected to the Internet, you can open your iDisk in one of
the following ways:
✦From the Finder menu, choose Go➪iDisk and then choose My iDisk
from the submenu — or use the Ô+Shift+I keyboard shortcut.
✦Add an iDisk button to your Finder window toolbar by clicking View
and then choosing Customize Toolbar.
After you add the button, you can click it to connect to your iDisk from
anywhere in the Finder.

Your iDisk opens in a new Finder window, as shown in Figure 4-2. After you
use one of these methods in a Mac OS X session, your iDisk icon appears on
the Mac OS X Desktop; Figure 4-3 shows both the iDisk icon and its proper-
ties in the Get Info dialog. The iDisk volume icon remains until you shut
down or restart your Mac.
If you’re using a remote computer with an Internet connection, you can log in
to the .Mac page at www.apple.com and use your Web browser to access the
contents of your iDisk. (Hey, sometimes this is the only choice you have.)

Opening and Using iDisk
446
However, you don’t actually need to open your iDisk in a Finder window to
use it because you can also load and save files directly to your iDisk from
within any application. Simply choose your iDisk as you would any of the
hard drives on your system when using the application’s Load, Save, or
Save As commands.
You can also open an iDisk’s Public folder — either yours or the Public
folder inside another person’s iDisk — as if it were an Internet file server.
As I explain earlier, if that person has set a password, you’ll need to enter
that password to gain access to their Public folder. From the Finder menu,
choose Go➪iDisk➪Other User’s iDisk (or, to jump directly to their Public
folder, choose Go➪iDisk➪Other User’s Public Folder). If you choose the
former, Panther prompts you for the other person’s member name and pass-
word (see Figure 4-4); if you pick the latter, you need only enter the other
.Mac member’s account name.
After you enter a valid iDisk member name (and password, if required),
you’ll see the .Mac member’s Public folder.
You can also use the server address http://idisk.mac.com/
username-Public? to connect to an iDisk from computers running
Windows and Linux. Check the Help for your operating system to determine
how to connect to a WebDAV server (usually called a Web folder in the
Windows world). When prompted for your access username and password,
use your .Mac account name and password. If you’re using Windows XP,
Apple has provided an even easier way to open an iDisk Public folder: Use
iDisk Utility for Windows, which you can download from www.mac.com.
To connect to your iDisk from within Mac OS 9, follow these steps:

W
hen I was designing the Table of Contents for this book, I seriously
considered leaving this chapter out — after all, more people use a
Web browser now than any other software application. Who really needs a
guide to mowing a lawn?
But then again, I suddenly thought of all the hidden features that folks don’t
know about Apple’s Safari browser — for example, the tips and tricks that
can help you organize your online visits. It’s a little like learning more about
the lawn mower itself: Even though you might not need tips on mowing,
many people don’t know how to remove the spark plug in the winter or how
to sharpen the blade so you can handle taller grass. Remember, magic is
nothing more than technology that someone understands.
In this chapter, I show you how to use those other controls and toolbar but-
tons in Safari — you know, the ones besides the Forward and Back buttons —
and you’ll discover how to keep track of where you’ve been and where you’d
like to go. (Oh, and did I mention that you’ll need an Internet connection?)
One note: Many authors have written entire books on Web browsing. As you
might guess, this chapter is far narrower in scope than those books — I’ve
got more ground to cover before dinner — and it doesn’t include every one
of Safari’s features. However, I think the coverage that you find here will
explain all that you’re likely to need for most surfing sessions.

Let’s Pretend You’ve Never Used This Thing
450
Let’s Pretend You’ve Never Used This Thing
Figure 5-1 illustrates version 1.1 of Safari, which runs only under Mac OS X.
You can launch Safari directly from the Dock, or you can click the Safari icon
within your Applications folder.
Major sections of the Safari window include
✦The Address bar: You’ll find the most often-used commands on the tool-
bar for things like navigation, adding bookmarks, and searching Google —
plus, you can type or paste the address for Web sites that you’d like to
visit. The Address bar can be hidden to provide you with more real estate
in your browser window for Web content. To toggle hidden mode, press
Ô+| (the vertical bar right above the backslash) or choose View➪
Address Bar.
✦The Bookmarks bar: Consider this a toolbar that allows you to jump
directly to your favorite Web sites with a single click. I show you later in
the section “Adding and Using Bookmarks” how to add and remove sites
from your Bookmarks bar. For now, remember that you can toggle the
display of the Bookmarks bar by choosing View➪Bookmarks Bar.

Visiting Web Sites
451
✦The Content window: Congratulations! At last, you’ve waded through
all the pre-game show and you’ve reached the area where Web pages
are actually displayed. Like any other window, the Content window can
be scrolled; and when you minimize Safari to the Dock, you get a thumb-
nail (minimized) image of the Content window.
The Content window often contains underlined text and graphical icons
that transport you to other pages when you click them. These under-
lined words and icons are links, and they make it easy to move from one
area of a site to another or to a completely different site.
✦The status bar: The status bar displays information about what the
mouse pointer is currently resting upon, like the address for a link or
the name of an image; it also updates you on what’s happening while a
page is loading. To hide or display the status bar, press Ô+\ (back-
slash).
Visiting Web Sites
Here’s the stuff that virtually everyone over the age of 5 knows how to do . . .
but I get paid by the word, and some folks might just not be aware of all the
myriad ways of visiting a site. You can load a Web page from any of the fol-
lowing methods:
✦Type (or paste) a Web site address into the Address bar and then
press Return.
If you’re typing in an address and Safari recognizes the site as one that
you’ve visited in the past, it helps by completing the address for you. If
this is a new site, just keep typing.
✦Click a Bookmarks entry within Safari.
✦Click the Home button, which takes you to the home page that you
specify.
More on this in the section “Setting Up Your Home Page” elsewhere in
this chapter.
✦Click a page link in Apple Mail or another Internet-savvy application.
✦Click a page link within another Web page.
✦Use the Google box in the Address bar.
Click in the Google box, type the contents that you want to find, and
then press Return. Safari presents you with the search results page on
Google for the text that you entered. (In case you’ve been living under
the Internet equivalent of a rock for the last couple of years, Google.com
is the preeminent search site on the Web — people use Google to find
everything from used auto parts to ex-spouses.)

Navigating the Web
452
✦Click a Safari page icon in the Dock or in a Finder window.
For example, Mac OS X already has an icon in the default Dock that
takes you to the Mac OS X page on the Apple Web site. Drag a site from
your Bookmarks bar and drop it on the right side of the Dock. Clicking
the icon that you add launches Safari and automatically loads that site.
This trick only works on the side of the Dock to the right of the vertical
line.
If you minimize Safari to the Dock, you’ll see a thumbnail of the page with
the Safari logo superimposed on it. Click this thumbnail in the Dock to
restore the page to its full glory.
Navigating the Web
A typical Web surfing session is a linear experience — you bop from one
page to the next, absorbing the information that you want and discarding
the rest. However, after you visit a few sites, you might find that you need
to return to where you’ve been or head to the familiar ground of your home
page. Safari offers these navigational controls on the Address bar:
✦Back: Click the Back button (the left-facing arrow) on the toolbar to
return to the last page that you visited. Additional clicks take you to
previous pages, in reverse order. The Back button is disabled if you
haven’t visited at least two sites.
✦Forward: If you’ve clicked the Back button at least once, clicking the
Forward button (the right-facing arrow) takes you to the next page (or
through the pages) where you originally were, in forward order. The
Forward button is disabled if you haven’t used the Back button.
✦Home: Click this button (look for the little house) to return to your
home page.
✦AutoFill: If you fill out a lot of forms online — when you’re shopping at
Web sites, for example — you can click the AutoFill button (which looks
like a little text box and a pen) to complete these forms for you. You can
set what information is used for AutoFill by choosing
Safari➪Preferences and clicking the AutoFill toolbar button.
To be honest, I’m not a big fan of releasing any of my personal informa-
tion to any Web site, so I don’t use AutoFill often. If you do decide to use
this feature, make sure that the connection is secure (look for the pad-
lock icon in the upper-right corner of the Safari window) and read the
site’s Privacy Agreement page first to see how your identity data will
be treated.
✦Stop/Reload: Click Reload (which has a circular arrow) to refresh the
contents of the current page. Although most pages remain static, some

Book IV
Chapter 5
Going Places
with Safari
Navigating the Web
453
pages change their content at regular intervals or after you fill out a
form or click a button. By clicking Reload (look for the curvy arrow),
you can see what’s changed on these pages. (I use Reload every hour
or so with CNN.com, for example.) While a page is loading, the Reload
button turns into the Stop button — with a little X mark — and you can
click it to stop the loading of the content from the current page. This is
a real boon when a download takes foorrevverr, which can happen when
you’re trying to visit a very popular or very slow Web site (especially if
you’re using a dialup modem connection to the Internet). Using Stop is
also handy if a page has a number of very large graphics that are going
to take a long time to load.
✦Add Bookmark: Click this Address bar button (which carries a plus
sign) to add a page to your Bookmarks bar or Bookmarks menu. (More
on this in a tad.)
✦Google Search: As I mention earlier, you can click in this box and type
text that you want to find on the Web via the Google search engine —
press Return to display the results. To repeat a recent search, click the
down arrow in the Google Search box and select it from the drop-down
list.
✦Bug: A rather strange creature, the Safari Bug button (top right) makes
it easy to alert Apple when you encounter a page that doesn’t display
properly in Safari. (Software developers call such glitches bugs — hence
the name.) When you click the Bug button, you’ll see a sheet with the
settings shown in Figure 5-2; take time to enter a short description of
the problem that you’re having. (I also enable the Send Screen Shot of
Current Page and the Send Source of Current Page check boxes to give
the Apple folks more to work with while they’re debugging Safari.) Then
click the Submit button to send the bug report to Apple.
Remember, not all these buttons and controls might appear on your
Address bar — to display or hide Address bar controls, toggle them on and
off from the View menu.

Setting Up Your Home Page
454
Setting Up Your Home Page
Choosing a home page is one of the easiest methods of speeding up your
Web surfing, especially if you’re using a dialup modem connection. However,
a large percentage of the Mac owners whom I’ve talked to have never set
their own home page, simply using the default home page provided by their
browser! With Safari running, take a moment to follow these steps to declare
your own freedom to choose your own home page:
1. If you want to use a specific Web page as your new home page, dis-
play it in Safari.
It’s a good idea to select a page with few graphics or a fast-loading popu-
lar site.
2. Choose Safari➪Preferences or press Ô+, (comma).
3. Click the General button.
You’ll see the settings shown in Figure 5-3.
4. Click the Set to Current Page button.
5. Alternatively, click the New Windows Open With drop-down list box
and click Empty page if you want Safari to open a new window with a
blank page.
This is the fastest choice of all for a home page.
6. Press Ô+Q to exit the Preferences dialog.
Visit your home page at any time by pressing the Home button on the
Address bar.

Adding and Using Bookmarks
455
Adding and Using Bookmarks
No doubt about it: Bookmarks make the Web a friendly place. As you collect
bookmarks in Safari, you’re able to immediately jump from one site to
another with a single click on the Bookmarks menu or the buttons on the
Bookmarks bar.
To add a bookmark, first navigate to the desired page and then do any of the
following:
✦Choose Bookmarks➪Add Bookmark.
✦Press the Ô+D keyboard shortcut.
Safari displays the sheet that you see in Figure 5-4, where you can enter
the name for the bookmark and select where it will appear (on the
Bookmarks bar or the Bookmarks menu).
✦Drag the Web address from the Address bar to the Bookmarks bar.
You can also drag a link on the current page to the Bookmarks bar — but
note that doing this only adds a bookmark for the page corresponding to the
link — not the current page.
To jump to a bookmark:
✦Choose it from the Bookmarks menu.
If the bookmark is contained in a folder, which I discuss later in this sec-
tion, move your mouse pointer over the folder name to show its contents
and then click the bookmark.
✦Click the bookmark on the Bookmarks bar.
If you’ve added a large number of items to the Bookmarks bar, click the
More icon on the edge of the Bookmarks bar to display the rest of the
buttons.
Figure 5-4:
Adding a
bookmark is
child’s play.

Downloading Files
456
✦Click the Show All Bookmarks button (which looks like a small opened
book) on the Bookmarks bar and then click the desired bookmark.
The Bookmarks window that you see in Figure 5-5 appears, where you
can review each collection of bookmarks at leisure.
The more bookmarks that you add, the more unwieldy the Bookmarks
menu and the Bookmarks window become. To keep things organized,
choose Bookmarks➪Add Bookmark Folder and then type a name for the
new folder. With folders, you can organize your bookmarks into collec-
tions, which appear in the column at the left of the Bookmarks window
(or as separate submenus within the Bookmarks menu). You can drag
bookmarks within the new folder to help reduce the clutter.
To delete a bookmark or a folder from the Bookmarks window, click it and
then press Delete.
Downloading Files
A huge chunk of the fun that you’ll find on the Web is the ability to down-
load images and files. If you’ve visited a site that offers files for download-
ing, typically you just click the Download button or the download file link,
Figure 5-5:
The
Bookmarks
window
puts all your
bookmarks
in easy
reach.

Book IV
Chapter 5
Going Places

Downloading Files
457
and Safari takes care of the rest. You’ll see the Downloads status window as
shown in Figure 5-6, which keeps you updated with the progress of the
transfer. While the file is downloading, feel free to continue browsing or
even download additional files; the status window helps you keep track of
what’s going on and when everything will be finished transferring.
By default, Safari saves any downloaded files on your Mac OS X Desktop,
which I like and use. To specify the location where downloaded files are
stored — for example, if you’d like to scan them automatically with an
antivirus program — follow these steps:
1. Choose Safari➪Preferences or press Ô+, (comma).
2. Click the General tab and then click the Save Downloaded Files To
drop-down list box.
3. Click Other.
4. Navigate to the location where you want the files stored.
5. Click the Select button.
6. Click the Close button to exit Preferences.
To download a specific image that appears on a Web page, move your mouse
pointer over the image and hold down Control while you click. Then choose
Download Image to Disk from the pop-up menu that appears, as shown in
Figure 5-7. Safari prompts you for the location where you want to store the
file.
Luckily, Safari has matured to the point that it can seamlessly handle virtu-
ally any multimedia file type that it encounters. However, if you’ve down-
loaded a multimedia file and Safari doesn’t seem to be able to play or
display it, try loading the file within QuickTime. As you can read in Book III,
Chapter 6, QuickTime is the Swiss Army knife of multimedia players, and it
can recognize a huge number of audio, video, and image formats.

Using Subscriptions and History
458
Using Subscriptions and History
To keep tabs on where you’ve been, you can display the History list by click-
ing the History menu. To return to a page in the list, just click it from the
History menu. Safari also searches the History list when it fills in an address
that you’re typing — that’s the feature I mentioned in the earlier section
“Visiting Web Sites.”
I show you how to clear the contents of the History file in the upcoming sec-
tion “Handling ancient history.”
Saving Web Pages
If you’ve encountered a page that you’d like to load later, you can save it to
disk in its entirety. Follow these steps:
1. Display the desired page.
2. Choose File➪Save As.
3. In the Save As text field, type a name for the saved page.
4. From the Where field, navigate to the location where you want to
store the file on your system.

To expand the sheet to allow navigation to any location on your system,
click the button with the downward arrow.
5. Click Save to begin the download process.
After the Save file has been created, double-click it to load it in Safari.
A quick word about printing a page within Safari: Some combinations of
background and text colors might conspire together to render your printed
copy practically worthless. In a case like that, use your printer’s grayscale
setting (if it has one). Alternatively, you can simply click and drag to select
the text on the page, press Ô+C to copy it, and then paste the text into Word
or AppleWorks, where you can print the page on a less offensive background
(while still keeping the text formatting largely untouched). You can also save
the contents of a page as plain text, as I just demonstrated.
Protecting Your Privacy
No chapter on Safari would be complete without a discussion of security,
both against outside intrusion from the Internet and prying eyes around
your Mac. Hence this last section, which covers protecting your privacy.
Although diminutive, the tiny padlock icon that appears in the top-right
corner of the Safari window when you’re connected to a secure Web site
means a great deal! A secure site encrypts the information that you send and
receive, making it much harder for those of unscrupulous ideals to obtain
things like credit card numbers and personal information.
Yes, there are such things as bad cookies
First, a definition of this ridiculous term: A cookie, a small file that a Web
site automatically saves on your hard drive, contains information that the
site will use on your future visits. For example, a site might save a cookie to
preserve your site preferences for the next time or — in the case of a site
such as Amazon.com — to identify you automatically and help customize
the offerings that you see.
In and of themselves, cookies aren’t bad things. Unlike a virus, a cookie file
isn’t going to replicate itself or wreak havoc on your system, and only the
original site can read the cookie that it creates. However, many folks don’t
appreciate acting as a gracious host for a slew of little snippets of personal
information — also, if you do a large amount of surfing, cookies can occupy
a significant amount of your hard drive space over time. (Not to mention
that some cookies have highly suggestive names, which could lead to all
sorts of conclusions. End of story.)

Protecting Your Privacy
460
You can choose to accept all cookies — the default — or you can opt to dis-
able cookies altogether. You can also set Safari to accept all cookies. To
change your Cookie Acceptance Plan (or CAP, for those who absolutely crave
acronyms), follow these steps:
1. Choose Safari➪Preferences.
2. Click the Security toolbar button.
Safari displays the preference settings shown in Figure 5-8.
3. Select the Never radio button to block cookies entirely, or select the
Always radio button to accept all cookies.
Personally, I use the default option, Only from Sites You Navigate To,
which allows sites like Amazon.com to work correctly without allowing
a barrage of illicit cookies.
4. To view the cookies currently on your system, click the Show Cookies
button.
The site that used that cookie will forget any information that it stored
in the file, meaning that you might have to take care of things manually,
like providing a password on the site that used to be read automatically
from the cookie.
5. Click the Close button to save your changes.
Cleaning your cache
Safari speeds up the loading of Web sites by storing often-used images and
multimedia files in a temporary storage, or cache, folder. Naturally, the files
in your cache folder can be displayed (hint), which could lead to assump-
tions (hint, hint) about the sites you’ve been visiting (hint, hint, hint).
(Tactful, ain’t I?)
Figure 5-8:

Book IV
Chapter 5

Protecting Your Privacy
461
Luckily, Safari makes it easy to dump the contents of your cache file. Just
click Safari on the menu and click Empty Cache; then click Empty to confirm
that you want to clean up your cache.
Handling ancient history
As you might imagine, your History file leaves a very clear set of footprints
indicating where you’ve been on the Web. To delete the contents of the
History menu, choose History➪Clear History.
Another built-in security feature can also help save your sanity: Safari can
block those incredibly irritating pop-up advertisement windows that are
automatically displayed by some Web sites. (I rank such Webmasters at
the same social level as spammers!) Click Safari and choose Block Pop-Up
Windows, or press Ô+ K — in case you’re visiting a site that actually uses
pop-up windows to your advantage, you can toggle off the block feature 
temporarily.

I
know that you’ve heard horror hacking stories: Big corporations and
big government installations seem to be as open to hackers as a public
library. Often, you read that even entire identities are being stolen online.
When you consider that your Mac can contain very sensitive and private
information in your life — such as your Social Security number and financial
information — it’s enough to make you nervous about turning on your com-
puter long enough to check your eBay auctions.
But how much of that is Hollywood? How truly real is the danger? And how
can you protect yourself? The good news is that you can easily secure your
data from all but the most determined hacker — in fact, depending on the
hardware that you’re using to connect yourself to the Internet, you might be
well guarded right now without even knowing it.
In this chapter, I continue a quest that I’ve pursued for over a decade now —
to make my readers feel comfortable and secure in the online world by
explaining the truth about what can happen and telling you how you can
protect your system from intrusions.
One quick note: This chapter is written with the home and small business
Mac owner in mind. Macs that access the Internet through a larger corporate
network are very likely already protected by that knight in shining armor, the
network system administrator. (Insert applause here.) Of course, if you’re
using Mac OS X in your office, you’re still welcome to read and follow this
material — especially if you have a laptop that could act as a “carrier” for
viruses from home — however, check with your system administrator before
you attempt to implement any of the recommendations that I make.

What Can Really Happen?
464
What Can Really Happen?
Before I begin, I want to offer you a moment of reassurance and a little of
my personal background to explain that I’m well qualified to be your guide
through this online minefield. (After all, you don’t want Jerry Lewis lecturing
you on how to maintain your Internet security. He’s a funny guy, though.)
✦I’ve been running and managing all sorts of online systems since the
days of the BBS (Bulletin Board System), the text-based dinosaurs that
used to rule the online world in the late ’80s and early ’90s. (In fact, my
first book was on this very subject — and it contained a chapter on
viruses long before they were the darlings of the techno-media.)
✦As a consultant, I run Web sites and squash virus attacks for a number
of companies and organizations.
✦I keep my own office network of six computers safe from attack while
still providing readers all over the world with a Web site and that very
same BBS.
With that understood, here’s what can happen to you online without the
right safeguards:
✦Hackers can access shared information on your network. If you’re run-
ning an unguarded network, it’s possible for others to gain access to
your documents and applications or wreak havoc on your system.
✦Your system could be infected with a virus or dangerous macro. Left
to their own devices, these misbehaving programs and macro com-
mands can delete files or turn your entire hard drive into an empty
paperweight.
✦Unsavory individuals could attempt to contact members of your family.
This kind of attack may take place through iChat AV, e-mail, or Web dis-
cussion boards, putting your family’s safety at risk.
✦Hackers can use your system to attack others. Your computer can be
tricked into helping hackers when they attempt to knock out Web
servers and public access File Transfer Protocol (FTP) sites on the
Internet. Along the same lines, that innocent Web server that you put
online could be misused by spam-spewing, online “entrepreneurs.”
(Cute name, right?)
✦Criminals can attempt to con you out of your credit card or personal
information. The Internet is a prime candidate for identity theft.
Yes, that’s a frightening list, and to be absolutely honest, some danger is
indeed present every time that you or any user of your Macintosh connects

Book IV
Chapter 6

Online
What Can Really Happen?
465
to the Internet. However, here’s the good news. With the right safeguards,
it’s literally impossible for most of those worst-case scenarios to happen on
your Macintosh, and what remains would be so difficult that even the most
die-hard hacker would throw in the towel long before reaching your com-
puter or network.
I also want to point out that virtually everyone reading this book — as well
as the guy writing it — really doesn’t have anything that’s worth a malicious
hacking campaign. Things like Quicken data files, saved games of Half-Life 2,
and genealogical data might be priceless to us, of course, but most dedi-
cated hackers are after bigger game. Unfortunately, the coverage that the
media and Hollywood give to corporate and government attacks can turn
even Aunt Harriet more than a little paranoid. Therefore, time for another
of Mark’s Maxims:
It’s not really necessary to consider the NSA or Interpol each time
you poke your Mac’s power button.™
A few simple precautions are all that’s required.
More of Mark’s totally unnecessary
computer trivia
The term hacker dates far back in the annals of
the personal computer — in fact, it originally
had nothing to do with networks, the Internet,
or illegal activities at all . . . because In The
Beginning, there was no public Internet!
“Explain yourself, Chambers!” All right. The
original hackers were electronics buffs, ham
radio operators, computer hobbyists, and engi-
neers who built (or hacked) a working computer
out of individual components with a soldering
gun and a whole lotta guts. At the time, you
didn’t simply order a computer from Dell or visit
your local Maze o’ Wires store in the mall to
select your favorite system.
No, I’m talking about the mid-’70s, in the hal-
cyon time before IBM even introduced the IBM
PC (and when the only folks using the Internet,
which wasn’t called that back then, were 
military folks and researchers). Even the sim-
plest computer — really nothing more than a
glorified calculator by today’s standards — had
to be lovingly assembled by hand. These early
personal computers didn’t run software as we
know it. Instead, you programmed them manu-
ally through a bank of switches on the front,
and they responded with codes displayed on a
bank of lights. (Think about that next time you
launch Microsoft Word.)
Today, of course, the need to assemble a com-
puter from individual transistors is nonexistent,
and the word hacker has an entirely different
connotation — but don’t be surprised if you
meet an older member of your Macintosh user’s
group who’s proud to be an old-fashioned
hacker! (Look for the soldering gun, usually
worn in a holster like a sidearm.)

“Okay, Mark, now I know the real story on what can happen to my computer
online. So what do I do to safeguard my Macintosh?” You need two essential
tools to protect your hardware (besides a healthy amount of common sense,
which I cover in the upcoming section, “A Dose of Common Sense: Things
Not to Do Online”): a firewall and an antivirus program.
Firewall basics
A firewall is a piece of hardware or software that essentially builds an imper-
meable barrier between the computers on your side of the wall (meaning your
Mac and any other computers on your network) and all external computers
on the other side of the wall (meaning the rest of the Internet).
“But wait a second — if other computers can’t reach me and my Mac can’t
reach them, how can I use the Internet at all?” Ah, that’s the beauty of today’s
firewalls. By using a series of techniques designed to thwart attacks from the
outside, a firewall allows you to communicate safely, even monitoring what
you send and what you receive for later examination. Figure 6-1 illustrates
the basics of a firewall.
A firewall sounds grand and incredibly complex and highly technical — and
sometimes it is — but it can also be incredibly simple. For example:

Networked computers sharing
your Internet connection
Web Servers
FTP Servers
Hackers and
Crackers

✦You can spend anywhere from $50 to thousands of dollars installing
sophisticated firewall hardware and software.
or
✦You can activate your firewall by disconnecting your dialup, digital sub-
scriber line (DSL), or cable modem from the wall socket.
Believe it or not, both of those examples technically involve a firewall. In the
first case, the firewall is a physical, tangible presence on the network; in the
second case, the lack of a connection to the Internet actually acts as a fire-
wall. (Think of it as the Air Firewall.) I’ve spoken to a number of readers who
actually do this — however, if you’re running a Web site or downloading a
file from your company’s FTP site, yanking the connection when you head to
bed isn’t an option. Therefore, most of us will install a physical firewall
through hardware or software.
Do I already have a firewall?
In some cases, you might already be using a hardware firewall and not even
know it. For example, many Internet-sharing devices include a built-in NAT
firewall. NAT stands for Network Address Translation, and it’s the most effec-
tive and popular hardware firewall standard in use by consumer devices. If
you’re using an Internet sharing hub or router, check its manual to deter-
mine whether it offers NAT as a firewall feature — and if so, turn it on if NAT
isn’t enabled by default. (See Book V, Chapter 2 for more on Internet shar-
ing, routers, and firewalls.)
For instance, Figure 6-2 illustrates the configuration screen for my Internet
router. Note the options to disable port scanning and ping responses, which
are two tricks that hackers often use to detect what’s often called a hot 
computer — meaning that the computer can be identified and is accessible
to attack. (Wireless networks are notoriously hot — for more information
on securing your wireless connections, visit Book V, Chapter 4.)
Using the internal Mac OS X firewall
Mac OS X includes a powerful internal firewall called IPFW. I’m happy to say
that the latest version of Mac OS X makes IPFW very simple to use, and I can
now recommend it! (In earlier versions of Mac OS X before the arrival of
Jaguar, IPFW — actually a UNIX application — was completely command
driven from the Terminal.) The Mac OS X firewall is now configured through
System Preferences — find more information on setting up IPFW in Book V,
Chapter 2.

“Shields Up, Chekov!”
468
Several developers have written user-friendly front-ends that provide alter-
nate methods of configuring IPFW; for example, you can try the shareware
application BrickHouse (as shown in Figure 6-3), available from http://
personalpages.tds.net/~brian_hill/brickhouse.html. Another
shareware offering, Firewalk X 2 (available from www.pliris-soft.com),
is a full-featured firewall application that doesn’t use IPFW at all.
Using a commercial software firewall
Besides Firewalk X 2, you’ll also find a number of popular alternatives to
IPFW on the market. Here are two commercial software firewall applications
that are proven to be both effective and easy-to-use:
✦Symantec, Norton Personal Firewall, $70 (www.symantec.com):
Symantec provides both antivirus and firewall protection for the PC
and Macintosh. Frequent updates and top-of-the-line technical support
ensure that your firewall stays current and that you can get help when
you need it.
✦Intego, NetBarrier X, $60 (www.netbarrier.com): NetBarrier X comes
with a number of preset configurations that allow you to choose a basic
firewall for your network environment with a single click.

Whether you set up IPFW, a shareware firewall, or a commercial firewall, visit
a favorite site of mine on the Web: http://grc.com, the home of Gibson
Research Corporation. There you’ll find the free online utility ShieldsUP!!,
which will automatically test just how tight your firewall is and how suscepti-
ble your Mac could be to hacker attacks. Visit this site often because this
service is updated periodically to reflect new hacking techniques.
Antivirus basics
Next, consider your antivirus protection. Viruses are typically transmitted
through applications — you run a program, and the virus is activated.
(Although not the traditional definition of a virus, both scripts and macros
can be used to take control of your system and cause trouble, as well.)
Therefore, you need to closely monitor what I call The Big Three:
✦Web downloads: Consider every file that you receive from the Internet
as a possible viral threat.
✦Removable media: Viruses can be stored on everything from CD-ROMs
and DVD-ROMs to Zip disks and even archaic floppy disks.
✦E-mail file attachments: An application sent to you as an e-mail attach-
ment is an easy doorway to your system.
Horrors! Mac OS X has no built-in antivirus support. (Then again, neither
does Windows XP.) However, a good antivirus program will take care of any
application that’s carrying a virus. Some even handle destructive macros
Figure 6-3:
BrickHouse
provides
another
route for

IPFW.

within documents. Make sure that the antivirus program that you choose
offers real-time scanning, which operates when you download or open a file.
Periodic scanning of your entire system is important, too, but only a real-
time scanning application like Norton AntiVirus can immediately ensure that
the StuffIt archive or the application you just received in your e-mail Inbox is
actually free from viruses.
Virus technology continues to evolve over time, just like more beneficial
application development. For example, recently a virus has been discovered
that’s actually contained in a JPEG image file! With a good antivirus applica-
tion that offers regular updates, you’ll continue to keep your system safe
from viral attack.
I heartily recommend Norton AntiVirus from Symantec, as shown in Fig-
ure 6-4. This program includes automatic updates delivered while you’re
online to make sure that you’re covered against the latest viruses.
A Dose of Common Sense: Things Not to Do Online
One more powerful weapon that you can use to make sure that your Mac
stays safe from unlawful intrusion is this: Practicing common sense on the
Internet is just as important as adding a firewall and an antivirus application
to Mac OS X.
With this in mind, here’s a checklist of things that you should never do while
you’re online:
✦Never download a file from a site you don’t trust. And make sure that
your antivirus software is configured to check downloaded files before
you open them.
Figure 6-4:

471
✦Never open an e-mail attachment until it’s been checked. Don’t give in
to temptation, even if the person who sent the message is someone you
trust. (Many of today’s macro viruses actually replicate themselves by
sending copies to the addresses found through the victim’s e-mail pro-
gram. Of course, this problem crops up regularly in the Windows world,
but it’s been known to happen in the Macintosh community as well.)
✦Never enter any personal information in an e-mail message unless
you know the recipient. Sure, I send my mailing address to friends and
family, but no one else. In fact, even e-mail can be intercepted by a
determined hacker, so if you’re sending something truly important, use
an encryption application like PGP Personal (www.pgp.com) shown in
Figure 6-5.
✦Never include any personal information in an Internet newsgroup
post. After all, these posts can be viewed by anyone with a newsgroup
account, so there’s no such thing as privacy in a newsgroup. (For a
glimpse of just how long a newsgroup post can linger in the great
Internet continuum, visit www.google.com, click the Groups button,
and search for your name. I can pull up newsgroup messages that I
posted back in 1995!)
✦Never buy from an online store that doesn’t offer a secure, encrypted
connection when you’re prompted for your personal information and
credit card number. If you’re using Internet Explorer or Netscape, you
can tell when you’re using a secure connection by checking the status
bar at the bottom of the Web browser window: If a small padlock icon
appears (as shown in Figure 6-6), the connection is encrypted and
secure. (If you’re using Apple’s Safari browser, the padlock icon appears
at the top-right corner of the Safari window.)
Figure 6-5:

✦Never divulge personal information to others over an iChat AV 
connection.
✦Never use the same password for all your electronic business. Use dif-
ferent passwords that include both letters and numbers, change them
often, and never divulge them to anyone else.
✦Never give anyone else administrative access to your Web or FTP
server.
✦Never allow any type of remote access to your Macintosh or your net-
work without testing that access first; restrict that access to visitors
whom you trust.

Internet hacker attacks — in Book V. I cover System Preferences that can

a Small Network

I
n the not-so-distant past — I’m talking 10 to 15 years ago — networks
were found only in huge companies that had the money and workforce to
pay for and maintain them. But now, as technology rolls on, a home or small
office network is both very affordable and relatively easy to create. In this
chapter, I introduce you to this helpful beastie: You discover what networks
are, what you can do with them, and how to set up a small network of your
own for your home or small business.
Networks can be used for many things. Computers exchange all types of data
over a network: files that you want to send between computers or to net-
worked printers; streaming audio or video broadcasts; data for multiplayer
computer games; or even a private company Web site (typically called an
intranet). Anything that you can imagine that would involve moving data
between multiple computers can be done by using a network.
What Do I Need to Set Up My Network?
First, let me define network. In a nutshell, a network is a combination of
hardware, cables, and software that allows computers and printers to talk
to each other. To have a network, you need the right hardware and software.
Some of the hardware and most of the software that you’ll need probably
came with your Mac, depending on which Mac you have; as you progress
through this chapter, you’ll discover everything that’s required to set up
your network so that you can pick up any additional parts you need. Any
good-sized computer store (either the brick-and-mortar or online variety)
has everything that you need to get up and running.

What Do I Need to Set Up My Network?
476
Now, back to the requirements: You need the right hardware and software
to make your network sing. This section covers each component with a
description about the role that each part plays on the network and other
good stuff that you’ll want to know to get your network right the first time.
Something to network
Okay, this might be obvious, but I’m nothing if not thorough. The first thing
that you need to build a network is . . . well . . . stuff! That’s right, you need
to have devices that you want to network. Most times this will be computers
(whether Macs or Windows/UNIX PCs), printers, personal digital assistants
(PDAs), and other standalone, network-capable devices (such as file servers
and shared tape backup drives).
Network interface card (NIC)
A network interface card, or NIC, is a hardware device that your computer
uses to talk to the rest of the network. The NIC connects to the network
cabling, and it speaks the language of electronics, sending data around the
network. Nowadays, most networks use the Ethernet networking protocol,
and most NICs are Ethernet-compatible. Most modern Macs have an
Ethernet NIC built right in — and, in fact, aren’t really cards at all but some-
thing built right onto the Mac’s main system board. If you have an older
Mac, say one bought before 1998, you can purchase an add-on NIC at any
computer store.
Hub or switch
So you have an assortment of devices in your home or small office that
you’ve decided to network. How do you make them all interconnect?
Although you could connect just two computers together by using nothing
more than a single crossover cable, you need fancier hardware to connect
more than two computers: namely, a hub or a switch. The hub or the switch,
used to connect everything, is the focal point of the network. Without a hub
or switch, you wouldn’t have a network.
Hubs
A hub is a small box that has a bunch of Ethernet ports on it. A port is really
just like an Ethernet NIC on your computer, but a hub or switch has lots of
them. Inside, a hub connects all those Ethernet ports so that the talking
(sending) wires from each port connect to the listening (receiving) wires on
all other ports — therefore, when one computer talks, all others listen. As a
side effect of how hubs work, if more than one computer tries to talk at
once, a collision happens. Collisions are a Bad Thing: The data that was
being sent by the two computers is destroyed and has to be re-sent.

Book V
Chapter 1

Small Network
What Do I Need to Set Up My Network?
477
Although they might seem relatively harmless, collisions can really take a
toll on your Ethernet network. When data starts flying around your network,
collisions will take over and limit the amount of data that you can get
through the network. Typically you’ll only be able to use about 40 percent
of the total speed, or bandwidth, of the hub. With the cost of switches barely
above that of hubs, you really have little reason to get a hub instead of a
switch.
Setting up a hub (and therefore giving birth to your network, which sounds
more painful than it is) is usually no more difficult than connecting a power
cable to the hub and then plugging in your computers with their own
Ethernet cables. You’ll see various lights on the hub — usually a power light
indicating that the hub is powered on and operational. You’ll also see lights
that correspond to each port on the hub — these lights tell you what’s going
on in the hub. For instance, you normally see the following types of lights:
39 flavors of Ethernet . . . but no Rocky Road
Ethernet standards allow for operation at dif-
ferent speeds. Because the Ethernet standard
has improved over time, some older Ethernet
devices only support the older (slower) speeds.
Ethernet’s speed is rated by how much data it
can transfer in a second — usually in millions of
bits per second, or megabits per second (Mbps).
Originally, Ethernet was designed to run at 10
Mbps. Now there are three different speeds of
Ethernet: 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, and 1000 Mbps.
1000 Mbps Ethernet — also called Gigabit
Ethernet or just Gigabit for short — is still a bit
on the expensive side for small home or office
networks. All consumer-level Gigabit Ethernet
NICs also support running at 10 Mbps or 100
Mbps, so you will hear them called 10/100/1000
Ethernet NICs. PowerBook G4s and G4/G5
towers come with a 10/100/1000 Ethernet NIC
built in, but the iMac, iBook, and eMac still
come with just 10/100 Ethernet NICs built in.
Although Gigabit NICs are now priced under
$100, the devices that can connect Gigabit NICs
still cost thousands of dollars. That fact, cou-
pled with the reality that most computer sys-
tems can’t really even handle or dish out that
much data, makes Gigabit Ethernet a choice for
only those wanting an extremely high-end and
costly network.
NICs and other Ethernet equipment that only
handle 10 Mbps are rapidly becoming obsolete
because virtually all the modern NICs and other
Ethernet hardware support both 10 Mbps and
100 Mbps. Most times, you will see this labeled
as 10/100 Ethernet. For your home networking,
you probably want to invest in 100 Mbps or
10/100 Mbps. You can pick up a 10/100 Ethernet
NIC for as low as $19.
Remember: Keep your eye out for Ethernet NICs
and equipment that handle only 100 Mbps. You
won’t see it much, but be wary because it can’t
interconnect with 10 Mbps Ethernet NICs and
equipment. I advise against buying it — stay
compatible, and you’ll be a happy puppy.

✦Link light: Each port on a hub should have a link light. Link lights simply
tell you which ports have something alive connected to a given port:
that is, a device is connected and powered on. On hubs that support 10
and 100 Mbps, the speed light is also used to indicate a link, so there
isn’t a separate link light.
✦Speed light: Each port on the hub should have a speed light. On hubs
that support both 10 Mbps and 100 Mbps, this tells you the speed of the
device at the other end. Some hubs have different lights for different
speeds, and some use a single light and make it different colors for dif-
ferent speeds.
✦Activity light: When one computer speaks, they all hear it. Typically, an
entire hub has only one activity light for the entire hub, indicating that
someone is speaking. With heavy traffic, the light could appear solid.
✦Collision light: Just like the activity light, collisions affect everything
connected to the hub, so logic dictates having only one collision light
for the entire hub. This light will flash whenever a collision occurs,
which can happen even with only two devices attached. When you add
more devices, you get more collisions; if this light stays on most of the
time, look into getting a switch (which I describe in the next section).
Switches
A hub is a relatively simple way to connect a bunch of cables to allow com-
puters to talk. (They’re not particularly intelligent or efficient creatures.) A
hub just receives network data on one port and sends (or broadcasts) a copy
out through all the other ports. A switch, on the other hand, is a more
advanced “post office” for your network because a switch uses the informa-
tion in the network data to eliminate collisions and thus increase the effi-
ciency of your network.
When an Ethernet switch receives a frame — that’s the name for a standard
unit, or packet, of network data — it reads the label on the frame to see the
return address of the computer that sent the frame. In a short amount of
time (after being turned on and watching the data move around), a switch
learns which computer is located on which port. Then, whenever data
comes into the switch, it looks at the header (some information on the front
of all frames, much like a mailing label on a package that you send) and sees
which computer should receive the frame. The switch then sends the frame
out the port for that computer only.
This is a Good Thing. Instead of forcing all computers on the network to
listen while one Mac speaks (like a hub does) — known as half-duplex — a
switch can actually send the data directly to the only computer that needs to
hear it. This gets rid of the evil collisions, allowing all the computers to speak

Book V
Chapter 1
Setting Up a
Small Network
What Do I Need to Set Up My Network?
479
and talk at the same time (full-duplex). Now, twice as much information can
be shoved around because a computer can now send and receive data at the
same time. This is a major breakthrough and can happen only on a switch.
Just how much of a performance improvement do you get with a switch
compared with a hub? On average, you’ll move from a 100 Mbps hub that
can handle an average of 5 Mbps of traffic per device (assuming that eight
computers are communicating at once) to a 100 Mbps switch that can
handle 200 Mbps per device (no matter how many devices are connected).
That’s a speed increase of 4,000 percent, leading me to another inescapable
Mark’s Maxim:
Buy a switch for your network, and say goodbye to collisions!
Cables
Cables are the ties that bind . . . literally. Cables are used to connect the
NIC card on each computer to the central hardware of the network: namely,
hubs (which you don’t really want) or switches (which you do want). With
a little experience, you’ll be a cable-wielding superhero with hundreds of
feet of cable draped across every piece of furniture in your place for your
first LAN party. (A LAN party, by the way, is when way too many techies bring
their computers into a very small space, connect them, and play games for
48 hours straight. Oh, and we eat a lot, too. Good stuff!)
Here’s the scoop on what kind of cables to use. Technically, you can run 10
Mbps Ethernet over Cat5 cable (like a super-version of the wire that you use
for your telephones) or coaxial cable (the kind of cable that you use to con-
nect your TV to your cable service). You can run 100 Mbps Ethernet over
Cat5 cable or fiber optic cable.
Although you can do 10/100 and most times 100 Mbps Ethernet over Cat5
cable, any new cables that you buy should be Cat5E — which I talk about in
the following section — because it is specifically meant to be used with 1000
Mbps Ethernet.
I’m sure that you noticed that the common denominator here is the Cat5
cable. Although you could get by using coaxial cable, it’s pretty much gone
out of style as a network cable because it’s limited to 10 Mbps Ethernet. In
fact, it’s very hard to find a NIC with a coaxial connection any more. Fiber
optic cable, although supporting speeds of 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, and even 10
Gbps, is much more expensive and more difficult to install.
Hey, did I mention that you can eschew cables entirely? For more informa-
tion on the lean, mean world of wireless networking using Apple’s AirPort
Extreme, see Chapter 4 of this mini-book.

Setting Up Your Network
480
Be sure to buy straight-through Cat5E cables (also called patch cables) and
not crossover cables, which are only used in certain circumstances.
Crossover cables are mainly used to connect two computers directly
together to form a network, connect a cable/DSL modem directly to a com-
puter, or connect multiple switches.
Cat5 cable supports speeds of 100 Mbps. 1000 Mbps Ethernet, of course, is
designed to run ten times faster than that; luckily enough, it was engineered
to be compatible with 90 percent of Cat5 installations. Having said that,
some Cat5 cable doesn’t stick to the stringent specifications that 1000 Mbps
Ethernet requires. The newer version of Cat5 cable is Category 5 Enhanced,
or Cat5E for short. Cat5E is recommended for any new installation because
it can easily handle 10/100 Mbps Ethernet and yet can handle 1000 Mbps
Ethernet as well. Even if you’re using 10/100 Mbps Ethernet, you can
upgrade someday to 1000 Mbps without having to worry about upgrading
your cabling.
Setting Up Your Network
After you collect the hardware components listed earlier in this chapter,
you’re ready to connect things. Here’s a quick list of things to do to get your
network fired up:
1. Find the best location for placing your hub or switch.
To keep costs down, try to place the hub or switch in a location close to
a power socket that’s centrally located so that you can use the least
amount of cable. If cost isn’t an issue, hide the unit in a closet and just
run all the cables along the walls to the hub or switch. And if cost really
isn’t an issue, get your house fully wired with Cat5E cable.
2. Plug the hub or switch into the power socket.
Some hubs and switches come on automatically when you plug them in
and can never be turned off. Others have a power switch that you need
to turn on the first time that you plug them in.
3. Verify that the hub or switch is working by looking at the lights on the
front. Check the manual that came with the hub or switch to see what
light configuration is normal for that particular unit.
Until you have computers or printers attached to it, you might just have
a status light that shows the hub is powered on. But if the lights on your
unit don’t match up with what the manual says, you could have a bum
unit that you need to return.
4. Verify that all your devices are near enough to the hub or switch to
be connected by your cables and then turn them all on.

5. Get one of your Cat5E cables and connect one cable from the
Ethernet jack on your computer, usually on the side or back, to an
open port on the hub or switch.
You should see a link light or speed light come on that verifies that the
two devices sense each other. (You might also have a link light on your
NIC where you plug in the cable, but that depends on the Mac that
you’re using.)
6. Repeat Step 5 until each device is attached to the hub or switch.
Congratulations, you’re a network technician! (Don’t forget to call your
friends and brag.) The first phase of the network, the physical connection, is
complete; the next step is the configuration of Mac OS X.
Understanding the Basics of Network Configuration
Take a deep breath, there’s no need to panic — in fact, configuring your net-
work software basically involves entering a lot of numbers and other stuff in
dialogs. (In fact, most folks can just allow Panther to take care of network
settings automatically.) But just so you’ll understand what’s involved, this
section explains what those numbers are, what they do, and why you ought
to know it. Because this is a Mac OS X book, I stick with configuring Macs
running the Big X.
TCP/IP
First things first: Protocol is just the techno-nerd word for a set of rules or
a language. A protocol is a language that computers use to communicate.
Without protocols, the computers on your network would never be able
to speak to each other even though you have NICs, cables, and a hub or
a switch. The Internet Protocol (IP) part of the TCP/IP suite is what you’re
really interested in because it’s the most important part of your network
configuration chore.
IP addresses
IP addresses are like street addresses for computers on a network. Each
computer on the network has an IP address, and it needs to be unique
because no other computer can share it. When a computer wants to com-
municate with another computer, it can simply send the data on the net-
work in a nice package that has its address as well as the address of the
computer that it’s trying to talk to. (Remember frames? If not, take a
refresher in the earlier section, “Switches.”)

Understanding the Basics of Network Configuration
482
An IP address is just a number, but it’s written in a strange way. (Go figure.)
All IP addresses are written as four numbers between 0 and 255 with a dot
(period) between them: For instance, a common IP address that you might
run into is 192.168.0.1. As everyone knows, engineers can’t sleep unless they
have three or four ways to write the same thing, including IP addresses. The
form shown above — which is by far the most common — is dotted notation.
Each number, like 192, is an octet.
Don’t worry too much about this stuff: You don’t have to remember terms
like octet to create your own network. They could be helpful, however, if
something goes wrong and you need to place a call to tech support. Plus,
you can impress the computer salesperson (gleefully called a wonk by
Mac power users) at your local Maze ’o Wires store with your mastery of 
techno-babble.
IP addresses at home versus on the Internet
One very important thing to keep in mind is that the Almighty IP Address
Police — Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (www.iana.org) — has broken
IP addresses into groups. The two main types of IP addresses are public and
private. Public IP addresses are ones that can be used on the Internet and
are unique throughout the whole world. Private IP addresses are used in
homes or businesses and cannot be used to talk to the public Internet.
Private IP addresses are used over and over by many people and most com-
monly take the form 192.168.x.x.
You will almost always get a public IP address from your Internet service
provider (ISP), whether you’re using a cable modem, digital subscriber line
(DSL), or a regular dialup modem. If you use a cable/DSL router or some-
thing like IPNetShareX to share your Internet connection among multiple
computers, you’ll be using private IP addresses on your network while using
a single public IP address to talk to the Internet (more on that later in
Book V, Chapter 5).
“Great! I get an IP address, put it into my Network settings in System
Preferences, and off I go. Right?” Well, you’re close, but here are a few other
pieces of information that you might need before you can go surfing around
the world:
✦Default gateway: When you send information to other networks —
whether in another building or around the world on the Internet — your
computer needs to know the IP address of the gateway that will forward
your data down the line. The default gateway is really just the IP address
of a router, which is a device that connects multiple networks. A gateway
gets its name because it really is your gateway to all other networks.
✦Subnet mask: A subnet mask is a number that helps your computer
know when it needs to send stuff through the router. It’s a group of four

Book V
Chapter 1

Small Network

483
octets with dots, just like an IP address, but almost always it uses 0 or
255 as the four octets. Most often, the subnet mask will be 255.255.255.0.
If the wrong number is entered for the subnet mask, it could keep you
from talking to the Internet or even computers on your own network.
Software applications
After you have the hardware in place and you’ve chosen and configured a
protocol to allow the computers to all talk to each other, you need software
to make use of your new network connections. Time for more good news: A
lot of the software that you’ll need to move data on your network is already
included in Mac OS X! Here is a quick list of some of the network software
and protocols already built into Mac OS X and what they’re used for:
✦FTP: File Transfer Protocol (FTP), part of the TCP/IP protocol suite,
allows computers of any type — Mac, PC, Linux, UNIX, mainframe, or
whatever — to transfer files back and forth between them.
✦Telnet: Telnet is also part of the TCP/IP suite — you can use it to
remotely connect to a computer and execute commands on the remote
machine.
✦Samba: Samba, an open source software suite, enables Mac OS X users
to share files with people using Windows computers and also allows the
Mac user to connect to files that the Windows computers share.
✦HTTP: HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), also part of the TCP/IP suite,
is used by Web browsers to provide access to all the various pages on
the World Wide Web.
Configuring Network System Preferences
In this section, I show you how to configure your Mac to communicate with
other computers on a local network. 
Using DHCP for automatic IP address assignment
Now I’d like to introduce you to a very dear friend of mine — an abbrevia-
tion that you will soon grow to love, like everyone else who’s set up a small
Mac network. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, or DHCP for short, is a
protocol that enables a computer to automatically get all the information
that I’ve talked about to this point. (Check in your Webster’s . . . this is the
very definition of the word godsend.)
You’re saying, “Mark, there’s gotta be a catch, right?” Well, here’s the bad
news: Before you can use DHCP, you have to first add a DHCP server, which
provides other computers on the network with their configuration settings.
Here’s the good news: Most Internet connection-sharing hardware devices

Configuring Network System Preferences
484
(and software-sharing implementations as well) provide a DHCP server as
part of the price of admission. (Internet connection sharing allows all your
networked computers to access the Internet through a single Internet con-
nection. I cover it more in Book V, Chapter 5.) Even many switches can pro-
vide DHCP services these days . . . technology marches on.
If you plan to use Internet connection sharing or you know that you have
a DHCP server on your network, you can set up your Mac to automatically
obtain the required IP address and information. Open System Preferences
from the Dock or the Apple menu and choose Network. From the Network
dialog that appears, click the Show drop-down list box and select Built-in
Ethernet. Select Using DHCP from the Configure IPv4 drop-down list on the
TCP/IP tab. Click the Apply Now button, and Mac OS X will contact the
DHCP server to obtain an IP address, a subnet mask, a gateway router IP
address, and a Domain Name System (DNS) address. (DNS servers convert a
human-friendly address like www.yahoo.com to a computer-friendly IP
address like 66.218.71.86.)
A few seconds after clicking the Apply Now button, you should see the infor-
mation come up. Notice the addition underneath IP Address: (Provided by
DHCP Server.) This lets you know that the process worked and configuration
is complete. You might also notice that the DNS information is empty — fear
not, Mac OS X is really using DNS information provided by the DHCP server.
Press Ô+Q to quit System Preferences and save your settings.
If you ever make a network change that screws things up, like entering the
wrong subnet mask or an IP address that isn’t in the same range as others
on your LAN, you can always click the Revert button to get back your old
settings.
One DHCP server on a network is princely — two or more DHCP servers
on a single network will fight like alley cats and grind everything to a halt.
Therefore, if you’re considering adding a DHCP server to an existing net-
work, make doggone sure that you’re not treading on another server’s toes.
(Ask that network administrator person.)
Manually choosing an IP address range
You say you don’t have a DHCP server, and you need to manually assign IP
addresses? This configuration means two things: You need to manually con-
figure the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)
Properties, and you don’t need an address for a router (the gateway to the
outside world). Keep in mind that, for now, you’re not concerned with the
Internet — just computers on the local network.
A result of being on a local network — because it’s not connected to the
Internet, it’s also called a private network — is that you must use IP

485
addresses that are reserved for private network use. You can use a few dif-
ferent ranges of IP addresses, but I recommend that you choose an address
range from the 192.168.x.x networks. In the next section, I show you how.
Down to business: I recommend that you use IP addresses in the 192.168.x.x
range. What does this mean exactly? Well, here’s the scoop:
✦Use IP addresses where the first two octets are 192 and 168 (192.168).
Octet numbers are conjoined by periods.
✦For the third octet, choose any number between 1 and 254.
It doesn’t matter which one you choose as long as you use this same
third number on all computers on your network.
✦For the fourth octet, choose any number between 1 and 254.
Make sure that every computer on your local network has a different
fourth octet number. This is very important — your network will not
work otherwise.
✦Use 255.255.255.0 as your subnet mask.
For instance, suppose that you’re using three computers on your network.
All the IP addresses that you use will start with 192.168. Next, suppose you
choose 123 for the third octet. (Remember that you can choose any number
between 1 and 254.) Finally, for the fourth octet, choose the numbers 100,
105, and 110 for the three computers, respectively. (Again, you can choose
any numbers between 1 and 254.) The resulting IP addresses used on the
three computers are
192.168.123.100
192.168.123.105
192.168.123.110
By the way, I should mention that there are other range possibilities for
reserved private networks — AirPort and AirPort Extreme hardware uses a
10.x.x.x network range, for example — but the 192.168.x.x range is definitely
the most popular and the most common default on Ethernet network
hardware.
After you know the IP addresses and the subnet mask that you’re going to
use, start setting up each computer. Being a nice guy, I’d like to walk you
through the process of configuring Mac OS X with the 192.168.123.105
address as an example.
Be sure that you have all the physical portion of your network powered up
and connected as outlined in the earlier section “Setting Up Your Network.”

Configuring Network System Preferences

1. Select any of your Macs to start with and open System Preferences
(either choose System Preferences from the Apple menu or from
the Dock).
2. From the System Preferences dialog that appears (see Figure 1-1),
choose Network.
The Network dialog appears.

Connecting directly to the Internet
with a DSL or cable modem
If you have a DSL or cable modem, you can con-
nect it to your Mac directly — with this setup,
that one Macintosh can access the Internet
without using any of the Internet sharing meth-
ods that I talk about in Chapter 5 of this mini-
book. Simply connect the LAN port on your
DSL/cable modem to the Ethernet port on your
Mac with a crossover cable. (Your DSL/cable
modem probably came with one just for this
purpose.) Next, configure your Mac to obtain an
IP address automatically by using DHCP.
Depending on your ISP, you might have to give
your Mac a specific network name or use other
specific settings to get it to work right — you’ll
just need to call or check the instructions from
your ISP. As a reader once told me, “Hey, this
turns out not to be rocket science after all.”

Verifying Connectivity
488
Most ISPs also supply DNS server addresses and search domains. If your ISP
included DNS server addresses or search domains, don’t forget to type them
into the corresponding boxes on the TCP/IP panel.
Verifying Connectivity
After you have your Macs connected and your TCP/IP configuration is done,
you need to check to make sure that everything is working. After you have
at least two computers on your network, each with a TCP/IP address, you
can use a simple little utility called ping to test the connection.
ping is a very simple, yet extremely helpful, utility that’s the first connectiv-
ity-testing tool out of the box, even for network professionals. When you use
the ping utility — referred to as pinging something — the application sends
out a small packet of data to whatever destination you’re trying to reach.
When the receiving computer hears the ping, it answers with a ping reply.
If the original computer receives the ping reply, you know that the connec-
tion between the computers is good.
To ping a computer, you use a little application built in to Mac OS X called
Network Utility, which allows you to work various network wonders
Figure 1-3:

ration is

Book V
Chapter 1

(including checking connectivity, watching the route that your computer
takes to get to another computer, and looking up information about Internet
domain names). To use Network Utility to check network connectivity,
follow these steps:
1. Double-click your hard drive to open it and then choose
Applications➪Utilities➪Network Utility, as shown in Figure 1-4.
2. In the Network Utility dialog that opens, click the Ping button
(see Figure 1-5).
3. In the Please Enter the Network Address to Ping text field, enter
the IP address of the computer that you want to ping.

Figure 1-4:

Verifying Connectivity
490
4. To simply verify connectivity, select the Send Only x Pings radio
button and enter a low number, such as 5, in the text field.
Five or ten pings are plenty to see whether the connection is good.
5. Click the Ping button.
Your Mac sends ping packets to the IP address that you entered.
If the pings are successful, text appears in the text box at the bottom of the
Ping tab: one line for each ping reply received from the other computer. The
end of each line reads time= with a number at the end — that number is the
amount of time, in 1⁄1000 of a second (milliseconds [ms]), that it took for the
ping packet to go from your computer to the other computer and back.
If your ping is unsuccessful, you will see nothing, at least for a little bit. 
Each ping that you send takes two seconds before it’s considered missing 
in action. So, if you chose five pings, you need to wait ten seconds before
you see the results. After all the pings time out — a ping times out when it
doesn’t get returned in the proper amount of time — you see a line of text
appear that reads ping: sendto: No route to host (as seen in Figure
1-6) or 100% packet loss. Both error messages mean the same thing: All
the ping packets that you sent out are now in the packet graveyard, never to
be seen again. As you’ve likely guessed already, this is not a good sign for
your network connectivity — look ahead to “Troubleshooting Your New
Network” to find out where to begin troubleshooting this problem.
If you can ping all the other computers on your network from one of the
computers, you don’t need to go to each computer and ping all the others.
You can logically assume that all the computers can communicate. For
instance, if you can ping computers B, C, and D from computer A, you don’t
need to bother with ping tests from computer B, C, or D.

Troubleshooting Your New Network
491
After you have your computers configured and you’ve verified connectivity
between them, start doing the fun stuff that a network allows you to do, like
sharing data, printing, and most importantly, playing games with users on
other computers.
Troubleshooting Your New Network
After a network is set up and operating, it rarely has problems — still,
Murphy sometimes takes charge, and the darn thing just won’t work right.
When you do have problems with the network, I recommend using a stan-
dard, consistent approach to finding and fixing the problem. This section
breaks down troubleshooting into two areas:
✦The hardware: The best place to start troubleshooting a network
problem is with the actual equipment, such as the NICs, cables, and
hubs/switches. (See earlier sections on each equipment type.)
✦The software: The second place to check for problems is in the configu-
ration of the computers on the network, specifically the configuration
on the computer(s) having the problem that you’re troubleshooting.
Physical problems with your network
Although many things on a network can go bad or cause problems, usually
network problems are caused by faulty equipment or wiring. Sometimes it’s
something as simple as a cable not being plugged in snugly. Looking at the
physical cables, connections, and equipment is always the best place to
start looking for problems. Here is a quick list of physical things to check
while trying to fix network problems:
✦Make sure that both ends of the network cable are firmly connected.
First check the end that plugs into the computer and then check the end
that connects to the hub/switch.
✦Turn on the problematic computer to be sure that it’s connected to a
hub or switch.
Check the port on the hub/switch to see whether the link/speed light is
lit. (Depending on the hub or switch that you have, you might not have
a link light. Many hubs and switches use a speed light to indicate a link.
Check the manufacturer’s manual for your model.) If your computer is
on and connected but no link/speed light is lit, try replacing the net-
work cable.

Troubleshooting Your New Network
492
✦If you replace the network cable and there is still no light, try unplug-
ging the cable from the hub/switch and plug it into another port.
Choose one of the other computers connected to the hub/switch that
works, unplug it, and plug the broken computer into that port for test-
ing. Occasionally a single port on a hub or switch will go bad; just mark
it as bad and don’t use it anymore. But if all computers connected to the
hub/switch stop working, it’s probably the hub or switch that has gone
south. If the hub/switch is still under warranty, I recommend getting it
fixed or replaced.
✦If you replace the cable, try a different port on the hub, and other
computers work fine on that hub/switch, the NIC inside your com-
puter has possibly gone bad.
If you reach this determination, call your local service center to have it
looked at and repaired. If you have an older model where the NIC was
added instead of built in, you can simply replace the NIC yourself.
The key when troubleshooting physical problems is the link/speed light on
the hub or switch. If the link/speed light still won’t work, the problem isn’t
likely a physical problem. You need to start troubleshooting the network
configuration on the computer itself.
Network configuration problems
After checking the physical layer, look for problems in the network settings.
When using TCP/IP on your network, look for these specific things: the
TCP/IP configuration mode, IP address, subnet mask, and router IP address
(if you’re using a router to connect to the Internet or other networks). To
check these settings, choose Apple➪System Preferences➪Network to bring
up the Network dialog.
✦Make sure the Configuration drop-down list on the TCP/IP Properties
tab is set to the appropriate option. Select the Using DHCP option only if
you’re using a cable/DSL modem/router or other DHCP server.
Otherwise, set this to Manually.
✦To check your Internet connectivity to the rest of the Internet, try ping-
ing www.apple.com — this checks the router and DNS settings.
✦If you’re set up for DHCP and your TCP/IP settings remain blank, make
sure that your DHCP server — which could be your cable/DSL
modem/router — is turned on and working properly.
✦If the configuration is set to Manually, check the IP Address, DNS
Servers, Router, and Subnet Mask fields to make sure that they’re cor-
rect. If you’re not sure whether your Subnet Mask field entry is correct,
you can usually make it the same as other computers on the same net-
work with you. Most times, the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0.

H
ere’s one of those incredibly complex concepts that you always find
in these computer books: After you have your network all set up and
ready to go, you can do all kinds of things with it. (Now wasn’t that painless?)
You can use your network to share files, share printers, remotely control
your Mac, or even play multi-user games like Unreal Tournament 2003 against
other friends. To keep your files safe from unwanted snoops, you can con-
figure the Mac OS X built-in firewall. In this chapter, I cover the basics of file
sharing, sharing printers, and using the firewall to protect yourself from
intruders.
It’s All about (File) Sharing
One of the main reasons for building a network is sharing files between com-
puters. You might even want to set up a server, which is a computer with
shared files that are always available to anyone on the network. Think of a
server as a common file storage area for the rest of the network. Really, any
computer that shares files is technically a server because it’s serving, so to
speak. But usually most people only use the word server to mean a com-
puter that’s dedicated solely to serving files, printers, and so on for the rest
of the network.
Creating an account
Sharing files on your Mac with other Mac users is a piece of cake. Keep
some basic things in mind, though, to make everything go smoothly. First,
you need to create an account, with a username and password, on your

It’s All about (File) Sharing
494
computer to allow others access to the files on your Mac. Second, you
need to create an account for anyone whom you want to have access to
your files. The accounts that you create can only access two folders, shown
in Figure 2-1:
✦The account’s Home folder: That specific account’s Home folder carries
a short version of the username that’s in the Users folder on your hard
drive. Figure 2-1 shows the Home folder, which is noted with an icon that
looks like a house, for the chambers account (where chambers is the
short account name for Mark Chambers). The Home folder icon always
bears the short account name for the user who’s currently logged in.
✦The Shared folder: This folder is also in the Users folder on your hard
drive. Anyone with an account on your Mac can access the Shared
folder, so it’s a great place to keep common files that everyone wants
to copy or use.
By the way, a quick note about the drive names you’ll see in these fig-
ures. I’ve never liked that rather mundane Macintosh HD moniker, and
as I mention elsewhere in the book, I’m a huge (okay, really huge) fan of
Mozart — hence the drive name Disk Wolfgang. My other drive is an
external FireWire drive where I keep all beta builds of upcoming Mac OS
X versions . . . and it’s thoughtfully named FireWire Drive. (Technology
authors can be somewhat eccentric; chalk it up to our techno-nerd
beginnings. On the other hand, we never type e-mail messages in ALL
CAPITAL LETTERS.)

2. Click Accounts under the System section.
3. Click the New Account button, which carries a plus sign.
4. Fill in the appropriate information, including the name for the

It’s All about (File) Sharing
496
Enabling file sharing
When you enable file sharing, your files will be shared by using
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and/or AppleTalk,
depending on which protocols you’ve enabled. (To enable AppleTalk for
compatibility with older Macs on your network, see Book V, Chapter 3.)
Regardless of which protocol you use to share your files, follow these steps
to turn on sharing:
1. Open System Preferences either from the Apple menu or from the
Dock.
2. Click the Sharing icon under the Internet & Network section to open
the Sharing Preferences dialog.
3. On the Services panel, select the Personal File Sharing check box to
enable it.
After the computer thinks for a second, you see the message Personal
File Sharing On appear just above the Stop button. This lets you
know that file sharing is enabled.
Connecting to a shared resource
Toward the bottom of the Sharing dialog, you can see that other Macintosh
users can access your computer at afp://<ip address>, where ip
address is the IP address for your specific computer. When another Mac
user wants to connect to your shared files, that person can do the following:
1. Open the Finder and choose Go➪Connect to Server.
2. After the Connect to Server dialog opens, other Mac users can type
afp://<ip address> (where ip address is the IP address of your
Macintosh) and then click the Connect button.
Alternatively, you can click the Browse button in the Connect to Server
dialog and browse your network for available servers.
After clicking the Connect button of the Connect to Server dialog, you’ll be
prompted to choose whether you want to connect as a Guest or a
Registered User. To connect to the server as a Registered User, you must
supply the right username and password. If you connect as Guest, you don’t
have to supply a password, but you will have restricted access only to the
Public folder for each account on the system you connect to. If you connect
as a Registered User, ask an Admin user who controls that Mac to supply
you with the correct username and password.

Sharing a Connected Printer
497
Give the username and password that you created to the person using the
other Mac, and he can now access files in his Home folder on your Mac (as
well as any files in other user’s folders that have been defined as Public).
Sharing a Connected Printer
Sharing your printer for others to use is one of the best reasons to have
a network. Setting up your Mac to share your printer is very easy under
Mac OS X. Here’s a quick rundown of what you need to do:
1. Open System Preferences either from the Apple menu or from the
Dock.
2. Click the Sharing icon under the Internet & Network section to open
the Sharing Preferences dialog.
3. On the Services panel, select the Printer Sharing check box to
enable it.
There will be a slight pause while Mac OS X gets everything ready, but
when it’s done, you see the message Printer Sharing On appear just
above the Stop button. This lets you know that printer sharing is enabled.
After Printer Sharing is enabled, follow these steps to connect to that
printer from other computers on your network:
1. From your hard drive, choose Applications➪Utilities and then double-
click the Printer Setup Utility icon.
2. If you have a local printer attached, click the Add icon.
Otherwise you’ll be prompted to add a printer automatically when the
Printer Setup Utility opens. Click the Add button to begin the addition.
(For more on adding a printer with the Printer Setup Utility, see Book VI,
Chapter 4.)
3. From the dialog that opens, click the Add button.
4. From the top drop-down list box, select IP Printing.
5. Enter the IP address of the Macintosh that’s connected to the target
printer and then click the Add button.
You can also select Rendezvous from the drop-down box to automatically
recognize printers on your local network — printers just appear in your
Printer List automatically. It doesn’t get any easier than that!

Sharing Files to Windows Computers
498
Sharing Files to Windows Computers
If you’ve deigned to allow PCs running Windows on your network — a
generous gesture to the lower classes — you’ll probably want to also share
files with those computers. Sharing files with a Windows PC — actually a
Windows user — is very similar to sharing files with other Mac users.
Follow these steps:
1. Open System Preferences either from the Apple menu or from the Dock.
2. Click the Sharing icon under the Internet & Network section to open
the Sharing Preferences dialog.
3. On the Services panel, select the Windows Sharing check box to
enable it.
After a few moments, you see the message Windows Sharing On
appear just above the Stop button, confirming that you’re now open to
connections from the Great Unwashed Windows Horde.
Just like when sharing files with other Mac users, you will see a helpful
reminder toward the bottom that tells you what the Windows users will need
to type to gain access to your Mac. For example, on my network, a Windows
user would need to enter \\192.168.1.105\chambers to access the shared
files. Note: The IP address that you enter here changes for each computer
that you want to access.
Accessing File Shares on Windows Computers
If you allow a Windows PC to access your files, you’ll also probably want to
putter around with files on a Windows PC. Easy!
Using FTP on the Internet
Because FTP is a part of the TCP/IP suite, it
works on virtually every type of computer (over
both the Internet and your local area network).
So, assuming that you have your computer con-
nected to the Internet through a modem or a
LAN connection, everything that I discuss about
FTP and how to use it will apply to connecting
to FTP servers on the Internet as well. When
you connect to FTP servers on the Internet, you
can use the Fully Qualified Domain Name (or
FQDN for short) like ftp.apple.com instead
of an actual IP address. You can also use the
FTP server in Mac OS X to make files available
to friends on the Internet just as you would to
make them available on a LAN.

Accessing files on Windows computers relies on the Samba component (a
part of the UNIX foundation of Mac OS X). Follow these steps:
1. Choose Go➪Connect to Server from the Finder.
The Connect to Server dialog opens.
2. In the Address box, enter smb://<ip address>, where ip address is
the IP address of the Windows computer that you want to connect to.
3. Click the Connect button.
Depending on the type of account you have on the Windows PC,
Mac OS X might display an SMB (Server Message Block) authentication
dialog where you can enter your username and password. (Think secu-
rity for the Windows crowd.)
4. From the prompt to select which Windows shared drive you wish to
mount, select the desired shared drive from the drop-down list box.
5. If you’re accessing a file shared on a Windows 95 or Windows 98
computer, simply click OK to mount the share.
If you’re accessing a file shared on a Windows NT, 2000, or XP computer,
click the Authenticate button. Then enter your username and password,
click OK, and then click OK again to mount the share.
After you mount the shared drive, you’ll see it appear on your Desktop, just
like a Mac volume. You can use this drive just like any other drive on your
system. To disconnect from the Windows share, you can drag the icon to
the Trash on the Dock (which changes to an Eject icon when you start drag-
ging); press Ô+E; or hold Control, click the icon, and then choose Eject from
the menu that appears.
Using FTP to Access Files
FTP is part of the TCP/IP protocol suite — the hoary acronym FTP stands
for File Transfer Protocol. FTP is one of the oldest methods for sharing files
between computers; however, because it’s part of the TCP/IP protocol suite,
it can be used on many different kinds of computers, including those run-
ning just about any type of strange and arcane operating system. You can
still manage to exchange files regardless of whether you’re using Mac OS X,
Windows, OS/2, or UNIX. (Heck, even DOS can join the party.)
FTP is a client/server application. In plain English, this means that two
pieces make things tick: the server (which hosts the connection, rather like
a file server) and the client (which connects to the server). Mac OS X,
thanks to its UNIX foundation, has both an FTP server and client built in.
To use FTP, you need a computer running the FTP server software to give

Using FTP to Access Files
500
others access to files; then the other computer, or client, can connect to the
FTP server. After the connection is made, the client can either send files to
the server (uploading) or get files from the server (downloading). In this sec-
tion, I cover how to use FTP to give others access to your files as well as talk
about the FTP applications that come with Mac OS X.
Using the Mac OS X built-in FTP to share files
One way to give others access to your files is to run an FTP server on your
Mac. Mac OS X comes with an FTP server built in, so you just have to acti-
vate it. You might wonder why you’d use FTP to share files when you can
use Personal File Sharing or Windows File Sharing. The main advantage to
FTP is compatibility — not only can people on your LAN access files, but
anyone on the Internet can also access your files, regardless of the type of
machine that they’re using.
Just like with the other file sharing methods, you need to create a user
account on your computer before someone can connect to and get files from
your Mac. After you have accounts created for the users, you can enable
FTP sharing like this:
1. Open System Preferences either from the Apple menu or from the
Dock.
2. Click the Sharing icon under the Internet & Network section to open
the Sharing Preferences dialog.
3. Select the FTP Access check box to enable it.
You see the message FTP Access On appear above the Stop button,
which proclaims that FTP access is enabled. Also you can see toward
the bottom of the dialog that people can use ftp://<ip address>,
where ip address is the IP address of your Mac.
If you’re using an AirPort/AirPort Extreme Base Station or other cable/digi-
tal subscriber line (DSL) router to share your Internet connection, you need
to place the Mac that you want people on the Internet to access in a DMZ, or
demilitarized zone. Check your cable/DSL router documentation for more
information.
Using FTP from Terminal to transfer files
You can use FTP to transfer files with an FTP server by using the command
line interface (CLI); to use the CLI, you need to open a Terminal, or shell,
session. To use a Terminal session, click the Terminal icon in the Utilities
folder inside of the Applications folder, as shown in Figure 2-3. When you
open a Terminal session, you’ll be presented with a window that accepts
text commands. You’ll see a prompt that consists of your computer’s name

Book V
Chapter 2
Using Your
Network
Using FTP to Access Files
501
and the folder that you’re currently in, followed by your user ID. It’s at this
prompt where you type various FTP commands.
Figure 2-4 shows a quick FTP file transfer. If you look at the Terminal ses-
sion, you’ll see the complete process of connecting to an FTP server, logging
in, changing both the local and remote folders, and downloading a file.

Using FTP to Access Files
502
After you’re in the Terminal session, you’ll use a series of commands to con-
nect to another computer, move in and out of folders, and transfer files.
Below is a list of the basic commands that you need to use FTP as well as a
brief description of what each command does.
✦ftp: This command starts the FTP command line interface session. You
can tell that you’re in the FTP client application when you see ftp> as
your command prompt (see Figure 2-4). This is where you will type all
other FTP commands to do things.
✦open: This command is used to start your connection to another com-
puter. Type this command followed by the IP address of the FTP server
that you want to connect to.
✦ls: Use this command to see a listing of all files and folders in the cur-
rent folder on the FTP server.
✦cd: This command allows you to change the folder that you’re in. Type
cd <folder> (where folder is a specific folder name) to move into a
subfolder on the FTP server. Type cd .. to go back out a folder level.
✦lcd: This command acts exactly like cd except that it changes the folder
that you’re currently in on your local system, not the FTP server. Use
this command to put yourself in the folder on the local drive that you
want to transfer files to and from.
✦bin: Type this command to get in binary mode to transfer files that
aren’t plain text files. (Always use binary mode unless you’re specifically
transferring plain text files.)
✦ascii: This command puts you in ASCII mode for transferring text files.
✦get or mget: To retrieve a single file, use the get command followed by
the filename of the file that you want to retrieve. If you want to get multi-
ple files at once, use the mget command followed by a filename contain-
ing * and/or ? as wildcards.
✦put or mput: To send a single file, use the put command followed by
the filename to send a file to the FTP server. To send multiple files, use
the mput command followed by a filename containing * and/or ? as
wildcards.
✦quit: Use the quit command to end your FTP session.
To end a Terminal session at any time, type exit and press Return.
Many FTP servers will only let you send files to certain folders. Most times
this folder is named Upload, Uploads, or something similar.

Book V
Chapter 2
Using Your
Network
Using the Built-in Firewall
503
Using these commands will enable you to exchange files with an FTP server.
Here’s an example of how to use these commands within the Terminal
window:
1. Type ftp to get into FTP mode.
2. Type open <ip address> to open your connection to the FTP server.
3. At this point, you’ll be asked for a username and password.
For many FTP servers, using the username anonymous and your e-mail
address as the password is enough to get you logged in. On others, you
must use an assigned username and password provided by the adminis-
trator of that particular server.
4. Use the lcd <folder> (where folder is a specific folder name) com-
mand to change into the folder on your local drive that you want files
to come to/from.
5. Use the ls and cd commands to place yourself into the desired folder
on the FTP server.
6. Use the ascii or bin commands to set your file transfer mode to
ASCII or binary, respectively.
This is important because choosing the wrong type will likely cause the
transfer to fail. Unless it’s a plain text file, always use binary mode.
7. Use the get/mget/put/mput commands to send or receive the
desired files.
8. Use the quit command to close the connection and exit the FTP
session.
Using the Built-in Firewall
A firewall watches all the network communications coming into your Mac —
it automatically plays the role of security guard, blocking or denying certain
network traffic that you want to avoid from reaching your Mac. It acts as
another layer of security to help keep you safe from unwanted attacks.
That’s all well and good, but you must be careful to set up your firewall cor-
rectly before you turn it on: A configuration mistake could make your Mac
inaccessible from the network.
For instance, if you want to enable FTP access on your Mac but you also
want to keep all other traffic from coming into your Mac, you can tell the
built-in firewall to only allow FTP traffic. (The firewall on the Mac will only
block or allow TCP/IP traffic — not AppleTalk — so AppleTalk traffic is
always able to get in.)

Using the Built-in Firewall
504
When enabled, the firewall, by default, will block all traffic that comes into
your Mac — by default, however, the firewall is turned off. So, your first job
is to enable the firewall, following these steps:
1. Open System Preferences from the Apple menu or the Dock.
2. Click the Sharing icon.
3. Click the Firewall tab, as shown in Figure 2-5.
4. Click the Start button.
This will enable the firewall — and, by default, all incoming TCP/IP traffic
will be blocked. You must enable each sharing method that you want to be
able to use; as you enable different sharing methods, such as Personal File
Sharing or FTP Access, you might notice that under the Firewall tab, those
types of traffic now have a check mark in the box for each type of traffic.
(In other words, when you turn on a sharing method, the firewall automati-
cally allows traffic for that sharing method. Most excellent.)
Figure 2-5:

firewall in
Mac OS X.

Book V
Chapter 2
Using Your
Network
Using the Built-in Firewall
505
Sometimes you might want to allow other traffic through your firewall that
isn’t on the list. At that point, you can click the New button to create a new
definition for your firewall to use. The resulting dialog has a drop-down list
with some common things that you might want to allow, such as America
Online (AOL) Instant Messenger, ICQ, and MSN Messenger.
If you need to add ports for another application that’s not in that drop-down
list — for instance, a multiplayer game — you need to select Other from the
Port Name drop-down list (as shown in Figure 2-6). Then you can enter a
port number, a port range, or a series of ports. You might need to check the
documentation for a specific application to see which ports it uses.
Ports are like an extension to an IP address. For example, when you commu-
nicate with a Web server, you send a request not only to that Web server’s
IP address, but you send it on port 80 — the standard port for HyperText
Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic. Different applications use different port
numbers, so you need to check which ports are used when you want to
adjust your firewall to allow that traffic.

Remote Control of Your Mac
506
Remote Control of Your Mac
Forgive me whilst I wax techno-nerd here: One of the coolest advantages to
a network is the ability to take control of one computer from another com-
puter. For example, sometimes you might need to access files on your Mac
while you’re on a trip, but you don’t have Personal File Sharing enabled.
What can you do? You can remotely connect into your Mac and then — just
as if you were sitting in front of it — enable Personal File Sharing (as I
demonstrate earlier in the chapter). Perhaps you have a file on your com-
puter with someone’s phone number that you suddenly need on the road —
with remote control, it’s at your fingertips! (Sigh . . . ah, technology.)
Remote control your Mac (for free, no less!)
Virtual Network Computer (VNC; www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/) is a
very nice application that enables you to remotely control a computer from
pretty much anywhere that has an Internet connection. VNC is easy to
install and configure, but the best feature is that it’s free. VNC can run on
many different platforms, ranging from Mac OS X and UNIX on desktop com-
puters and servers to Palm OS and Windows CE on personal digital assis-
tants (PDAs). Wrap your mind around this: You could be at a friend’s house
on her wireless network and use your PDA to remotely control your Mac at
home over the Internet. Pure, undiluted sassy!
Some networks have proxies and firewalls that might interfere with VNC’s
operation. You can remotely control a computer that’s behind a firewall or
cable/DSL router, but the firewall/router needs to be configured properly.
Because the process varies from one manufacturer to the next, check your
cable/DSL router manual for instructions on how to do this.
Speaking of firewalls, make sure that you configure the Mac OS X firewall to
allow VNC traffic — follow the steps that I outline in the previous section
and select VNC from the Port Name drop-down list.
How VNC works
In a nutshell, VNC takes the graphical interface on your monitor, turns it into
data, and sends it to the computer that you’re using to remotely control it.
The computer that you’re using sends keyboard presses, mouse movements,
and clicks to it, acting just the same way it would if you were sitting right in
front of it.
A specific version of VNC is available for Mac OS X which, ironically enough,
is called OSXvnc. You can download OSXvnc at http://netmath.math.
uiuc.edu/VNC-osx.htm. There you’ll find instructions on how to install
and set up OSXvnc. Figure 2-7 shows a screenshot of a Mac running OSXvnc
being remotely controlled from a computer running Windows 98.

Book V
Chapter 2

507
Mr. Paranoia speaks again: Make doggone sure that you set up the pass-
word access correctly for OSXvnc, or don’t run it! I can’t stress enough
how much fun a hacker would have with free remote control over your
Desktop.
Remote control of another computer from your Mac
A few different VNC viewers exist for Mac OS X. A VNC viewer is just an
application you use to remotely control your computer running VNC. You
can download them at www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/platforms.html.
If you find yourself on a computer without a VNC viewer — heaven forbid —
VNC server actually runs over the Web as well! As long as the computer that
you’re using has a Web browser that supports Java — which Safari and
Internet Explorer do — you can still remotely control your computer.
When you connect to the computer running VNC using a Web browser, the
Web server sends a default page that contains a Java applet. That Java
applet asks you for the password to connect, and upon entering the correct
password, it brings up the remote control session right in the Web browser.
Good golly, Molly!

 Using Mac OS X to access AppleTalk resources
W
hen emoting concerning networking and Macs, I’d be terribly remiss
for not discussing AppleTalk, which is the so-called “archaic” com-
munications protocol created years ago by Apple. AppleTalk allows a net-
work of Macs to share files and printers; before the arrival of an Ethernet
port, AppleTalk was the cat’s meow for connecting Macs. AppleTalk is still
used in environments like homes, offices, and college campuses — however,
AppleTalk is disappearing from the corporate world because it simply
cannot scale (that’s administrator-speak for grow) to handle large networks
like standard Ethernet and Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
(TCP/IP) can.
Although Apple finally made the move to TCP/IP as its primary network
protocol — like the rest of the civilized world — Apple still includes support
for AppleTalk in Mac OS X Panther. About the only time when you might need
to use AppleTalk is if you find yourself trying to access an existing AppleTalk
network (which is practically the definition of the phrase rare occurrence) . . .
but hey, I like to cover everything in a desktop reference. Therefore, in this
chapter, I show you how to enable the AppleTalk protocol on your Mac as
well as how to access files and printers on a network that’s running
AppleTalk.
Setting Up AppleTalk
Just like most network configuration tasks under the Big X, configuring your
Mac to use AppleTalk and play well with others in an AppleTalk network
isn’t very difficult. In this section, I talk about how to configure the settings
in the Network dialog of System Preferences so that you can join the file
sharing and network printing party.

Setting Up AppleTalk
510
Do you need to add an older Mac to a future Ethernet network that currently
exists only on the back of a napkin? For more information on setting up a
local Mac Ethernet network, see Chapter 1 of this mini-book.
You can configure AppleTalk on Mac OS X in two ways: manually or automat-
ically. I’ll bet you could see this Mark’s Maxim coming from a mile away:
Automatic is always good.
Unless you’re designing your AppleTalk network to work through routers
with other AppleTalk networks or you’re given specific AppleTalk settings
by a network administrator, I highly recommend using the automatic
AppleTalk configuration. However, I cover both methods in this chapter just
to be on the safe side. (That’s just the kind of guy I am.)
Automatically configuring AppleTalk
To automatically configure AppleTalk, follow these steps.
1. Choose System Preferences from the Apple menu or the Dock.
2. From the System Preferences dialog that appears, click the Network
icon to open the Network Preferences dialog.
3. Click the Show drop-down list box and click Built-in Ethernet.
4. Click the AppleTalk tab to display the AppleTalk settings page, as
shown in Figure 3-1.
AppleTalk history: LocalTalk
When Apple first begat AppleTalk, it also intro-
duced a network cabling system and a protocol
to move the AppleTalk data through the network:
LocalTalk. LocalTalk was basically Apple’s ver-
sion of Ethernet that ran over special cables that
connected to each Mac’s printer port. Because
LocalTalk used the Mac printer port to commu-
nicate, it ran at a not-so-speedy 230 Kbps, or
230,000 bits per second (compared with Ethernet
running at 10 Mbps, or 10 million bits per
second). Eventually Apple standardized with
Ethernet, and LocalTalk went away; AppleTalk
now runs over standard Ethernet networks, just
like TCP/IP. (Remember, you won’t be tested
on this stuff — it’s just trivia for the pumped-up
Panther power users in the audience.)

5. Select (mark) the Make AppleTalk Active check box and then click the
Apply Now button.
Mac OS X defaults to using the automatic AppleTalk configuration mode,
as shown in the Configure drop-down list in Figure 3-1. Now, I know this
is going to be hard to believe, but you’re done!
Now your Mac is configured to use the AppleTalk protocol to share and
access files and printers. AppleTalk is ready to go as soon as you click the
Apply Now button, but you won’t notice anything special when you turn on
AppleTalk. (Like TCP/IP, AppleTalk is invisible in Mac OS X until you use it.)
Check the “Accessing Files and Printers with AppleTalk” section later in this
chapter to actually start using AppleTalk to do stuff.
Manually configuring AppleTalk
Although not as simple as using the automatic configuration, manually con-
figuring AppleTalk is quite easy as well. To manually configure AppleTalk,
follow these steps:
Figure 3-1:

tion is a

1. Choose System Preferences from the Apple menu or the Dock.
2. From the System Preferences dialog that appears, click the Network

3. Click the Show drop-down list box and click Built-in Ethernet.
4. Click the AppleTalk tab to display the AppleTalk settings page.
5. From the Configure drop-down list, select Manually.
When you do, two more text boxes appear where you can enter informa-
tion, as Figure 3-2 illustrates: Node ID and Network ID. Unless you’re
the network administrator — check to see whether you’re surrounded
by a glowing aura of authority and wisdom — you must obtain these
two ID numbers from that glowing individual who is administering your
network.
Only use manual configuration if you’re designing an AppleTalk network
or you have information from a network administrator on the correct set-
tings to use. If you enter the wrong settings, you won’t be able to com-
municate with other Macs on your network . . . but at least you don’t
need to worry about blowing something up or watching your Mac melt.
6. After you enter the appropriate Node ID and Network ID, click the
Apply Now button to save those settings.

Accessing Files and Printers with AppleTalk
513
Accessing Files and Printers with AppleTalk
After you have AppleTalk configured and ready to go, you can share files
and printers from your Mac. If you’re wondering what to do after AppleTalk
is enabled, the following sections show you how to share your files and
printers as well as how to access files and printers that others have shared
on the network.
Accessing AppleTalk share points
Accessing share points — a collection of files that are shared to the network —
by using AppleTalk is much like accessing other shared files with Internet
Protocol (IP). In this section, I talk about finding AppleTalk servers, connect-
ing to AppleTalk share points, and how to disconnect when you are done.
Follow these steps each time when you start your computer or if you get
disconnected for any reason.
Even though a server version of Mac OS X exists that is meant to run on cor-
porate servers that do nothing but serve up files and printers to people, in
this entire section, I use the word server to simply mean any Mac or other
computer that has AppleTalk running and is sharing files or printers.
A word about Zones
The final option on the AppleTalk settings page
is the AppleTalk Zone drop-down list box. (Stick
with me here, things are going to get technically
flamboyant for a few sentences, but it can’t be
helped.) Zones are logical groupings of comput-
ers that an AppleTalk network administrator cre-
ates for ease of use. For example, consider a
large company that employs many graphic
artists: This company has many buildings, but
because of how the business has grown, the
graphic artists are spread between several dif-
ferent locations in different buildings. An
AppleTalk network administrator would likely
have created a Graphics Zone that contains all
the Macs and servers and printers that make up
the graphics department; this way, the artists
can get to files on servers or print to printers that
are meant for them simply by putting themselves
in the Graphics Zone. This works as a handy
way to keep people who are physically separate
logically grouped into a common area, or Zone.
(Think of Zones as a convenience thing — they
don’t help your system performance.)
When you configure AppleTalk, you might or
might not need to set the AppleTalk Zone. If
you’re on a network where the administrator
has configured AppleTalk Zones, you’ll see a list
of all the Zones by clicking the AppleTalk Zone
drop-down list; from there, simply select the
name of the Zone that you want to participate
in. If you’re on a network where no Zones are
configured, the AppleTalk Zone drop-down box
will be grayed out and unavailable — and if you
can’t choose a Zone anyway, don’t worry about
it. (In other words, don’t let your lack of
AppleTalk Zones spoil that upcoming trip to
Vegas.)

Accessing Files and Printers with AppleTalk

Choosing an AppleTalk server
To choose an AppleTalk server, perform the following steps:
1. From the Finder, choose Go➪Connect to Server or press Option+K on
the keyboard.
This brings up the Connect To Server dialog (as shown in Figure 3-3).
2. From this dialog, click the Browse button.
Your Mac searches the local network for any AppleTalk servers and dis-
plays a Finder window listing all the available servers.
3. Double-click the icon representing the appropriate AppleTalk server
that contains the share point that you want to access.
4. After you choose the AppleTalk server, click the Connect button.
To help cut down on the time that it takes to connect to this same server in
the future, just click the Add button (which proudly bears a plus sign), and
the server’s path is added to the Favorite Servers list. The next time that
you need to connect to that server, you need only double-click the server
entry in the Favorite Servers list. (This works for all servers, not just the
AppleTalk variety.) Ain’t life grand?
Panther also maintains a list of the servers that you’ve connected to
recently, even if they don’t appear in the Favorite Servers list. Click the
Recent Servers button (which carries a clock icon) and then click the
desired server from the menu.

Connecting to the AppleTalk server
Each time that you want to access files or printers via AppleTalk, you must
connect to the server. To connect to an AppleTalk server, you need to con-
nect as a Guest or, if you have a username and password for that server, as a
Registered User. After clicking the Connect button of the Connect to Server
dialog, you’ll be prompted to choose whether you want to connect as a
Guest or a Registered User.
If you’re connecting to the server as a Registered User, you must supply the
right username and password. If you connect as a Guest, you don’t have to
supply a password, but you will have restricted access only to the Shared
folder that appears in the Users folder on each system that you connect to. If
you connect as a Registered User, you need to get the correct username and
password from the person who is in control of user accounts on a given Mac.
Before you click the Connect button to complete the connection, consider
whether you’d like to automate things in the future. If so, enable the
Remember Password (Add to Keychain) check box. Enabling this check box
saves the username and password for this connection so that you don’t
have to manually type it in each time that you reconnect to this particular
share point (particularly handy if you connect to a share point every time
that you use your Mac). However, use this option only if your Mac is in a
secure location, or if you can be sure that others won’t use this connection.
Inviting those Windows types to visit
Of course, those Windows people won’t let us
forget that a lot more Windows users are out
there than Mac users. Sigh . . . you’ll probably
find yourself sometime on a network with
people running Windows. True, it’s easy for Mac
OS X users to get to files on Windows systems
(see Book V, Chapter 2). However, you might
want access available for those Windows folks
to get to your Mac files or to perhaps share
printers between the Mac and Windows.
Panther makes it easy to share files: Open your
System Preferences, click Sharing, and then
enable the Windows Sharing check box on
the Services panel. Press Ô+Q to save your
changes, and boom! — you’re done.
Another option is to run the third-party utility PC
MACLAN (www.miramarsys.com) on your
Windows PCs. PC MACLAN allows bidirectional
file sharing using both IP and AppleTalk, as well
as allowing Macs and PCs to share printers
both ways. It’s about $200, so I’d definitely rec-
ommend that you try Panther’s built-in Windows
Sharing feature first!

Accessing Files and Printers with AppleTalk
516
Choosing a share point from the AppleTalk server
Whether or not you chose to play with the connection options, finalize the
connection by clicking the Connect button after choosing to log in as a
Guest or a Registered User. After you click Connect, you see a list of share
points on AppleTalk server.
Double-click the icon for the share point that you want. You see a network
drive appear on your Desktop, which you can treat as you would any other
attached drive.
Disconnecting from the share point
When you’re done using the share point, you can disconnect from the share
point in a few different ways:
✦Control+click the network drive Desktop icon and choose Eject from the
contextual menu that appears.
✦Click the network drive Desktop icon to highlight it and then choose
Eject from the File menu.
✦Click the network drive Desktop icon to highlight it and then press
Option+E.
✦Click and drag the network drive Desktop icon to the Trash on the
Dock — the Trash will change into an Eject icon when dragging a net-
work drive. Simple but sassy.
Accessing AppleTalk printers
The other major thing (besides file sharing) that you can do with AppleTalk
is to connect to and use AppleTalk network printers. Again, like most things
under Mac OS X, it’s pretty straightforward and easy.
Adding an AppleTalk printer
Before you can print to an AppleTalk printer, you first need to add that
printer to your setup. Follow these steps to add a printer:
1. Open your hard drive from the Desktop, double-click the Applications
folder, double-click the Utilities folder, and then double-click the
Printer Setup Utility icon.
This opens the Printer Setup Utility.
2. When you’re prompted to add a printer the first time that you open
the Printer Setup Utility, as seen in Figure 3-4, click Add to start the
process.

If you’ve already opened Printer Setup Utility and have already added
printers in the past, you add another network printer by clicking the
Add button.
3. From the resulting Printer List sheet, select AppleTalk from the top
drop-down box.
You see a list of all the AppleTalk shared printers that your Mac sees on
the network, as shown in Figure 3-5.
4. (Optional.) If you’re on a network with more than just the local Zone,
you might need to select the appropriate Zone from the second drop-
down box before you will see the desired printer.
5. After you select the desired printer, select the proper printer from
the Printer Model drop-down list at the bottom of the Printer List
dialog.
If the needed printer model isn’t in this list, you might have to select
Other here and provide your Mac with the right printer files to use this
new printer. Choosing Generic from the list will work with most printers,
but you’re restricted to text-only output and don’t have access to spe-
cial features like tray selection or print quality.

6. Click the Add button to complete the process.
You can now treat this as any other printer that could be connected
directly to your machine. You can view the print queue and hold,
resume, and delete print jobs from the Queue menu.
Removing an AppleTalk printer
Removing an AppleTalk printer that you’ve connected to is very simple.
From the Printer Setup Utility, click once on the printer that you wish to
remove and then either click the Delete icon in the Printer Setup Utility tool-
bar or choose Delete Printer from the Printers menu.

N
owadays, wireless connectivity is king. For example, cell phones have
gone from being something only the technological elite could afford to
being a permanent fixture on the hip of the common man. The shorts that
I’m wearing right now have a special pocket just for a cell phone to ride in;
when I’m without my phone, it usually carries a Zagnut candy bar. (Perhaps
that was too personal . . . sorry.)
Because people have become accustomed to being able to keep in touch
wherever they are, they also want to be able to have access to their net-
work, at least within their house or workplace, without the hassle of cables.
(Which, by the way, are magnets for pets that enjoy a good chewing.) This
desire for convenience and the advances in wireless technology have com-
bined to bring you the concept of the wireless network (and wireless coffee
shops, and wireless access providers, and even wireless gaming centers).
Now you can be connected to your home local area network (LAN) and your
shared Internet connection (which I cover in Book V, Chapter 5) from your
balcony, deck, lounge chair in the yard, or even your bedroom. In this chap-
ter, I talk about how wireless networks work, and then I give you a lot of
information to help you get the right pieces to free yourself — securely, mind
you — from the world of the wired.
Speaking the Wireless Lingo
Wireless networks aren’t all that different from their wired siblings. In this
chapter, I discuss some of the features and limitations of wireless network-
ing, but you must first be familiar with a foundation of information.

Speaking the Wireless Lingo
520
Because of the technology involved in wireless networks and how things are
changing rapidly in this area, you’ll find yourself swimming in a sea of
acronyms and other technobabble. Although you don’t need to know every
little detail to be able to set up your own wireless network, you should know
some of these terms so that you can avoid getting stung by hackers or stuck
with equipment that’s on the verge of obsolescence. Here is a quick list of
terms that you’ll see on your road to becoming a wireless network guru:
✦WLAN: WLAN stands for Wireless LAN. If you’ve already read previous
chapters in this mini-book, a LAN (local area network) is just a bunch of
computers and other devices connected together.
✦IEEE: The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. This is an
organization that approves standards which allow computers, network
equipment, and just about anything else electronic to play nicely
together. Sometimes IEEE helps create these standards before approv-
ing them, and sometimes it just approves standards that others have
produced.
✦802.11: This is the part of the IEEE standards that deals specifically with
wireless networking. Although wireless is usually generically referred to
as wireless networks, it’s all really a wireless form of Ethernet.
✦Wireless Access Point: A Wireless Access Point, or WAP, is a device
that allows wireless network devices to connect to a wired Ethernet
network.
✦Service Set Identifier: The Service Set Identifier, or SSID, is used to tell
your computer the name of the wireless network that you want to use.
✦Wired Equivalency Protocol: Wired Equivalency Protocol, or WEP, is an
encryption that wireless networks can use to keep your wireless net-
work more secure from snoopers and hackers.
✦Ad Hoc mode: An Ad Hoc wireless network is one where each wireless
device talks directly with all other wireless devices. Apple calls this
mode a computer-to-computer network.
✦Infrastructure mode: This is where all wireless devices talk to a WAP,
and the WAP then talks to other wireless devices and the wired network.
As I cover the different parts of wireless networking and how to set it up,
you’ll find yourself using these terms over and over. Before you know it,
you’ll be spouting these wireless-related acronyms like a pro. (No, really.)

Figuring Out the Different Flavors
of Wireless Ethernet
One of the first things that you might notice when you start looking into
wireless networking is the different wireless standards. You should at least
be aware that these different standards exist: That way, you can be sure to
get wireless network components that will work together because some of
the different wireless standards are not compatible. (Feel free to photocopy
this list and stick it on your fridge door.)
IEEE 802.11b
IEEE 802.11b has another name that you’ll likely see on product advertise-
ments, literature, or boxes in stores: Wi-Fi, which stands for Wireless
Fidelity. (Kinda like that cutting-edge Hi-Fi stereo from the ’60s and ’70s,
where Hi-Fi stands for High Fidelity.) When you see Wi-Fi, you know that it’s
802.11b. Wi-Fi was the first version of wireless Ethernet. This version of wire-
less runs at speeds up to 11 million bits per second, or 11 Mbps. The reason
why I say that it runs at speeds up to 11Mbps is because the actual speed
that the data is transferred depends on things like signal strength and qual-
ity. When the conditions are such that your signal strength or quality is
decreased — such as an inconvenient concrete wall between you and your
AirPort Base Station — you might find that your wireless connection
changes down to 5.5 Mbps, 2 Mbps, or even as slow as 1 Mbps.
Most available wireless Ethernet equipment, including Apple’s AirPort net-
work cards and standard-issue AirPort Base Station, uses 802.11b. In fact,
it’s time for Mac owners to swell with pride yet again: Apple was the first
computer company to ship 802.11b hardware. (Back then, in 1999, it was the
original AirPort Base Station.) Now, of course, Apple has raised the bar with
AirPort Extreme, which I discuss later in this chapter.
In general, Wi-Fi network cards have the ability to communicate with other
Wi-Fi devices and WAPs that are up to 1,000 feet away. Having said that, real-
ize that 1,000 feet is a generous estimate when outdoors on a clear day with
no wind blowing — you see what I’m getting at. In reality, when you set up
your wireless network, things such as walls — especially concrete walls, like
in basements — decrease the distance that you can cover. If you use a WAP,
plan on no more than 150 feet between wireless computers and the WAP.
However, your mileage may vary.

Figuring Out the Different Flavors of Wireless Ethernet
522
Wireless Ethernet networks operate just like wired Ethernet networks that
use a hub (see Book V, Chapter 1 for more info on hubs). This means that
the 11 Mbps bandwidth is shared between all computers using it. Collisions
can also occur if more than one computer tries to communicate at the same
time. If you have a lot of people on your wireless network, the network can
and will get noticeably slower because of increased collisions. Remember
that the total bandwidth is shared between the computers on the wireless
network. This applies not only to Wi-Fi but also to the 802.11a (which I cover
in the next section) and the 802.11g standards.
One last thing about 802.11b networking: Wi-Fi uses the 2.4 GHz frequency
range. It actually uses 11 different channels, but they’re all around the 2.4
GHz range. I bring this up because if you’re using a 2.4 GHz cordless phone
or even a microwave, using either device can definitely interfere with or
even shut down your wireless network. Keep this in mind when you buy
your next phone or wonder why your file transfers stop when you’re com-
muning with Orville Redenbacher in the microwave.
802.11a
802.11a is a newer version of wireless Ethernet. No, I didn’t get my letters
mixed up. For some reason that I don’t know (or understand), 802.11b came
out first, and 802.11a came out next. (I guess someone ran into a door-
frame.) Anyway, 802.11a doesn’t yet have a handy nickname like Wi-Fi, so
just call it 802.11a.
802.11a isn’t all that much different than Wi-Fi, but the few differences make
a big impact. First off, 802.11a can run at speeds up to 54 Mbps — almost
five times faster than Wi-Fi. This is because 802.11a uses the 5 GHz fre-
quency range instead of the cluttered 2.4 GHz range that Wi-Fi uses. The
powers that be set aside the 5 GHz range just for wireless networking, so
cordless phones and microwaves (or any other wireless devices for that
matter) can’t interfere with the network. The downside to using the higher 5
GHz range, though, is that the distances that can be covered are even less
than that of Wi-Fi — no more than about 60 feet to maintain the highest
speeds.
802.11a equipment is starting to become easier to find. However, 802.11a
equipment isn’t compatible with Wi-Fi, so don’t make the mistake of buying
both 802.11b and 802.11a network equipment. Instead, I recommend that
you follow the AirPort Extreme course charted by Apple, and use 802.11g
(which is backward-compatible with Wi-Fi).

Book V
Chapter 4
Going Wireless
Keeping Your Wireless Network Secure
523
Let’s get Extreme: 802.11g
Although some hardware manufacturers have designed equipment that will
handle both Wi-Fi and 802.11a, Apple’s release of AirPort Extreme provides
both the speed of 802.11a and the compatibility with Wi-Fi. That’s because it
uses a new standard, 802.11g, which operates at speeds up to 54 Mbps (like
802.11a) but will also operate at the same frequency ranges and play nicely
with existing 802.11b equipment. (Notice that we’re heading in the right
direction again when it comes to naming conventions. Go figure.)
Oh, and did I mention that Apple is once again the first company to offer
802.11g hardware as standard equipment? Feel free to enjoy the Superiority
Dance yet again as you use AirPort Extreme.
Naturally, there is a downside: 802.11g returns to that pesky 2.4 GHz range,
so your cordless phone and microwave can also wreak the same havoc that
they did with your original AirPort equipment.
I should also mention Bluetooth — a strange name for a wireless standard, I
admit, but it works like a charm. Bluetooth devices use 2.4 GHz as well, but
they’re designed only for very short distances . . . only about 30 feet.
Bluetooth is the future for linking mobile devices (like personal digital assis-
tants and cell phones) and external peripherals (like wireless keyboards and
mice) to your Mac. Panther provides built-in support for Bluetooth through
the iSync application.
Keeping Your Wireless Network Secure
Are you worried about the security of your AirPort wireless network? You
should be, bunkie. As you might (or might not) know, the government has
said that intercepting calls made from wireless phones isn’t a violation of
privacy. Because of the similarities between wireless phones and wireless
networks, it stands to reason that if/when a court has to make a determina-
tion, it will most likely determine that it’s not illegal for someone in the next
apartment or house — or standing right in your street — to listen to and
intercept your data from your wireless network.
But before you decide to toss the idea of a wireless network, keep this in
mind: Even though it is technically possible that someone might camp out
on your doorstep in order to gain access to your wireless network, for
most home networks, this possibility isn’t very probable. Even if someone
tries to gain access to your wireless network and perhaps even sniff your
network — a techno-nerd term meaning to record all the data flying around
a network — there isn’t a whole lot someone can do with that information.

Keeping Your Wireless Network Secure
524
If a friend invites you for an evening of war driving, think “recreational
mobile hacking.” War driving is the act of driving through neighborhoods in
a car equipped with a laptop computer and a wireless network card. The
payoff? If the hacker is lucky enough to locate a house with an open wireless
network, we’re talking free wireless Internet access . . . from the comfort of
his car! Again, keep security in mind when installing wireless hardware, and
these bozos will get nothing from your network.
You might say, “But I use my credit card on the Internet to buy stuff.” Well,
this is a valid concern. However, if you purchase things on the Internet with
your credit card, you should already be using a secure connection provided
by the Web site for your personal information so that the data you’re send-
ing across your wireless network is already encrypted and relatively safe
from thieves. “But I have shared out my files on my computer. Can they
access those file shares?” Another good question, but if you read Book V,
Chapter 2, you have to create an account for those whom you want to
access your files. Unless the would-be hacker is very good at guessing user-
names and passwords, your files are pretty safe, too.
This is not to say that you bear absolutely no risk of being hacked. If a legiti-
mate user on your wireless network connects to your computer and starts
transferring a file, a would-be hacker could potentially record all the traffic
and then reconstruct the file that was sent from the data that was recorded.
In other words, a hacker could grab that user’s username and password.
That’s where WEP comes in.
WEP
Wired Equivalency Protocol, or WEP, is A Good Thing (even if it makes for
a silly-sounding acronym). It’s an encryption scheme that can be used on
your wireless network. WEP is a part of all 802.11 standards, so all your 
Wi-Fi equipment supports WEP. Apple’s implementation of WEP comes in
two varieties: 40-bit and 128-bit. The more bits used in the encryption,
the better it is.
To use WEP, you need to select a WEP key, which is really just a code word.
The longer the key, the better. Also, when making a key, be sure to use some-
thing like ab8sher7234ksief87 (something that’s random with letters and num-
bers) as opposed to something like mykey that’s easily guessed. If you’re
using an Ad Hoc wireless network, all the computers need to have their wire-
less network card configured with the same WEP key in order to communi-
cate. If you’re using a WAP to connect to the rest of the network, you need to
use the same key on your computers that you’ve configured on your WAP.

Book V
Chapter 4
Going Wireless
Keeping Your Wireless Network Secure
525
One thing to note about WEP is that it has been broken, meaning that some-
one has figured out how to undo the encryption that WEP provides. For
businesses, especially those with sensitive data, WEP is not a good security
solution.
However, for home users, WEP works well as a deterrent to keep people out.
In order for someone to crack your WEP key, that person needs to record
somewhere around 1 million encrypted packets or more. For a business,
that might only be an hour or so of monitoring for a hacker, but for most
home networks, this could take much longer. Remember that a typical home
network carries much less traffic than a business network. So, not only
would someone need to pitch a tent outside on your porch, he would need
to be able to record at least a million of the packets going over your network
and then have the knowledge to crack your encryption key. Although WEP
isn’t going to ward off the spies at the National Security Agency, it’s good
enough to protect home networks like yours and mine.
Other security standards
Although all Wi-Fi network equipment supports WEP, a few standards are
worth mentioning: LEAP and 802.11x.
Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP) is a protocol devel-
oped by Cisco Systems. To use LEAP, you need to have a server that’s set up
to enable users to log in to gain permission to the wireless network. After
you initially log in (authenticate) to your network, LEAP changes encryption
keys on the fly at a time interval that you determine. You could set it so that
every 15 minutes, your encryption key is changed: Even if someone is in
that hypothetical tent on your front lawn, he would never be able to record
enough packets to figure out your key because it changes so often.
Setting up a server so that you can use LEAP isn’t something for the novice
to attempt. I would encourage you to read up on LEAP only if you are very
serious about airtight security on your WLAN. The Cisco Web site (www.
cisco.com) is a good place to read about LEAP.
All the Apple AirPort 2.0 and AirPort Extreme wireless network cards and
base stations are compatible with Cisco’s LEAP for higher security.
The other thing worth mentioning is the new upcoming wireless security
standard from IEEE: 802.11x. This new standard will take care of the weak-
nesses in WEP. Right now, IEEE is still trying to hammer out many of the fine
details; however, the final 802.11x standard will probably be based on a

Setting Up Your Wireless Network
526
system very similar to Cisco’s LEAP. After 801.11x is ratified (agreed on and
finalized) by IEEE, expect to see it integrated with the other 802.11 stan-
dards. For most 802.11b/a/g hardware, a simple software update will be all
that’s required to support the new standard.
Setting Up Your Wireless Network
On to the good stuff. This section describes installing an AirPort Extreme
card as well as how to set up an Ad Hoc or infrastructure-based WLAN
(wireless LAN).
Installing an AirPort Extreme network card
Some Macs come with an AirPort (802.11b) or AirPort Extreme (802.11g)
card built in, especially if you ordered one pre-installed. However, if your
Mac doesn’t have either type of AirPort card installed, you can usually add
one yourself. Naturally, older Macs don’t have a slot or antenna for an
AirPort card, such as the Indigo iMac with a 350 MHz CPU. However, all Mac
models in production at the time of this writing do have a slot for an AirPort
card. You just need to check www.info.apple.com/applespec to see
whether your particular Mac can use an AirPort card.
Using non-Apple wireless equipment
with AirPort Extreme equipment
Because of Apple’s implementation of AirPort
Extreme, keep in mind some things when trying
to mix Apple wireless equipment with other
vendors’ 802.11b or 802.11g equipment. As you
discover elsewhere in this chapter, using
AirPort wireless networks can require a pass-
word, which corresponds to the 802.11b/g
WEP key for encryption. However, the pass-
word that you enter for AirPort networks isn’t
exactly the same as the WEP key for that same
network. If you’re using an AirPort network
card and are trying to connect to a non-Apple
802.11b WAP, you need to follow a specific pro-
cedure. You can find this procedure by going to
http://kbase.info.apple.com/index.
jsp and searching on the number 106250 (the
Apple Knowledge Base article number). If
you’re using a non-Apple 802.11b network card
and are trying to connect to an Apple AirPort
Base Station, go to the same URL and search
on 106864. These articles will show you how to
convert the Apple AirPort password to a WEP
key and vice versa.
You want my opinion? Because of the issues of
using non-AirPort 802.11b/g hardware with The
Real Thing (AirPort/AirPort Extreme stuff), I rec-
ommend that you stick with Apple equipment if
possible.

Book V

Setting Up Your Wireless Network
527
In case you have any issues using AirPort or need more information about
anything related to AirPort, check this page at Apple’s Web site: www.info.
apple.com/usen/AirPort/.
You should be able to use any standard 802.11b Wi-Fi or 802.11g card,
but you might run into some issues with drivers and such. Be sure that any
non-AirPort/AirPort Extreme card that you might buy is backed up with
Mac OS X drivers.
A variety of 802.11b/g wireless network devices are available, many of which
come with drivers for the Mac. Some of these devices connect via a Universal
Serial Bus (USB), which could be handy if you want to be able to move it
between a desktop Power Mac or iMac to an iBook and back (without the
hassle of opening the case each time). Before you can set up your wireless
network, you have to install the card, which you can pick up at virtually any
Apple store or Apple-authorized reseller (like CompUSA; www.compusa.com).
Because of the differences between manufacturers, check the installation
instructions that come with whichever device that you choose.
After you have your AirPort, AirPort Extreme, or other 802.11b/g wireless
network card installed, you’re ready to connect.
Setting up an Ad Hoc wireless network
Using an Ad Hoc network — also called a computer-to-computer network — is
a fairly easy thing to accomplish in Mac OS X. Plus, you’re not limited to just
Macs: With an Ad Hoc network, you can also swap niceties with PCs and
PDAs that have 802.11b/g network interface cards (NICs) installed. This Ad
Hoc network is great for setting up an impromptu network in a classroom,
exchanging recipes and pictures at a family reunion in a park, or blowing
your friend up while gaming across the aisle of a Greyhound bus at 70 mph.
To set up an Ad Hoc network, you first have to create the computer-to-
computer network on one of your Macs. This takes advantage of the AirPort
Software Base Station that’s built into Mac OS X. To create a computer-to-
computer network, follow these steps:
1. From the Applications folder on your hard drive, open the Internet
Connect application.
2. Choose New Connection from the File menu.
Alternatively, if you’re already using AirPort or AirPort Extreme, you can
reach the same dialog from the AirPort status icon on the menu bar, as
seen in Figure 4-1.

Setting Up Your Wireless Network
528
3. Click the Network drop-down list box and click Create Network.
4. In the resulting dialog, enter a name for your network, enter a pass-
word twice, and then choose a channel.
Although you can leave the password blank, I highly recommend that
you choose a password for that extra bit of security.
Out of the 11 channels available for 802.11b networks, channels 1, 6, and
11 are the only ones that don’t overlap other channels — and are there-
fore the best choices to use. If you’re close to other WAPs, AirPort Base
Stations, or other Ad Hoc networks, you need to try to find a channel
that’s not being used, or performance can be degraded. (If you only
have one access point, it doesn’t matter which channel you select —
just allow Panther to automatically select a channel.)
5. When you finish filling out the dialog, click OK.
Creating a computer-to-computer network gives the illusion of having an
AirPort Base Station. So for people to join your network, they would follow
the same steps that they would to join any other AirPort network, as I cover
in the next section.

Setting up wireless networks with
an AirPort Base Station
After one computer is running a computer-to-computer network or you’ve
set up and configured an AirPort/AirPort Extreme Base Station, you’re ready
to invite other computers with wireless hardware to the party.
Joining in an existing AirPort network
After you have a network set up on one of your wireless-enabled computers,
you just need to have the other wireless-enabled computers join that net-
work. You can use the same process, as I describe here, to join any wireless
network.
1. From the Applications folder on your hard drive, open the Internet
Connect application.
2. From the Internet Connection window, choose AirPort from the
toolbar.
3. Select an existing AirPort network from the list.
4. Click Connect.
If you want to join a network whose name doesn’t appear in the list —
also called a closed network — select Other from the Network drop-down list
and then enter the name of the network that you want to join and the pass-
word (if any is required). A closed network is another added measure of
security — one that’s good enough for most people because it’s very
unlikely that a hacker is going to try to hack a hidden network.
If you’re using AirPort/AirPort Extreme for your wireless networking, you
can also join a network from the AirPort status icon on the menu bar as
seen in Figure 4-2. Just select the name of the network that you’d like to
join — or select Other if you’re joining a closed network.
Disconnecting from an AirPort network
To disconnect from an AirPort/AirPort Extreme network, you can turn off
your AirPort card altogether, which I cover in the next section. (Simplicity,
they say, is an art.) Another way is to simply connect to another AirPort net-
work — but this option is really only useful if you actually want to connect
to another network.

Setting Up Your Wireless Network
530
Turning your AirPort card on or off
You might want to use your Mac, usually your laptop, in a place where your
wireless card shouldn’t be used, like on an airplane (when they tell you to
turn all cell phones off) or in a hospital in an area that doesn’t allow cell
phones or other wireless devices. Plus, turning off your AirPort/AirPort
Extreme card will conserve your notebook’s battery life. Being able to turn
your AirPort/AirPort Extreme card on and off actually has its uses.
To turn your AirPort card on or off via the AirPort status icon on the menu
bar, give it a click and choose Turn AirPort On/Off from the resulting menu.
If you would like to control exactly which wireless network cards can access
your wireless network, go to http://kbase.info.apple.com/index.jsp
and search on 58571, which is the Apple Knowledge Base article number of a
document that explains exactly how to limit access to your network to spe-
cific wireless network cards.

Internet Thing
In This Chapter
 Finding out how Internet sharing works
 Discovering the difference between hardware and software Internet
sharing
 Connecting your Macs to a cable/DSL router
 Adding wireless support to your shared Internet connection
A
lthough I discuss lots of fun stuff that you can do with your network in
previous chapters, this has to be my favorite: sharing a single Internet
connection between all the computers on your network. If you have more
than one computer, I’m sure that you’ve had to deal with the dilemma that
pops up whenever more than one person wants or needs to access the
Internet at the same time.
Luckily, because most small home and office local area networks (LANs) use
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) for network com-
munications, connecting an entire network to the Internet isn’t as ornery of
a task as you might think. In this chapter, I talk about different hardware and
software options for sharing your Internet connection as well as how to
include your wireless devices.
Sharing the Internet
Sharing a single Internet connection between all your computers can be a
boon simply because of the reduced chances of random acts of violence. . . .
Internet deprivation can be an ugly thing, you know. Although I won’t claim
that Internet sharing will save lives, it can indeed save you from headaches
and arguments when more than one person wants to use the Internet at once.
Throughout this chapter, I talk a lot about cable modems and Asynchronous
Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) modems. Both of these are high-speed Internet
connections — both are relatively inexpensive — that are offered by your
local cable company and your local phone company, respectively. The phone
company offers different kinds of digital subscriber line (DSL) connections,
the most common of which is ADSL. However, because different kinds of DSL
connections exist, in this chapter I refer to them all generically as DSL.

To share your Internet connection, you need a few things, so here’s a quick
checklist:
✦An Internet connection: This could be a dialup Internet connection
that’s accessed via a standard v.90/v.92 analog telephone modem, or it
could be a cable or DSL modem connection.
✦A LAN: You need a standard LAN (which is connected with cables) or
a wireless LAN. See Book V, Chapter 1 for more information about set-
ting up a LAN and Book V, Chapter 4 for more on setting up a Wireless
LAN (WLAN).
✦An Internet-sharing device: I use the word device because the method
that you use to share your Internet connection could be software that you
run on one of your computers or hardware that is standalone, depend-
ing on how you connect to the Internet and what fits your needs best.
When you have these three things ready to go, you can share your Internet
connection. However, you need to know some background information to
help you choose the right components and get everything up and running.
Using Network Address Translation
There’s one thing that you must determine before you start your Internet
sharing quest: the set of network Internet Protocol (IP) addresses that you’ll
use. If you used Book V, Chapter 1 to set up and configure your LAN, you
might recall that I suggest a specific range of IP addresses to use on your
LAN. In case you missed out on Chapter 1, I briefly cover this important
topic again so that you can share your Internet connection smoothly.
(Forgive me if I wax technical, but ’tis only for the moment.)
When talking about IP addresses, the ruling body that tracks IP addresses
and where they are used has broken all IP addresses up into two parts:
public and private IP addresses. Public IP addresses are used to communi-
cate on the Internet, and only one device in the entire world can use a given
public IP address at any given time. Private addresses, on the other hand,
are only supposed to be used on networks (like your home LAN) and do not
connect to the Internet. Lots of people can use the same private address
because their networks never go public: That is, they never access the
Internet, so their IP addresses never conflict. Typically, you’ll use addresses
in the form of 192.168.x.x on your LAN. See Book V, Chapter 1 for an
overview of IP addresses and how they work.
You might be wondering to yourself thusly: “If I use private IP addresses on
my LAN at home or in the office and I have to use a public IP address to
communicate on the Internet, how can my private IP addresses on my LAN
communicate with public IP addresses on the Internet?” That is an excellent
question, and the answer is Network Address Translation (or NAT for short).

NAT acts as a gatekeeper between your private IP addresses on your LAN
and the public IP addresses on the Internet. When you connect to the
Internet, your Internet service provider (ISP) gives you one — and usually
only one — public IP address that can be used on the Internet. Instead of
one of your computers using that public IP address and depriving all the
other computers on the LAN, the hardware or software that you use to
share the Internet will take control of that public IP address. Then, when any
computer on your LAN tries to communicate on the Internet, your NAT soft-
ware/hardware intercepts your communications and re-addresses the traffic
so that it appears to be coming from your allotted public IP address. (Think
of a funnel that collects water from several different sources and then
directs all the water into a single stream.)
When the Web site, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server, or whatever strange
Internet intelligence you’re using on the Internet replies, it replies to your
NAT device. The NAT device remembers which private IP address it should
go to on the LAN and sends the information to that computer. See NAT at
work in Figure 5-1.

Ways to Share Your Internet Connection
After you have an Internet connection and your LAN is set up, you need
something to make this NAT thing work. You have two different options to
take care of NAT for your shared Internet connection: hardware or software.
(Go figure.) Each has pros and cons, so take a look at each option individually.
If you’ve already read Chapter 4 of this mini-book, you know that Mac OS X
version 10.3 Panther has AirPort software built in. So, if you have an AirPort
wireless network card in your Mac and you’re using Panther, you can have
your Mac act like an AirPort Base Station for all the wireless computers on
your network, which in turn can use a software NAT.
Using hardware for sharing an Internet connection
Probably the most popular way to share an Internet connection is to buy a
hardware device that connects to your Internet connection, which then con-
nects to your LAN. These devices are referred to as cable/DSL routers. The
main downside to a hardware Internet connection-sharing device is that it
costs more than a software solution.
Don’t let the name throw you: Although these devices are usually used
to share cable/DSL connections, many have the ability to use an external
analog telephone modem to connect to a standard dialup Internet account.
Cable/DSL routers are nice because they’re easy to set up and configure —
and you can leave them on, which means constant Internet access for those
on your LAN. You don’t have to worry about turning on another computer
to connect to the Internet like you do with a software solution. Sounds like a
good spot for a Mark’s Maxim:
Hardware routers are the best choice for sharing your Internet con-
nection, so if you can afford one, you should get one!
Apple’s AirPort and AirPort Extreme Base Stations are not only Wireless
Access Points (WAPs) for your network, as I discuss in Chapter 4 of this
mini-book, but they also act as Internet connection-sharing devices. Both
flavors of AirPort Base Station have a built-in v.90 modem for sharing a
single 56 Kbps connection using a dialup account as well as two Ethernet
connections for sharing a high-speed Internet connection: one to connect to
a cable/DSL router and one to connect to the LAN.

Book V
Chapter 5

Thing
Ways to Share Your Internet Connection
535
If you think that a cable/DSL router or an AirPort Extreme Base Station
could be the karma pathway for you to achieve your goal of sharing your
Internet connection, here are some things to consider when deciding which
device to buy for your LAN:
✦Do you need a switch? Most cable/DSL routers have a small 3-, 4-, or 
5-port switch built in — refer to Chapter 1 of this mini-book to discover
more about hubs and switches. This is nice because the same cable/DSL
router that shares your Internet connection is also the centerpiece of
your LAN where all your connections meet, thus saving you from having
to buy a hub or switch on top of the cost of the cable/DSL router.
Some cable/DSL routers, however, like the AirPort Extreme, only have a
single Ethernet connection to connect to your LAN. So keep in mind that
if you choose a device with a single LAN connection, you must supply
your own hub or switch that would then connect the cable/DSL router
to the rest of your LAN.
✦Got modem? On your cable/DSL router, look for a built-in analog tele-
phone modem, like the one that you find on the more expensive model
of AirPort Extreme. If your only Internet connection is through a dialup
modem account, you must have this feature if you want to use a hard-
ware device to share your Internet connection. AirPort Extreme is great
for this because the modem is built in. Even if you have cable/DSL serv-
ice, most ISPs also include a dialup account with it. With such a bounti-
ful selection of connections, you can plug both your cable or
DSL service to the cable/DSL router as well as use the dialup account
as a backup in case your main service has problems.
✦Want a printer with that? Some cable/DSL routers also have a port for
connecting a printer — a great feature to have because it allows you to
leave the printer connected and turned on so that anyone on the net-
work can print to it anytime. (This is much better than connecting the
printer to a computer and sharing it because then the computer doing
the sharing must always be on in order to make the printer available.)
Mac OS X can send a print job to a printer by using Rendezvous or
TCP/IP, so just make sure that your printer is compatible with TCP/IP
printing, also called LPR (Line Printer Remote).
Using software for sharing an Internet connection
As I mention earlier, if you’re using Mac OS X version 10.3 Panther and have
an AirPort or AirPort Extreme wireless network card installed, your Mac can
act like an AirPort/AirPort Extreme Base Station, providing both wireless
Ethernet connectivity for other computers on the LAN and a shared Internet
connection.

Ways to Share Your Internet Connection
536
Mac OS X version 10.3 Panther also has built-in software that allows a single
computer on your network to share its Internet connection with others on
the LAN. To share your Internet connection, follow these quick steps:
1. Open System Preferences either from the Apple menu or from
the Dock.
2. Click the Sharing icon.
This brings up the Sharing dialog, shown in Figure 5-2.
3. Click the Internet tab of the Sharing dialog.
4. Click the Share Your Connection From drop-down list and select 
Built-in Ethernet.
5. Select the Built-in Ethernet check box (in the To Computers Using list)
to enable it.
When you do, you will be issued a warning that enabling this could affect
your ISP or violate your agreement with your ISP. In my experiences,
this step has never caused any networking problems. However, if you
have any doubts, contact your ISP and verify this.

6. Click OK in the warning dialog to continue.
You go back to the Sharing dialog, which now has a Start button.
7. Click Start to enable Internet sharing.
If you’re using a dialup modem to access the Internet, you need to also make
sure that the computer that has the modem also has an Ethernet LAN con-
nection. The iMac is a great example of a computer that can do this because
it has both a built-in modem and an Ethernet connection.
If you’re using a cable or DSL modem for your Internet connection, the Mac
that you want to run the sharing software on should have two Ethernet con-
nections: one to connect to the cable/DSL modem and one to connect to the
rest of the LAN.
The main disadvantage to using a software solution for Internet connection
sharing is that the computer that connects to the Internet must be turned
on and ready to go all the time so that others on the network can get to the
Internet. And although the sharing software operates in the background on
the machine it’s running on, it still chews up some of that Mac’s processing
power and memory, so it could slow down other applications that you’re
running on that computer.
Connecting Everything
After you decide whether to use a software or hardware solution, it’s time
to get your hands dirty: All the pieces of the puzzle must be set up and con-
nected. In this section, I tell you how to connect things for either the soft-
ware or hardware method of sharing the Internet connection.
Using the software method
When you use the software method to share your Internet connection, this
means that one of the computers on your network will have both the con-
nection to the Internet and a connection to the LAN. Figure 5-3 shows a typi-
cal setup for software Internet sharing, whether you’re using a dialup modem
account or a cable/DSL modem for your Internet connection.
Keep in mind, though, that when using a cable/DSL modem for your Internet
connection, the computer running the sharing software must have two
Ethernet connections. If you’re using a standard dialup modem for Internet
access, chances are that it’s built into the computer used for sharing the
Internet connection.

Connecting Everything
538
Using the hardware method
Not only does using a dedicated piece of hardware free one of the Macs on
your network from the onerous job of hosting the shared connection, but it
also keeps you from having to have more than one Ethernet connection on a
single computer if you’re using a cable/DSL modem for your Internet access.
Figure 5-4 shows how you would connect your devices for hardware Internet
sharing by using either a cable/DSL router with a built-in Ethernet switch or
a cable/DSL router with a standalone Ethernet hub or switch, like you would
need to use AirPort or AirPort Extreme.

If you choose to buy a cable/DSL router that has a built-in Ethernet switch,
you can simply connect all your computers on the LAN to the built-in
switch. However, if you buy a cable/DSL router that only has a single LAN
connection, like AirPort/AirPort Extreme, you must connect that single LAN
connection to an external hub or switch in order to get all the computers on
the same network.

Adding Wireless Support
540
Regardless of whether you use the hardware or software method to share
your Internet connection, all the computers on your LAN — except the one
that’s doing the sharing if you’re using software sharing — should be config-
ured to obtain its IP address automatically through our old friend, Dynamic
Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). (See Chapter 1 for detailed instruc-
tions on how to do this in Mac OS X.) Although it’s not a requirement that
you set up your other devices with DHCP, it is recommended unless you
understand the IP addressing scheme required by your cable/DSL router
and are willing to set up the addresses manually. You need to follow the
instructions that come with the cable/DSL router or software that you pur-
chase for detailed information on how to configure that.
Adding Wireless Support
You might have noticed that I mention wireless here and there in this chap-
ter. This section is going to cover in a bit more detail how you can add wire-
less capabilities to your shared Internet party. To discover more about how
wireless networks work and how to set one up, see Book V, Chapter 4.
Basically, you’ll encounter a couple of situations when trying to add wireless
capabilities into the mix. Either you already have an Internet connection-
sharing mechanism in place (either hardware or software) or you don’t yet
have your Internet connection shared.
If you already have a cable/DSL router or
are using software Internet sharing
If you already have a cable/DSL router or if you’re using software Internet
sharing, like that built into Mac OS X version 10.3 Panther, you can simply
buy a WAP and connect it to your LAN. Adding a WAP will enable anyone
using wireless Ethernet access to your network and thus to your shared
Internet connection. There are many WAPs that you can buy to add wireless
to your network. AirPort and AirPort Extreme are good examples; however,
because AirPort also can do Internet sharing, make sure that you don’t
enable the Internet sharing on the AirPort card! (In this case, you don’t
want or need this feature because it can conflict with your cable/DSL router
operation.)
If you do not have a cable/DSL router
or AirPort Base Station
If you don’t have a cable/DSL router or an AirPort/AirPort Extreme Base
Station for Internet sharing, you have a few options. Each option has an
upside and downside.

Book V
Chapter 5
Sharing That
Precious Internet
Thing
Adding Wireless Support
541
One option is to get an AirPort or AirPort Extreme Base Station, which will
provide both wireless access for AirPort-enabled wireless computers and
Internet sharing for the entire network. As I mention earlier, this device has
only a single LAN Ethernet connection, so if you have more than one com-
puter using wired Ethernet, you must buy an additional hub or switch to
connect them all.
The other option is to buy a combination cable/DSL router, which has a
built-in WAP. Most cable/DSL routers — including the ones that have wire-
less built in — also have multiple Ethernet ports on them, so connecting
computers by using wired Ethernet can be done without buying an external
hub or switch.
The final option is that you can use the AirPort software built into Mac OS X
to turn your Mac into an Airport or AirPort Extreme Base Station — if you
have an AirPort wireless card on that particular Mac. This is a great, low-
cost way to add wireless and Internet sharing to your network. However,
many Macs don’t come with an AirPort wireless card built in, and you still
can eat up processor time and memory by running the AirPort software. For
more on wireless networking, read Chapter 4 of this mini-book.

ardware. We love it. To a Mac power user, new hardware holds all the
promise of Christmas morning, whether your new toys are used for
business or for pleasure. We pore over magazines and visit our favorite Mac
Web sites like clockwork to check on new technology.
These hardware devices don’t come cheap, however, forcing you to make
the painful decision of deciding which new hardware you really need in
order to accomplish what you want and which hardware is a luxury. Also, if
you’re a new Mac owner, you might not know what’s available. For example,
I constantly get e-mail from readers, asking, “What can I connect to my new
computer?” I guess I could reply, “Why, the kitchen sink!” To that end,
I decided to add this chapter to the book to let you know how you can
expand the hardware for your Mac OS X powerhouse.
Each section in this chapter provides a description of what a particular device
does, approximately how much it costs, and a set of general guidelines that
you can use when shopping. Although this isn’t in-depth coverage — after
all, the book is supposed to be about Mac OS X — it will serve to get you
started if you’ve just become a Mac owner. If you’re especially interested in
a specific piece of hardware, I recommend other books that you can read for
the exhaustive details.
Ready? To quote a great line from the first Batman film: “Alfred, let’s go
shopping!”

546
Parading Pixels: Digital Cameras,
DV Camcorders, and Scanners
The first category of hardware toys revolves around images — hardware for
creating original images, capturing images in real-time, and reading images
from hard copy.
Digital cameras
A digital camera like the Hewlett-Packard PhotoSmart 912 (shown in
Figure 1-1) shares most of the characteristics of a traditional film camera.
It looks the same, and you use the same techniques while shooting photo-
graphs. The difference is in the end result. With a digital camera, instead
of a roll of film that has to be developed, you have an image in JPEG or TIFF
format that’s stored on a memory card. The contents of the memory card
can be downloaded to your Mac from within iPhoto (which I discuss with
great pleasure in Book III, Chapter 3), and then the real fun begins. Here are
some things that you can do with a digital photograph:
✦Edit it with an image editor such as Adobe Photoshop
✦Print it with an inkjet or color laser printer
✦Record it to a CD or DVD
✦Add it to a Web page
✦Print several of them in a coffee-table book (using iPhoto)
✦Mail it to friends and family
What they cost
Consumer-level digital cameras typically sell for anywhere from $200 (for
a 2-megapixel model) to $400 (for a 3-megapixel camera). Megapixel is a 
general reference to the resolution (the size of the image, measured in indi-
vidual dots called pixels) and detail delivered by the camera. Such digital
cameras can produce photographs that are well suited for just about any
casual shutterbug. Professional digital cameras in the 5- or 6-megapixel
range can set you back $1,000 or $2,000, but because of their cost and com-
plexity, I wouldn’t recommend them to someone who’s just discovered digi-
tal photography.

Book VI
Chapter 1
Hardware That
Will Make You
Giddy
Parading Pixels: Digital Cameras, DV Camcorders, and Scanners
547
What to look for
Here are some general guidelines that I recommend when selecting a digital
camera:
✦At least a 2-megapixel camera: As a general rule, the higher the
megapixel value, the better the camera.
✦At least an 8MB memory card: The memory card stores the images that
you capture.
✦A Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection to your Macintosh: USB is
covered in all its glory in Chapter 3 of this mini-book.
✦An optical zoom feature: Optical zoom allows you to draw closer to
subjects that are farther away.
Note that I recommended optical zoom there and not digital zoom.
Essentially, digital zoom is a silly feature that simply resizes a portion
of your image, providing a blocky close-up. In fact, an image editor like
Photoshop or Paint Shop Pro can produce exactly the same result as a
camera with digital zoom . . . and it looks as bad. Only an optical zoom
results in a sharper magnification of the subject.

Although it
looks like a
film camera,

548
✦A self-timer: With a self-timer, your camera can snap a photo automati-
cally, allowing you to finally be seen in your own pictures!
✦A manual flash setting: Although automatic flash is a good thing most
of the time, a manual setting allows you to disable your camera’s flash
for artistic shots (or just to prevent the glare on subjects with polished
surfaces).
For a complete guide to digital cameras, I heartily recommend the Digital
Photography Handbook, published by Wiley Publishing, Inc. — and written
by some guy named Mark L. Chambers. (It really is a good book, with full-
color pictures to boot.) For a full (even exhaustive) exposé of everything in
digital photography, check out Digital Photography Bible, also published by
Wiley Publishing, Inc.
DV camcorders
Like digital cameras, digital video (DV) camcorders are the counterpart to
the familiar video camcorder. A DV camcorder looks and operates like a VHS
camcorder, but you can connect it to your Macintosh via a FireWire cable
and download your video clips directly into iMovie. (Chapter 4 of Book III
explains all about iMovie, and FireWire is tackled in Chapter 3 of this mini-
book.) Figure 1-2 illustrates the Panasonic PV-DV401 DV camcorder.
Besides the higher quality of digital video, it has a number of other real
advantages over analog video:
✦Digital video can be edited with applications such as iMovie or Adobe
Premiere.
✦Digital video can be recorded to a CD or DVD.
✦Digital video can be posted for downloading on a Web page.

549
What they cost
A typical DV camcorder starts at about $500, with the more desirable
MiniDV camcorders selling for around $1,000.
If a DV camcorder is too costly of an investment, you can convert analog
video — video from your current VHS camcorder or VCR — into digital
video by using an inexpensive device called an AV converter. I’ve used the
Hollywood DV-Bridge from Dazzle (www.dazzle.com), and I can heartily
recommend it — the DV-Bridge is available on the Web for about $250.
What to look for
I recommend the following when shopping for a DV camcorder:
✦The highest optical zoom in your price range: Again, like a digital
camera, it’s important to be able to capture subjects and action when
you can’t get any closer — think the lion exhibit at the zoo.
✦Image stabilization: This helps steady the picture when you’re holding
the camcorder without a tripod.
✦Onboard effects: These effects generally include some snazzy things
like black and white footage, fades, and wipes.
✦AV connectors: Use these to display your video by connecting the cam-
corder directly to your TV.
✦Support for FireWire (or IEEE 1394) connectivity: For more details on
FireWire, see Chapter 3 of this mini-book.
✦Digital still mode: This enables you to take still photographs if your dig-
ital camera isn’t handy; however, the image quality isn’t as good as a
bona fide digital camera.
For an in-depth look at digital video, check out Digital Video For Dummies,
3rd Edition, by Keith Underdahl, published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.
Scanners
Figure 1-3 illustrates a typical flatbed scanner, which is the tool of choice for
those Macintosh owners who want to digitize images and text from printed
materials. Although you can also connect a sheet-fed scanner, flatbed
models are much more versatile and produce better-quality scans.
Images produced by a scanner can be edited, mailed, displayed on the Web,
or added to your own documents, just like the images from a digital camera.

Parading Pixels: Digital Cameras, DV Camcorders, and Scanners
550
What they cost
A good-quality scanner should cost anywhere from $100 to $300, with the
best models — featuring the fastest scanning speeds, best color depth, and
highest resolutions — going for around $1,000.
What to look for
Try to get the following features in a scanner:
✦The highest color depth that you can afford: Get a minimum of 36-bit.
✦The highest resolution that you can afford: Get a minimum of 600 dots
per inch (dpi) (optical).
✦Single-pass scanning: This feature results in a faster scan with less
chance of error.
✦Transparency adapter for scanning film negatives: If you’re a tradi-
tional film photographer, you’ll find that a transparency adapter turns
a standard flatbed scanner into an acceptable negative scanner.
✦One-touch buttons for e-mailing your scanned images or uploading
them to the Web: These are controls of convenience — pressing one of
these buttons automatically scans the item and prepares the image to
be e-mailed or uploaded to a Web site.
✦USB or FireWire connection: I cover the advantages of both in
Chapter 3 of this mini-book.
Another shameless (but good-natured) plug. My best-selling book Scanners
For Dummies offers comprehensive coverage of all types of scanners, as well
as chapters devoted to advanced features, image editing, and step-by-step
projects. It’s published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.

Although your Mac is already equipped with a keyboard and a mouse, you
can replace them with enhanced hardware that will add functionality and
precision to your work. (Or, you can buy a joystick and spend your days
wreaking havoc on your enemies.)
Keyboards
If you’re using the latest G4 iMac or G5 tower model, you don’t really need
to upgrade your keyboard. These new machines come with excellent key-
boards already, replete with volume controls and a Media Eject key.
However, if you’re using an older Macintosh — or you have an iBook or
PowerBook and you want to add an external keyboard — you can take
advantage of the convenience of a USB keyboard like the one in Figure 1-4.
What they cost
Aftermarket (non-standard-issue) keyboards generally cost anywhere from
$40 to $100.

Trackballs
Some folks prefer using a trackball, like the one shown in Figure 1-5, over a
mouse any day. Graphic artists find that trackballs are more precise and offer
better control, usually including a secondary button to display contextual
menus. (One model on the market has eight buttons. Who needs a keyboard?)

✦More programmable buttons: Opt for at least two buttons!
✦Optical tracking: An optical trackball — one that doesn’t use rollers,
instead using a photosensitive sensor to record the movement of
the ball — is more precise and easier to keep clean.
✦A scroll wheel: Use this gizmo to scroll documents up and down.
✦Ergonomic design: Look for a wrist pad or slanted buttons.
Joysticks
Game players, unite! For arcade and sports games, using a joystick results in
increased maneuverability, more realistic action, higher scores, less wear

the traditional USB aircraft controller shown in Figure 1-6 to USB controllers
and gamepads that rival anything offered on the PlayStation 2 or the Xbox.

✦Force feedback. A force feedback joystick rumbles and moves in tandem
with the action in the game, providing an extra feeling of realism.
Drawing tablets
A drawing tablet like the one you see in Figure 1-7 might be pricey, but if
you’re a graphic artist or a designer, using a tablet will revolutionize the way
that you work with your Mac — especially with the Inkwell technology built
into Mac OS X. Rather than use a mouse or trackball to sketch, you can draw
on the tablet freehand, just like you would draw on paper or canvas. Tablets
can recognize different levels of pressure, allowing applications such as
Photoshop and Painter to re-create all sorts of photo-realistic brush effects.

What they cost
Depending on the size of the tablet, you’ll pay anywhere from around $100
to a whopping $500, depending on the size and the pressure levels that
you need.
What to look for
I recommend the following tablet features:
✦Programmable buttons: See a trend here?
✦Accessory mouse: Some high-end tablets include a mouse that you can
use along with the tablet.
✦A cordless stylus: Make sure that it doesn’t require batteries.
✦The highest number of pressure levels possible: The more levels that
the tablet offers, the more subtle and precise your control is over paint-
ing effects.
Sublime Storage: CD/DVD Recorders and Tape Drives
I don’t include Zip drives in this category because the arrival of cheap, reli-
able optical storage has rendered a 750MB Zip cartridge obsolete. Even the
once awesome 2.2GB capacity of the original Orb drive seems a little
insignificant next to a rewriteable DVD-RW drive, which can store 4.7GB on a
single disc.
If you’d like to trade data with another Mac or a PC via floppy disks, you
can get an external USB floppy drive for under $100 — however, I personally
eschew floppy disks, which are very unreliable and carry a mere 1.44MB
of data.
CD and DVD recorders
Virtually all recent Mac models include a rewriteable optical drive — either
a CD-RW or the DVD-R SuperDrive — but if your computer is older and
didn’t come equipped with a recorder, you can always add an external
model, like the external CD-RW drive shown in Figure 1-8.
What they cost
A typical USB or FireWire CD-RW drive costs about $150. A FireWire DVD-RW
drive averages about $500.

Sublime Storage: CD/DVD Recorders and Tape Drives
556
What to look for
Get the following features in an external CD-RW drive:
✦An internal buffer of at least 2MB: The larger the buffer, the less
chance that you’ll encounter recording errors and the faster your drive
will burn.
✦At least 8X recording speed: A no-brainer here. The faster the record-
ing speed, the less time you’ll wait for the finished disc.
✦AC power through the USB or FireWire cable: This eliminates the need
for a separate AC power supply.
✦Burn-proof technology: This virtually eliminates recording errors due
to multitasking so that you can continue to work on other applications
while you record.
Okay, just one more. I’m very proud of another of my books in the For
Dummies series, CD and DVD Recording For Dummies, 2nd Edition. Published
by Wiley Publishing, Inc., it covers everything that you need to know about
producing all sorts of discs — everything from basic data and audio CDs to
DVDs and more exotic formats such as CD Extra. Mac owners will be happy
to know that this book covers the Mac like a blanket, too.
Tape drives
If you’re looking for a real high-capacity backup solution, use a tape drive. A
tape drive is a storage device that uses a tape cartridge (much like a music
cassette). A Travan tape drive (which averages about 40–60GB of storage) is
much less expensive than a Digital Audio Tape (DAT) drive, which has a
higher capacity of 120GB or more.

What they cost
Travan drives typically range around $500 (storing around 60MB per tape),
and most DAT drives start at $1,000 (and can store gigabytes of data on a
single tape).
What to look for
Get the following features in a tape drive:
✦Hardware data compression: This provides a faster backup on fewer
tapes.
✦Automatic head cleaning: Head cleaning helps reduce errors while writ-
ing data (and reading it back later).
✦FireWire connection: A FireWire drive provides much faster data transfer,
so your backups take a fraction of the time needed by a USB tape drive.
✦A transfer rate of at least 6 Mbps: The faster the transfer rate, the
shorter the time necessary to back up your drive!

Although virtually all Macs ship with speakers, I’ll be honest — the “stock”
speakers don’t measure up to the standards of a true audiophile. For those
who really enjoy their music and their game audio, this last section covers
the world of Macintosh aftermarket sonic enjoyment.
Subwoofer speaker systems
The ever-popular USB port again comes to your rescue. This time, it enables
you to connect a more powerful speaker system with a subwoofer, like the
one shown in Figure 1-9. If you’ve never heard a subwoofer — think chest-
rattling thump, thump, thump — they provide the basement-level bass that
can add power and punch to both your music and your games. Being hit by
an asteroid is a rather flat, tinny experience with a pair of battery-powered
speakers that you salvaged from your Walkman years ago. With a new set of
speakers and a subwoofer, you’ll swear that Han Solo is sitting in the cockpit
chair next to you!
With the growing importance of the computer as a replacement for your
home entertainment center, investing in a more powerful set of speakers will
help you enjoy all those audio CDs and MP3s that you’ve added to your
iTunes Playlists. (Read all about iTunes in Book III, Chapter 2.)

Awesome Audio: Subwoofer Systems and MP3 Hardware
558
What they cost
Most USB-powered speakers with a subwoofer are priced below $200, but
true audiophiles looking for surround sound can spring for a $500 system
that includes several satellite speakers and a subwoofer.
What to look for
Get these features in a subwoofer:
✦At least 30 watts of power: The higher the wattage rating, the more
powerful the speakers (and the louder your music can be).
✦Additional headphone jacks and stereo mini-plug input jacks: Use
these for connecting your iPod or MP3 player directly to your speaker
system. (Read all about iPods in the next section.)
✦Magnetic shielding: This helps prevent your speakers from distorting
your monitor display.
MP3 players (Well, actually, just the iPod)
I’ve lusted after Apple’s iPod MP3 player ever since it arrived on campus.
Depending on which model you get, this incredible device can hold any-
where from 5MB to 30GB of MP3 digital audio — that’s over 7,500 songs of
average length in the 30GB version! Plus, the iPod also acts as your personal
data butler by carrying your files; it’s an honest-to-goodness, external

FireWire drive. You can download your contacts and appointments from
Mac OS X and view them wherever you go. Just think: Carry your files to and
from your office and carry Devo and the Dead Kennedys as well! Oh, and did
I mention that you can play three games with the latest iPod models?
All this fits into a beautiful, stylish package about the size of a pack of ciga-
rettes, with up to a 10-hour lithium rechargeable battery, high-quality
earbud headphones, and automatic synchronization with your iTunes MP3
library. Life just doesn’t get any better for a technoid like me. If you think
that your Mac is a well-designed piece of equipment, you’ll understand why
this little box is so alluring. (And why I have one now.)
Sure, there are other MP3 players out there, but most of them share the
same following problems:
✦They use digital memory cards, which offer far less capacity than
the iPod.
✦They use standard batteries, or you have to furnish rechargeable batter-
ies (which don’t last 8 or 10 hours).
✦They use USB connections, which take forever to download your files
and audio.
✦They don’t operate as an external hard drive or a contacts/appointment
database.
I say forget ’em. The iPod is worth every cent that you’ll pay.
The 10GB iPod runs $299 at the time of this writing, and the 30GB model
costs $499.
If you’re shopping for a great MP3 player and you happen to need an
external drive for backing up your Mac’s internal hard drive, the iPod is
perfect — I mean, it’s literally a double-play!

ost Macintosh owners will make two upgrades — adding more
memory (RAM) and additional hard drive space — during the lifetime
of their computers. These two improvements have the greatest effect on the
overall performance of Mac OS X. By adding RAM and additional hard drive
space, you not only make more elbow room for your applications and docu-
ments, but everything runs faster: Think of the Six Million Dollar Man, only a
heck of a lot cheaper to operate.
In this chapter, I steer you around the hidden potholes along the way for
those who aren’t well versed in selecting memory modules or weighing the
advantages of different types of hard drives. However, if you buy the wrong
piece of hardware, remember that using a hammer to make it fit is not a
workable option.
Adding Memory: Reasons for More RAM
Of all the possible upgrades that you can make to your Macintosh, adding
more random access memory (RAM) is the single most cost-effective
method of increasing the performance of Mac OS X. (In fact, your machine
will likely run faster with more memory than a reasonably faster processor!)
Here is exactly what Mac OS X uses available RAM for:
✦Applications: Naturally, Mac OS X needs system RAM to run the applica-
tions that you launch. The more memory in your machine, the larger the
applications that you can open and the faster they’ll run.

Adding Memory: Reasons for More RAM
562
✦Overhead: This includes the operating system itself, Classic mode (if
it’s running), as well as various and sundry buffers and memory areas
devoted for temporary work. As you would guess, the more memory
here, the merrier. (For the complete scoop on Classic mode, see
Chapter 7 of Book I.)
✦Virtual memory: A-ha! Now here’s something that I mention lightly and
politely in Book I but didn’t really amount to a hill of beans until this
moment. (Can you tell I’m a big fan of Bing Crosby?) Virtual memory
allows Mac OS X to use empty hard drive space as temporary system
memory, as shown in Figure 2-1. Data is written to your hard drive
instead of being stored in RAM, and then it’s erased when it’s no longer
needed. It’s a neat trick that’s also used by Windows, Linux, and dear
old Mac OS 9 (just nowhere near as well as Mac OS X). Virtual memory
works automatically within Mac OS X, so you don’t have to enable it
manually as you did in Mac OS 9.
At first, virtual memory sounds like absolute bliss, and it does indeed allow
your Macintosh to do things that would otherwise be impossible, like run-
ning an application that requires 300MB of RAM in just 128MB of actual
physical RAM. However, here come the caveats:
✦Virtual memory is slow as molasses in December. Even today’s fastest
hard drive is many, many times slower than real silicon, so any use of
virtual memory instead of RAM slows down Mac OS X significantly.
✦Virtual memory abuses your hard drive. If you’ve ever run Photoshop
on a Windows PC with 64MB of RAM, you’re having flashbacks right
now — whenever your Macintosh is using virtual memory, your hard
drive remains almost constantly active. (Hardware types like myself call
this phenomenon thrashing because we know what’s happening inside
that poor hard drive.) Over time, running any computer with insufficient

RAM and behemoth applications will result in a significant increase in
hard drive wear and tear.
✦Virtual memory costs you processing power. With sufficient RAM, Mac
OS X gleefully runs as efficiently as it can — when virtual memory kicks
in, however, your Mac has to spend part of its quality time shuttling
data to and from the hard drive, which robs your computer of process-
ing power.
The moral of the story is very simple, so it’s time for another of Mark’s
Maxims:
The less that Mac OS X needs to use virtual memory, the better.
To put it another way, physical memory (meaning memory modules) is
always a better choice than virtual memory. This is why power users and
techno-types crave as much system memory as possible.
A mere two years ago, 128MB of RAM was a quite comfortable figure for
most folks, but most of today’s Macs can accept a whopping 1GB (that’s
short for gigabyte, or 1,024 megabytes), or even more, system RAM. (At the
extreme end of the scale, the King Kahuna — Apple’s latest Power Mac G5 —
can now accommodate an unbelievable 8 gigabytes of RAM!)
If you’ll be keeping your current Macintosh for a few years more, install as
much memory as you can afford — you’ll thank me every time that Mac OS X
boots.
Shopping for a RAM Upgrade
Before you click your mouse on some online computer store’s Buy button,
you need to determine two things that will help you determine which
memory module to buy: how much RAM you’ve already got and how much
more your system can handle.
Finding out the current memory in your Mac
Memory modules are made in standard sizes, so you need to determine how
much memory you already have and which of your memory slots are filled.
To do this, open an old friend you might have used in Mac OS 9, the Apple
System Profiler. Here, open your Applications folder and then open the
Utilities folder to locate the System Profile, which is shown in Figure 2-2.
Alternatively, click the Apple menu, choose About This Mac, and then click
the More Info button.

Shopping for a RAM Upgrade
564
After you launch this application, it takes a few seconds to scan your
Macintosh and display all sorts of identifying information about the hard-
ware and software that you’re using. Check out the Overview section. Here
you can see exactly how many memory modules you have, what type they
are, and how much memory each provides. For example, in Figure 2-2, my
iMac G4 has two memory slots — labeled DIMM0 and DIMM1 — and each of
those slots is filled with a 256MB module, giving me a total physical memory
of 512MB. Jot down the name and contents of each slot on a piece of paper —
or, if you’re a real Mac OS X power user, add a Stickie to your Desktop with
this information. (Stickies are covered in Book II, Chapter 2.)
However, on my particular machine, only one of those memory modules
can be upgraded by a mere mortal: DIMM1. DIMM0 is an internal module
and can only be upgraded by an Apple technician. (Insert sound of harps
playing here.)
Unfortunately, this arrangement differs on just about every model of
Macintosh ever made — some have more memory slots, and others allow
you to upgrade all the system memory instead of just one module. The only
way to determine which modules are accessible on your Mac is to identify
the exact model of your computer.
Determining the exact model of your computer
Most folks know the type and model of their computers, but there’s a catch
here, too: Sometimes the memory that you need varies by the processor in
your Macintosh. For instance, many different versions of iMacs have been
made since the Bondi Blue Beast debuted, and over the course of those
Figure 2-2:

with Apple

Profiler.

Chapter 2

and Stir
The Tao of Hard Drive Territory
565
years, Apple has made a slew of changes inside. Your eye should be on the
actual processor speed and bus speed — the transfer speed that data
reaches whilst speeding across your motherboard — because they’re the
identifying factors here. An older iMac with a 333 MHz G3 processor, for
example, will use a different type of memory from the latest flat-panel iMac
with a 1.25 GHz G4 processor.
Again, your salvation turns out to be Apple System Profiler — look again at
that talented image Figure 2-2 to see that both the Machine Speed (or proces-
sor speed) and the Bus Speed are both listed: In this case, this machine has a
700 MHz G4 running at 100 MHz bus speed. Grab that same piece of paper
(or open that same Stickie) and add these two figures to your list.
Now you’re armed with the information that you need to go online and buy
the right memory — or, if you’d rather work directly with a human being,
you can visit your local Apple dealer, present him with the list, and have him
order the memory upgrade for you.
Buying memory online is much cheaper. I recommend the following online
stores:
✦MacMall: www.macmall.com
✦MacWarehouse: www.macwarehouse.com
✦MacConnection: www.macconnection.com
The Tao of Hard Drive Territory
Next, turn your attention to the other popular Mac upgrade — adding extra
hard drive space. With today’s cutting-edge, 3-D games using 600MB of
space each and Photoshop expanding to 450MB, IDC (short for Insidious
Data Creep) is a growing problem. (Bad pun most certainly intended.)
You can save space by deleting those files and folders that you don’t need,
but what fun is that? To reduce your Mac’s waistline before you consider
adding more room, I recommend using Spring Cleaning from Aladdin
Systems, which you can find at www.aladdinsys.com. It’s a great tool for
locating duplicates, removing empty folders, and uninstalling old programs
that you no longer use.
Is English your only computing language? DeLocalizer, another handy space-
saving utility from Mike Bombich, removes all those extra language files that
get tacked on when you install Panther. You can download this great free-
ware application from Mike’s Web site at www.bombich.com. (And take a
moment to check out his other Macintosh software, too.)

Internal versus External Storage
566
To determine how much free space remains on a hard drive, click the drive’s
icon on your Desktop and press Ô+I to display its information, as shown in
Figure 2-3. (I’m a major-league Mozart fan-boy, hence the name of my hard
drive.)
As a general rule, the following factors indicate that you’re ready to upgrade
your hard drive territory:
✦You have less than 2GB of space on your current hard drive.
✦You’ve cleaned off all unnecessary files, and your Mac is still lagging.
✦You need to share a large amount of data between computers that aren’t
on the same network. (Read on to discover why.)
Internal versus External Storage
Just about everyone who upgrades their existing hard drive does so
because they need extra space; however, you might also need to add a hard
drive to your system that can go mobile whenever necessary. Unlike an
internal drive — which resides hidden inside your Mac’s case — an external
drive is a lean, mean, self-contained traveling storage machine that’s perfect
for road warriors.

Internal versus External Storage
567
External drives
External removable cartridge drives, such as a Zip drive, are fine for folks
who have to send cartridges to other locations. Unfortunately, however, the
capacities of these drives are rapidly falling behind conventional, non-
removable external hard drives. Also, most Macs now have either a CD-RW
or DVD-R drive, which basically render Zip technology obsolete. Therefore,
if you’re considering an external unit, go with the most popular pick — a
high-capacity non-removable hard drive, which offers the most storage for
your dollar.
Most external drives are shock-mounted (meaning that they can take more
abuse than an internal hard drive), and they carry their own power supply.
In fact, some external drives actually don’t need a separate power supply
because they draw their power through your Mac’s Universal Serial Bus
(USB) or FireWire port. (The next chapter in this mini-book tells all about
USB and FireWire.)
External drives also have a number of other advantages:
✦No installation hassle: You can easily install a USB or FireWire drive in
seconds. Simply plug in the drive to the proper connector on the side or
back of your Mac, connect the power supply (if necessary), and turn it
on. (No software installation necessary. As the folks in Cupertino are
fond of saying, “Look, Ma — no drivers!”)
✦No extra space needed: Many Macs simply don’t have the internal
space for another drive — laptops and iMacs are good examples.
Therefore, if you want to keep your existing internal drive as-is while
you’re adding more storage, an external drive is your only choice.
✦Share files with ease: With an external drive, you can share your data
between multiple computers or bring your files with you on your
next trip.
✦Safe from prying eyes: Unlike an internal drive, external drives are easy
to secure. Take your sensitive information home with you or lock it in
a safe.
After you plug in an external drive, Mac OS X displays it just like any other
hard drive volume. Figure 2-4 illustrates my 30GB FireWire drive in action.

Internal versus External Storage
568
Internal drives
Your other alternative is to upgrade your internal drive, which can be a
hassle. Like a memory upgrade, adding or swapping an internal drive
involves opening your Mac’s case. In fact, it’s a somewhat more complex
procedure than adding memory.
I usually recommend that folks add a second drive rather than swap out
their existing drive. You’ll avoid the hassle of backing up and restoring your
system on a new drive or (even worse) reinstalling Mac OS X and then rein-
stalling all the applications that you use. (Swapping a hard drive should be
the definition of the word hassle.) Instead, add a second drive and leave
your current hard drive as-is.
However, here are a number of very important reasons why many Mac
owners choose updating internal drives, even with the hassle of swapping:
✦They’re cheaper. You’ll spend significantly less on an internal drive
because it doesn’t need the case and additional electronics required by
an external drive.
✦They’re faster. Even a FireWire or USB 2.0 drive isn’t as fast as an inter-
nal drive.
✦They take up less space in your work area. An internal drive eliminates
the space taken by an external drive, which can range anywhere from
the size of a paperback to the size of a hardback book.
Figure 2-4:

After you establish that you are in fact ready for more space — and you’ve
decided whether you want to add an internal drive, an external drive, or (if
you enjoy punishment) upgrade your existing internal drive — you’re ready
to consider how big of a drive you need.
Determining How Much Space You Need
Your next step is to decide just how much hard drive space is enough. I sup-
pose that if your last name is Gates and you live in Redmond, you can proba-
bly pick just about any drive on the market. However, I have a family, a
mortgage, a car payment, and lust in my heart for the latest computer
games; therefore, I must be a little more selective.
I have two hard-and-fast rules that I follow when I’m determining the capac-
ity of a new drive:
1. If you’re buying a replacement for your existing drive, shop for a drive
with at least twice the capacity of the existing drive (if possible).
2. If you’re buying an external USB or FireWire drive, shop for a drive with
at least half the capacity of your existing internal drive (if possible).
Those rules seem to work pretty doggone well in most circumstances with
these two exceptions: gamers and digital video gurus. These folks need to
shoehorn as much space as they possibly can into their systems. If you’re a
hardcore gamer or if you work primarily with digital video, you need a
wheelbarrow’s worth of hard drive capacity. Trust me: Buy the biggest hard
drive that you can afford.
Shopping for a Hard Drive
Ready to brave the local Wireless Shed superstore (or perhaps its Web site)?
Here’s a list of guidelines to keep handy while you’re shopping for a new
internal or external hard drive:
✦Faster is indeed better. You’ll pay more for a 7,200 revolutions per
minute (rpm) drive than a slower 5,400 rpm drive, but the extra cash is
worth it. Faster drives can transfer more data to your Mac in less time —
and that’s especially important for storing digital video.
✦Avoid used or refurbished drives. Hard drives are one of the few com-
ponents in your computer that still have a large number of moving
parts. Therefore, buying a used drive isn’t a good idea unless it’s priced
very low.

Shopping for a Hard Drive
570
Because the prices on new hard drives are constantly dropping, make
sure that you check on the price for a new, faster drive of the same
capacity before you buy that bargain used drive.
✦Pick FireWire over USB 1.x every time. Compared with a FireWire con-
nection, a USB 1.x external hard drive is simply a joke when it comes to
performance. Because most Macs with USB ports also have FireWire
ports, make very sure that you buy a FireWire drive! (If your Mac has
USB 2.0 ports, you can buy a USB 2.0 drive without being embarrassed.)
✦Watch the size of the drive when buying internal drives. Most
Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics (EIDE) drives are standard half-
height 3.5-inch units, but check to make sure that you’re not investing in
a laptop drive — unless, of course, you’re upgrading a laptop.
✦Do I need SCSI? In most cases, the answer is no — Macs built within the
last three or four years all use EIDE drives. However, older Macs do use
Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) hardware, so make sure that
you check before you buy. (SCSI and EIDE are the two different types of
internal hard drive interfaces — a fancy word for connection — used on
Macs that can run Mac OS X.) Again, you can use the Apple System
Profiler to determine what type of drives you have. Click the Hardware
category in the Contents column on the left and then click both the EIDE
(ATA) and SCSI subcategories to display the information for your hard
drives. As you can see in Figure 2-5, both my internal hard drive and my
internal DVD-ROM/CD-RW drive are EIDE devices.

Installing Your New Stuff
571
Installing Your New Stuff
After you get your memory modules or hard drive, pick from one of two
methods of installing them: easy and hard. Guess which method will cost
you money?
The easy way
Your Apple dealer can perform either type of hardware installation for you.
You can rest easy knowing that the job will be done right, but money will
definitely change hands.
Personally, I always recommend that owners of iBooks and Titanium
PowerBook laptops allow their dealers to install memory upgrades and hard
drives because these laptops are much more complex than a desktop, and
they’re much easier to damage.
The hard way
If you’re familiar with the inside of your Macintosh, you can install your own
upgrade and save that cash. A memory upgrade is one of the simpler chores
to perform, but that doesn’t mean that everyone feels comfortable taking
the cover off and jumping inside a computer; hard drives are a tad more
complex.
If you have a knowledgeable friend or family member who can help you
install your hardware, buy him the proverbial NSD (short for Nice Steak
Dinner) and enlist him in your cause. Even if you still do the work yourself,
it’s always better to have a second pair of experienced eyes watching, espe-
cially if you’re a little nervous.
Because the installation procedures for both memory modules and hard
drives are different for every model of Mac — heck, even removing the
cover on each model of Macintosh involves a different challenge — I can’t
provide you with any step-by-step procedures in this chapter. Many online
stores include installation instructions with their hardware. Other sources
for installation instructions include the Apple Web site (www.apple.com) or
your Apple dealer. You can use Sherlock 3 (more about this in Book I,
Chapter 4) to scan the Internet for installation information for your particu-
lar model. However, here are guidelines to follow during the installation:
✦Watch out for static electricity. When opening your Macintosh and han-
dling hardware, make certain that you’ve touched a metal surface
beforehand to discharge any static electricity on your body. (You can
also buy a static wrist strap that you can wear while working within the
bowels of your Mac.)

Installing Your New Stuff
572
✦Check the notches on memory modules. Most types of memory mod-
ules have notches cut into the connector. These notches make sure that
you can install the module only one way, so make certain that they align
properly with the slot.
✦Make sure that you’re using the right memory slot. As I mention ear-
lier in this chapter, most Macs have multiple memory slots, so check
the label on the circuit board to make sure that you’re adding the
memory to the correct slot. (Naturally, this won’t be a problem if you’re
installing a module into an unoccupied slot.)
✦Take good care of older hardware. If you replace an existing memory
module or hard drive with a new one, put the old hardware in the left-
over anti-static bag from your new hardware and immediately start
thinking of how you’ll word your eBay auction . . . Used 128MB Memory
Module for 333MHz iMac, for example.
✦Check your hard drive jumper settings. If your Mac uses EIDE hard
drives, you must set the Master and Slave jumpers correctly on the back
(or underside) of the new drive. A jumper is simply a tiny metal-and-
plastic connector that is used to change the configuration on a hard
drive. Setting jumpers indicates to your Mac which drive is the primary
drive and which is the secondary drive. (I don’t know how engineers got
into the whole Master/Slave thing . . . they’re normally not quite so
exotic when naming things.)
If you’re adding a second drive to a G3 or G4 tower, you’ll probably have
to change the jumper settings on the original drive as well. (If you’re
replacing the existing drive, you’re in luck; simply duplicate the jumper
settings from the old drive and use them on the new drive.) Because the
configuration settings are different for each hard drive model, check the
drive’s documentation for the correct jumper position.
✦Leave the cover off while testing. After you install the upgrade, leave
the cover off your Mac while you boot the computer and test to see how
well you did. That way, if you have to replace the original hardware for
some reason, you won’t have to remove the cover a second time.
To determine whether a memory upgrade was successful, you can again
turn to the Apple System Profiler. Open the Profiler again and compare the
memory overview specifications with the original list that you made earlier.
If the total amount of memory has increased and the memory module is rec-
ognized, you’ve done your job well. If not, switch off the Mac and check the
module to make sure it’s completely seated in the slot.

USB and FireWire

 Adding a USB or FireWire hub
 Troubleshooting FireWire and USB connections
 Adding and updating drivers
A
pple’s list of successes continues to grow over the years — hardware,
applications, and (of course) Mac OS X — but the FireWire standard
for connecting computers to all sorts of different devices is in a class by
itself. That’s because FireWire has been universally accepted all over the
world as the port of choice for all sorts of digital devices that need a high-
speed connection. Even Windows owners have grudgingly admitted that
FireWire just plain rocks. Ya gotta love it.
In this chapter, I discuss the importance of FireWire to the digital hub that I
discuss in Book III, and I compare it with both version 1.1 and version 2.0 of
Intel’s Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection technology. I also talk trou-
bleshooting and expansion using a hub.
Appreciating the Advantage of a FireWire Connection
So what’s so special about FireWire, anyway? Why does Apple stuff at least
one (and usually two) FireWire ports in all its current Macintosh models?
Heck, even the iPod (Apple’s MP3 player, which you can read more about in
Book III, Chapter 2) uses FireWire! (Its official name is IEEE 1394, but even
the Cupertino crew doesn’t call it that — at least very often.)
First things first. As countless racing fans will tell you, it’s all about the speed,
my friend. The original FireWire 400 port delivers a blazing fast 400 Mbps
(megabits per second), which is fast enough for all sorts of peripherals to
communicate with your Macintosh. The following list includes a number of
hardware toys that are well known for transferring prodigious file sizes:

✦Digital video (DV) camcorders
✦High-resolution digital cameras
✦Scanners and some printers
✦External hard drives and CD/DVD recorders
✦Networking between computers
For example, consider the sheer size of a typical digital video clip captured
by one of today’s DV camcorders. DV buffs commonly transfer several hun-
dred megabytes of footage to their computers at one time. Check out the rel-
ative speeds of the different types of ports in Table 3-1, and you’ll see a big
attraction of FireWire.

Ouch! Not too hard to figure that one out. Here are three other important
benefits to FireWire:
✦Control over Connection: This is a 10-cent term that engineers use,
meaning that you can control whatever gadget that you’ve connected
using FireWire from your computer. This is pretty neat when you think
about it; for example, you can control your DV camcorder from the com-
fort of your computer keyboard, just as if you were pressing the buttons
on the camcorder.
✦Hot-swapped: You don’t have to reboot your Mac or restart Mac OS X
every time that you plug (or unplug) a FireWire device. Instead, the
FireWire peripheral is automatically recognized (as long as the operat-
ing system has the correct driver) and ready to transfer.
✦Power through the port: FireWire can provide power to a device
through the same wire — typically, there’s enough power available for
an external drive or recorder — so you don’t need an external AC power
cord for some FireWire devices. (Apologies to owners of DV cam-
corders, but those things eat power like a pig eats slop.)

Port-o-rama: Using
USB and FireWire
Understanding USB and the Tale of Two Point Oh
575
However, FireWire isn’t finished evolving yet — the new, cleverly named
IEEE 1394 B (called FireWire 800 by anyone with any sense, including the
folks at Apple) is designed to deliver a whopping 800 Mbps. That, dear reader,
oughta be fast enough for both you and your loved ones. These ports only
appear on the top-of-the-line Apple models at the time of this writing, but if
you can afford the best, you’ll have to wear racing goggles to use ’em.
Oh, and as you would expect from Apple, the new ports will be backward-
compatible with older FireWire hardware. However, the ports aren’t exactly
the same, so you’ll need a plastic port converter to connect FireWire 400
devices to a FireWire 800 port. (Such important little conversion fixtures are
commonly called dongles. No, I’m not making that up. Ask your favorite
techno-nerd.)
Understanding USB and the Tale of Two Point Oh
The other resident port on today’s Apple computers is the ubiquitous USB,
which is short for Universal Serial Bus. (By the way, ubiquitous means ever-
present or universal, which I quickly looked up by using Sherlock 3 — read
all about this super sleuth in Book I, Chapter 4.) Although version 1.1 of the
USB standard is nowhere near as fast as FireWire, USB has taken the world
by storm. It’s used for everything from mice to keyboards, speakers, digital
cameras, and even external drives and CD recorders. (A friend of mine never
misses the chance to point out that USB — which was originally developed
by Intel, the makers of the Pentium 4 processor — was given its first wide-
spread implementation on the original iMac. You’re welcome, Intel.)
Unfortunately, those last two are somewhat problematical: Technically, you
can add an external hard drive, but don’t expect response times anywhere
near what you’d enjoy with an internal hard drive. Ditto for a CD recorder —
4X is about the limit for the recording speed with a USB 1.1 connection.
(Don’t even think about recording DVDs over a USB 1.1 connection.) Now,
compare this performance with that of similar equipment using a FireWire
connection, which provides nearly the speed of an internal hard drive and
CD and DVD recording at the fastest pace possible.
Like FireWire, USB connections are hot-swappable and provide power over
the connection — a USB port also offers a more limited version of Control over
Connection as well, making it a good choice for virtually all digital cameras.
The average 2- or 3-megapixel digital camera creates a JPEG image that’s
about 400–500K, so USB is the connection of choice for all but the 5- and 6-
megapixel (and higher) camera models. Why is it the connection of choice,
even thought it’s slower than FireWire? Most PCs still don’t come standard
with FireWire ports, and transferring a 500K file doesn’t take that long over

Hey, You Need a Hub!
576
USB. (On the other hand, try transferring a 20MB file from a 6-megapixel
camera, and FireWire suddenly makes a lot of sense.)
Not to be outdone, a new USB 2.0 specification has arrived that delivers
even better performance than the original FireWire standard — USB 2.0 can
transfer 480 Mbps. These ports are backward-compatible — meaning they
work with the original USB 1.x ports as well — but don’t look for Apple to
jump through any hoops to support the new, faster, even-fresher-smelling
USB standard. In fact, at the time of this writing, only the top-of-the-line Mac
models in Apple’s current stable have USB 2.0 ports (but they’re likely to
become more common, of course).
If you have an expandable tower G3 or G4 machine, you can use an empty
Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) slot to add USB 2.0 ports to your
Mac. For example, Orange Micro sells the OrangeUSB 2.0 Hi-Speed PCI card
for a mere $50 (www.orangemicro.com); if you have a PowerBook, you can
add a USB 2.0 port by using a PC Card.
Hey, You Need a Hub!
Suppose that you’ve embraced FireWire and USB and you now have two
FireWire drives hanging off the rear end of your Mac — and suddenly you
buy an iPod. (Or you get another FireWire device that’s as much fun as an
iPod, if that’s actually possible.) Now you’re faced with too many devices for
too few ports. You could eject a drive and unhook it each time that you want
to connect your iPod, but there must be a more elegant way to connect.
Help!
Enter the hub. Both the FireWire and USB specifications allow you to con-
nect a device called a hub, which is really nothing more than a glorified split-
ter adapter that provides you with additional ports. Note that this device
has nothing — repeat, absolutely nothing — to do with the network hubs
that I discuss in Book V. With a FireWire or USB hub at work, you do lose a
port; however, most hubs multiply that port into four or eight ports. Again,
all this is transparent, and you don’t need to hide anything up your sleeve.
Adding a hub is just as plug-and-play easy as adding a regular FireWire/USB
device.
I should also mention that FireWire supports daisy-chaining — a word that
stretches all the way back to the days of the Atari and Commodore comput-
ers, when devices had extra ports in the back so that additional stuff could
be plugged in. However, not every FireWire drive has a daisy-chain port
(also called a passthru port). With daisy-chaining, you can theoretically add
63 FireWire devices to your Mac — talk about impressing them at your next
Mac user group meeting!

Port-o-rama: Using
USB and FireWire
Uh, It’s Just Sitting There
577
Uh, It’s Just Sitting There
Man, I hate it when FireWire and USB devices act like boat anchors. FireWire
and USB peripherals are so doggone simple that when something goes
wrong, it really aggravates you. Fortunately, I’ve been down those roads
many a time before, so in this section, I’ll unleash my experience. (That
sounds a little frightening, but it’s a good thing. Really.)
Common FireWire and USB headaches
Because FireWire and USB are so alike in so many ways, I can handle possi-
ble troubleshooting solutions for both types of hardware at once:
✦Problem: Every time I turn off or unplug my external peripheral, Mac
OS X gets irritated and displays a nasty message saying that I haven’t
properly disconnected the device.
Solution: This happens because you haven’t ejected the peripheral. I
know that sounds a little strange for a device like an external hard drive
or a digital camera, but it’s essentially the same reasoning as ejecting a
CD or DVD from your Desktop. When you click your USB or FireWire
device and hold the mouse button down, you’ll see that the Trash icon
turns into an Eject icon; drag the device icon to the Eject icon and drop
it, and the external device disappears from your Desktop. (You can also
click the device icon to select it and press Ô+E.) At that point, you’re
safe to turn it off or unplug the FireWire/USB cable.
If Panther recognizes the device as an external drive, which is usually
the case with a digital camera, external hard drive, or external CD/DVD
recorder, you can simply click the Eject button next to the device icon
in the Finder window’s sidebar.
✦Problem: The device doesn’t show a power light.
Solution: Check to make sure that the power cable is connected —
unless, of course, you’ve got a device that’s powered through the con-
nection itself. This can sometimes pose its own share of problems, how-
ever, when using USB devices. Not all USB ports provide power because
some are designed only for connecting mice, keyboards, and joysticks.
To check whether an unpowered USB port is your problem, either con-
nect the device to a USB port on the back of your Mac or connect it to a
hub or another computer. If the device works when it’s connected to
another port, you’ve found the culprit.

Uh, It’s Just Sitting There
578
✦Problem: The device shows a power light but just doesn’t work.
Solution: This can be because of problems with your cable or your hub.
To check, borrow a friend’s cables and test to see whether the device
works. If you’re testing the hub, try connecting the device directly to
your Mac using the same cable to see whether it works without the hub.
If you’re attempting to connect a device through another USB or
FireWire device, try connecting it directly to see whether it works. If so,
the middleman device either needs to be switched on to pass the data
through or it doesn’t support daisy-chaining at all — in which case,
you’ll have to connect both devices directly to your Macintosh.
✦Problem: Mac OS X reports that I have a missing driver.
Solution: Check the manufacturer’s Web site and download a new copy
of the USB or FireWire drivers for your device because they’ve been cor-
rupted, overwritten, or erased entirely. Because Mac OS X loads the
driver for a USB or FireWire device when it’s connected, sometimes just
unplugging and reconnecting a peripheral will do the trick.
Check those drivers
Speaking of drivers . . . old and worn-out drivers are a sore spot with me.
Drivers are simply programs that tell Mac OS X how to communicate with
your external device. Each new version of Mac OS X contains updated driv-
ers, but make certain that you check for new updates on a regular basis. That
means using both the Software Update feature in Mac OS X (which I cover in
Book II, Chapter 3) and going to the Web sites provided by your USB and
FireWire hardware manufacturers.

Chapter 4: I’m Okay,
You’re a Printer
In This Chapter
 Using the Printer Setup Utility
 Adding a non-USB printer
 Managing print jobs
 Setting up a shared printer
O
f all the improvements made in Mac OS X over Mac OS 9, one of the
most important is the simplified printing process — no Chooser, no
strange printer ports . . . just a heap of Universal Serial Bus (USB) and net-
work printing goodness. As I discuss in Book I, if your USB printer is recog-
nized by Mac OS X, you can print within seconds of plugging it in, with no
muss or fuss. A USB printer is connected physically to your Mac, but you can
also send print jobs over the network to a network printer. (Unfortunately,
if that network printer is in another room, you do have to get up out of your
comfortable chair to retrieve your printed document . . . not even Mac OS X
is that powerful.)
But what if you want to print to an AppleTalk printer or perhaps send docu-
ments to a printer over Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
(TCP/IP)? (For more on AppleTalk, read Book V, Chapter 3.) To take care of
tasks like that, you need to dig a little further — and I do so in this chapter.
You also discover here how to use the features of the Printer Setup Utility
and how to juggle print jobs like a circus performer.
Meet the Printer Setup Utility
The Printer Setup Utility (which was called the Print Center in earlier ver-
sions of the Big X) runs automatically whenever it’s needed by Mac OS X —
for example, when you print a document — but you can also run it at any
time from the Utilities folder inside your Applications folder. Although it
doesn’t look like much (as shown in Figure 4-1), power lurks underneath.
If you find the Printer Setup Utility hard to reach and you need to manually
launch it often, add it to the Dock — that way, you can launch it with a
single click.

Printer Setup Utility Toolbar Buttons
580
Printer Setup Utility Toolbar Buttons
Along the top of the Printer Setup Utility, you’ll find six default toolbar
icons. They are
✦Make Default: If you have more than one printer listed in the Printer
Setup Utility, you can select which printer Mac OS X will use by default.
Hint: The entry for the default printer appears in bold type. Click the
desired entry and then click the Make Default icon. (You can also use
the Ô+D keyboard shortcut.)
When you add a new printer to the list, it automatically becomes the
default printer. (Some folks like this feature; others would banish the
person responsible to Siberia for a decade.)
✦Add: In Book I, Chapter 3, you can read how to add a typical USB printer
(both with and without an installed driver). In the next section, I show
you how to add a non-USB printer.
If your USB printer is already natively supported within Mac OS X, you
might not need to go through the trouble of clicking the Add icon on the
toolbar. Mac OS X can add a new USB printer automatically, so don’t be
surprised if your Mac swoops in and does it for you as soon as you plug
in a new printer. Also, the manufacturer’s installation program for your
printer might add the printer for you in a behind-the-scenes way, even if
Mac OS X lies dormant.
✦Delete: First click a printer in the list to select it and then click this icon
to remove a printer from your list of installed printers. This isn’t some-
thing that you’re likely to do often, but if a printer is no longer available,
it helps keep your list nice and tidy.
✦Utility: Clicking this icon displays the model-specific configuration set-
tings and features available for the specific printer that’s selected in the
list. Of course, these settings vary for every printer produced by the
hand of Man — they’re actually determined by the manufacturer’s
printer driver — but they usually include actions such as cleaning and
alignment, and settings such as print quality. Figure 4-2 illustrates some
of the configuration settings for my HP printer, which appear in their
own dialog after you click the Utility icon.

Printer Setup Utility Toolbar Buttons
581
✦ColorSync: Click this toolbar button to display the color matching con-
trols that are specific for your printer — graphic artists and print media
professionals use color matching to make sure that a shade you picked
called Antique Rose also looks like Antique Rose on the printed version.
(Wouldn’t want Vamp Red instead, now would we?)
✦Show Info: From the Printer Setup Utility menu, click Printers and then
choose the Show Info menu item (or press the Ô+I keyboard shortcut)
to display information on the selected printer. You can change the printer
name in this list, but you have other options, too. Many Mac printers use
the PostScript standard printing language; if your printer uses PostScript,
click the drop-down list box to display the PPD (Postscript Printer
Description) data files for the printer (the PPD list will be empty if the
printer doesn’t use PostScript) as well as any installable options, such
as a paper feed or scanning upgrade.
Here are two additional important features that don’t seem to rate their own
buttons on the toolbar (but would doggone well be there if I were running
the show):
✦Preferences: Click the Printer Setup Utility menu and choose Preferences
to display the Print & Fax settings within System Preferences (see
Figure 4-3). The choices that you make here affect the defaults in all the
applications on your system. Choose the Default Paper Size from the
drop-down list for use with all your printers. Click the Selected Printer
in Print Dialog list box to pick the default printer that will be used in all
your applications. Enable the Share My Printers with Other Computers
check box to allow others on the network to use any printer connected
to your Mac. (There’s another way to share your printers, which I dis-
cuss at the end of this chapter, but it’s a little more complex.)

✦Show Jobs: Choosing this from the Printer Setup Utility Printers menu
displays the job list for the selected printer — more on this later in the
upcoming section “Managing Your Printing Jobs.”
Adding a Funky Printer
“And what,” you might ask, “is a funky printer?” Well, you have a number of
possibilities, but they all add up to a non-USB connection:
✦An AppleTalk printer: If you’re sharing a printer on another Mac by
using AppleTalk, you can print to that device. For more on AppleTalk,
read Book V, Chapter 3.
✦IP printing: Sending a job to an Internet Protocol (IP) printer actually
shoots the document across a network or Internet connection by using
a target IP address or domain name. Generally, it’s best to have a static
(unchanging) IP address for a network printer; if the IP address changes
often, for example, you’d have to reconfigure your connection to your IP
printer each time that it changed.
✦Rendezvous: Shared printers on your local network use the built-in
Rendezvous networking system, which means that they’re automatically
recognized, and you needn’t enter any bothersome settings to reach
’em. (Go, Cupertino!)
✦Open Directory: This connection uses Mac OS X Directory Services to
share a printer. If your network uses Directory Services, your network
Figure 4-3:

preferences
for the

Setup Utility.

Book VI
Chapter 4
I’m Okay,

Adding a Funky Printer
583
system administrator will have to set up mappings (essentially configu-
rations that point the way to a shared printer). Many network system
administrators favor Directory Services, which provide a much higher
level of security and make it easy to limit access to a printer by user ID
or location.
✦Windows printing: “Hey, I get to use the enemy’s printers too?” That’s
right, as long as a Windows user on your network has shared his printer
(via the ubiquitous Windows File and Printer Sharing feature), you can
use it. Sweet.
✦Application printer drivers: Some printers aren’t actually physical
devices at all. For example, if you don’t want to use Panther’s built-in
faxing system, you can print directly to a third-party fax program such
as FAXstf X Pro (www.smithmicro.com), which then dials, connects,
and sends the document to a fax machine.
Although you can install Adobe Acrobat under Mac OS X, the operating
system provides built-in support for printing documents in Adobe’s PDF
format (which can then be viewed and printed on any other computer with
the Acrobat Reader, or added to your Web site for downloading). In fact, you
don’t even have to install a PDF print driver or display Printer Setup Utility!
To print a document in PDF format, click the Save as PDF button in the appli-
cation’s Print dialog, navigate to the desired folder and enter a filename, and
then click Save.
No matter which type of funky printer you add, it will need a driver installed
in the Printers folder, which resides inside your Library folder. (A driver is a
software program provided by the printer manufacturer that tells Mac OS X
how to communicate with your printer.) Also, if the printer is PostScript-
compatible, it will need a PPD file installed in your PPD folder, which also
appears in the Printers folder. Luckily, Mac OS X comes complete with a long
list of drivers and PPD files already installed and available — bravo, Apple
dudes and dudettes!
To add a funky printer, follow these steps:
1. Launch the manufacturer’s installation application, which should
copy the driver and PPD files for you.
If you have to do things the hard way, manually copy the driver file into
the Library/Printers folder and then copy the PPD file (if required)
into the Library/Printers/PPD folder.
2. If you’re adding a physical printer — instead of an application printer
driver — verify that the printer is turned on and accessible.
If you’re printing to a shared printer connected to another Mac, that
computer has to be on. Luckily, most network printers remain on all
the time.

Adding a Funky Printer
584
3. Launch Printer Setup Utility and then click the Add icon on the tool-
bar to display the Printer List sheet that you see in Figure 4-4.
4. Click the drop-down list at the top of the sheet and choose AppleTalk,
Rendezvous, Open Directory, IP Printing, Windows Printing, or the
application name.
• AppleTalk: If you choose AppleTalk, click the second drop-down list
and choose the correct AppleTalk Zone. After a scan of the specified
Zone, Printer Setup Utility displays the list of printers that it can
access from that Zone. Click the desired printer and then click Add.
• Rendezvous: Click Rendezvous, and you’re treated to a list of print-
ers offered on local Macintosh computers that it can access. Click
the desired printer and then click Add.
• Open Directory: If you choose Open Directory, the Printer Setup
Utility displays the list of printers that it can access. (Again, your
access to specific printers might be limited by your network system
administrator.) Click the desired printer and then click Add.
• IP Printing: If you choose IP Printing, type the printer’s IP address
or Domain Name System (DNS) name, which should be provided by
your network administrator or the person running the print server.
You can use the default queue on the server — which I recommend —
or disable the Use Default Queue on Server check box and type a
valid queue name for the server.
If you don’t know a valid queue name, you’re up a creek — hence,
my recommendation to use the default queue.

Finally, click the Printer Model drop-down list, choose the brand and
model of the remote printer, and then click Add.
• Windows Printing: If you choose Windows Printing, click the second
drop-down list and then click the correct Windows workgroup that
includes the printer(s) that you want to use. After a scan of the spec-
ified workgroup, Printer Setup Utility displays the list of printers that
it can access — click the desired printer and then click Add. (Don’t
forget to thank His Billness later.)
• Application Name: If you choose an application name, like FAXstf X
Pro, the application’s driver will display its own settings. Set the con-
figuration as necessary and then click Add.
Managing Your Printing Jobs
As I mention earlier in this chapter, you can also exercise some control over
the documents — or, in technoid, print jobs — that you send to your printer.
To display the jobs that are queued (in line) for your printer, click Printers
on the Printer Setup Utility menu and choose Show Jobs (or press Ô+O).
The actions that you can perform from the Jobs dialog are
✦Delete: When you click a print job in the list and then click the Delete
icon, the print job is removed from the queue. You might need to delete
a print job if you discover a mistake in the document while printing.
If the job is currently printing, several additional pages might be printed
before the job is finally cancelled. In other words, information already
sent to the printer might have to be printed before the cancel request
can be processed.
✦Hold: Click the Hold toolbar icon to pause printing of the current print
job. The status of the print job changes to Hold.
✦Resume: Click a print job in Hold status in the list and then click the
Resume icon to resume printing.
✦Stop Jobs: Click this icon to stop all printing. Note, however, that unlike
using the Delete command, Stop Jobs doesn’t remove any print jobs
from the list. When jobs are stopped, the Stop Jobs icon morphs into
Start Jobs — click it to restart all jobs in the queue list.
This is a good feature to use when your printer is about to run out
of paper.

Sharing a Printer across That There Network
586
Sharing a Printer across That There Network
Before we leave the Island of Big X Printing, I’d like to show you how to
share a printer with others on your local network.
If you decide to share your printers, don’t be surprised if Mac OS X seems to
slow down slightly from time to time. This is because of the processing time
necessary for your Mac to store queued documents from other computers.
The hard drive activity on your Mac is likely to significantly increase as well.
Where’s the chapter on faxing?
Good question, and here’s the answer: Panther
handles faxing so seamlessly that you don’t
need a chapter’s worth of instruction! As long
as your Mac has either an internal or external
analog (dialup) modem connected to a phone
line, you’re a lean faxing machine.
To fax any open document within an active
application, just click File and choose Print, or
press Ô+P. Panther adds the Fax button at the
bottom of the Print dialog — click it, and you
see the sheet shown here. Either type a tele-
phone number directly in the To field, or click
the suave-looking button with the profile next
to the field and choose a contact with a tele-
phone number from your Address Book. You
can optionally type a subject as well. Next, type
a dialing prefix if one is necessary to reach an
outside line. (Usually, you won’t have to select
an external modem because virtually all modern
Macs have an internal modem.)
If you need a spiffy-looking cover page, select
the Cover Page check box to enable it. Click in
the Comment box directly below it and type
whatever you like. When all is ready, you can
either click the Preview button to see the fax
before you send it, or throw caution utterly to
the wind and click the Fax button. The Printer
Setup Utility treats a fax just like any other
printed document, so you can cancel it or mon-
itor its progress, as I discuss earlier.

“Wait a second, Mark, didn’t you cover this already?” That’s right, but
Panther gives you more than one way to skin a . . . well, you get the idea,
even without the bad pun. To share a printer with a single click from within
the Printer Setup Utility, you can take the easy course. As I demonstrate ear-
lier in the chapter, click the Printer Setup Utility menu and click Preferences;
then enable the Share My Printers with Other Computers check box. Voilà!
You’re the guru!
However . . . (insert long pause here) . . . if you’re using the Mac OS X built-in
firewall, the easy way might not always work. (That’s because the firewall
will actually block any printer commands sent to it from other computers.)
Therefore, you can take the tougher road, which winds through System
Preferences — but you’ll make sure that the firewall won’t interfere with
your shared printers. Follow these steps:
1. Click the System Preferences icon in the Dock.
2. Click the Sharing icon.
3. Click the Services button to display the dialog that you see in
Figure 4-5.

4. Enable the On check box next to Printer Sharing in the Services
panel list.
5. Click the Firewall tab and make sure that the Printer Sharing check
box is enabled.
This will allow print jobs to pass through the firewall (see Figure 4-6).
6. Close System Preferences to save your changes.
The printers in your Printer Setup Utility list will be available to other com-
puters within the same IP subnet — in other words, someone in your local
network will be able to use your printers, but no one outside your network
will have access.
If you haven’t already assigned a printer a descriptive name, launch the
Printer Setup Utility, select the printer, and press Ô+I. This displays the
Show Info dialog for that particular printer. With Name & Location chosen
from the drop-down list, simply enter the name of your printer in the Printer
Name text field. You can also identify that printer’s location in the Location
text field. For example, in an office environment, I like to add the room
number to a shared printer name (as well as the Location field).

n Chapter 1 of this mini-book, I present you with an overview of the most
popular hardware that you can add to your Mac — and where there’s hard-
ware, software can’t be far behind. (Somebody famous said that — I think
it was either Bill Gates or Dennis Miller. I consider both of them famous
comedians.)
Anyway, Mac OS X comes with a full suite of software tools right out of the
box. You get Internet connectivity, disk repair, basic image editing, digital
video editing, and — depending on the price that you paid or the Mac model
that you bought — even games and a complete set of productivity applica-
tions. However, if you’re willing to pay for additional features and a manual
(at least what passes for a manual in the manufacturer’s opinion), you can
make all these tasks easier and accomplish them in shorter time.
Read on for an overview to the most popular third-party software applica-
tions for Mac OS X: what everyone’s using, how much they cost, and why
they’re (usually) better. But before you drop a wad of cash on a fancy new
application, though, remember yet another of Mark’s Maxims:
If a program you already have does everything you really need, you
don’t have to upgrade. Honest and truly.

The Trundling Microsoft Mammoth

The Trundling Microsoft Mammoth
Yes, I know I’ve been poking fun at His Gateness for much of this book —
you have to admit, he makes a pretty good target — but he did pull PC
owners out of the character-based world of DOS, and I’ll be the first to say
that he does get things right from time to time.
For example, I’ve always been more impressed with Microsoft Office than
I have been with Microsoft Windows. (At least Windows XP Professional
is a step in the right direction, but it still has a long way to go to match
Mac OS X.) Office has long been the productivity suite of choice in the
Windows world, and it’s also been a popular favorite in years past on the
Macintosh side.
A lot of hard work was put into the latest version of Microsoft Office, and
it shows. Office v. X was completely rewritten for Mac OS X, using the rules
that Apple recommends for the Aqua user interface — as you can see in
Figure 5-1, it looks as much like a native Mac OS X application as
AppleWorks 6, which is Apple’s competing office productivity suite.
However, like Mac OS X itself, Office v. X isn’t just an attractive exterior.
Consider some of the advantages of Office v. X:
✦Perfect document compatibility with the Windows version of Office:
You can both read and write documents with transparent ease, no
matter which platform gets the file. Documents can be shared between
platforms on the same network.
✦Mirrored commands: Both the Windows XP and Mac OS X versions of
Office share virtually identical menu items, dialogs, and settings, thus
making Mac OS X instantly familiar to anyone who’s used Office on a
Windows PC.
✦Support for native Aqua features: This includes transparent graphics
within your documents, input and confirmation sheets, and palettes for
formatting.
✦Tons of templates, samples, and support files: Microsoft doesn’t
scrimp on ready-to-use documents and templates, as well as additional
fonts, clip art, and Web samples.
✦Entourage: Entourage (shown in Figure 5-2) is the Macintosh counter-
part to Windows Outlook — it combines most of the same features that
you’ll find in the Apple Mail, iCal, and Address Book applications. (Read
about Apple Mail in Book IV, Chapter 2; read about the Address Book in
Book I, Chapter 5.) Use Entourage to participate in Internet newsgroups;
it also includes a Mailing List Manager to help you keep track of the
deluge of list messages that you receive every day.

Your Mac OS X Toolbox: Drive 10
592
Besides Entourage, Office v. X includes three other applications:
✦Word: The word processing application that rules the planet
✦Excel: The leading spreadsheet application
✦PowerPoint: A favorite presentation development application
The Office v. X Professional Edition suite costs a little over $400 at the time
of this writing — you might save a dollar or two if you buy it online from a
Web store like Mac Warehouse (www.macwarehouse.com).
Your Mac OS X Toolbox: Drive 10
My favorite native Mac OS X disk repair application is Drive 10 from
Micromat (www.micromat.com).
More than just about any other type of application, it’s important for a disk
maintenance program to be built “from the ground up” for Mac OS X. Never
attempt to repair a Mac OS X disk in Classic mode, nor should you try to use
an older repair utility that was written for use under Mac OS 9.
What about AppleWorks?
If you’re already using AppleWorks, you might
have noticed that the Office applications pro-
vide roughly the same features. (The drawing
and painting elements of AppleWorks are inte-
grated into the Office v. X suite.) Therefore,
you might wonder whether you should scrap
AppleWorks.
Remember my maxim — if the AppleWorks
suite that you’re familiar with is doing the job,
I recommend that you keep it. After all,
AppleWorks is a powerful productivity suite on
its own, capable of producing results that are
easily as good as Office v. X. Also, Apple does
provide conversion filters that can allow you to
open and save Office documents, so you’re not
isolated from the Office crowd. If you’re still
using Mac OS 9 on one or more of your Macs, I
should also point out that Office v. X doesn’t run
under Mac OS 9 — but AppleWorks runs like
clockwork on both Mac OS 9 and X.
On the other side of the coin, I would recom-
mend that you buy Office if
• You prefer the Office menu design and
features.
• You’d like to keep most of the same com-
mands replicated in the same places as the
Windows version of Office.
• You want to seamlessly share documents
with co-workers who use Windows Office
on your network or through e-mail.

Your Mac OS X Toolbox: Drive 10
593
With Drive 10 (shown in Figure 5-3), you can thoroughly check a hard drive
for both physical errors (such as faulty electronics or a bad sector on the
disk surface) and logical errors (incorrect folder data and glitches in the file
structure). The Disk Utility that’s included with Mac OS X does a fine job of
checking the latter, but it doesn’t perform the physical testing — and Drive
10 does both.
I should note, however, that Drive 10 doesn’t take care of viruses. Pick up a
copy of Norton AntiVirus (www.norton.com) to protect yourself against
viral attack.
Drive 10 also takes care of disk optimization, which is a feature that’s been
conspicuously absent from Mac OS X ever since the beginning. As I explain
earlier in Book I, Chapter 6, defragmenting your disk will result in better per-
formance and a faster system overall.
Version 1.1 of Drive 10, which will set you back about $70, comes on a self-
booting CD-ROM so you can easily fix your startup volume by booting your
system from the Drive 10 disc.

Image Editing for the Masses

Image Editing for the Masses
The only one true King of the Retouching Hill in Mac OS X, Adobe
Photoshop (www.adobe.com/products/photoshop) has been the digital-
image editing favorite of Mac owners for many years now. Like Office v. X,
Photoshop 7 has been reassembled for Mac OS X, and it also takes full
advantage of the Aqua standard (see Figure 5-4).
You can find more three-pound Photoshop books on the shelf than politi-
cians in trouble, so it’s no surprise that I can’t provide you with a sweeping
list of its features in this section. However, here’s a summary of what you
can expect from Adobe’s crown jewel:
✦Superior editing: The most sophisticated image editing possible for
a digital photograph — if you can accomplish an image-editing task in
software, it’s very likely that Photoshop can do it. You can even com-
bine and splice parts of different images to produce a new work of art
or perhaps distort and liquefy an image to produce a new look.
✦Image retouching tools: These help you rescue images with problems
such as overexposure and color imbalance. (You can also use tools like
the new Healing brush to erase imperfections in the photograph’s
subject.)

The Morass of Digital Video
595
✦Plug-ins: Photoshop has been a standard for plug-in functionality since
it first appeared — if you need features that aren’t in the application out
of the box, you can add them through third-party plug-ins.
✦Web posting: Prepare images for use on the Web.
✦Painting tools: Use these gems to simulate different types of inks,
paints, and brushes on different types of media.
Although Photoshop is a hefty $600 for the full package, Adobe has also cre-
ated a kid brother, Photoshop Elements 2.0, that sells for a mere $85.
Designed for the novice or intermediate level photographer, Elements has
most of the functionality of the full package that you’re likely to need.
Elements also provides a number of very helpful wizards to help automate
the most common image-editing tasks, as well as one of the most compre-
hensive Help systems that I’ve ever used.
The Morass of Digital Video
Two types of applications make up the DV market: digital video editing
(where you create a movie) and DVD mastering (where you take that movie
and create a DVD movie). You can find a number of great applications on the
market in both of these categories, all at different price points and different
levels of complexity. They include
✦iMovie: I cover this easy-to-use video editing iApp in Book III, Chapter 4.
A good choice for any novice, it’s usually bundled for free with today’s
new Mac models. You might also receive it with Mac OS X.
✦iDVD: This is the DVD mastering counterpart to iMovie. Although it’s
a snap to use, it doesn’t offer a lot of advanced features. (Book III,
Chapter 5 explains iDVD in detail.) Again, you’ll receive it free with your
Mac if you bought a model with a SuperDrive.
✦Premiere 6.5: This is the DV editing application from Adobe that’s been
a standard on both the Mac and PC. Premiere is much more complex
than iMovie and offers far more features and control over the finished
footage, but learning it is a bear compared with iMovie. Premiere sells
for around $600; www.adobe.com/products/premiere.
✦DVD Studio Pro: Apple’s entry into the ranks of DVD mastering (see
Figure 5-5) can produce a commercial-quality DVD movie disc, but don’t
expect any hand-holding or assistants with this application. This is a
serious tool for professionals, and it’ll set you back $500. With DVD
Studio Pro 2 (www.apple.com/dvdstudiopro), you can add interactive,
animated menus, subtitles, multiple audio tracks, and Web interactivity
to your DVD projects.

Yes, It’s Really Called “Toast”
596
✦Final Cut Pro: At $1,000, you’d assume Final Cut Pro (www.apple.com/
finalcutpro) to be the best DV editing package on the market for
Mac OS X . . . and you won’t get any argument from me. It offers real-time
playback — no waiting for rendering, like you have to within iMovie and
Premiere — and OfflineRT, which is an offline, hard drive storage format
that lets you park over 40 minutes of digital video in a single gigabyte
of hard drive space. Sweet.
Yes, It’s Really Called “Toast”
Time to turn your attention to a subject near and dear to my heart: record-
ing data CDs, audio CDs, and DVDs on the Macintosh (which I cover in detail
in another of my For Dummies books, CD and DVD Recording For Dummies,
2nd Edition, published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.). Of course, Mac OS X can
burn basic data CDs that you can share with your Windows and UNIX
friends without any add-on software. If you have a Mac equipped with a
SuperDrive, you can also create standard, cross-platform data DVDs, too.
But what if you need an exotic format, like CD Extra, where data and digital
audio tracks can co-exist peacefully on one disc? Or perhaps you need a
self-booting disc?

There’s one clear choice: When you’re ready to seriously burn, you’re ready
for Roxio Toast (www.roxio.com), the CD and DVD recording choice for mil-
lions of Mac owners. (No snickering about the name, please.) Figure 5-6 illus-
trates this powerhouse of an application, which is an elegant design that’s
both simple to use and perfectly Aqua. Files, folders, and digital audio tracks
that you want to record are simply dropped into the application window.
As for exotic formats, here’s a list of what types of discs that you can record
with Toast:
✦Standard data CDs and DVDs
✦Standard audio CDs
✦Video CDs
✦MP3 discs (which store MP3 audio tracks)
✦Discs recorded from an image file
✦Mac volumes
✦Hybrid PC/Mac discs
✦ISO 9660 discs
✦Multisession discs
✦CD Extra discs
Toast works with both internal and external CD and DVD recorders, taking
advantage of the latest features on today’s drives — in particular, burn-proof
recording, which can practically eliminate recording errors. You can also
copy existing discs, using one or multiple drives.

Toast is quite affordable at $90. You can buy it directly from the Roxio online

If You Positively Have to Run Windows . . .
Here’s where Mac power users usually start grinning from ear to ear like
Santa’s elves on the day after Christmas, because — get this — the great
Unwashed Windows Horde actually thinks that you can’t run Windows XP on
a Macintosh! Can you believe that? Obviously, they haven’t heard of Virtual
PC from Microsoft (www.microsoft.com/mac/), which without a doubt is
one of the coolest applications ever written for the Mac.
No, my friend, your eyes are not deceiving you — you are indeed looking at
Windows 2000 running on my iMac G4 in Figure 5-7. Virtual PC 6 provides a
near-perfect PC environment for any version of Windows from 95 all the way
up to XP; literally, Windows has no idea that it’s not running on a typical
piece of PC iron.

Virtual PC simulates everything necessary for you to get the full functionality
out of Windows. For example, this jewel automatically (and transparently)
handles your Windows Internet connection, network tasks, and CD and DVD
access. Heck, it even allows you to use your single-button mouse as a two-
button PC mouse (by holding down the Control key while you click). You
can run full-screen or run Windows in a window. (Pun joyfully intended.)
If that weren’t enough, you can also run multiple operating systems. So, if
you need Linux or Windows 2000 along with your XP system, no problem —
all it takes is the install disc for those operating systems and the hard drive
space to hold ’em. And yes, it does run under both Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X.
Just plain sassy.
Naturally, performance is an issue — and, to be honest, Virtual PC isn’t for
the PC gamer, even with the newest Macs and their super-duper GeForce
and Radeon video cards. Because today’s PC games push an actual PC to the
limit, they just run too sluggishly on a Mac emulating a PC — they do run,
just too slowly. (Also, virtually all of today’s blockbuster PC games are also
being ported to Mac OS X, so why not just run the Mac version?)
However, when it comes to just about any other type of application, Virtual
PC running on a late-model G4 Mac can deliver performance equal to a
Pentium III — with a new G5 Power Mac, you can match the power of a typi-
cal Pentium 4 PC. The more memory that your Mac has, the more you can
give your virtual PC, so it also pays to have 512MB or more of RAM. (And
naturally, a dual-processor Mac runs Virtual PC much faster.) I use Virtual
PC with niche Windows programs that have never appeared on the Mac as
well as native Mac versions of all other applications. Again, you don’t need
to use Mac to run the Windows version of Photoshop because Photoshop 7
is also available for the Mac.
If you’re tired of the undeserved taunts from your clueless Windows friends,
run — don’t walk — to your browser and order a copy of Virtual PC 6. The
program comes prepackaged with fully licensed copies of several different
flavors of Windows and Linux. For example, the version with XP Home costs
around $200 — or you can buy the DOS version and supply your own copy
of Windows for about $90.
All Hail FileMaker Pro
If databases are the name of your game, you’ve already been using
FileMaker Pro for years (on both Mac and Windows, more than likely). For
the uninitiated, FileMaker Pro (www.filemakerpro.com) is the premier
database creation, editing, and maintenance application for Mac OS X. It
comes with dozens of ready-made database templates for business, home,

and education use, or you can construct your own database in surprisingly
short order.
Right out of the box, FileMaker Pro 6 (as shown in Figure 5-8) can create
✦Business databases and forms for inventory, personnel, purchase
orders, and product catalogs
✦Home databases for budgeting, recipes, music CDs, DVD movies, family
medical records, and event planning
✦Education databases for student records, expense reports, field trip
planning, book and multimedia libraries, and class scheduling
FileMaker Pro 6 can add images and multimedia to your database, and you
can quickly and easily publish your databases on your Web site by using
one of the built-in theme designs. (In fact, visitors to your Web site can
update your database online, if you like.) FileMaker Pro 6 can also allow mul-
tiple users to share data across your network, no matter whether they’re
running the Mac or Windows version.
At $299, FileMaker Pro 6 is one of the least expensive — and most powerful —
applications that you can buy.

StuffIt
In the Windows world, the Zip archive is the king of archiving formats. An
archive contains one or more compressed files that you can uncompress
whenever you need them. Folks store files in archives to save space on their
hard drives; archiving is also a neat way to package an entire folder’s worth
of files in a single convenient file, which you can attach to an e-mail message
or send via File Transfer Protocol (FTP).
On Planet Macintosh, the archiving format of choice is StuffIt. Manage your
archives with StuffIt Deluxe, from Aladdin Systems (www.aladdinsys.com),
as shown in Figure 5-9. StuffIt Deluxe can both archive and unarchive .sit
files (the common name for StuffIt archives) as well as Zip archives from

QuicKeys X
QuicKeys X, from CE Software (www.cesoft.com), is another example of
someone thinking properly. This time, the idea is to automate repetitive
tasks by allowing Mac OS X to memorize what you do. Think of QuicKeys X
as a system-wide, macro playback application. Unlike AppleScript, however,
QuicKeys X works within any application and can play back mouse move-
ment and clicks/double-clicks. Figure 5-10 illustrates the QuicKeys applica-
tion menu.
I’ve used QuicKeys X for a number of different tasks, including
✦Typing a commonly used block of text (like my address) into applica-
tions that don’t support macros
✦Launching applications at specific times and dates
✦Operating menus within programs to automate complex tasks
✦Launching Classic or choosing a specific startup disk with a single key
sequence
QuicKeys X sells for $79 on the CE Software Web site.

BBEdit
Although we all know and love Mac OS X as a graphical operating system,
folks still need a powerful text editor for creating and modifying text files.
For example, software developers and Webmasters still use text editors
daily to write applications or apply a quick fix to the HyperText Markup
Language (HTML) that makes up a Web page. (I use a text editor to make
minor changes to my Web site, MLC Books Online, without firing up a hor-
rendous Web design application. Talk about overkill!)
At first, you might think of TextEdit, which is the free application that ships
with Mac OS X. It’s not a bad editor, either, with features that are very simi-
lar to Notepad in the Windows environment. However, serious text and code
editing requires a more powerful tool, and the text editor of choice for Mac
owners is universally considered to be BBEdit, from Bare Bones Software
(www.barebones.com). Figure 5-11 shows a document open within BBEdit.
Figure 5-11:

Bare Bones Software pulls no punches in describing BBEdit — its advertis-
ing proclaims, “It doesn’t suck.” Gotta give Bare Bones credit; this incredibly
popular editor includes features like
✦Compatibility with both Mac OS X and Mac OS 9.
✦Support for DOS/Windows, Mac, and UNIX text files. (Yes, differences
do exist between the platforms, even with a so-called pure text file.)
✦Works with text files up to 2GB in size. (Try that with TextEdit. Hmm . . .
on second thought, please don’t.)
✦HTML tools for Web design. These tools include syntax checking and
browser preview.
✦grep pattern-based, multifile search and replace. In non-programmer/
non-UNIX English, that means a very sophisticated search-and-replace
function that can span more than one text file.
✦Syntax coloring. Use this to help you quickly locate commands and
qualifiers in programming languages.
✦Built-in FTP transfer commands, integrated spell-checking, and highly
configurable custom keymaps.
You can even expand the functionality of BBEdit with plug-ins, many of
which are free extensions written by programmers and developers specifi-
cally for languages like C/C++, Java/JavaScript, Perl, and Pascal.
BBEdit is available from the Bare Bones Software site for $119.
REALbasic
The final application that I want to mention really isn’t a utility as such —
however, you can use it to write your own software, so I guess that it should
qualify. As an ex-COBOL programmer, reluctant Visual Basic shareware
developer, and recalcitrant dBASE coder, I can tell you that REALbasic (from
REAL Software) is definitely the easiest visual drag-and-drop programming
environment that I’ve ever used. If you want to develop your own productiv-
ity applications, Mac OS X utilities, or — dare I say it? your own game! —
award-winning REALbasic is the way to go. (See Figure 5-12.)
Development in REALbasic is as simple as designing the application window
by first simply adding controls, text, and multimedia wherever you like.
Then just fill in the blanks, like setting variables and specifying what hap-
pens when the controls are triggered, by using a new implementation of the
tried-and-true BASIC language. Of course, some programming knowledge is
required but far less than you’d need with Visual Basic. And the results look
as good as anything you can accomplish in those so-called real program-
ming languages.

✦Support for all sorts of multimedia, including QuickTime.
✦Ability to animate and rotate text and objects, or tap the 3-D power of
QuickDraw3D and OpenGL graphics.
✦Capability to allow printing, network, and Internet communications

REALbasic has been such a popular development tool on the Macintosh that
dozens of user-supported Web sites and mailing lists have sprung up, offer-
ing all sorts of REALbasic plug-ins, tutorials, and sample code for you to use
in your own projects.
I would be seriously remiss if I didn’t mention the bestselling REALbasic For

I’ve practically worn out my copy, and it never leaves my desk. If you’re

REALbasic 5 comes in two versions — the Standard Edition ($149.95) and
the Professional Edition ($449.95). You can order either version from the

At Least One Game
To be completely accurate, Mac OS X already comes with one game — a
very good version of chess, which I cover in the next section — but the
Macintosh has never been considered a true gaming platform by most com-
puter owners. Until recently, many popular Windows games were never
ported (or converted) for the Mac, and only the most expensive Mac models
had the one important component that determines the quality of today’s
games: a first-rate, 3-D video card.
However, within the last two years or so, all that has changed dramatically.
All of today’s Mac models feature muscle-car-quality video cards that use
the nVIDIA GeForce or ATI Radeon chipsets; they can handle the most com-
plex 3-D graphics with ease. Match that with the renewed popularity of the
Macintosh as a home computer and the performance of the current crop of
G4 and G5 processors, and — wham! Suddenly you’ve got the best game
developers in the business — id Software (www.idsoftware.com), Firaxis
(www.firaxis.com), and Blizzard (www.blizzard.com), to name a few —
releasing Macintosh versions of their newest games concurrently with the
Windows version.
For the gamer in you, allow me to take you on a tour of the best of the new
generation of entertainment.

No mercenaries, no rail guns, and no cities to raze — but chess is still the

The game features speech recognition, move hints, take back (or undo) for
your last move, and a 2-D or 3-D board. You can also list your games in text
form and print them or save games in progress. Maybe it’s not a complete
set of bells and whistles like commercial chess games, but the price is right,
and the play can be quite challenging when you set it at the higher skill
levels.
Civilization III
Sid Meier’s original Civilization is considered by many hard-core gamers to
be one of the top three or four best games ever written, so Civilization III
(Civ 3 for short) has some pretty big shoes to fill. Like previous versions,
your job is to lead a civilization through its development and ultimately win
the game by colonizing another star system, assimilating all the other civi-
lizations, or being voted supreme leader of the planet. Sounds like a nice,
quiet afternoon’s diversion, right?
Well, be ready for a typical turn-based game to last well into the night.
Civ 3 is a complex game, but after you learn the basics, you’ll be instantly
addicted. (Those who have played the first two versions of Civilization will
feel comfortable right off the bat.) You establish towns that slowly grow into
cities, research new technology, build alliances with other players (and tear
them down), and wage war if necessary. Your people must be kept happy
and entertained — as well as taxed. One way to keep the peace is to build
Wonders like the Pyramids or to assign some of the populace as entertain-
ers. Figure 5-14 shows a typical screen from Civ 3.

The game sells for around $40 on the Web — for screenshots and additional

If you’re looking for a game that involves strategy and management — as
well as practically unlimited replay value because you can configure entirely
new worlds to inhabit — I can heartily recommend Civilization III. You won’t
be disappointed!
Return to Castle Wolfenstein
You can just hear Indiana Jones: “Nazis. Why did they have to be Nazis? I
hate ’em!” Those of us with a long computing past remember the original
Castle Wolfenstein, which ran on the Atari, Commodore, and Apple II com-
puters. (I still have a copy that runs on my antique Atari 800 and
Commodore 64 computers.) Playing an American GI imprisoned in a Nazi
castle, you had to find your way out, reducing the Nazis to zero and reliev-
ing them of their secret Axis plans in the process. Along with the cutting-
edge gameplay — pixellated rooms and stick-figure guards — the game
actually spoke (albeit very fuzzy, hard-to-understand German).

Next came Castle Wolfenstein 3-D, which was an immediate predecessor
to DOOM and one of the first classic 3-D games. Suddenly the old building
and its occupants were far more realistic. . . . I remember creeping around
corners and flinching when I was attacked by a German Shepherd for the
first time.
Now id Software brings the legendary Castle Wolfenstein cutting-edge graph-
ics, gameplay, and the best weapon and level designs in the business, as
shown in Figure 5-15. You’ll encounter evil in many forms: human, zombie,
and far worse. Besides the interior of the castle, you’ll travel through envi-
ronments like underground labyrinths, ancient churches, Nazi research lab-
oratories, and even a cable car.
Most of the weapons in this 3-D shooter are realistic recreations of Allied
and Axis machine guns, rifles, pistols, and grenades. You also get imaginary
weapons like a top-secret Axis chain gun and something that looks and oper-
ates like the WWF version of a taser. Enemies are smart and hard to beat,
using most of the same tactics that you’ll use: using cover, ducking to
reload, and working together in teams. The single-player story is well writ-
ten, with just the right amount of tension. Multiplayer mode allows you to
play on either the Axis or the Allied side over both an Internet connection
and a local network.

WarCraft III
To finish my survey of must-have games, I’ll end with Blizzard’s best:
WarCraft III. This heady mixture of RTS (short for real-time strategy) and
RPG (short for role-playing game) is yet another sequel in another popular
game series. WarCraft III puts you in the boots of human princes, Orc battle
generals, undead champions, and elven lords — in fact, in single player
mode, you’ll play each of these warrior races in turn. My recommendation:
Stick with the Night Elves, my friend.
Combat, however, is only half of the job. Each mission is different; typically,
you also have to gather resources by mining gold and cutting trees while
you build new structures and train new troops. You can take to the air, buy
goods from mercenaries, or even hire goblins to do your dirty work (if you
have the gold handy). Spells abound, as do siege weapons and mounted
warriors. (Personally, my favorite units have to be the living guardian trees
of the Night Elves, which toss boulders. I want one of those — a friendly
one, mind you — in my backyard.)
Although visually stunning, WarCraft III is no first-person game. Instead, you
view the action from an overhead perspective, as you can see in Figure 5-16.
Control is by both keyboard and mouse; the game is easy to learn, but you’ll
always find someone to kick your posterior in multiplayer games, both over
the Internet and across your own local area network (LAN).

You’ll find the storyline in this game riveting — it keeps you playing with its
twists and turns. Your units include heroes, which are no static figureheads.
As they gain experience, you can teach them new skills and outfit them with
all sorts of magical items.
You’ll pay about $50 online for WarCraft III, and it’ll be worth every single

A
s I mention in the first chapter of the book — at the beginning of our
Panther odyssey — UNIX lurks deep beneath the shiny Aqua exterior
of Mac OS X. UNIX is a tried-and-true operating system that has been around
for decades, since the days when mainframe computers were king. If you
don’t believe that it’s a powerful (and popular) operating system, consider
that over half of all Web servers on the Internet use some variety of UNIX as
their operating system of choice.
Besides being battle-tested and having a long history, UNIX also offers some
fantastic features. Unlike the graphical world of Mac OS X, the keyboard
plays an integral role while you’re using a UNIX-based operating system.
Because UNIX is text-based, you’ll find that it has evolved a large set of
useful keyboard-driven commands that can perform powerful feats that a
mouse user just can’t easily equal. This chapter examines the role of the
keyboard in UNIX operating systems and describes how to execute standard
file system commands. You also discover how to use Apple’s additional set
of commands and install your own commands (and simple programs) from
the Internet.
Why Use the Keyboard?
To begin benefiting from the UNIX underpinnings of Mac OS X, get used to
doing things with the keyboard. Although mouse skills can be applied to
UNIX, you’ll generally find performing UNIX functions faster and easier with
the keyboard.

Why Use the Keyboard?
616
UNIX keyboarding is fast
Why on Earth would any red-blooded Macintosh owner want to leave the
comfort of the mouse to use a keyboard? After all, the graphical user inter-
face is what made the Macintosh great in the first place. With the Finder,
you can navigate and manage the various files on your hard drive with a few
clicks. This sounds simple enough, but for some tasks, using the keyboard
can be just as fast, if not faster.
Suppose, for example, that you need to copy a file from somewhere on your
hard drive to somewhere else on that same drive. To do so with the Finder,
you must first open a Finder window (by clicking the Finder icon in the
Dock, or by double-clicking a drive icon on your Desktop). Then, by using a
succession of mouse clicks, you navigate to where the file that you wish to
copy resides. Next, you might open another Finder window  and navigate to
the folder where you wish to copy the file. (Note: Opening the second Finder
window requires pressing Ô+N; clicking the Finder icon in the Dock does
not open a second Finder window.) Finally, you duplicate the original file
and drag that copy to its intended destination.
By using the keyboard and the power of UNIX, you can accomplish the same
task with a one-line command. For some tasks, the mouse is definitely the
way to go, but you can perform some tasks just as quickly, if not faster, with
the keyboard. For the skinny on one-line commands, skip down to the
upcoming section, “Uncovering the Terminal.”
The UNIX keyboard is a powerful beast
So maybe you’re not an expert typist and using the mouse still sounds invit-
ing. For many scenarios, you’d be correct in assuming that a mouse can
handle the job just as quickly and easily as a bunch of commands that you
have to memorize. Using the keyboard, however, offers some other distinct
advantages over the mouse. To allow you to control your computer from the
keyboard, all UNIX operating systems offer the command-line tool. With this
tool, you can enter commands one line at a time: hence, its name. Mac OS X
ships with the command-line application, Terminal. You can find it here:
/Applications/Utilities/Terminal
One shining feature of the command line is its efficiency. To wit: When
you use a mouse, one mouse click is equal to one command. When you
use the command line, on the other hand, you aren’t limited to entering
one command at a time; rather, you can combine commands into a kind of
super-command (minus the silly cape, but with bulging muscles intact),
with each command performing some action of the combined whole. By
using the command line, you can string together a whole bunch of com-
mands to do a very complex task.

Book VII
Chapter 1
. . . And UNIX

Why Use the Keyboard?
617
For example, consider how many times you’d have to click a mouse in the
Finder to do the following:
✦Find all files that begin with the letters MyDocument.
✦From this list of files, add a number to the beginning of the filename
indicating its size in kilobytes.
✦Save the names of all altered files to a text file.
By using the command line, you could accomplish all these tasks by typing
only one super-command: that is, a collection of three simple commands
combined to form one instruction. Remember: The built-in Terminal pro-
gram that ships with Mac OS X Panther gives you everything that you need
to start using the command line. I show you how in the section “Uncovering
the Terminal,” later in this chapter.
Delving farther into super-commands is not for the faint-hearted; things get
pretty ugly pretty quickly. If your thirst for UNIX dominance so compels you,
however, I invite you to do a little independent study to bone up on all-
things-UNIX. Pick up a copy of the great book of lore entitled Unix For
Dummies, 5th Edition, written by John R. Levine and Margaret Levine Young
(by Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Go where no mouse has gone before
The Finder is generally a helpful thing, but it makes many assumptions about
how you work. One of these assumptions is that you don’t have any need to
handle some of the files on your hard drive. As I mention in Chapter 6 of
Book IV, Mac OS X ships with its system files marked Off Limits, and I gener-
ally agree with that policy (which keeps anyone from screwing up the deli-
cate innards of Mac OS X). To secure your system files, Apple purposely
hides some files from view.
But what road do you take if you actually need to view or modify those
system files? Yep, you guessed it: The command line comes to the rescue!
You can use the command line to peer inside every nook and cranny of your
Mac’s vast directory structure on your hard drive. It also has the power to
edit files that aren’t normally accessible to you. With the command line, you
can pretend to be other users — even users with more permissions. By tem-
porarily acting as another more powerful user, you can perform actions with
the command line that would be impossible in the Finder. (Just remember to
make sure that you know what you’re doing, or you’re working with an
Apple technical support person — a wrong move, and it’ll be time for an
Ominous Chord.)

618
Automate to elevate
If all these benefits are beginning to excite you, hold on to your socks! Not
only can you perform complex commands with the command line, you can
go even one step further: automation. If you find yourself using the same set
of commands more than once, you’re a likely candidate for using automa-
tion to save time. Instead of typing the list of commands each time, you can
save them to a text file and execute the entire file with only one command.
Now that’s power!
Of course, you probably don’t like doing housekeeping tasks while you’re
busy on other things, so schedule that list of commands to run in the middle
of the night while you’re fast asleep. The command line lets you do that, too.
(Note that automation of UNIX commands is totally separate from automa-
tion of Mac OS X applications with AppleScript, which I cover in Book VII,
Chapter 2.)
Remote control
“So, Mark, the command line is the cat’s meow for efficiently accessing and
working with files on my Mac, and I can use it to automate many operations.
Anything else?” I’m glad you asked! By using the command line, you can also
send commands to another computer anywhere in the world (as long as you
know the right login and password). After you log into another computer,
you can use the same commands for the remote computer.
UNIX was created with multiple users in mind. Because computers used to
be expensive (and honking huge machines to boot), UNIX was designed so
that multiple users could remotely use the same machine simultaneously. In
fact, if Mac OS X is your first encounter with UNIX, you might be surprised
to know that many UNIX beginners of the past weren’t even in the same
room, building, state, or even country as the computer that they were using.
Not only can you work with a computer that’s in a different physical loca-
tion, but it’s also very fast to do so. Instead of the bandwidth hog that is the
Internet, the command line is lean and mean. This permits you to use a
remote computer nearly as fast as if it were sitting on the desk in front of
you. (This is a great advantage for road warriors who need to tweak a Web,
e-mail, or FTP server from a continent away.)
Uncovering the Terminal
The best way to learn how to use command line is to jump right in. Mac OS
X comes stocked with an application named Terminal. The Terminal applica-
tion is where you enter commands in the command line. It is located in the

Utilities folder within the Applications folder on your hard drive — choose
Applications➪Utilities.
Double-click the icon shown in Figure 1-1 to launch Terminal.
By the way, feel free to make Terminal more accessible by dragging its icon
to the Dock or the toolbar. That way, you won’t have to dive this deep into
the Applications folder in the future.
What’s a prompt?
Upon launch of the Terminal application, you’ll immediately notice some
text in the window that appears onscreen.
Last login: Sun Jun 23 17:51:14 on console
Welcome to Darwin! 
[WHITEDRAGON:~] chambers%
As you might guess, this text details the last time that you logged into the
Terminal, followed by a greeting from the Darwin underbelly of Mac OS X.
(As I mention in Chapter 1 of Book I, Darwin is Apple’s name for the UNIX
underpinnings of Mac OS X.) The last line, however, is the most important
one. It’s called the prompt.
The prompt serves some important functions. First, it lists the current direc-
tory, which is listed as ~. A tilde character (~) denotes a user’s Home direc-
tory. By default, you will always be in your Home folder each time that you
begin a new session on the Terminal. After the current directory, the Terminal
displays the name of the current user, which is chambers in this example.
Figure 1-1:

620
The final character of the prompt is a %. Consider this your cue because
immediately after this character is where you enter any command that you
wish to execute. Go ahead; don’t be shy. Try out your first command by
typing uptime in the Terminal application. (It’s a good idea to type UNIX
commands in lowercase.) Your text appears at the location of the cursor,
denoted by a small square. If you make a mistake while entering the com-
mand, press the Delete key to back up and then type the characters again.
(If the typing error is stuck deep in a longer command, press the left- or
right-arrow key to move the cursor immediately after the incorrect charac-
ter and press Delete to back up; then type the correct characters.) After you
type the command, press Return to execute it.
[WHITEDRAGON:~] chambers% uptime
6:24PM  up  2:42, 4 users, load averages: 2.44, 2.38, 1.90
[WHITEDRAGON:~] chambers% 
If all goes well, you should see a listing of how long your Mac has been run-
ning since the last reboot or login. In the example listing, the computer has
been running for 2 hours and 42 minutes (2:42 in line 2). Simple, eh?
Immediately following the listing of the uptime command, the Terminal dis-
plays another prompt for you to enter more commands. I examine many
more commands later in this chapter.
A few commands to get started
Using the command line is simply a matter of entering simple instructions —
or commands — into the Terminal application and pressing Return to exe-
cute them. It’s easy to use the command line to navigate through the various
folders on your hard drive. You’ll become accustomed to using two vital
commands: ls and cd. The ls command is shorthand for list, and it does
just that: It lists the contents of the current directory. Enter ls at your prompt,
and you should see a listing of your Home folder as shown in Figure 1-2.
The complementary cd command (lowercase) — which incidentally stands
for change directory — opens any folder that you specify. It works much the
same as double-clicking a folder in the Finder: The difference is that follow-
ing the cd command, you don’t immediately see all of the folder’s content.
However, the cd command requires a parameter (extra options or informa-
tion that appear after the command) so that your Mac knows which folder
to open.
For example, to open the Documents folder that resides in your Home direc-
tory, type cd Documents and press Return. When you do, you might be sur-
prised to see another prompt immediately displayed. So where are all the
files in the Documents folder? You must enter another command to see what
items are in the folder that you just opened. Type ls again to see the con-
tents of the Documents folder, as shown in Figure 1-3.

If you try to open a folder that has a space in its name, make sure to enclose
the folder’s name in quotes, like this:
cd “My Picture Folder”
Read more about using quotes in your commands in the upcoming section,
“Command line gotchas.”
To return to your Home folder, enter a modified version of the cd command:
cd ..

622
This causes your Mac to move back up the folder hierarchy one folder to
your Home directory. By using these three simple commands — ls, cd
foldername, and cd .. — you can traverse your entire hard drive.
After you successfully enter a command, you can recall it by pressing the
up-arrow key. Press the up-arrow key again to see the command prior to
that, and so forth. This is an extremely useful trick for retyping extra long
file paths.
Using the skills you already have
Just because the Terminal is text-based doesn’t mean that it doesn’t act
like a good Macintosh citizen. All the usual Mac features that you know and
love are there for you to use. Copy and Paste functions work as you might
expect — but only at the prompt position.
Drag-and-drop is also at your disposal. After you play around with the
Terminal for a while, you’ll find yourself bored to tears typing the long paths
that represent the files on your hard drive. To automatically enter the path
of a file or folder to a command, simply drag it to the active Terminal
window, as shown in Figure 1-4. The file’s full path instantly appears at the
location of your cursor. (Thanks, Apple!)
You can even use the mouse while entering commands in the Terminal. Click
and drag your mouse over text to select it. From there, you can copy to the
Clipboard as you might expect with any other application.

623
UNIX Commands 101
To use the command line effectively, you need to familiarize yourself with
the commands that are available to you. After all, how can you use a tool
without knowing what it can do? Despite having to memorize a few com-
mands, UNIX usually makes it easy on you by abbreviating commands, by
following a standard grammar (so to speak), and by providing you with
extensive documentation for each command.
Anatomy of a UNIX command
UNIX commands can perform many amazing feats. Despite their vast abili-
ties, all commands follow a similar structure:
command <optional flag(s)> <optional operand(s)>
The simplest form of a UNIX command is the command itself. (For a basic
discussion on UNIX commands such as ls, see the earlier section, “A few
commands to get started.”) You can expand your use of the ls command by
appending various flags, which are settings that enable or disable optional
features for the command. Flags are preceded by a dash (-) and always
follow the command. For instance, you can display the contents of a direc-
tory as a column of names by tacking on an -l flag to the ls command.
ls –l
Besides flags, UNIX commands sometimes also have operands. An operand
is something that is acted upon. For example, instead of just entering the ls
command, which lists the current directory, you can add an operand to list
a specific directory:
ls ~/Documents/myProject/
The tilde (~) denotes the user’s Home directory.
Sometimes a command can take multiple operands, as is the case when you
copy a file. The two operands represent the source file and the destination
of the file that you want to copy, separated by a space. The following exam-
ple copies a text file from the Documents folder to the Desktop folder by
using the cp command (short for copy).
cp ~/Documents/MyDocument ~/Desktop/MyDocument
You can also combine flags and operands in the same command. This exam-
ple displays the contents of a specific folder in list format:
ls –l ~/Documents/myProject/

UNIX Commands 101
624
Command line gotchas
In earlier sections, I describe a few simple command line functions. All these
commands have something in common: You might not have noticed, but
every example thus far involved folder names and filenames that contained
only alphanumeric characters. Remember what happens if you have a folder
name that has a space in it? Try the following example, but don’t worry
when it won’t work.
The cd command stands for change directory.
cd /Desktop Folder
The result is an error message:
cd: Too many arguments.
The problem is that a space character is not allowed in a path. To get
around this problem, simply enclose the path in double quotation marks,
like this:
cd “/Desktop Folder”
Mac OS X lets you use either double or single quotation marks to enclose a
path with spaces in it. Standard UNIX operating systems, however, use
double quotation marks for this purpose.
In a similar vein, you can get the space character to be accepted by a com-
mand by adding an escape character. To escape a character, add a backslash
(\) immediately prior to the character in question. To illustrate, try the last
command with an escape character instead. Note that this time, no quota-
tion marks are necessary.
cd /Desktop\ Folder
You can use either quotes or escape characters because they’re inter-
changeable.
Help is on the way!
By now, you might be wondering how a computer techno-wizard is sup-
posed to keep all these commands straight. Fortunately, you can find gener-
ous documentation for nearly every command available to you. To access
this built-in help, use the man command. Using the man command (short-
hand for manual) will display a help file for any command that it knows
about. For example, to read the available help information for the ls com-
mand, simply type man ls at the prompt. Figure 1-5 illustrates the result.

Working with Files
625
Autocompletion
To speed things along, the tcsh shell can auto-magically complete your
input for you while you type. Although the Terminal permits you to enter
commands via the keyboard, it is the shell that interprets those commands.
There are many kinds of shells available to UNIX users. The shell that Mac
OS X uses by default is named tcsh. Use the autocompletion features of
tcsh to autocomplete both commands and filenames. To demonstrate,
begin by typing the following:
cd ~/De
Then press the Tab key. This result is that the shell predicts that you will
want to type
cd ~/Desktop/
Of course, if you have another folder that begins with the letters De in the
same folder, you might need to type a few additional characters. This gives
the autocompletion feature more information to help it decide which char-
acters you want to type. In other words, if you don’t type enough charac-
ters, autocompletion ends up like a detective without enough clues to figure
things out.
Working with Files
If you’ve used a computer for any time at all, you’re no doubt familiar with
the idea of files. Even before the first floppy drive appeared in personal com-
puters, operating systems have stored data in files . . . they date back to the
days when a mainframe computer occupied an entire floor of an office build-
ing. Mac OS X is no exception, and it’s important to understand how Mac OS
X arranges them into folders and how you go about accessing them via the

tion for

command line. This section describes the basic file and folder information
that you need to know to tame the beast that is UNIX.
Paths
Before you dive into UNIX commands, you should first know a few facts . . .
nasty things, facts, but you can’t earn your pair of techno-wizard sus-
penders without ’em. For starters, as a Mac user, you might not be familiar
with how paths work in UNIX. A path is simply a textual representation of a
folder or file. The simplest path is your Home directory, which is denoted by
a tilde character (~). Any folder within the Home directory is represented by
the folder’s name preceded by a forward slash (/). For example, a document
entitled myDoc that resides in the current user’s Documents folder would
have a path like this:
~/Documents/myDoc
Similarly, a folder named myFolder that resides in the current user’s
Documents folder would have a path like this:
~/Documents/myFolder/
As you’ve probably surmised, a folder and a directory are two different
names for the same thing. Folder is the name with which most Mac users are
familiar, and directory is a term that UNIX power users prefer. I use the terms
interchangeably throughout the remainder of the chapter.
Because Mac OS X is a multi-user environment, you might sometimes want
to work with folder or files somewhere other than in your Home folder.
Starting from your Home folder, enter the following command:
cd ..
This will move you to the folder right above your Home folder, which hap-
pens to be the Users folder. Using another quick ls command will show you
all users who are permitted to use the machine, as shown in Figure 1-6. In
this figure, you can see the two users that are allowed to use this machine:
chambers and fuadramses. (By the way, Shared isn’t a user — it’s a folder
with privileges set so that any user can access its contents.)
Enter cd .. once again, and you find yourself at the root of your main hard
drive. The root directory is what you see in the Finder when you double-click
your hard drive icon on the desktop. A user’s Home directory is represented
by a tilde character (~), and the root of the hard drive is denoted by a for-
ward slash (/), as displayed by the prompt:
[WHITEDRAGON:/] chambers%

Here’s a faster way. Instead of moving through each successive folder until
you reach your intended destination, you can specify the path by using just
one cd command:
[WHITEDRAGON:/] chambers% cd /Users/chambers
[WHITEDRAGON:~] chambers%
Of course, the Home directory is a special folder in that you can also navi-
gate there by simply entering cd ~, but the main point here is that you can
navigate directly to specific folders by using that folder’s path in conjunc-
tion with the cd command.
Furthermore, when you navigate your hard drive by using paths, you can
jump directly to your desired destination from any place. When you enter 
cd .., it is in relation to your current position, whereas entering
cd /Users/chambers 
will always take you to the same directory, regardless of your starting point.
Copying, moving, renaming, and deleting files
After you’re comfortable with moving around the hierarchy of your hard
drive, it’s a cinch to copy, move, and rename files and folders.
Figure 1-6:

Working with Files
628
To copy files from the command line, use the cp command. Because using
the cp command will copy a file from one place to another, it requires two
operands: first the source, and then the destination. For instance, to copy a
file from your Home folder to your Documents folder, use the cp command
like this:
cp ~/MyDocument ~/Desktop/MyDocument
Keep in mind that when you copy files, you must have proper permissions
to do so. Here’s what happens when I try to copy a file from my Desktop to
another user’s Desktop:
[WHITEDRAGON:~] chambers% cp ~/Desktop/MyDocument
/Users/fuadramses/Desktop/MyDocument 
cp: /Users/fuadramses/Desktop/MyDocument: Permission denied
If you can’t copy to the destination that you desire, you will need to precede
the cp command with sudo. Using the sudo command allows you to perform
functions as another user. The idea here is that the other user whom you’re
“emulating” has the necessary privileges to execute the desired copy opera-
tion. When you execute the command, the command line will ask you for a
password. If you don’t know what the password is, you probably shouldn’t
be using sudo. Your computer’s administrator should have given you an
appropriate password to use. After you enter the correct password, the
command executes as desired.
In case you’re curious, sudo stands for set user and do. It sets the user to the
one that you specify and performs the command that follows the username.
sudo cp ~/Desktop/MyDocument /Users/fuadramses/Desktop/MyDocument
Password:
A close cousin to the cp (copy) command is the mv (move) command. As
you can probably guess, the mv command moves a folder or file from one
location to another. (I told you that all this character-based stuff would start
to make sense, didn’t I?) To demonstrate, this command moves MyDocument
from the Desktop folder to the current user’s Home folder:
mv ~/Desktop/MyDocument ~/MyDocument
Ah, but here’s the hidden surprise: The mv command also functions as a
rename command. For instance, to rename a file MyDocument on the
Desktop to MyNewDocument, do this:
mv ~/Desktop/MyDocument ~/Desktop/MyNewDocument

Book VII
Chapter 1
. . . And UNIX
Lurks Beneath
Working with Files
629
In this case, you can see that the mv command is really copying the original
file to the destination and then deleting the original. Because both folders in
this example reside in the same folder (~/Desktop/), it appears as though
the mv command has renamed the file.
Again, like the cp command, the mv command requires that you have proper
permissions for the action that you wish to perform. Use the sudo command
to perform any commands that your current user (as displayed in the
prompt) is not allowed to execute. On UNIX systems, not all users are neces-
sarily equal. Some users can perform functions that others can’t. This is
handy for keeping your child’s mitts out of important files on your com-
puter. It also creates a hurdle should you choose to work on files while using
your child’s restricted user account. The sudo command lets you temporar-
ily become another user — presumably one that has permission to perform
some function that the current user can’t.
What would file manipulation be without the ability to delete files? Never
fear; UNIX can delete anything that you throw at it. Use the rm (short for
remove) or rmdir (short for remove directory) command to delete a folder
or file. For example, to delete MyDocument from the Desktop folder, execute
the rm command like this:
rm ~/Desktop/MyDocument
Once again, deleting files and folders requires that you have permission to
do so. In other words, any time that you manipulate files with the command
line, you are required to have the proper permission. If your current user
lacks these permissions, using sudo will help.
Opening documents and launching applications
Launching applications and opening documents is child’s play for a UNIX
pro like you. The open command does it all. For example, to bring the Finder
to the foreground without touching the mouse, use
open /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app
To open a document from the command line, follow a similar scheme.
For example, to view an image named myImage.tif that’s stored in your
Documents folder, use
% open ~/Documents/myImage.tif

Useful Commands
Manipulating files and viewing folder content is fun, but the command line is
capable of so much more! Now I focus our attention on some of the other
useful tasks that you can perform with the command line.
Mac OS X comes stocked with a full set of useful commands. You can dis-
cover what commands are installed by viewing the files in /usr/bin. Type
cd /usr/bin to navigate there.
Calendar
One of my favorite command line functions is the cal command, which dis-
plays a calendar in text form. Simply entering cal at the prompt displays a
calendar for the current month, as shown in Figure 1-7.
Append a number to the cal command to display a 12-month calendar for
that year. The number that follows the cal command is the year for which
you’d like to see a calendar. For example, to view a calendar for 1970, type
cal 1970. The result appears in Figure 1-8.
Append a month number and a year number to display the calendar for that
month. For example, to view a calendar for November 1997, type cal 11
1997. The result appears in Figure 1-9.
Another useful command that is related to the cal command is date. Type
date at the command line to display the day, date, time, and year based on
your computer’s settings.

Processes
Have you ever been curious as to why your hard drive seems to spin and
grind on occasion while your system is seemingly inactive? Mac OS X some-
times has a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes. To discover just what
your computer is busy doing at any time, use the top command to display
all the actions that your computer is currently performing, as shown in
Figure 1-10. These activities are called processes; some are created when you
launch applications, and others are simply tasks that Mac OS X has to take
care of to keep things running smoothly.
Besides listing the names of the various processes currently in use, top also
tells you how much of your CPU is being devoted to each process. This lets
you know what process is currently hogging all your computing power.

Useful Commands
632
Sometimes a process stalls, effectively freezing that action. By using the top
command to find the Process ID (PID) of the offending process, you can halt
the process. Simply use the kill command followed by the PID of the
process that you want to stop, as shown in Figure 1-11.
Do not go killing processes willy-nilly! Although Mac OS X is extremely
stable, removing the wrong process — such as init or mach_init — is
rather like removing a leg from one of those deep-sea drilling platforms: Not
good. You could lock up your system and lose whatever you’re doing in
other applications. If you simply want to shut down a misbehaving program,
go graphical again (at least for a moment) and use the Force Quit menu com-
mand from the Finder menu.

UNIX Cadillac Commands
633
Like top, another handy command for examining process info is ps (short
for process). Most often, you will want to append a few flags to the ps com-
mand to get the information that you desire. For example, try the following
command:
ps –aux
The man page for ps explains what each flag means. Read more about using
the man command in the earlier section, “Help is on the way!”
UNIX Cadillac Commands
Besides working with files and processes, the command line has all kinds of
sophisticated commands. For example, with the command line, you have
instant access to a variety of tools for finding files or even stringing together
commands.
Finding files
The command line also gives you a number of ways to search for files on
your hard drive. The two most commonly used commands are find and
locate.
To use find, specify a starting point for the search followed by the name of
the file or folder that you wish to find. For example, to find the Fonts folder
that belongs to your user, enter the command like this:
% find ~/ -name “Fonts”
You should see at least one result of the find command.
/Users/chambers//Library/Fonts
One great feature of the find command is that you can look for a file or
folder in more than one location. Suppose you want to find a file named
MyDocument that you know resides either in your Documents folder or on
your Desktop. For this kind of search, use the find command like this:
% find ~/Documents ~/Desktop\ Folder -name “MyDocument”
In this example, you are telling the find command which folders it should
search when looking for the file named MyDocument.

UNIX Programs That Come in Handy
634
Besides find, another useful command for searching your hard drive is
locate. Using the locate command is many times faster than the find
command because it relies on a built-in database to do its search. Mac OS X
updates this database for you automatically. To find any folder with the
name Fonts by using the locate command, format your syntax like so:
%locate /Fonts
Using pipes
Nearly all UNIX commands can take on greater abilities by using a construct
called the pipe. A pipe (|) is represented by that funny little vertical line
that shows up when you press Shift+\. The pipe routes data from one com-
mand to another one that follows — for example, many UNIX commands
produce large amounts of information that can’t all fit on one page. (You
might have noticed this behavior when you used the locate command.)
Joining two commands or functions together with the pipe command is
piping. To tame the screens full of text, pipe the locate function to the less
command. The less command provides data one page at a time.
% locate /Fonts | less
When the results fill up one page, the data stops and waits for you to press
any key (except the Q key) to continue. When you reach the end of the
results, press Q to quit and return to a command-line prompt.
UNIX Programs That Come in Handy
As a Macintosh user, you might be surprised to know that many applica-
tions on your hard drive don’t reside in one of the typical Applications
folders of Mac OS X. These applications, in fact, don’t have any graphical
user interface like you’re accustomed to. They’re only accessible from the
command line. The remainder of this chapter will cover some of these
applications.
Text editors
UNIX has many text-editing applications for use at the command line. Some
of the more popular ones include pico, vi, and emacs. Each of these text
editors has its pros and cons — and thanks to the thorough folks at Apple,
because all three are included with Panther! For my examples here, how-
ever, I use pico because it’s simple to use and sufficient for our needs.

Book VII
Chapter 1
. . . And UNIX

UNIX Programs That Come in Handy
635
Creating a new document
To create a text file by using pico, simply type pico at the command line.
The result should look like Figure 1-12.
This is the rough and tumble world of UNIX, which preceded the Macintosh
by many years. Perhaps this will also help you to appreciate why the
Macintosh was so revolutionary when it was introduced. (You can just hear
the designers crowing, “We’ll call this a menu! Yeah, that’s the ticket!” The
only graphics that you’d see on your monitor were the newspaper cartoons
that you stuck to the bottom.)
At the bottom of the screen is a menu of common commands. Above the
menu is a large empty space where you can enter text, much like the word
processors that you already know and love. (For those of us that remember
the halcyon character-based days of DOS, think older versions of Word and
WordPerfect . . . or, if you’re a real computing dinosaur like I am, consider
the original WordStar.) Type some text in that area. Anything will do . . . a
letter to a friend, a grocery list, or your school homework.
When you’re finished entering your desired text, save the document with
the WriteOut command in the pico menu. Directly next to each command
in the pico menu is a keyboard sequence used to perform that command.
(Refer to the bottom of Figure 1-12.) The ^ character is shorthand for the
Control key on your keyboard. Thus, to save a file, press Control+O. This
flies in the face of standard Mac keyboard conventions, where the letter O is
traditionally used to mean Open.
Figure 1-12:
The pico
program is a
full-featured
text editor
built into the

line.

UNIX Programs That Come in Handy
636
After pressing the Control+O sequence, pico prompts you for a filename
(see Figure 1-13). Like most UNIX files, you’re permitted to enter a simple
filename here or a full path to a file. For this example, save the file to your
Documents folder, naming it MyPicoDocument.
After you’ve completed and saved the document, pressing Control+X will
transport you away from Planet Pico and back to the command line.
Customizing the prompt
In the previous example, I demonstrate how to launch pico, create a new
document, and save it to your Documents folder. For this example, you will
again launch pico, but this time the document will be very different. The
document won’t just hold some plain old letter to your mother. Rather, stick
with me to create a file to control some settings of the Terminal.
To get started, navigate to your Home directory.
cd ~
Then use the ls command to list the items in that directory. This time, how-
ever, add an -a flag. This will cause the listing to display all invisible (or
hidden) files. As I mention both in this chapter and earlier in the book, Mac
OS X tries to make things safe for average users by hiding files that you
don’t normally need (like files in the System folder). But now you’re a UNIX
guru, so you aren’t just an average user anymore! In particular, you are look-
ing for a hidden file named .tcshrc. The .tcshrc file stores settings for the
tcsh shell that you use in the Terminal. By altering its contents, you can
Figure 1-13:
After you

document,

prompts
you for a

Book VII
Chapter 1
. . . And UNIX

UNIX Programs That Come in Handy
637
adjust settings for your shell sessions each time that you use the Terminal
application.
All invisible files in UNIX begin with a period.
ls –a
If you do find a .tcshrc file, open it with pico by entering the following:
pico .tcshrc
If you don’t find a file named .tcshrc, simply launch pico. (Later, when
you’re finished creating the .tcshrc file, you can save it as .tcshrc.) The
default prompt already displays some useful information, but you can take
that one step further. To the new or existing .tcshrc text file, add the fol-
lowing line:
set prompt = “Command  %h %”
This syntax creates a command counter that keeps track of how many com-
mands you’ve executed. When you’re finished, press Control+O and save
the file as I describe earlier; make sure that it’s named .tcshrc and that
it’s located in your Home directory. To see your handiwork, open a new
Terminal session window by pressing Ô+N. If everything went off without a
hitch, you should now see something like Figure 1-14 — a prompt that dis-
plays the number of commands that you’ve executed.
Enter a command, like ls, to view the contents of your Home directory.
When you do, the next prompt automatically increases the command
counter for you!
So, what’s actually happening here and why all the % characters? A % charac-
ter, in UNIX lingo, is an escape character. It denotes a sequence that has spe-
cial meaning to the Terminal. Table 1-1 shows some other common escape
sequences for sprucing up your command line prompt.

In the previous example, I added the text Command to the prompt followed
by %h, which represents the current command count. Last, I finish off the
prompt with a % character. Recall that a % character is customary at the
prompt to show you where to enter a command. In this case, the % has no
special meaning; it’s simply meant to display the % character.
With a little experimentation, you can create some really cool (not to men-
tion useful) prompts. For example, you can add the date (as shown in
Figure 1-15) or command count.
Of course, you aren’t limited to geeky UNIX-style prompts. Be as creative as
you want. It’s your computer, after all! Figure 1-16 is an example of a fun
prompt.

Networking with the Terminal
Because UNIX isn’t a new phenomenon, it has many useful networking abili-
ties built into it. In fact, UNIX was instrumental in creating much of what we
now take for granted: e-mail, the Internet, and the World Wide Web. Thus,
you will be happy to know that you can communicate over networks with the
Terminal in practically any manner that you can dream of . . . and then some!
WWW and FTP
If you’ve used the Internet for any time, you’re probably familiar with the
various means to transport data over a network. From FTP (short for File
Transfer Protocol) and Telnet to e-mail and the Web, UNIX can handle it all. In
fact, UNIX has a command for each of these functions (and many more that
have passed into historical obscurity). Rather than use each individual com-
mand to send and retrieve data with the Terminal, Apple has conveniently
provided a command that can handle them all: curl. The curl command is
competent at all the standard network protocols. To see it in action, pass a
Web address (or URL, to The Enlightened) to the curl command:
curl http://www.mlcbooks.com
The result is that you will see the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) page
that’s located at www.mlcbooks.com. Because this isn’t particularly useful
for most people (it’s not very easy to read), you need to add the letter o as a
flag. This specifies where you would like to save this file upon download. To
save the HTML page to your Home directory, add the -o flag and a path to
the destination file.
Don’t forget to precede all flags with a hyphen. For this example, it would
be -o.
curl -o ~/mlcbooks.html http://www.mlcbooks.com
If you now perform an ls command, you will see that curl has, in fact,
downloaded the HTML found at www.mlcbooks.com and saved it to a file
named mlcbooks.html in your Home directory.
The beauty of curl is that it does much more than just retrieve Web pages:
It’s equally comfortable with FTP transfers. FTP is used to download (or
receive) files from a server as well as upload (or send) them. Like the previ-
ous HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) examples, you only have to pro-
vide an FTP address in Uniform Resource Locator (URL) format, and curl
will take care of the rest. Of course, most people want to save any files that
they download via FTP — not view them in the Terminal like I did the HTML
file. Therefore, like the previous example, you should add the -o flag and a

UNIX Programs That Come in Handy
640
path to the destination of your download. This time, I download a README
file about curl directly from the makers of curl.
curl
-o ~/Desktop/ README.curl ftp://ftp.sunet.se/pub/www/utilities/curl/README.curl
If you’re familiar with FTP, you might be wondering whether curl can
upload, too. Yes, indeed! Instead of using the -o flag, you will need to use
two flags: -T and -u. The -T flag denotes which file you wish to upload. The
-u flag denotes the username and password. Then, specify the FTP destina-
tion address of where you want to upload it. Because this example deals
with an upload, the remainder of this example is for an imaginary FTP
server. In real life, you’d use the appropriate FTP address, username, and
password for an FTP server where you are allowed to upload.
curl -T /Desktop/README.curl -u username:passwd ftp://ftp.yoursitehere.com
/myfiles/README.curl
This example uploads the README.curl file from the Desktop folder that I
downloaded earlier to an imaginary FTP server.
How do you spell success? C-u-r-l!
Sure, HTTP and FTP are handy, but did you know that there are many other
protocols for network communications? One of the niftier ones is the
Dictionary protocol. With it, you can look up words from any server that
understands the protocol. Suppose, for example, that you would like to know
the meaning of the term CD-ROM. Enter the following command to find out:
% curl dict://dict.org/d:CD-ROM
The results are shown in Figure 1-17. You might never use a real dictionary
again!

Taking a peek at Apple’s command-line jewels
Thus far in this chapter, I’ve used commands and programs that ship with
nearly every UNIX (and thus Mac OS X) distribution. The truth is that this is
only a small fraction of what is possible by using the command line. Now,
focus your attention on the UNIX programs that Apple provides for us Mac
users to beef up the command line. My hope is that these examples from
Apple will entice you to explore the many other commands and programs
that are available — usually for free.
Apple’s command-line tools are part of the Mac OS X Developer Tools Xcode
installation.
To see a list of the command-line tools that Apple installs with the
Developer Tools, enter this:
cd /Developer/Tools
ls
These tools are generally intended for developers, but a few gems in there
can help non-developers, too: in particular, the GetFileInfo and SetFile
commands. Because these commands are so handy and they’re not in the
standard command folder, the first step is to link them to /usr/bin.
Normally, command-line tools must reside in the /usr/bin directory for
them to be operational. If you would like to use a particular command that
does not reside in the proper directory, one solution is to link the command
to the appropriate folder. Then, when the system loads the usual commands
for you to use, it includes the commands that you have linked.
The sudo command requires an administrator password. For more on sudo,
read the earlier section, “Copying, moving, renaming, and deleting files.”
sudo ln -s /Developer/Tools/GetFileInfo /usr/bin/GetFileInfo
sudo ln -s /Developer/Tools/SetFile /usr/bin/SetFile
rehash
Now you can safely use these commands. These two commands simulate
the Get Info window that is part of the Finder. For example, to view a file’s
information, use the GetFileInfo command:
GetFileInfo ~/myDocument

UNIX Programs That Come in Handy
642
The result is a display like this:
% GetFileInfo ~/MyDocument
file: “/Users/chambers/MyDocument”
type: “TEXT”
creator: “R*ch”
attributes: avbstclInmed
created: 06/23/2002 22:25:04
modified: 06/23/2002 22:25:04
Conversely, SetFile sets one or more bits of the file’s information. For
example, to change the creator for this file, the -c flag is necessary.
SetFile -c “ttxt” ~/MyDocument
Although neither of these new commands have a man page, Apple does pro-
vide some documentation. Enter either command without any parameters
to view the documentation for that command.

sing a Macintosh is supposed to make your life easier — and in many
ways, it does. But there’s a limit to how much your Mac can do by
itself, right? After all, you still have to move the mouse, press keys on the
keyboard, and read information on the screen to get things done . . . or do
you? Why not let your computer do the dull chores — such as renaming a
thousand digital photographs from your family vacation and organizing
them into folders based on the subject of each photo — for you? Although
most people are familiar with controlling their Macs with the mouse and
keyboard, few realize that they can operate their machines without touching
a key, a mouse button, or even glancing at the screen.
What’s So Great about AppleScript?
If one word could describe what AppleScript is all about, it would be
automation. AppleScript is a technology for automating practically any action
that you perform with your Macintosh, including both common tasks in the
Finder and those that you perform in other applications.
Automate common tasks in the Finder
If you’ve ever found yourself repeating some task more than once, you’re
an ideal candidate for becoming an AppleScript techno-wizard. AppleScript
is particularly good at taking the boredom and tedium out of using your
Macintosh by performing all sorts of tasks automatically. To illustrate, con-
sider a few jobs that would take a fair amount of time to do by hand but are
a snap with AppleScript:

What’s So Great about AppleScript?
644
✦While writing your next best-selling Great American Novel — or
For Dummies book on Mac OS X — you make a mistake and misnumber
the chapters. All the chapters have a filename bearing the chapter
number, but they’re all off by one. Sure, you could rename each file by
hand, but your book is a large tome and renumbering forty-two chapters
manually doesn’t sound like much fun. (Take my word for it. Please.) It’ll
require several minutes and lots of tedious attention on your part, not
to mention introduce the likelihood of human error. But wait, there’s
another way! When using a simple AppleScript of only a few lines of code,
you can rename the chapters in seconds, whilst you go grab another
Diet Coke.
✦You’re a neat individual and think that your Mac should reflect your
penchant for order — in fact, you like your Desktop icons to be placed
just so. Being left-handed, you prefer the icons over on the left side of
the Desktop, like some of those inferior operating systems. In this situa-
tion, an AppleScript can help you do things that aren’t humanly possi-
ble; not only can you rapidly rearrange the icons on your Desktop, but
you can do so with pixel-point accuracy. Without AppleScript, it would
be nearly impossible to precisely align dozens of icons. And if you
could, it would take a long time and probably cause you to go blind.
✦After a font-download binge, you find yourself with hundreds of fonts.
You really want to organize them into separate folders based on the
date that you downloaded them. AppleScript comes to the rescue again!
With a brief script, you could knock out this challenge without ever
looking at a single date. Add a couple more lines of code to the script
and AppleScript will take care of creating the folders too. Right, you
know the word: sassy.
Automate tasks in other applications
By using AppleScript, you can also often automate your work from begin-
ning to end, despite the fact that you need multiple applications to do so.
Look at a few scenarios, and you’ll begin to appreciate why AppleScript is
such a powerful technology:
✦You’ve just completed creating the ultimate library of bagpipe songs in
iTunes — no, really! — and you want to share the list with your friends
at the next Bagpipers Anonymous meeting. You could easily send every-
one in the group an iTunes Playlist, but not everyone in the club has a
Macintosh, let alone a computer. This is going to require creating a hard
copy for those members without a computer. Because your bagpipe
song list contains thousands of songs, you don’t want to retype the name
of each song. AppleScript can save the day by extracting the song titles
for you and compiling them into a list just in time for your meeting.

✦AppleScript can take care of your computer-owning bagpipe friends,
too. With a few extra steps, you can e-mail all of them the list as well.
✦Being so doggone fond of bagpipes, you want to send your bagpiping
friends a special note during the holidays. To help manage your holiday
greeting cards, you can create a record in FileMaker Pro or some other
database listing the name and address of each person who should
receive a card. If you’ve entered their street addresses in the Contacts
section of your e-mail application, AppleScript can aid in transferring
the addresses from your e-mail application to the database. Never again
will your bagpiping friends miss a holiday greeting . . . and the world is a
much better place.
As you can imagine, there are literally thousands of ways that you can use
AppleScript to automate your workflow.
Running a Script
The easiest way to get started with AppleScript is to use some scripts that
others have already written. Scripts are small files that contain a list of com-
mands; this list of commands tells your Mac what function to perform and
when to perform it. Fortunately, Apple is kind enough to provide you with
several completed scripts with your installation of Mac OS X. You can find a
large cache of scripts in the scripts folder, found in the Library folder, under
Scripts.
Many scripts (but not all) end with the extension .scpt. Before you get
started running scripts, however, you should know a few things first.
Identifying scripts in the field
Each script that you encounter will be in one of these three formats:
✦Script application: Some AppleScripts act much like an application. To
use one, simply double-click it in the Finder, and off it goes to perform
whatever tasks it was meant to do. Depending on an internal setting of
the script, it might quit when it’s finished doing its thing. Most often, the
script completes its mission and quits. Scripts are typically identified by
the icon that you see in Figure 2-1.
✦Compiled script: You might also encounter AppleScripts that won’t run
without the aid of another application. Apple calls these compiled
scripts. Although they’re not able to execute on their own, they do have
the abilities of a script built in. They just require a host application to
use them.

✦Text file: In addition to compiled scripts and those that act like applica-
tions, a third category of AppleScript that you might encounter is a
script stored in a text file. Scripts that are stored in a text file also need
a host application before they’ll do anything. The main difference
between a text file script and a compiled script is that you can read a
text file script with any application that can open a text file.
The Script Editor application
Two of the three possible script types (compiled scripts and text files) require
some sort of host application before they’ll perform any action. Luckily,
Mac OS X provides you with just such a host: the AppleScript Script Editor
application, which comes with Mac OS X and can execute any AppleScript
with ease. With the Script Editor, you can also do much more, including
✦View or modify an AppleScript
✦Create a new AppleScript
✦Check an AppleScript for errors
✦Save scripts in one of the three possible formats
To launch the Script Editor application, navigate to the AppleScript folder
(choose Applications➪AppleScript➪Script Editor) and double-click the
Script Editor icon. The Script Editor application displays an empty, script-
editing window, as shown in Figure 2-2.

Executing a script
After you have the Script Editor application running, you can run any
AppleScript that can you find. To get you started, Apple has conveniently
provided a handful of useful scripts. Navigate to the Scripts folder, which is
located in the Library folder.
The scripts are divided into folders based on functionality, such as fonts,
mail, color, and navigation. Figure 2-3 shows the script categories that Apple
provides with Mac OS X.
For example, open the Internet Services folder, where you’ll find a script
named Current Temperature by Zipcode.scpt.
You need an active Internet connection to test this script.
Double-click the script to open it. Because it’s a compiled script and not an
application script, the Script Editor automatically loads the script and
comes to the foreground. This particular script prompts users for their ZIP
code and then displays the current temperature, which it retrieves from a
Web site. To see the script in action, click the Run button (see Figure 2-4) or
press Ô+R.

Writing Your Own Simple Scripts
Using someone else’s scripts is fun and all, but the real joy of AppleScript
comes when you create your own. Not only can you customize a script to
your own needs and desires, but saving all those keystrokes can really pro-
duce a feeling of euphoria. (Okay, perhaps just Panther power users will
actually experience a heightened sense of existence . . . you’ll be there soon.)
Create a script without touching a key
You needn’t wear a pocket protector or tape the bridge of your glasses to
become proficient with AppleScript — in fact, the Script Editor can get you
up and running with AppleScript in no time at all. The secret weapon of the
AppleScript author is the Record function of the Script Editor. You click the
Record button, perform one or more actions in a recordable application,
and then return to the Script Editor where you click the Stop button. The
Script Editor stores each of your actions and compiles the whole list into an
AppleScript.
In theory, this is how it should all work, but in reality, finding recordable
Macintosh applications is not always so easy. The Finder is, perhaps, the
most recordable application on the Mac. Although some other applications
support recording, so few do that the Finder could be the only recordable
application most Mac users ever see.
To try it yourself, do the following steps to automate actions in the Finder:
1. Bring Script Editor to the foreground.
If Script Editor isn’t currently running, double-click its icon in the Finder.
If it is running, click its icon in the Dock.
2. Create a new script by pressing Ô+N.
3. Click the Record button.
The Record button is one of four buttons positioned near the top left of
a new script window.
4. Switch to the Finder and perform the actions that you want to
automate.
When the Finder is active, you can select some icons on the Desktop
and move them around, resize any open Finder windows, or navigate to
your home directory. Any action that you perform in the Finder should
be acceptable fodder for the Script Editor. As you perform tasks in the
Finder, the Script Editor automatically generates a script that replicates
your actions.

Writing Your Own Simple Scripts
650
5. Return to the Script Editor and click the Stop button.
To reactivate the Script Editor, click its icon in the Dock. Click the Stop
button to cease the recording of your script.
When you’re finished, you should be looking at a complete AppleScript. To
test your work, return to the Finder and revert any icons or windows that
you might have moved or repositioned. (You don’t want to run a script that
doesn’t appear to have any effect.) Then return to the Script Editor and click
the Run button to watch your automated Finder tasks being performed.
Building your own scripts
An AppleScript novice can perform all kinds of amazing feats with the
recording features of the Script Editor. Because AppleScript uses a kind of
pseudo-English language, it’s usually pretty easy to figure out what’s going
on behind the scenes. Consider the following script for an example:
tell app “Finder”
activate
set windowList to every window --save list of open windows
repeat with theWindow in windowList
tell theWindow
if collapsed is true then
--do nothing, because the window is collapsed   
else
set collapsed to true
end if
end tell
end repeat
end tell
(By the way, in the preceding code, I bolded the commands we’ll be working
with, but they don’t have to be bolded for the script to work.) Anyway, the
first thing that you might notice about this script is the first line: the tell
command, which indicates that this script relates to the Finder. This script
activates the Finder, creates a list of open windows, and then examines the
state of each window: Is it collapsed or not collapsed? (In Mac OS X, a col-
lapsed, or minimized, window appears in the Dock.) If the window is already
minimized and in the Dock, nothing happens, and the script continues
through the list of windows. If the window isn’t minimized, the script col-
lapses it. This continues until the script has examined all open windows.
The end result? All open windows end up minimized in the Dock.
Another thing to note about this script is that it has two comments in it
(save list and do nothing). Comments can help you remember what
you were thinking months later when you open the script again. Although

Book VII

651
comments help us humans know what’s happening, they don’t really have
any other function. An AppleScript comment begins with two dashes (--).
Here’s a big-time Mark’s Maxim that every script author should remember:
Comments are your friend!
One Step Beyond: AppleScript Programming
Creating AppleScripts can soon become very involved, bordering on pro-
gramming. Don’t let that term programming scare you away, though. You
needn’t be a software developer to take advantage of AppleScripts. Apple
provides a lot of help to get you started along the AppleScript trail.
Grab the Dictionary
Perhaps the greatest resource for AppleScript novices and experts alike is
the AppleScript Dictionary. Although many applications are scriptable, not
all are. To be scriptable, an application must contain an AppleScript
Dictionary. An AppleScript Dictionary details the various commands and
objects of an application that you can access via AppleScript.
The Script Editor application allows you to peer inside an application and
view its AppleScript dictionary. To open an application’s Dictionary, choose
File➪Open Dictionary. Mac OS X searches through your installed applica-
tions and presents you with the Open Dictionary dialog, as shown in
Figure 2-5, which lists all applications that have a dictionary and are there-
fore scriptable.
If you don’t see your favorite application in the list, alas, it’s probably not
scriptable. To make certain, click the Browse button and select the applica-
tion in question.
After you select an application, the Script Editor displays that application’s
AppleScript Dictionary. An application’s dictionary lists all the features of
that application that are scriptable.
Scriptable features are divided into categories, called Suites, which you can
see on the left side of the AppleScript Dictionary. Every Mac application is
supposed to support the Standard Suite, which lists common terms that
most applications should support.
Click an item in the Suite on the left side of the Dictionary to view detailed
information about its capabilities, as shown in Figure 2-6.

By surveying the various Suites of an application, you begin to see what
tasks you can automate. The Finder, with its huge AppleScript Dictionary,
is perhaps the most scriptable of all applications.
Anatomy of a simple script
Although a full discussion of AppleScript programming is beyond the scope
of this book — after all, we have other things to talk about, too — that
doesn’t mean that you can’t produce some quick and useful scripts. Most
AppleScripts begin with a command that addresses the application that you
want to automate. Enter this command into a new AppleScript document,
which you create by pressing Ô+N.
tell application “Finder”
This is like saying, “Hey, Finder, listen up! I’m going to send commands your
way!” The double quotes surround the application name that you’re
addressing in the command.
Similarly, after you finish instructing the Finder what tasks you want
performed, you must also tell it to stop listening. As such, typical scripts
end with
end tell
With the shell of a script in place, all you have to do is add commands in
between the tell and end tell commands of the script. If you want your
script to force an application to the foreground, an activate command is
usually the first line within the shell of your script.
tell app “Finder”
activate
end tell
Believe it or not, this is technically a complete and valid script! It doesn’t do
much, though, so add some more functionality to make it accomplish some-
thing worthwhile. For example, suppose that you would like to perform
some housekeeping chores each time that you log in to your Macintosh.
Some desirable tasks might include
✦Emptying the Trash
✦Cleaning up the Desktop icons
✦Having your Mac say “Hello!” to you

One Step Beyond: AppleScript Programming
654
(Okay, I’ll grant that hearing your Mac say “Hello!” isn’t a housekeeping chore,
but it makes the whole script that much more fun — and really impresses
your visitors, too. No one ever said programming had to be boring!)
To add these functions, you can do so by using a language you already
know: English. As I mention earlier, Apple tries (and sometimes succeeds)
to make AppleScript as English-like as possible. That way, you don’t have to
learn some silly computer language; just use your native tongue. For exam-
ple, to empty the Trash, tell the Finder to do so.
empty trash
Similarly, cleaning up the Desktop is a no-brainer.
clean up desktop
The trickiest line of code might be the speech, and that’s only because you
need to remember to add quotes. AppleScript thinks that anything without
quotes is an AppleScript command.
say “Hello!”
The result is a super-simple script that anyone can read but that performs
several powerful functions. The completed script looks like this:
tell app “Finder”
activate
empty trash
clean up desktop
say “Hello!”
end tell
When you’ve completed the script, choose File➪Save to save your script.
The Save dialog appears, which is shown in Figure 2-7. Because you want
the script to execute and then quit, use the Form field to save it as an appli-
cation. Also, make sure that the Stay Open check box is disabled and that
the Startup Screen check box is disabled. And don’t forget to name your
script in the Save As text field.
To have the script automatically run each time you log in to your Mac, save
the script anywhere that you wish. (Assign its home folder in the Where
field of the Save window.) Open System Preferences by clicking its icon
in the Dock, click the Accounts icon, and then click Startup Items. Click the
Add button (which proudly bears a plus sign) and navigate to your script
in the Open dialog that appears. After you click the Add button of the
Open dialog, you’ll see the script in the Startup Items window. Figure 2-8
illustrates the Startup Items list after a new script called My Housecleaning
Script has been vigorously added.

If you would like to explore AppleScript further, you have many resources
on hand. Sometimes the easiest way to use AppleScript is to copy existing
scripts and modify them as necessary; other times, it’s a good idea to read
the documentation included in Apple’s Help system. Whichever approach
you use, with a little practice and guidance, you’ll soon be doing stupen-
dous tasks with your Mac.
Built-in AppleScript Help
The most readily available AppleScript reference is built into Mac OS X.
Choose Help➪Mac Help to launch the Mac OS Help Guides from the Finder
or choose Help➪Script Editor Help from the Script Editor. This is a great
place to begin your AppleScript exploration. It includes detailed documenta-
tion about the AppleScript language and loads of demonstration scripts for
you to try (or alter) yourself.
AppleScript on the Web
In addition to the built-in AppleScript help in the Finder, the Internet has
much to offer in the way of AppleScript training and examples. Like so many
other excellent Web resources, AppleScripts are free!
Apple Computer
The first place on the Web that you should visit for AppleScript help is the
Source of All That Is Good, also called the Mother Ship: Apple Computer.
Although the built-in OS X help offers a lot, the Apple Web site offers even
more scripts, tutorials, and general AppleScript goodness. You can even find
a list of all known scriptable applications, which can save you from search-
ing for them with Script Editor. Furthermore, the site maintains an extensive
list of links to other useful AppleScript sites.
www.apple.com/applescript/
ResExcellence
For the hacker in all of us, ResExcellence sports many unique system
tweaks, modifications, and outright hacks. Among the ResExcellence bag
of tricks is an extensive list of AppleScripts for you to download. Although
not geared strictly towards AppleScript, ResExcellence offers many excel-
lent scripts for customizing your Desktop, doing things you didn’t think
possible, and generally making your Macintosh experience more fulfilling.

MacScripter.net
MacScripter.net devotes its site to all Macintosh scripting. Because
AppleScript is such a huge part of scripting the Mac OS, you can be certain
that there’s something here for you. Besides offering up-to-date news on
scripting for the Mac OS, MacScripter.net also gives you access to many
scripts, information about scripting books, as well as details on Apple’s new
AppleScript Studio software, which lets you create AppleScripts with inter-
faces. The sheer volume of information at this site makes it one you
shouldn’t skip.
www.macscripter.net/
Not all AppleScripts are created equal! When downloading scripts from the
Internet, make sure that they are compatible with Mac OS X 10.3. Although
the majority of scripts made for Mac OS 9 will also work with Mac OS X,
some simply won’t. The converse is also true. Sometimes a script is meant
solely for use with Mac OS X.

f you’re a hunt-and-peck typist — leaving you certain that there must
be some better way to get information into your computer — you’ll be
happy to know that Apple has you in mind. Since the very first Mac rolled
off the assembly line, Apple has had a keen interest in alternative modes
of interaction between human and machine. Mac OS X continues in this tra-
dition of alternative computer controls, offering two options for controlling
Mac OS X without the keyboard: handwriting and speech.
✦Handwriting: By using a pen and computer tablet, you can enter text
into your Mac by simply writing as you would on a sheet of paper.
✦Speech: Talk to your Mac to make it listen and obey your commands.
It even talks back!
This chapter guides you through the various options that you have for
controlling your Macintosh without using the keyboard. First, I cover the
Mac OS X Inkwell feature, which you use to write on a tablet to enter data
into your computer. (Although it sounds a bit ironic, think of Inkwell as
your “digital paper” for the new millennium.) Whatever you write on the
tablet appears on the screen as text.
I also take a look at the more space-age speech capabilities available to you
in Mac OS X — by using your voice, you can command a Macintosh to per-
form all sorts of interesting feats. And just so you don’t get lonely, the Mac
will even talk back to you. (Now you can control your computer just like
Spock from Star Trek! )
So, scoot away from your computer, lean that chair back, and let your Mac
take care of the rest.

Using Ink with a Tablet
660
Using Ink with a Tablet
Typing on a keyboard can be a tedious and error-prone experience for even
the best typists. To help out, Apple added some useful handwriting features
to Mac OS X. Based in part on some of Apple’s handheld software for the
Newton (one of the first personal digital assistants [PDAs], and a product
released before its time), the handwriting recognition in Mac OS X gives
you the ability to write text on a compatible tablet for use in your favorite
applications.
The basic process of working with handwriting on Mac OS X goes like this:
1. Attach a tablet to your Mac.
Most tablets use a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection, so connecting
one to your computer is as simple as plugging in the cable from your
tablet to the USB port on your Mac.
2. Write on the tablet with the stylus that accompanies it.
A stylus is the name given the fake “pen” that accompanies most
tablets. A stylus doesn’t have any ink in it: It’s just a pen-shaped tool
with a plastic tip meant for writing on a tablet.
3. Your Mac interprets your handwriting.
After your Mac recognizes the handwriting, it sends that text to the fore-
most application at the cursor location where you would normally type
with the keyboard. You’re spared the whole training bit, too.
You aren’t restricted to writing just text on the tablet, naturally. You can use
it to control the interface of your Mac as you would a mouse. A tablet also
works great for graphics applications like Procreate Painter and Adobe
Photoshop. Many artists are frustrated when drawing with a mouse; but
when you use a tablet, you can feel right at home with the natural pen or
brush movements that you’ve always used.
Although Inkwell pretty much takes care of preparing your Mac for hand-
writing recognition, it does offer you a few settings in the Inkwell panel
within System Preferences. To view the System Preferences, click the System
Preferences icon in the Dock. From there, click the Inkwell icon to adjust
settings for your tablet.
If you don’t have a tablet connected to your Macintosh, you won’t be able to
view the System Preferences pane for Inkwell. Mac OS X is smart enough to
only show you the settings for your current hardware setup.

Computer, Can You Hear Me?
661
Computer, Can You Hear Me?
Remember that classic scene from the movie Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home
where Scotty picks up the mouse on a Macintosh and tries to talk directly to
the computer? Since the very early days of the Mac OS, Apple has included
some form of speech recognition in their computers. Mac OS X continues to
improve on speech recognition by offering a host of tools that let you get
more work done in a shorter amount of time. (We’re not to that point yet,
Scotty, but we’re working on it.)
The Speech Recognition features of Mac OS X let you speak a word, phrase,
or sentence. After you’ve spoken, your Mac goes to work translating what
you said — and if it understands the phrase, it then performs an action asso-
ciated with that phrase. The great part about this system is that you can say
any phrase in continuous speech and have your Mac perform any sort of
action that you can imagine. In fact, you aren’t limited to just one action:
You could perform dozens of actions upon speaking a particular phrase.
Before you get started using Speech Recognition, you need a microphone to
get sound into your Mac. Many current desktop Macintosh models (and all
portable models) have a built-in microphone — for example, if you use one
of the flat-screen iMacs, your microphone is built into the monitor. (Look for
a little hole at the bottom-left corner of your monitor.) PowerBooks and
iBooks have a similar microphone built into the screen. On the other hand,
if you use a desktop machine, you need to purchase a microphone and con-
nect it to the rear of your Macintosh by plugging it into the microphone jack.
If you’re looking for the best quality audio input from your microphone for
use with iChat AV, check out a microphone with a USB connection — you’ll
get far better sound quality than a microphone that connects to your
analog jack.
The Speech Recognition tab
To get started with Speech Recognition in Mac OS X, open the System
Preferences window by clicking its icon in the Dock and then clicking the
Speech icon. This brings up the Speech panel, as shown in Figure 3-1.
You’ll find that three tabs comprise the speech settings of Mac OS X:
✦Speech Recognition
✦Default Voice
✦Spoken User Interface

Computer, Can You Hear Me?
662
In this section, I’m only concerned with the Speech Recognition tab. Later,
in the section “Your Mac Talks Back!,” I explore the other two tabs.
The Speech Recognition tab consists of three sub-tabs:
✦On/Off: No great mental leap on this one. From this tab, you can switch
Speech Recognition features on and off. It lets you adjust some of the
Speech Recognition settings as well.
✦Listening: The Listening tab provides a number of settings that control
how your Mac listens to Its Master’s Voice. (Meaning you, dear reader.)
From here, you can set the sound input, adjust the key on the keyboard
that toggles speech recognition on and off, change microphone and
volume settings, and name your computer. (You do want to call your
computer by name like any techno-wizard, don’t you?)
✦Commands: When Speech Recognition is active, your Mac can under-
stand any number of commands. In the Commands tab, you tell the Mac
what type of command it should expect you to give. You can also spec-
ify whether you will be giving the commands word-for-word or whether
your Mac should be prepared to interpret paraphrasing.
Are you wondering about the Recognition System drop-down list box?
Don’t fret: At the time of this writing, the only available system was Apple
Speakable Items.

The On/Off tab
The On/Off tab, as shown in Figure 3-2, allows you to start and stop Speech
Recognition in Mac OS X.
When you mark the On radio button, the Speech Recognition Feedback
window appears on your screen, floating above all other windows. Learn
this face well because the Feedback window (as shown in Figure 3-3) is your
friend and partner — if you use Speech Recognition often, it’ll become a
constant companion on your Desktop. (More on it in the next section.)
When Speech Recognition is active, your Mac listens for whatever phrases
appear in your Speakable Items folder (a directory on your hard drive that
holds a number of scripts). The On/Off tab allows you to view the contents
of this folder. When you speak a phrase that matches one of these filenames,
your Mac automatically executes that script. The script can perform any
number of actions, which is what makes Speech Recognition so powerful.
Apple includes a large number of scripts with Mac OS X, but you’re free to
create your own, too.
To view the contents of the Speakable Items folder, click the Open Speakable
Items Folder button. The Finder comes to the foreground and navigates to
the folder that holds the scripts. This is handy because each item in the
Speakable Items folder is speakable.
Figure 3-2:

664
To the left of the Open Speakable Items Folder button is another button:
Helpful Tips. Click it to get some pointers on how to get the best perform-
ance from your microphone.
At the bottom of the On/Off tab is the When a Command Is Recognized sec-
tion. When your Mac comprehends one of your stentorian commands, you
can set it to respond by playing a sound, speaking a confirmation, or both.
This is helpful when you’re not sure whether your Mac understands you.
One hundred percent recognition is not a reality on any computer at this
point, so sometimes it helps to have any feedback that you can get — other-
wise, you might feel silly shouting at your machine while it sits there doing
nothing. (Or perhaps not, if you’re into really cheap anger management.)
The Listening tab
The second section of the Speech Recognition panel is the Listening tab, as
shown in Figure 3-4. From this tab, you can control how you turn listening
on and off. You can choose between two styles of listening with the
Listening Method options:

✦Listen Only While Key Is Pressed: Speech Recognition only works
while the designated key is held down.
✦Key Toggles Listening On and Off: Press a key to turn listening on.
When you’re finished speaking, press the key again to cease listening.
To change what key must be toggled or held down, click the Change
Key button.
While your computer is listening for your spoken commands, you might
want to preface each command with a word. For example, instead of saying,
“Empty the Trash!,” you might prefer, “Computer, empty the Trash!” This
adds a little bit of personality to the interaction and also gives your com-
puter a slightly longer time to react to your command. (As a general rule,
the longer the spoken phrase, the more likely your Mac will understand it.)
Below the Listening Method section of the Listening tab resides the name by
which you’d like to address your computer. You can also choose to address
your computer by name all the time or only sometimes. These settings are
located in the Name Is pop-up menu.
Finally, you can select the microphone that you want to use from the bottom
of the Speech Recognition tab — a great feature if you have more than one
microphone connected to your Mac.
The Commands tab
The Speech Recognition features of Mac OS X are not restricted to items in
the Speakable Items folder. Any application that supports Speech Recognition
is also fair game for your verbal manipulation. To control commands within
other applications, use the Commands tab, as shown in Figure 3-5. Here you
can enable the following check boxes:
✦Address Book
✦Global Speakable Items
✦Application Specific Items
✦Application Switching
✦Front Window (requires that you activate assistive devices in the
Universal Access panel within System Preferences)
✦Menu Bar (requires that you activate assistive devices in the Universal
Access panel within System Preferences)
Mark any one of these options to allow your Mac to listen to those kinds of
commands.

Computer, Can You Hear Me?
666
The Feedback window
After you activate Speech Recognition, you’ll instantly see a Feedback
window. The Feedback window, as shown in Figure 3-6, is the small round
window that floats above all applications — you can click and drag the
edge of the window to position it anywhere on your Desktop.
The Feedback window includes controls and displays of its own:
✦Microphone Level Meter: The Feedback window displays indicators to
let you know how loud the input to your microphone is.
✦Visual Indicator: The Feedback window displays visual feedback to let
you know what mode it is in: idle, listening, or hearing a command.
Refer to Figure 3-3 to see an example of a Feedback window in listening
mode. (Note: When there are no arrows on either side of the micro-
phone, this indicates listening mode.) Figure 3-6, with its microphone
flanked by arrows, indicates that the computer is hearing a command
spoken. When Speech Recognition is idle, no arrows are present, and
the microphone is grayed out.

for the System or view the Speech Commands window. Just click the

The Speech Command window
Because Speech Recognition might be listening for different sets of com-
mands from the Finder or many other applications, Mac OS X provides you
with a single listing of all commands that you might speak at any given time:
the Speech Commands window. To open the Speech Commands window,
click the triangle at the bottom of the Feedback window and choose Open
Speech Commands Window from the menu that appears (see Figure 3-7).
The Speech Commands window is a simple one, but it serves an important
purpose: to let you know what commands Mac OS X understands. The
Speech Commands pane, as shown in Figure 3-8, organizes commands into
categories that match the settings in the Speech pane of the System
Preferences.
If you launch another application that supports Speech Recognition, Mac OS X
adds that application’s commands to the Speech Commands window. Speak
any of these commands to make your Mac execute that function. For example,
Mac OS X ships with speech commands for Address Book, such as “Mail To”
and “Video Chat With.”

Your Mac Talks Back!
Mac OS X is great at listening to your speech, but the fun doesn’t stop there . . .
your Mac can talk to you, too! By using one of the many available voices, you
can make your computer talk or even sing. (Not as well as Sinatra, but better
than Bob Dylan.) And although Speech Recognition lets you speak to your
Macintosh, text-to-speech (or TTS, as the engineers call it) gives your Mac the
ability to speak text. This is an especially useful feature because it lets you
listen to your e-mails, Web pages, or even your homework — sometimes the
eyes need a break. Text-to-speech gives you the opportunity to lean back in
your chair or even get up and walk around while still using your Macintosh.
Like Speech Recognition, you can adjust text-to-speech settings by using the
Speech pane of the System Preferences. The Speech pane has two tabs that
pertain to text-to-speech.
✦Default Voice: Lets you choose a voice for your Macintosh
✦Spoken User Interface: Permits you to automate some text-to-speech
functions in Mac OS X
The Default Voice tab
The text-to-speech engine that comes with Mac OS X has a collection of
many different voices from which to choose; some voices are male, some
are female, and some aren’t human at all. To select your Mac’s voice in
Mac OS X, follow these steps:

1. Open the System Preferences by clicking its icon in the Dock.
2. Click the Speech icon to display the Speech dialog, where you can
change a number of Speech settings.
3. Click the Default Voice tab, as shown in Figure 3-9, to reveal the
voices available to you.
On the left side of the Default Voice tab is the list of voices from which you
can choose. When you select a voice, it speaks a sentence as a demonstra-
tion of that voice. Above the Play button is a slider for adjusting the speed
of the speech. Move the slider to the right to increase the speed at which
your Mac speaks and to the left to slow it down.
Each voice has a set of characteristics associated with it. When you select
voices, their properties appear in the top right of the Default Voice tab.
✦Language: If you’re reading this book, you’ll probably see English here.
✦Gender: Male, Female, or Other (robots or other non-living entities).
✦Age: How old is this voice, anyhow?
✦Description: This is usually some cryptic title that is connected to the
history of speech on the Macintosh. You can usually ignore this field.
For what it’s worth, Bruce, Victoria, Kathy, and Ralph have some of the more
intelligible (human-sounding) voices of the bunch. (I’m a Bruce kinda guy
myself.)

The Spoken User Interface tab
After you select a voice, you have a variety of ways to make your Macintosh
speak to you. The first one that you should check out is on the Spoken User
Interface tab (see Figure 3-10) — here you can set your Mac to speak auto-
matically based on some simple rules.
The two sections on the Spoken User Interface tab are Talking Alerts and
Other Spoken Items.
Talking Alerts
Every Mac owner has run into an Alert dialog. (Alert dialogs are typically
accompanied by a select group of words — better left unspoken — from the
person behind the keyboard.) An Alert dialog usually displays some kind of
icon from the following list:
✦Stop sign: Indicates that something particularly important requires your
attention — usually an error or a dire warning.
✦Yield sign: Signals that you should cautiously proceed; not as severe as
the Stop sign, but important nonetheless.
✦Notification: Looks like the profile of a person speaking; displays an
informative message, but not a warning. You could use this feature, for
example, to have a calendar application alert you when you have a
meeting or a deadline.

Interface

Book VII
Chapter 3
Forget Hal! Talking
and Writing to Your
Macintosh
Your Mac Talks Back!
671
The Talking Alerts section of the Speech pane in the System Preferences
specifies what your Mac speaks whenever an Alert is showing. You can
choose to have your Mac speak a specific phrase or the contents of the
Alert dialog by selecting one of the check boxes at the top of the tab. In the
Talking Alerts Voice drop-down list box, you can select a voice that is spe-
cific to the Talking Alerts — it only applies to Talking Alerts. Use the Wait
Before Speaking slider to control the increment of time that Mac allows to
pass before it speaks. To hear what your Talking Alert settings will sound
like in use, click the Demonstrate Settings button.
If you click the Demonstrate Settings button and don’t hear anything right
away, remember that it won’t begin speaking until the time has elapsed that
you set with the Wait Before Speaking slider. To hear the Talking Alerts
speak as soon as you click the Demonstrate Settings button, move the slider
to 0 (zero).
Other Spoken Items
In addition to Talking Alerts, you can allow your Mac to speak when other
actions occur. The Other Spoken Items section of the Spoken User Interface
tab is where you make these settings. Your Mac can speak in the following
circumstances:
✦Announce when an application requires your attention: In case you
have your Dock hidden from view, it’s not always clear when an applica-
tion needs your attention. In these instances, Mac OS X will grab your
attention via speech.
✦Read the text that’s directly under your mouse: If you have trouble
reading the text in word processing documents or Web pages, your Mac
can read whatever text is below your mouse.
✦Read a selection of text when you press a particular key: If you have a
child who is learning to read, the Mac can help them by reading a selec-
tion of text. Kids can learn how to drag and select text often more
quickly than they can read that text.
Apple might be a big, serious, computer company — yeah, right — but it
isn’t without a humorous side! With Speech Recognition enabled, say the
phrase, “Tell me a joke.” Your Mac will reply with a random joke. Say it
again, and your Mac will tell you another joke. (Brace yourself, these jokes
were likely written by Windows users . . . they’re really, really bad.)

Speaking Your Own Phrases
672
Speaking Your Own Phrases
Because the speech engine is an integral part of Mac OS X, you can make
your Mac speak whatever text you tell it to by using applications, services,
and even AppleScript. This is useful for a variety of purposes: for example,
listening to your Address Book, hearing a Web page read to you, or even
getting your Mac to call you by your first name.
Speaking text through applications
One of the simplest ways to hear spoken text in Mac OS X is by using the
TextEdit application. TextEdit is a simple text processor that accompanies
every copy of Mac OS X. Besides its handy word processing features, TextEdit
can also speak text. This is good for reviewing a document after you’ve writ-
ten it by listening to it. To hear spoken text with TextEdit, follow these steps:
1. Launch TextEdit from the Applications folder.
To open the Applications folder, choose Go➪Applications from the
Finder. In the window that appears, double-click the TextEdit application.
This launches the TextEdit application and opens a new document.
2. Enter some text.
Either type some text on the keyboard or paste some into the document
from the Clipboard. Here’s a favorite example from this book’s technical
editor:
Billy Gates has lots of cash
Lots of cash
Lots of cash
Billy Gates has lots of cash
I’d like $10 please!
3. Choose Edit➪Speech➪Start Speaking.
Your Mac will begin speaking the text from the document. The speech
engine has some intelligence, so you can enter dollar amounts (such as
$25,423.12) or Roman numerals (such as Chapter XIV), and the speech
engine will read them back in plain English. The result of these two
strings would be “Twenty-five thousand, four-hundred twenty-three 
dollars, and twelve cents” and “chapter fourteen.”
4. Choose Edit➪Speech➪Stop Speaking.
You Mac will stop speaking. It will also stop speaking when it reaches
the end of the text.

Book VII
Chapter 3
Forget Hal! Talking
and Writing to Your
Macintosh
Speaking Your Own Phrases
673
Speaking text through services
Mac OS X introduced the new Services feature to Macintosh users, which
are like miniature applications that are available to any application that sup-
ports Services. Located under the Apple menu, the Services menu lists all
installed Services. To speak text from an application, first select that text.
Then, choose Application➪Services➪Speech➪Start Speaking to speak text
from many applications (where Application is the name of the currently run-
ning application). This works great for doing things like
✦Speaking a Web page aloud
✦Reading your e-mail
✦Listening to a speech you’ve written in Microsoft Word
As you might expect, choosing Application➪Services➪Speech➪Stop
Speaking ceases the banter emanating from your Mac’s speaker.
Alas, not all applications are created equal. Some applications cannot
access the Services offered in the Services menu — if you don’t see Speech
in the list of services, you’re out of luck.
Speaking text through AppleScript
Don’t forget AppleScript, which offers a slew of interesting speech possibili-
ties. (For everything you always wanted to know about AppleScript — well,
almost everything — see the previous chapter.) With AppleScript, you can
command your Mac to say all sorts of things — in fact, because AppleScript
is dynamic, it can speak text that it doesn’t know about at the time that you
create the script. Truly techno-sassy!
For example, suppose that you want your Mac to speak the day of the week.
Each day that you run the script, your Mac will speak a different phrase: the
name of that day of the week. Launch the AppleScript Script Editor — you’ll
find it in the AppleScript folder inside your Applications folder — and type
this example into the Script Editor window:
tell application “Finder”
set today to weekday of the (current date)
say (today as text)
end tell
This sort of task wouldn’t be possible with TextEdit.
AppleScript works in conjunction with Speech Recognition, too. The
Speakable Items folder holds various scripts that you can launch by using
your own speech. (See the earlier section, “The On/Off tab,” to find out more

Speaking Your Own Phrases
674
about the Speakable Items folder.) Instead of simply double-clicking the pre-
vious script to hear the day of the week, you could save the script as an
Application in the Speakable Items folder.
Be sure to give the script a descriptive name because that name is what you
will speak to execute the script later. For example, save the script with a
name like this:
What day is it?
Then, when you want to know what day it is, simply ask your Mac! If all goes
as planned, your Mac should speak the result. With a little imagination, it’s
not hard to dream up some fun or useful ideas for AppleScript.

n the last ten years, surfing the Internet has gone from a nerd’s hobby to
a fun activity enjoyed by the whole family. For children and grandparents
alike, Web surfing has become one of the world’s most popular spectator
sports — and at some point, you’ll probably get the itch to become more
involved. Everyone else has a Web site, so why not you?
Creating and hosting your own Web site can be a rewarding experience, and
with some help from Apple and Mac OS X, it’s a cinch to do. Whether you
want to share your favorite eggplant recipes, display pictures of your purple
car, or just post a résumé (with a purple background), Mac OS X has you
covered in more ways than one. So put on your seat belts — you’re now
entering a strange world of servers, mysterious codes, and things that go
bump in the Net. No need for alarm, though . . . Apple has made the topic
so simple that even a politician can do it.
Building a Site with .Mac
To get you up and running on the Web quickly, Apple offers a suite of online
Web-publishing tools. The toolbox, collectively known as .Mac, gives you
easy and fast access to a variety of Internet functions. A .Mac membership
costs $99.95 per year and offers the following features:
✦iCards: Send customized electronic postcards via the Internet.
✦HomePage: Build and edit your own Web site.
✦iDisk: Disk space on Apple’s servers for you to post a Web site or files.
(This is where you’ll be storing files for use in your own HomePage
creations.)

Building a Site with .Mac
676
✦Online Backup: Safeguard your data the right way — across the
Internet, or to your Mac’s CD recorder.
✦Address Book and iCal sharing: Store and publish data from your local
Address Book and iCal files.
✦Email: Web-based e-mail for your Mac.com e-mail account.
Registering as a .Mac user
You can visit Apple’s home on the Internet to register as a .Mac user.
www.mac.com/
To register, you must create a username and password. The username that
you select is an important part of the .Mac experience, so choose it care-
fully. Your username plays a part in your e-mail address, your Web address,
your login name, and even the bar code on your forehead. (Okay, the bar
code is a joke — for now, anyway — but the rest aren’t.) Take a few minutes
to carefully plan your .Mac username. It will save you some typing, be easier
for your friends to remember, and, like a customized license plate for your
car, can convey a certain personality to others on the Web.
Setting up your site with HomePage
After you successfully register as a .Mac user, log in to the .Mac section of
the Apple Web site, as shown in Figure 4-1. You can find it on the toolbar at
the top of the Web page.
Then click the Account link in the lower portion of the toolbar. This takes
you to the login screen (see Figure 4-2). Enter your username and password
that you entered upon registration and click the Enter button.
After you’re logged in, click the HomePage icon that appears at the left side
of the page. HomePage is a complete publishing tool for building Web pages
that’s actually a Web site itself. HomePage lets you choose from a variety of
styles that you can then apply to your Web site within a matter of seconds;
because it’s template driven, even non-techies can produce impressive-
looking Web sites. After you finish designing your Web pages by selecting
one of the premade templates, HomePage automatically posts them to your
.Mac Web site.
The HomePage interface includes two sections: the Pages section and the
Create a Page section. The Pages section (as shown in Figure 4-3) is where
you manage the various pages of your site; here you can view a list of all
pages on your site as well as password-protect any pages on your site.
When you’ve completed your site, you can get spiffy and formal by sending
an announcement to all of your friends from the Site section.

In the Create a Page section, as shown in Figure 4-4, you can directly add a
page to your site based on a variety of premade Web page templates. Apple
offers a multitude of styles to suit your needs. Click any one of these styles
to add it to your Web site. When you do, .Mac walks you through a series of
questions that indicate what specific information, graphics, or movies you
want on that Web page.
✦Photo Album: Display your favorite photos and images for your friends
and family.
✦File Sharing: With HomePage, you can quickly post your favorite files
for others to download.
✦Site Menu: A top-level menu design that helps visitors navigate quickly
around your site.
✦iMovie: Post your home videos or iMovie creations on the Web. (To dis-
cover all about iMovie, read Book III, Chapter 4.)
✦Writing: Want to update all those close and not-so-close relatives on
your family’s doings? Put out a newspaper, or an online diary.
✦Resume: Looking for a job? A Web-based résumé is a handy tool for
impressing prospective employers.
✦Baby: When your bundle of joy arrives, it’s a cinch to post photos of the
new baby to your HomePage site. This works great for long-distance
relatives because they can cyber-visit the hospital without leaving
home. It also works well for keeping those curious aunts and uncles out
of the delivery room.
✦Education: Schools are depending more and more on the Internet.
To help the student and the teacher, Apple provides several useful 
education-related pages for you to use, including event calendars,
homework pages, and an online school newspaper.
✦Invite: The Web makes for a great tool when it comes to delivering invi-
tations. Gone are the hassles of standing in line at the post office, licking
300 stamps (What? You don’t have 300 friends?), and cards lost in the
mail. Send your guests a Web-based invitation. Your guests will thank
you. The trees that you save will thank you. Moreover, your tongue will
thank you. The post office, however, might not thank you, but why
should it start now?
Keep adding pages to your site as you see fit. Each type of page has a differ-
ent layout. If a page requires media like images or movies, for example,
HomePage will automatically list all media available on your iDisk. You
simply select the desired media file, and HomePage adds them to the cur-
rent page. The following section elaborates more on iDisk.

Book VII
Chapter 4

After you complete your Web site, you access it by using a URL like this
(with your_username replaced with your actual username):
http://homepage.mac.com/your_username/
Adding files with iDisk
If you create a Web page with HomePage that requires images or movies,
you add them to your site by using iDisk. iDisk (see Figure 4-5) is a space on
Apple’s servers designated just for you, where HomePage stores the ele-
ments of your site when you add or change Web pages.
You aren’t limited to iDisk access via HomePage: Simply choose the iDisk
menu from the Finder’s Go menu to mount your iDisk. (No need for a
saddle — I explain more about mounting volumes in Book I.) When you
mount an iDisk, it shows up as an icon on your Desktop, just like you might
see when you insert a CD into your Mac. The icon for your iDisk, however,
looks like a hard drive with a blue globe on top of it.
Figure 4-4:
Add pages
to your site.

Creating a Home Page with HTML and iDisk
680
With your iDisk mounted, double-click its icon to view its contents. Apple
organizes iDisk with a handful of folders that correspond to the page types
in HomePage; you can’t delete or rename these folders, however. If you need
an image for your photo album page, stick it in the Pictures folder. If you
need a movie for your Web page, copy it to the Movies folder. When you
return to HomePage, your files will now appear in the list of items that you
can use in a Web page.
Creating a Home Page with HTML and iDisk
For those folks who like driving a car without knowing what goes on under
the hood, HomePage is perfect — use it to create and post Web pages with-
out knowing what makes it all work. On the other hand, some folks are
grease monkeys and like to get under the hood. If you’re itching to see what
goes on behind the scenes, Apple gives you a chance to get your hands
dirty. You don’t have to use HomePage to work on your Web site — if you’re
well versed in HyperText Markup Language (HTML), you can edit your Web
page files on your iDisk just like you would any file on your hard drive.
Within your iDisk, open the Sites folder to see the various files that compose
your Web page. If you’re an old pro at HTML, you can add your own pages to
your iDisk with your favorite text editor. In other words, the iDisk acts much
Figure 4-5:

like any other disk that you’re accustomed to using. (For all the inside infor-
mation on iDisk, see Chapter 4 of Book IV.)
Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
With .Mac, Apple takes care of the Web server for you, but you aren’t lim-
ited to .Mac: You have other options when it comes to posting Web pages.
Mac OS X comes stocked with its own high-powered Web server, so you
can run things without .Mac. Consider the advantages, won’t you?
✦Privacy: Everyone in the house wants access to the family phone book.
You want all computers on your home network to see the telephone list
but not the whole world. Posting it on the home network keeps it secure
from prying eyes outside your home.
✦Your own domain: Want a name like www.size14feetphotos.com?
(Don’t even think about it, I’ve already taken it.) Anyway, if you run your
own Web server, you can arrange for your own domain name.
✦Speed: Your friend needs a copy of your iMovies masterpiece for a class
project. Rather than wait for you to post the file to your iDisk, he
decides to download it directly from your computer.
✦Coolness factor: It’s fun, easy to do, and your mother will truly be proud.
Seriously, it is fun and easy to run your own Web server. (And although
your mother might not actually give a hoot, companies like employees
who know useful skills; therefore, Web server stuff is good to know.)
I love Apache: Confessions of a UNIX Webmaster
Deep in the guts of Mac OS X lies one of the most popular Web servers
around: Apache, which turns your Macintosh into a full-featured Web server.
The Apache Web server is well known around the world and comprises
about half of all personal and commercial Web servers in use today. Yes,
that’s right! You have one of the world’s most-used Web servers already
installed on your Mac!
By now, you might be wondering what makes Apache so great — I won’t
keep you in suspense. Apache’s first appealing feature is its price —
absolutely free. Free is sassy! Free isn’t any good without quality, though.
Fortunately, Apache delivers in this aspect as well. It’s extremely reliable —
and combined with the crash-proof Mac OS X, you can be almost certain
that your Web server will always be available. Besides being rock-solid and
free, Apache sports all the features you’d expect from a top-notch Web
server, such as techno-wizard integration with databases and scripting lan-
guages. Believe me, it can serve anything you throw at it.

Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
682
Configuring and running Apache
In addition to all its great qualities, Apache is dead simple to operate in
Mac OS X. Open the System Preferences and click the Sharing icon; then
mark the check box next to Personal Web Sharing to launch Apache. That’s
it! It doesn’t get any easier . . . at least, when it comes to turning on Apache.
(See Figure 4-6.)
To begin using your Web server, open a Finder window and navigate to the
Sites folder that resides in your Home folder; this is the root of your per-
sonal space on the Web server. Any files that you add to this folder will be
accessible via your Web server.
You might find a file named index.html already installed in the Sites folder.
This is the default file for your Web site. To view it, open your favorite Web
browser and load this URL, replacing ~username with the username that
you’re currently using:
http://127.0.0.1/~username/
Figure 4-6:
Start your
Web server
with only
one click in
the System
Preferences.

Book VII
Chapter 4
Hosting a Web

Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
683
The 127.0.0.1 address is a generic Internet Protocol (IP) address, which
means self. (In other words, your Mac is connecting to itself. Faintly unset-
tling, but absolutely legal.) You can also use your real IP address, which
appears at the bottom of the Sharing panel in the System Preferences when
you turn on Personal Web Sharing.
To see the Web page from another computer, you must use the real IP
address. The 127.0.0.1 address is merely a convenience for use when you’re
using the actual machine that runs the Web server.
Because Mac OS X is a multi-user environment, each user can host a Web site.
The key is the username found at the end of the URL; replace it with the appro-
priate username, and you’re ready to go. If everything goes smoothly, you
should be viewing the default Mac OS X Web page, as shown in Figure 4-7. The
default page displays a welcome message and some important information
for Web-sharing beginners. Make sure that you read the information carefully.
In addition to a main page for any individual that logs in, the Web server
also has a global default page. To find the global default page, follow these
steps:
1. Open a new Finder window.
2. Double-click the drive that contains your Mac OS X installation.
3. Choose Library➪WebServer➪Documents.
Figure 4-7:

Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
684
Here you’ll find dozens of HTML files. These files are the default global home
pages for many different languages. For English versions of the Mac OS, this
means that the file named index.html.en serves as the default home page
for the server. To view this file in your browser, try this URL:
http://127.0.0.1/ 
This will display a Web page like the one shown in Figure 4-8.
Serving static information
To change the default Web page, simply open it in your favorite HTML
editor and start changing it. An HTML editor is an application that lets you
lay out your Web page with what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) ease.
If you’re familiar with a word processor, you’re well on your way to using
an HTML editor. Of the many HTML editors available, VersionTracker
(www.versiontracker.com) will give you a good head start on finding
some of the most popular ones.
You aren’t limited only to HTML editors, of course. Many word processors
support HTML export — I particularly like Microsoft Word — so it’s a cinch
to create Web pages with them by simply choosing File➪Save As.

If you already know HTML (Webmasters might say, “If you can bang out raw
HTML code”), you can edit your Web pages by hand. Simply open the existing
index.html file with a text editor like TextEdit or BBEdit (www.barebones.
com) by choosing File➪Open and change it to suit your needs. For example, a
simple Web page might read like this:
<html>
<head><title>My First Web Page</title></head>
<body>
Welcome to my Web site!
</body>
</html>
If you’re interested in improving your HTML skills, HTML 4 For Dummies, 4th
Edition, by Ed Tittle and Natanya Pitts (Wiley Publishing, Inc.) makes a good
starting point.
Serving information dynamically
It’s cool to serve your own Web pages, but the fun doesn’t stop there: Plain
old HTML pages are handy for displaying the same information repeatedly.
Computer Web-wizards call this type of information static. (That is, it doesn’t
change, so you can set it once and forget about it.)
Although static displays are good for things like your copy of the Magna
Carta or sports stats from the past 20 years, they’re not so great for data
that changes a lot (usually referred to as dynamic, if you hadn’t already
guessed). Some good examples of dynamic information are the date, the
time, your age, or the weather. If you were to display your age on a Web
page by using only HTML, you’d only have to change it once every year.
This isn’t so bad, but consider what happens if you want to post the date on
a Web page: Now you have to update the Web page once per day. Add the
time, and now you’re down to HTML changes every hour, minute, or second,
depending on how reliable you want to make the clock. Clearly, you need
something besides static HTML for dynamic information.
The Apache Web server allows you to use a variety of tools to produce
dynamic Web pages. The most basic tool for serving dynamic data is the
Server Side Include. The Web server executes a small piece of code in your
HTML — then the Web server replaces that code with some text and sends
the page to whomever requested it. The result is dynamic text in your
Web page.

Adding Server Side Includes requires that you perform a few preparatory
steps beforehand. To alter Apache settings, you must change text in its set-
tings file. The file is named httpd.conf and is located here:
/etc/httpd/httpd.conf
You probably won’t be able to find this file if you go searching for it in the
Finder because it’s a hidden file. Some text editors like BBEdit can open
hidden files, but you might not have that on hand. You do have the Terminal
application, though. Launch the Terminal by double-clicking its icon. (You
can find it in the Utility folder that resides in your Applications folder.) Book
VII, Chapter 1 has more information about the Terminal in case you need a
refresher. At the prompt that appears, enter this command:
sudo pico /etc/httpd/httpd.conf
Password:
When prompted for a password, use a password of an administrator
account on your machine. If you’re the only user, this might be the pass-
word of the user that you’re currently signed in as. Press Return, and you
will be looking at the innards of the Apache setup file. There’s a lot of what
I call Programmer Pig Latin in this file, but don’t be discouraged. Scroll down
through the file (use the arcane UNIX Control+V key sequence) and look
for this chunk of text:
# Note that “MultiViews” must be named *explicitly* --- “Options All”
# doesn’t give it to you.
# 
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews 
If you don’t feel like scrolling through a bunch of text, you can jump to the
text by pressing Control+W (shorthand for where), entering the text that you
want to find (for example: Options Indexes FollowSymLinksMultiViews), and
then pressing Return.
Whenever you find the desired text in the file, add the word Includes to the
end of the last line of this text.
# Note that “MultiViews” must be named *explicitly* --- “Options All”
# doesn’t give it to you.
# 
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews Includes
One thing that you might notice in this file is the many pound (#) charac-
ters. A pound character denotes a comment. If a comment character (#)

Book VII
Chapter 4
Hosting a Web
Site à la OS X
Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
687
precedes a line, that line of text performs no function. You can use this to
your advantage to turn settings on and off for the server. Add a pound char-
acter to the beginning of a line, and that function stops working. Remove the
character, and the function works again. Continue scrolling through the
httpd.conf file by using the arrow keys or the Control+W search trick,
looking for the following:
# To use server-parsed HTML files
#
AddType text/html .shtml
AddHandler server-parsed .shtml
Make sure that no # characters precede the AddType and AddHandler lines.
After you finish, press Control+O, press Return to save the file, and then
press Control+X to exit the pico text editor. Now that you’ve edited Apache’s
settings, you have to restart it for the changes to take effect. Open the
System Preferences and click the Internet tab. Deactivate Web Sharing and
then reactivate it again.
Next, open your favorite text editor and add some text to a new file:
<html>
<head><title>My First Web Page</title></head>
<body>
Welcome to my Web site!<br>
Today’s date: <!--#echo var=”DATE_LOCAL” -->
</body>
</html>
The <!--#echo var=”DATE_LOCAL” --> part is a Server Side Include. The
server understands the “DATE_LOCAL” message, and in its place, adds text
that displays today’s date. Save the text file and give it the name
index.shtml.
Make sure that you include the .shtml extension. It’s important for making
the Server Side Includes work properly.
Save the file in your global Web folder, located here:
/Library/WebServer/documents/index.shtml

Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
688
Finally, it’s time to check out your handiwork . . . and rest your fingers from
all this typing. Open a Web browser and navigate to the URL of your global
Web folder:
http://127.0.0.1/index.shtml
The result should be a Web page that displays today’s date. (I know, it’s not
particularly material for the Louvre at this point, but I think you can appre-
ciate the possibilities.)
If you’re not content with appending .shtml to your files to take advantage
of Server Side Includes, you need to perform another step. When you view
your Web site with a Web browser, it’s customary to use default pages for a
particular directory. For example, when loading the following URL:
http://127.0.0.1/
the server looks for a default page to load on the server because you didn’t
specify one. This is normally a file named index.html, which causes prob-
lems for Server Side Includes because they require a filename ending with
.shtml. The easiest way to fix this is to tell the server that index.shtml
can also be a default page. To fix this discrepancy, reload the Apache config-
uration file by using this command line:
sudo pico /etc/httpd/httpd.conf
If you perform this step within 15 minutes of your last sudo command, you
won’t have to re-enter a password. If it’s been longer, you might have to
enter the password — I told you in Chapter 1 of this mini-book that UNIX
had sophisticated security, didn’t I? Then scroll down through the
httpd.conf file and find this bit of text:
# DirectoryIndex: Name of the file or files to use as a pre-written HTML
# directory index.  Separate multiple entries with spaces.
#    
<IfModule mod_dir.c>
DirectoryIndex index.html
</IfModule>
Change it by adding index.shtml to it:
# DirectoryIndex: Name of the file or files to use as a pre-written HTML
# directory index.  Separate multiple entries with spaces.
#    
<IfModule mod_dir.c>
DirectoryIndex index.shtml index.html
</IfModule>

Book VII
Chapter 4
Hosting a Web
Site à la OS X
Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
689
Notice that index.shtml precedes index.html. This line indicates which
filenames you can use for the default filename of any folder on the Web
server. In this case, I’m forcing index.shtml as the default filename before
index.html. This means that when you load a Web page from your server
without specifying a specific file, Apache is going to look for a file named
index.shtml in that folder first. If it can’t find one, it looks for a file named
index.html. With that change in place, press Control+O to write the file to
disk and then press Control+X to quit the pico text editor. To see your work
in action, load this URL with your Web browser:
http://127.0.0.1/
The result should be that your index.shtml page loads with Server Side
Includes intact.
Server Side Includes can perform a few other simple functions besides the
date, including
✦DATE_GMT: Today’s date in Greenwich Mean Time.
✦DATE_LOCAL: Today’s date in your local time zone. (You’re already an
expert with this one.)
✦DOCUMENT_NAME: The name of document.
✦LAST_MODIFIED: The date that this document was last modified.
To see them all in action, alter your index.shtml file to read like this:
<html>
<head><title>My First Web Page</title></head>
<body>
Welcome to my Web site! <br><br>
GMT date: <!--#echo var=”DATE_GMT” --> <br>
Today’s date: <!--#echo var=”DATE_LOCAL” --><br>
Name of this document: <!--#echo var=”DOCUMENT_NAME” --><br>
Last Modified: <!--#echo var=”LAST_MODIFIED” --><br>
</body>
</html>
Reload your Web server’s main page to see the results.

Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
690
Fancier dynamic stuff
Another common use of Server Side Includes gives you a chance to remove
whole chunks of your HTML files and put them into another file. (Sounds
messy, doesn’t it?) You might want to do this for HTML that will appear on
each page of your Web site: For example, you might like today’s date and the
page’s last modified date to appear at the bottom of any page of your whole
Web site. Webmasters, being the sedentary, nerd-beast crowd that they are,
don’t want to type this information repeatedly for each HTML page that they
create. Furthermore, they don’t want to have to retype all that information
for every file if it should change. What’s a lazy techno-wizard to do? Server
Side Includes come to the rescue!
The first step is to modify your main page: in this case, index.shtml:
<html>
<head><title>My First Web Page</title></head>
<body>
Welcome to my Web site!<br>
<!--#include virtual=”footer.shtml”-->
</body>
</html>
You might notice that I removed all the Server Side Includes from before and
added a new one. The new line
<!--#include virtual=”footer.shtml”-->
tells the Web server to load the file named footer.shtml and dump its con-
tents into index.shtml in place of this Server Side Include. Save this file.
Next, create a new text file. To the new file, add this code:
<center>
<hr width=”50%”>
Today’s date: <!--#echo var=”DATE_LOCAL” --><br>
Last Modified: <!--#echo var=”LAST_MODIFIED” --><br><br>
</center>
If you’re familiar with HTML, the first thing that might strike you is that
this file doesn’t follow proper HTML formatting — that’s because this file is
just a chunk of HTML that’s going to be part of a fully formed HTML file, it

Book VII
Chapter 4
Hosting a Web
Site à la OS X
Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
691
doesn’t need the full treatment. Otherwise, this code is standard HTML with
a few Server Side Includes tossed in for good measure. Just to spruce things
up a bit, the text is centered with a small horizontal line above it. Save this
file, giving it the name footer.shtml.
Now, whenever you want this footer to be at the bottom of any Web page on
the server, add the <!--#include virtual=”footer.shtml”--> line from
before. Besides saving you time from reconstructing the footer each time
in an HTML file, you only have to add one line of code, and Server Side
Includes take care of the rest. Even better, you can alter the footer file when-
ever you want, and the changes appear in the HTML of every page that con-
tains the footer.
When bad things happen to good Webmasters
If you have browsed the Web for any time at all, you’ve no doubt stumbled
across a dead link. This phenomenon occurs when you attempt to load a
Web page that no longer exists on a particular server. If you were lucky and
the server still existed, you probably saw a boring error message telling you
that the page no longer exists. Apache provides default error messages like
this for you, but that doesn’t mean you can’t improve the messages that
your visitors see — a true power user eschews defaults when creativity
kicks in!
Open your httpd.conf file for editing with pico like before.
sudo pico /etc/httpd/httpd.conf
Scroll through the file until you find the ErrorDocument directives.
#    2) local redirects
#ErrorDocument 404 /missing.html
#  to redirect to local URL /missing.html
Whenever a server can’t find a page, it produces a 404 error — also well
known as “That Damn Screen” to Web surfers around the world. (Please
excuse my clarity there.) In fact, the number 404 has entered popular slang,
meaning dead or broken. Normally, Apache directs itself to a default error
message, but by removing one comment (note the now-absent pound char-
acter at the beginning of the second line), you can specify which file you
would like to display (in the form of a page for the viewer) in the case of a
404 error.
#    2) local redirects
ErrorDocument 404 /missing.html
#  to redirect to local URL /missing.html

Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
692
Press Control+O to save the httpd.conf file and then press Control+X to
exit pico. Now whenever someone comes across a missing Web page on
your site, your server will redirect him to a file named missing.html. Of
course, you also need to create this missing.html file. Use your favorite
text editor to create a new HTML file. To it, add this code:
<html>
<head><title>Uh-oh!</title></head>
<body>
Holy Toledo! <br><br>
We can’t find the page you requested. <br>
Would you like to <a href=”index.shtml”>return to the main page</a>?
<!--#include virtual=”footer.shtml”-->
</body>
</html>
Save this file, giving it the name missing.html. Save it in your Web server’s
root directory.
/Library/WebServer/Documents/missing.html
Return to the System Preferences Sharing panel, click the Internet tab, and
toggle Web Sharing off and on again. This will force your Web server to read
in the changes to the httpd.conf file.
To test it out, load a URL that you know doesn’t exist. Anything will do.
http://1270.0.0.1/some_missing_page_I_forgot_to_add.html
If you’ve configured things properly, you should see a personalized Web
error page — this way, perhaps your visitor will chuckle instead of curse
when a dead link is encountered.
