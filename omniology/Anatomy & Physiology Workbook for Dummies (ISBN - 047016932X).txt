About the Authors
Janet Rae-Dupree has been covering science and technology in Silicon Valley since 1993 for
a number of publications, including U.S. News & World Report, BusinessWeek, the San Jose
Mercury News, and the Silicon Valley/San Jose Business Journal. She was a frequent guest 
on cable channel Tech TV’s “Silicon Spin” technology talk show, and she was part of the
Pulitzer Prize-winning team at the Los Angeles Times covering the city’s riots in 1992. During
the 2005–2006 academic year, Janet was a John S. Knight Journalism Fellow at Stanford
University, where she studied human biology and researched innovation and market transfer.
She freelances for various publications, working from her home in Half Moon Bay, California,
where she lives with husband, Dave Dupree, and their 9-year-old son, Matthew (although a
19-year-old calico cat named Trillian actually rules the roost).
Pat DuPree taught anatomy/physiology, biology, medical terminology, and environmental
science for 24 years at several colleges and universities in Los Angeles County. She holds two
undergraduate life science degrees and a master’s degree from Auburn University and con-
ducted cancer research at Southern Research Institute in Birmingham, Alabama, before join-
ing the Muscogee Health Department in Columbus, Georgia. In 1970, she moved to Redondo
Beach, California, where she was a university instructor and raised her two sons, Dave
Dupree and Mark DuPree. Now Pat is retired and lives on lovely Pine Lake in rural Georgia
with her husband, Dr. James E. DuPree.
Dedication
To our loving family — Dave Dupree, Matthew Dupree, and Jim DuPree — for their patience
and understanding as we pulled this book together and put so many other aspects of our
lives on hold. To Dave, for being Mr. Fix-It on balky hard drives, recalcitrant computers, and
fussy printers; for distracting an antsy 8-year-old with baseball, movies, and games; and for
concocting terrific — and healthy! — home-cooked meals. To Matthew, for understanding
why Mommy couldn’t drive for every school field trip, attend every Cub Scout den meeting,
or set up play dates every single day of the week. 
And especially from Pat to Jim for his love, enthusiastic support, assistance, and encourage-
ment without which she could not have finished this workbook.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
We owe gratitude to so many people, but this project has been first and foremost a DuPree
family affair. We will never be able to thank our spouses enough for their patience and under-
standing from beginning to end. Dr. James E. DuPree was a constant helpmate to Pat on the
East coast, providing research, editing, computer assistance, and graphics support as well as
priceless cheerleading and enthusiasm. Their son David E. Dupree filled the cheerleader role
on the West coast, keeping the computers and home network up and running, Janet focused
and on track, and the gaping child-rearing gaps filled while she pushed to get the book done
in what surely must be record time. And we can’t forget to thank son/grandson Matthew J.
Dupree for his stalwart patience while Mom and Grandmom focused their attentions on the
book instead of him.
We would also like to thank our agent, Matt Wagner, for his tireless efforts, as well as the
many devoted people at Wiley Publishing, particularly Stacy Kennedy, Chrissy Guthrie (who
welcomed Sophia Rose Guthrie into the world days after receiving the final manuscript!),
Stephen Clark, and Elizabeth Rea.

Anatomy & Physiology Workbook For Dummies 

Introduction
W
hether your aim is to become a physical therapist or a pharmacist, a doctor or an
acupuncturist, a nutritionist or a personal trainer, a registered nurse or a paramedic,
a parent or simply a healthy human being — your efforts have to be based on a good under-
standing of anatomy and physiology. But knowing that the knee bone connects to the thigh
bone (or does it?) is just the tip of the iceberg. In Anatomy & Physiology Workbook For
Dummies, you discover intricacies that will leave you agog with wonder. The human body is
a miraculous biological machine capable of growing, interacting with the world, and even
reproducing despite any number of environmental odds stacked against it. Understanding
how the body’s interlaced systems accomplish these feats requires a close look at every-
thing from chemistry to structural mechanics.
Early anatomists relied on dissections to study the human body, which is why the Greek
word anatomia means “to cut up or dissect.” Anatomical references have been found in
Egypt dating back to 1600 BC, but it was the Greeks — Hippocrates, in particular — who first
dissected bodies for medical study around 420 BC. That’s why more than two millennia later
we still use words based on Greek and Latin roots to identify anatomical structures.
That’s also part of the reason so much of the study of anatomy and physiology feels like
learning a foreign language. Truth be told, you are working with a foreign language, but it’s
the language of you and the one body you’re ever going to have.
About This Book
This workbook isn’t meant to replace a textbook, and it’s certainly not meant to replace going
to an actual anatomy and physiology class. It works best as a supplement to your ongoing
education and as a study aid in prepping for exams. That’s why we give you insight into what
your instructor most likely will emphasize as you move from one body system or structure to
the next.
Your coursework most likely will cover things in a different order than we’ve chosen for this
book. We encourage you to take full advantage of the table of contents and the index to find
the material addressed in your class. Whatever you do, certainly don’t feel obligated to go
through this workbook in any particular order. However, please do answer the practice ques-
tions and check the answers at the end of each chapter because, in addition to answers, we
clarify why the right answer is the right answer and why the other answers are incorrect;
we also provide you with memory tools and other tips whenever possible.
Conventions Used in This Book
Half the battle of studying anatomy and physiology is getting comfortable with the jargon. To
help you navigate through this book, we use the following typographical conventions:
 Italics are used for emphasis and to highlight new words or terms that are defined in
the text.
 Boldface is used to indicate keywords in bulleted lists or the action parts of numbered
steps.
 Monofont is used for Web site addresses.

Foolish Assumptions
In writing Anatomy & Physiology Workbook For Dummies, we had to make some
assumptions about you, the reader. If any of the following apply, this book’s for you:
 You’re an advanced high school student or college student trying to puzzle out
anatomy and physiology for the first time.
 You’re a student at any level who’s returning to the topic after some time away,
and you need some refreshing.
 You’re facing an anatomy and physiology exam and want a good study tool to
ensure that you have a firm grasp of the topic.
Because this is a workbook, we had to limit our exposition of each and every topic so
that we could include lots of practice questions to keep you guessing. (Believe us, we
could go on forever about this anatomy and physiology stuff!) In leaving out some of
the explanation of the topics covered in this book, we assume that you’re not just look-
ing to dabble in anatomy and physiology and therefore have access to at least one
textbook on the subject.
How This Book Is Organized
Anatomy and physiology are very far-reaching topics, so it only makes sense that this
workbook is divided into parts, each of which is divided into a number of chapters.
The following sections preview the part topics to give you an idea of what you can find
where.
Part I: Building Blocks of the Body
We begin at the very beginning — chemistry — because it’s a very good place to start.
Stop moaning and groaning — chemistry really isn’t as difficult as it’s been made out
to be. It’s an integral part of understanding what the body’s cells are doing and how
they’re doing it. We cover the basics from the atom on up and introduce the processes
that keep the whole package operating smoothly. Then we take a look at the cells and
the tiny structures inside every one. Cells are living things, just like the bodies of
which they are a part, and they have the same cycles as all living things do: They grow,
mature, reproduce, and die. By layering thousands upon thousands of similar cells on
top of one another, tissues with unique structures and functions are formed. This part
covers the primary types of tissues and where you’ll find them in the body.
Part II: Weaving It Together: 
Bones, Muscles, and Skin
The chapters in this part have a kind of classic leg-bone-connected-to-the-hip-bone feel
to them — what people generally think of when they hear “anatomy and physiology.”
We take you on a tour of the skeleton and then attach muscles to that skeleton to get
the whole package moving and grooving. Then we wrap it all together in the body’s
largest single organ: the skin.

Anatomy & Physiology Workbook For Dummies 

Part III: Feed and Fuel: Supply and Transport
No man is an island, and no one can exist without a consistent supply of life’s little
necessities. In this part, we breathe life into the respiratory system with a close look at
the lungs and everything attached to them, we feed your hunger for knowledge about
how nutrients fuel the anatomical package, and we get to the heart of the well-oiled
human machine to show how the central pump is the hardest-working muscle in the
entire body. None of that matters without a strong defense system, so we touch on the
lymphatic system. And don’t forget: All that metabolizing is bound to lead to some
waste and by-products; we package up the trash and show you how the body takes it
to the dumpster.
Part IV: Survival of the Species
No, we don’t talk about who’s going to get voted off the island. But we do take a close
look at perpetuating humanity through reproductive successes. This part takes the
male and female halves of the equation one at a time, delving into the parts of the male
and female reproductive systems as well as the functions of those parts. We cover
sperm and eggs, but we don’t even try to address which came first!
Part V: Mission Control: All Systems Go
We have lift off! We already have gotten things moving before this part, but now it’s
time to study how nerves and hormones keep things hopping. In this part, we lay out
the basic building blocks of the nervous system, help you wire it all together, and then
show you how the body sends messages flying along a solid spine of brainy material.
After that, we come to our senses with an overview of the eyes and ears (we cover
taste in the digestive system chapter, touch in the skin chapter, and smell in the respi-
ratory chapter). Then we turn hormonal to absorb what the endocrine system does,
including observing the functions of the ringmaster of this multi-ring circus, the pitu-
itary gland. We also delve into the various hormones coursing through your body, why
they’re there, and how they do what they do.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
This part is a classic For Dummies feature — lists of ten things that we just have to
share with our readers. First we identify ten Web sites that can help you advance your
knowledge of anatomy and physiology. Then we give you a list of ten key things to
keep in mind as you study this illustrious and fascinating topic.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, you’ll find symbols in the margins that highlight critical ideas
and information. Here’s what they mean:
The tip icon gives you juicy tidbits about how best to remember tricky terms or con-
cepts in anatomy and physiology. It also highlights helpful strategies for fast translation
and understanding.
3
Introduction

The example icon marks questions for you to try your hand at. We give you the answer
straightaway to get your juices flowing and your brain warmed up for more practice
questions.
The remember icon highlights key material that you should pay extra attention to in
order to keep everything straight.
The sizzling bomb icon — otherwise known as the warning icon — points out areas
and topics where common pitfalls can lead you astray.
Where to Go from Here
If you purchased this book and you’re already partway through an anatomy and physi-
ology class, check the table of contents and zoom ahead to whichever segment your
instructor is covering currently. When you have a few spare minutes, review the chap-
ters that address topics your class already has covered. It’s an excellent way to prep
for a midterm or final exam. If you haven’t yet started an anatomy and physiology
class, you have the freedom to start wherever you like (although we suggest that you
begin with Chapter 1) and proceed onward and upward through the glorious machine
that is the human body!

Anatomy & Physiology Workbook For Dummies 

Part I
Building Blocks of the Body

In this part . . .
B
efore beginning to study the parts of the body, it’s
important to know about the basic building blocks
and functions that make those parts what they are. That
means getting down to the true basics: chemistry, cells,
cell division, and how tissues are formed. We know your
eyes are glazing over, but it’s really not as bad as you may

This part helps you discover that chemistry isn’t all that
tough, particularly when you focus on the organic elements
involved in the chemistry of life. You look at how that chem-
istry takes place inside the bricks-and-mortar of the body
(its cells) and take things a step further with the wonders of
self-perpetuation through mitotic cell division.

e can hear your cries of alarm. You thought you were getting ready to learn about
the knee bone connecting to the thigh bone. How in the heck does that involve
(horrors!) chemistry? As much as you may not want to admit it, chemistry — particularly
organic chemistry, or that branch of the field that focuses on carbon-based molecules — is a
crucial starting point for understanding how the human body works. When all is said and
done, the universe boils down to two fundamental components: matter, which occupies
space and has mass; and energy, or the ability to do work or create change. This is the chap-
ter where we review the interactions between matter and energy to give you some insight
into what you need to know to ace those early-term tests.
Building from Scratch: Atoms and Elements
All matter — be it solid, liquid, or gas — is composed of atoms. An atom is the smallest 
unit of matter capable of retaining the identity of an element during a chemical reaction. 
An element is a substance that can’t be broken down into simpler substances by normal
chemical reactions. There are 92 naturally occurring atoms in nature and 17 (at last count)
artificially created atoms for a total of 109 known atoms. However, additional spaces have yet
to be filled in on the periodic chart of elements, which organizes all the elements by name,
symbol, atomic weight, and atomic number. The key elements of interest to students of
anatomy and physiology are
 Hydrogen, symbol H
 Oxygen, symbol O
 Nitrogen, symbol N
 Carbon, symbol C
HONC your horn for the four organic elements. These four elements make up 96 percent of
all living material.
Atoms are made up of the subatomic particles protons and neutrons, which are in the atom’s
nucleus, and clouds of electrons orbiting the nucleus. The atomic weight, or mass, of an atom
is the total number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus. The atomic number of an atom is
its number of protons or electrons; conveniently, atoms always have the same number of
protons as electrons, which means that an atom is always electrically neutral because it

always has the same number of positive charges as negative charges. Opposite charges
attract, so negatively charged electrons are attracted to positively charged protons.
The attraction holds electrons in orbits outside the nucleus. The more protons there
are in the nucleus, the stronger the atom’s positive charge is and the more electrons it
can attract.
Electrons circle an atom’s nucleus at different energy levels, also known as orbits or
shells (see Figure 1-1). Each orbit can accommodate only a limited number of electrons
and lies at a fixed distance from the nucleus. Each level must be filled to capacity with
electrons before a new level can get started. The orbit closest to the nucleus, which
may be referred to as the first level or first shell, can accommodate up to two electrons.
The second level can have eight electrons and the third also can have eight electrons.
Higher orbits exist, but anatomy and physiology students only need to know about the
first three levels.
Other key chemistry terms that you need to know as an anatomy and physiology stu-
dent are
 Isotopes: Atoms of an element that have a different number of neutrons and a dif-
ferent atomic weight than usual. In other words, isotopes are alternate forms of
the same chemical element, so they will always have the same number of pro-
tons as that element, but a different number of neutrons.
 Ions: Because electrons are relatively far from the atomic nucleus, they are most
susceptible to external fields. Atoms that have gained or lost electrons are trans-
formed into ions. Getting an extra electron turns an atom into a negatively
charged ion, or anion, whereas losing an electron creates a positively charged
ion, or cation.
To keep anions and cations straight, think like a compulsive dieter: Gaining is
negative, and losing is positive.
 Acid: A substance that becomes ionized when placed in solution, producing 
positively charged hydrogen ions, H+. An acid is considered a proton donor.
(Remember, atoms always have the same number of electrons as protons. Ions
are produced when an atom gains or loses electrons.)
 Base: A substance that becomes ionized when placed in solution, producing neg-
atively charged hydroxide ions, (OH)–. Bases are referred to as being more alka-
line than acids and are known as proton acceptors.
 pH (potential of hydrogen): A mathematical measure on a scale of 0 to 14 of the
acidity or alkalinity of a substance. A solution is considered neutral, neither acid
nor base, if its pH is exactly 7. (Pure water has a pH of 7.) A substance is basic if
its pH is greater than 7 and acidic if its pH is less than 7. Interestingly, skin is con-
sidered acidic because it has a pH around 5. Blood, on the other hand, is basic
with a pH around 7.4.

Compounding Chemical Reactions
Atoms tend to arrange themselves in the most stable patterns possible, which means
that they have a tendency to complete or fill their outermost electron orbits. They join
with other atoms to do just that. The force that holds atoms together in collections
known as molecules is referred to as a chemical bond. There are two main types and
some secondary types of chemical bonds:
 Ionic bond: This chemical bond (shown in Figure 1-2) involves a transfer of an elec-
tron, so one atom gains an electron while one atom loses an electron. One of the
resulting ions carries a negative charge, and the other ion carries a positive charge.
Because opposite charges attract, the atoms bond together to form a molecule.
 Covalent bond: The most common bond in organic molecules, a covalent bond
(shown in Figure 1-3) involves the sharing of electrons between two atoms. The
pair of shared electrons forms a new orbit that extends around the nuclei of both
atoms, producing a molecule. There are two secondary types of covalent bonds
that are relevant to biology:
• Polar bond: Two atoms connected by a covalent bond may exert different
attractions for the electrons in the bond, producing an unevenly distrib-
uted charge. The result is known as a polar bond, an intermediate case
between ionic and covalent bonding, with one end of the molecule slightly
negatively charged and the other end slightly positively charged. Although
the resulting molecule is neutral, at close distances the uneven charge dis-
tribution can be important. Water is an example of a polar molecule; the
oxygen end has a slight positive charge whereas the hydrogen ends are

slightly negative. Polarity explains why some substances dissolve readily in
water and others do not.
• Hydrogen bond: Because they’re polarized, two adjacent H2O (water) mole-
cules can form a linkage known as a hydrogen bond, where a (electronega-
tive) hydrogen atom of one H2O molecule is electrostatically attracted to the
(electropositive) oxygen atom of an adjacent water molecule. Consequently,
molecules of water join together transiently in a hydrogen-bonded lattice.
Hydrogen bonds have only about 1⁄20 the strength of a covalent bond, yet
even this force is sufficient to affect the structure of water, producing many
of its unique properties, such as high surface tension, specific heat, and
heat of vaporization. Hydrogen bonds are important in many life processes,
such as in replication and defining the shape of DNA molecules.
A chemical reaction is the result of a process that changes the number, the types, or
the arrangement of atoms within a molecule. The substances that go through this
process are called the reactants. The substances produced by the reaction are called
the products.
Chemical reactions are written in the form of an equation, with an arrow indicating the
direction of the reaction. For instance: A + B →AB. This equation translates to: Atom,
ion, or molecule A plus atom, ion, or molecule B yields molecule AB.
When elements combine through chemical reactions, they form compounds. When
compounds contain carbon, they’re called organic compounds. The four families of
organic compounds with important biological functions are
 Carbohydrates: These molecules consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in a
ratio of roughly 1:2:1. If a test question involves identifying a compound as a car-
bohydrate, count the atoms and see if they fit that ratio. Carbohydrates are
formed by the chemical reaction process of concentration, or dehydration synthe-
sis, and broken apart by hydrolysis, the cleavage of a chemical by a reaction that
adds water. There are several subcategories of carbohydrates:
• Monosaccharides, also called monomers or simple sugars, are the building
blocks of larger carbohydrate molecules and are a source of stored energy
(see Figure 1-4). Key monomers include glucose (also known as blood
sugar), fructose, and galactose. These three have the same numbers of
carbon (6), hydrogen (12), and oxygen (6) atoms in each molecule — for-
mally written as C6H12O6 — but the bonding arrangements are different.
Molecules with this kind of relationship are called isomers.
• Disaccharides, or dimers, are sugars formed by the bonding of two mono-
saccharides, including sucrose (table sugar), lactose, and maltose.
• Polysaccharides, or polymers, are formed when many monomers bond into
long, chain-like molecules. Glycogen is the primary polymer in the body; it
breaks down to form glucose, an immediate source of energy for cells.
 Lipids: Commonly known as fats, these molecules contain carbon, hydrogen, and
oxygen, and sometimes nitrogen and phosphorous. Insoluble in water because
they contain a preponderance of nonpolar bonds, lipid molecules have six times
more stored energy than carbohydrate molecules. Upon hydrolysis, however, fats
form glycerol and fatty acids. A fatty acid is a long, straight chain of carbon atoms
with hydrogen atoms attached (see Figure 1-5). If the carbon chain has its full
number of hydrogen atoms, the fatty acid is saturated (examples include butter
and lard). If the carbon chain has less than its full number of hydrogen atoms, the
fatty acid is unsaturated (examples include margarine and vegetable oils). All fatty
acids contain a carboxyl or acid group, –COOH, at the end of the carbon chain.
Phospholipids, as the name suggests, contain phosphorus and often nitrogen and
form a layer in the cell membrane. Steroids are fat-soluble compounds such as
vitamins A or D and hormones that often serve to regulate metabolic processes.
11
Chapter 1: The Chemistry of Life

 Proteins: Among the largest molecules, proteins can reach molecular weights of
some 40 million atomic units. Proteins always contain the four HONC elements —
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon — and sometimes contain phosphorus
and sulfur. The human body builds protein molecules using 20 different kinds of
smaller molecules called amino acids (see Figure 1-6). Each amino acid molecule
is composed of an amino group, –NH2, and a carboxyl group, –COOH, with a
carbon chain between them. Amino acids link together by peptide bonds to form
long molecules called polypeptides, which then assemble into proteins. Examples
of proteins in the body include antibodies, hemoglobin (the red pigment in red
blood cells), and enzymes (catalysts that accelerate reactions in the body).

 Nucleic acids: These long molecules, found primarily in the cell’s nucleus, act as
the body’s genetic blueprint. They’re comprised of smaller building blocks called
nucleotides. Each nucleotide, in turn, is composed of a five-carbon sugar (deoxyri-
bose or ribose), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The nitrogenous
bases in DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) are adenine, thymine, cytosine, and gua-
nine; they always pair off A-T and C-G. In RNA (ribonucleic acid), which occurs in
a single strand, thymine is replaced by uracil, so the nucleotides pair off A-U and
C-G. In 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick published their discovery of the
three-dimensional structure of DNA — a polymer that looks like a ladder twisted
into a coil. They called this structure the double-stranded helix (see Figure 1-7).

Cycling through Life: Metabolism
Metabolism (from the Greek metabole, which means “change”) is the word for the
myriad chemical reactions that happen in the body, particularly as they relate to gen-
erating, storing, and expending energy. All metabolic reactions are either catabolic or
anabolic. Catabolic reactions break food down into energy (memory tip: it can be cata-
strophic when things break down). Anabolic reactions require the expenditure of
energy to build up compounds that the body needs. The chemical alteration of mole-
cules in the cell is referred to as cellular metabolism. Enzymes can be used as catalysts,
accelerating chemical reactions without being changed by the reactions. The mole-
cules that enzymes react with are called substrates.
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a molecule that stores energy in a cell until the cell
needs it. As the tri– prefix implies, a single molecule of ATP is composed of three phos-
phate groups attached to a nitrogenous base of adenine. ATP’s energy is stored in high-
energy bonds that attach the second and third phosphate groups. (The high-energy
bond is symbolized by a wavy line.) When a cell needs energy, it removes one or two of
those phosphate groups, releasing energy and converting ATP into either the two-
phosphate molecule adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or the one-phosphate molecule
adenosine monophosphate (AMP). (You can see ADP and ATP molecules in Figure 1-8.)
Later, through additional metabolic reactions, the second and third phosphate groups
are reattached to adenosine, reforming an ATP molecule until energy is needed again.
Oxidation-reduction reactions are an important pair of reactions that occur in carbohy-
drate, lipid, and protein metabolism (see Figure 1-10). When a substance is oxidized, it
loses electrons and hydrogen ions, removing a hydrogen atom from each molecule.
When a substance is reduced, it gains electrons and hydrogen ions, adding a hydrogen
atom to each molecule. Oxidation and reduction occur together, so whenever one sub-
stance is oxidized, another is reduced. The body uses this chemical-reaction pairing to
transport energy in a process known as the respiratory chain, or the electron transport
chain.

Chapter 1: The Chemistry of Life

Carbohydrate metabolism involves a series of cellular respiration reactions, which are
illustrated in Figure 1-9. All food carbohydrates are eventually broken down into glu-
cose; therefore, carbohydrate metabolism is really glucose metabolism. Glucose
metabolism produces energy that is then stored in ATP molecules. The oxidation
process in which energy is released from molecules, such as glucose, and transferred
to other molecules is called cellular respiration. It occurs in every cell in the body and
it is the cell’s source of energy. The complete oxidation of one molecule of glucose will
produce 38 molecules of ATP. It occurs in three stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and
the electron transport chain:
1. Glycolysis
From the Greek glyco (sugar) and lysis (breakdown), this is the first stage of both
aerobic (with oxygen) and anaerobic (without oxygen) respiration. Using energy
from two molecules of ATP and two molecules of NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine 
di-nucleotide), glycolysis uses a process called phosphorylation to convert a mol-
ecule of six-carbon glucose — the smallest molecule that the digestive system
can produce during the breakdown of a carbohydrate — into two molecules of
three-carbon pyruvic acid or pyruvate, as well as four ATP molecules and two
molecules of NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). Taking place in the cell’s
cytoplasm (see Chapter 2), glycolysis doesn’t require oxygen to occur. The pyru-
vate and NADH move into the cell’s mitochondria (detailed in Chapter 2), where
an aerobic (with oxygen) process converts them into ATP.
2. Krebs cycle
Also known as the tricarboxylic acid cycle or citric acid cycle, this series of energy-
producing chemical reactions begins in the mitochondria after pyruvate arrives
from glycolysis. Before the Krebs cycle can begin, the pyruvate loses a carbon
dioxide group to form acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA). Then acetyl CoA com-
bines with a four-carbon molecule (oxaloacetic acid, or OAA) to form a six-
carbon citric acid molecule that then enters the Krebs cycle. The CoA is released
intact to bind with another acetyl group. During the conversion, two carbon
atoms are lost as carbon dioxide and energy is released. One ATP molecule is
produced each time an acetyl CoA molecule is split. The cycle goes through
eight steps, rearranging the atoms of citric acid to produce different intermedi-
ate molecules called keto acids. The acetic acid is broken apart by carbon (or
decarboxylated) and oxidized, generating three molecules of NADH, one molecule
of FADH2 (flavin adenine dinucleotide), and one molecule of ATP. The energy can
be transported to the electron transport chain and used to produce more mole-
cules of ATP. OAA is regenerated to get the next cycle going, and carbon dioxide
produced during this cycle is exhaled from the lungs.
3. Electron transport chain
The electron transport chain is a series of energy compounds attached to the
inner mitochondrial membrane. The electron molecules in the chain are called
cytochromes. These electron-transferring proteins contain a heme, or iron, group.
Hydrogen from oxidized food sources attaches to coenzymes that in turn com-
bine with molecular oxygen. The energy released during these reactions is used
to attach inorganic phosphate groups to ADP and form ATP molecules.
Pairs of electrons transferred to NAD+ go through the electron transport process
and produce three molecules of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. Pairs of elec-
trons transferred to FAD enter the electron transport after the first phosphoryla-
tion and yield only two molecules of ATP. Oxidative phosphorylation is
important because it makes energy available in a form the cells can use.
At the end of the chain, two positively charged hydrogen molecules combine
with two electrons and an atom of oxygen to form water. The final molecule to
which electrons are passed is oxygen. Electrons are transferred from one mole-
cule to the next, producing ATP molecules.
16
Part I: Building Blocks of the Body 

Lipid metabolism only requires portions of the processes involved in carbohydrate
metabolism. Lipids contain about 99 percent of the body’s stored energy and can be
digested at mealtime, but as people who complain about fats going “straight to their
hips” can attest, lipids are more inclined to be stored in adipose tissue — the stuff gen-
erally identified with body fat. When the body is ready to metabolize lipids, a series of
catabolic reactions breaks apart two carbon atoms from the end of a fatty acid chain
to form acetyl CoA, which then enters the Krebs cycle to produce ATP. Those reactions
continue to strip two carbon atoms at a time until the entire fatty acid chain is con-
verted into acetyl CoA.

Chapter 1: The Chemistry of Life

Protein metabolism focuses on producing the amino acids needed for synthesis of pro-
tein molecules within the body. But in addition to the energy released into the electron
transport chain during protein metabolism, the process also produces byproducts,
such as ammonia and keto acid. Energy is released entering the electron transport
chain. The liver converts the ammonia into urea, which the blood carries to the
kidneys for elimination. The keto acid enters the Krebs cycle and is converted into
pyruvic acids to produce ATP.
One last thing: That severe soreness and fatigue you feel in your muscles after strenu-
ous exercise is the result of lactic acid buildup during anaerobic respiration. Glycolysis
continues because it doesn’t need oxygen to take place. But glycolysis does need a
steady supply of NAD+, which usually comes from the oxygen-dependent electron
transport chain converting NADH back into NAD+. In its absence, the body begins a
process called lactic acid fermentation, in which one molecule of pyruvate combines
with one molecule of NADH to produce a molecule of NAD+ plus a molecule of the toxic
byproduct lactic acid.

Answers to Questions on Life’s Chemistry
The following are answers to the practice questions presented in this chapter.
a
The four key elements that make up most living matter are c. hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and
carbon. We arranged them so that they spell HNOC instead of HONC, but you get the idea,
right?
b
Among the subatomic particles in an atom, the two that have equal weight are b. protons and
neutrons. That’s why you add them together to determine atomic weight, or mass.
c
For an atom with an atomic number of 19 and an atomic weight of 39, the total number of neu-
trons is b. 20. The atomic number of 19 is the same as the number of protons. The atomic
weight of 39 tells you the number of protons plus the number of neutrons: 39 – 19 = 20.
d
Element X has 14 electrons. How many electrons are in its outermost shell? d. 4. The first orbit
has the maximum two electrons, and the second orbit has the maximum eight electrons. That
makes ten electrons in the first two orbits, leaving only four for the third, outermost orbit.
e
A substance that, in water, separates into a large number of hydroxide ions is d. a strong base.
The more hydroxide ions there are, the stronger the base is.
f
A hydroxyl, or hydroxide, ion has an oxygen atom c. and a hydrogen atom and an extra elec-
tron. The first few letters of the word “hydroxide” are a dead giveaway that there’s a hydrogen
atom in there; plus hydroxide ions are negatively charged, which calls for that extra electron.
g–l
Different isotopes of the same element have the same number of 7. electrons/protons
and 8. protons/electrons but different numbers of 9. neutrons. Isotopes also have different
atomic 10. weights. An atom that gains or loses an electron is called an 11. ion. If an atom 
loses an electron, it carries a 12. positive charge.
m
Bonds formed as a result of sharing one or more electrons between atoms are b. covalent
bonds. If the atoms had gained or lost electrons, it would be an ionic bond, but here they’re
sharing — valiantly cohabiting, if you will.
n
The formation of chemical bonds is based on the tendency of an atom to b. fill its outermost
energy level. This is true whether an atom fills its outer shell by sharing, gaining, or losing 
electrons.
o
Which of the following statements is not true of DNA? c. DNA contains the nitrogenous bases
adenine, thymine, guanine, cytosine, and uracil. This statement is false because only RNA
contains uracil.
p
Polysaccharides c. are complex carbohydrates. The root poly– means “many,” which you can
interpret as “complex.” The root mono– means “one,” which you can interpret as “simple.”
q
Amino acids are the building blocks of b. proteins. Being such large molecules, proteins need
to be built from complex molecules to begin with.
r
A molecule of glucose is broken down to pyruvic acid by a. glycolysis. Remember that glucose
must become pyruvic acid before it enters the Krebs cycle.
s
Pyruvic acid enters a mitochondrion and is converted into b. acetyl CoA. Don’t forget that the
Krebs cycle, during which pyruvate is broken down, occurs in the mitochondrion.
21
Chapter 1: The Chemistry of Life

t
A molecule of glucose can be converted into how many ATP molecules? c. 38. Two net mole-
cules of ATP come from glycolysis, two molecules come from the Krebs cycle, and the electron
transport chain churns out 34.
u
The part of metabolism that involves creating compounds the body needs is called c. an ana-
bolic reaction. Breaking things down is a catabolic reaction, but building them up is anabolic.
v
Metabolic processes that don’t require oxygen are called a. anaerobic. Recall that during aero-
bic exercise, you’re trying to circulate oxygen to your muscles. So anaerobic is the opposite.
w
Which two respiration processes take place in the cell’s mitochondria? c. The Krebs cycle 
and the electron transport chain. The other answers are incorrect because glycolysis takes
place in the cytoplasm, and anaerobic respiration isn’t one of the three cellular respiration
processes.
x
Coal is to electricity as glucose is to a. ATP. Just as you can’t power a lamp with a lump of coal,
cells can’t use glucose directly. You need to turn the coal into electricity, and cells need to turn
the glucose into ATP.
y
The primary products of protein metabolism are b. amino acids. Although some ATP comes
from metabolizing proteins, the body primarily needs to get amino acids from any protein that’s
consumed.
A
Fats are metabolized primarily during d. the Krebs cycle. That’s the only process that can use
the acetyl CoA supplied by lipids.

ytology, from the Greek word cyto, which means “cell,” is the study of cells. Every living
thing has cells, but not all living things have the same kinds of cells. Eukaryotes like
humans (and all other organisms besides bacteria and viruses) have eukaryotic cells, each
of which has a defined nucleus that controls and directs the cell’s activities, and cytosol,
fluid material found in the gel-like cytoplasm that fills most of the cell. Plant cells have
fibrous cell walls; animal cells do not, making do instead with a semipermeable cell mem-
brane, which sometimes is called a plasma membrane or the plasmalemma. Because human
cells don’t have cell walls, they look like gel-filled sacs with nuclei and tiny parts called
organelles nestled inside when viewed through an electron microscope.
In this chapter, we help you sort out what makes up a cell, what all those tiny parts do, and
how cells act as protein-manufacturing plants to support life’s activities. We then take a quick
look at an individual cell’s life cycle.
Gaining Admission: The Cell Membrane
Think of it as a gatekeeper, guardian, or border guard. Despite being only 6 to 10 nanometers
thick and visible only through an electron microscope, the cell membrane keeps the cell’s
cytoplasm in place and lets only select materials enter and depart the cell as needed. This
semipermeability, or selective permeability, is a result of a double layer (bilayer) of phospho-
lipid molecules interspersed with protein molecules. The outer surface of each layer is made
up of tightly packed hydrophilic (or water-loving) polar heads. Inside, between the two layers,
you find hydrophobic (or water-fearing) nonpolar tails consisting of fatty acid chains.
Cholesterol molecules between the phosphate layers give the otherwise elastic membrane
stability and make it less permeable to water-soluble substances. Both cytoplasm and the
matrix, the material in which cells lie, are primarily water. The polar heads electrostatically
attract polarized water molecules while the nonpolar tails lie between the layers, shielded
from water and creating a dry middle layer. The membrane’s interior is made up of oily fatty
acid molecules that are electrostatically symmetric, or nonpolarized. Lipid-soluble molecules
can pass through this layer, but water-soluble molecules such as amino acids, sugars, and
proteins cannot. Because phospholipids have both polar and nonpolar regions, they’re also
called amphipathic molecules.

The cell membrane is designed to hold the cell together and to isolate it as a distinct
functional unit of protoplasm. Although it can spontaneously repair minor tears,
severe damage to the membrane will cause the cell to disintegrate. The membrane is
picky about which molecules it lets in or out. It allows movement across its barrier by
diffusion, osmosis, or active transport as follows:
 Diffusion: This is a spontaneous spreading, or migration, of molecules or other
particles from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration
until equilibrium occurs. When equilibrium is reached, diffusion continues, but
the flow is equal in both directions. Diffusion is a natural phenomenon that
behaves in much the same way as Brownian motion; both phenomena are based
on the fact that all molecules possess kinetic energy. They move randomly at
high speeds, colliding with one another, changing directions, and moving away
from areas of greatest concentration to areas of lower concentration. The rate of
movement depends on the size and temperature of the molecule; the smaller and
warmer the molecule is, the faster it moves.
Diffusion is one form of passive transport that doesn’t require the expenditure of
cellular energy. A molecule can diffuse passively through the cell membrane if
it’s lipid-soluble, uncharged, and very small, or if it can be assisted by a carrier
molecule. The unassisted diffusion of very small or lipid-soluble particles is
called simple diffusion. The assisted process is known as facilitated diffusion. The
cell membrane allows nonpolar molecules (those that don’t readily bond with
water) to flow from an area where they’re highly concentrated to an area where
they’re less concentrated. Embedded with the hydrophilic heads in the outer
layer are protein molecules called channel proteins that create diffusion-friendly
openings for the molecules to diffuse through.
 Osmosis: This form of passive transport is similar to diffusion and involves a sol-
vent moving through a selectively permeable or semipermeable membrane from
an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. Solutions are
composed of two parts: a solvent and a solute. The solvent is the liquid in which
a substance is dissolved; water is called the universal solvent because more
materials dissolve in it than in any other liquid. A solute is the substance dis-
solved in the solvent. Typically, a cell contains a roughly 1 percent saline solu-
tion — in other words, 1 percent salt (solute) and 99 percent water (solvent).
Water is a polar molecule that will not pass through the lipid bilayer; however, it
is small enough to move through the pores of most cell membranes. Osmosis
occurs when there’s a difference in molecular concentration of water on the two
sides of the membrane. The membrane allows the solvent (water) to move
through but keeps out the particles dissolved in the water.
Transport by osmosis is affected by the concentration of solute (the number of
particles) in the water. One molecule or one ion of solute displaces one molecule
of water. Osmolarity is the term used to describe the concentration of solute par-
ticles per liter. As water diffuses into a cell, hydrostatic pressure builds within
the cell. Eventually, the pressure within the cell becomes equal to, and is bal-
anced by, the osmotic pressure outside.
• An isotonic solution has the same concentration of solute and solvent as
found inside a cell, so a cell placed in isotonic solution — typically 1 per-
cent saline solution for humans — experiences equal flow of water into and
out of the cell, maintaining equilibrium.
• A hypotonic solution has less solute and higher water potential than inside
the cell. An example is 100 percent distilled water, which has less solute
than what’s inside the cell. Therefore, if a human cell is placed in a hypo-
tonic solution, molecules diffuse down the concentration gradient until the
cell’s membrane bursts.
24
Part I: Building Blocks of the Body 

• A hypertonic solution has more solute and lower water potential than inside
the cell. So the membrane of a human cell placed in 10 percent saline solu-
tion (10 percent salt and 90 percent water) would let water flow out of the
cell (from higher concentration inside to lower concentration outside),
therefore shrinking it.
 Active transport: This movement occurs across a semipermeable membrane
against the normal concentration gradient, moving from the area of lower con-
centration to the area of higher concentration and requiring an expenditure of
energy released from an ATP molecule (as discussed in Chapter 1). Embedded
with the hydrophilic heads in the outer layer of the membrane are protein mole-
cules able to detect and move compounds through the membrane. These carrier
or transport proteins interact with the passenger molecules and use the ATP-sup-
plied energy to move them against the gradient. The carrier molecules combine
with the transport molecules — most importantly amino acids and ions — to
pump them against their concentration gradients.
Active transport lets cells obtain nutrients that can’t pass through the mem-
brane by other means. In addition, there are secondary active transport
processes that are similar to diffusion but instead use imbalances in electrostatic
forces to move molecules across the membrane.

Chapter 2: The Cell: Life’s Basic Building Block

Aiming for the Nucleus
The cell nucleus is the largest cellular organelle and the first to be discovered by scien-
tists. On average, it accounts for about 10 percent of the total volume of the cell, and it
holds a complete set of genes.
The outermost part of this organelle is the nuclear envelope, which is composed of a
double-membrane barrier, each membrane of which is made up of a phospholipid
bilayer. Between the two membranes is a fluid-filled space called the perinuclear cis-
terna. The two layers fuse to form a selectively permeable barrier, but large pores
allow relatively free movement of molecules and ions, including large protein mole-
cules. Intermediate filaments lining the surface of the nuclear envelope make up the
nuclear lamina, which functions in the disassembly and reassembly of the nuclear
membrane during mitosis and binds the membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum.
The nucleus also contains nucleoplasm, a clear viscous material that forms the matrix
in which the organelles of the nucleus are embedded. 
DNA is packaged inside the nucleus in structures called chromatin, or chromatin 
networks. During cell division, the chromatin contracts, forming chromosomes.
Chromosomes contain a DNA molecule encoded with the genetic information needed
to direct the cell’s activities. The most prominent subnuclear body is the nucleolus, a
small spherical body that stores RNA molecules and produces ribosomes, which are
exported to the cytoplasm where they translate messenger RNA (mRNA).

Looking Inside: Organelles 
and Their Functions
Molecules that pass muster with the cell membrane enter the cytoplasm, a mixture of
macromolecules such as proteins and RNA and small organic molecules such as glu-
cose, ions, and water. Because of the various materials in the cytoplasm, it’s a colloid,
or mixture of phases, that alternates from a sol (a liquid colloid with solid suspended
in it) to a gel (a colloid in which the dispersed phase combines with the medium to
form a semisolid material). The fluid part of the cytoplasm, called the cytosol, has a dif-
fering consistency based on changes in temperature, molecular concentrations, pH,
pressure, and agitation.
Within the cytoplasm lies a network of fibrous proteins collectively referred to as the
cytoskeleton. It’s not rigid or permanent but changing and shifting according to the
activity of the cell. The cytoskeleton maintains the cell’s shape, enables it to move,
anchors its organelles, and directs the flow of the cytoplasm. The fibrous proteins that
make up the cytoskeleton include the following:
 Microfilaments, rodlike structures about 5 to 8 nanometers wide that consist of a
stacked protein called actin, the most abundant protein in eukaryotic cells. They
provide structural support and have a role in cell and organelle movement as
well as in cell division.
 Intermediate filaments, the strongest and most stable part of the cytoskeleton.
They average about 10 nanometers wide and consist of interlocking proteins,
including keratin, that chiefly are involved in maintaining cell integrity and resist-
ing pulling forces on the cell.
 Hollow microtubules about 25 nanometers in diameter that are made of the pro-
tein tubulin and grow with one end embedded in the centrosome near the cell’s
nucleus. Like microfilaments, these components of cilia, flagella, and centrioles
provide structural support and have a role in cell and organelle movement as
well as in cell division.
Organelles, literally translated as “little organs,” are nestled inside the cytoplasm
(except for the two organelles that move, cilia and flagellum, which are found on the
cell’s exterior). Each organelle has different responsibilities for producing materials
used elsewhere in the cell or body. Here are the key organelles and what they do:
 Centrosome: Microtubules sprout from this structure, which is located next to
the nucleus and is composed of two centrioles — arrays of microtubules — that
function in separating genetic material during cell division.
 Cilia: These are short, hair-like cytoplasmic projections on the external surface of
the cell. In multicellular animals, including humans, cilia move materials over the
surface of the cell. In some single-celled organisms, they’re used for locomotion.
27
Chapter 2: The Cell: Life’s Basic Building Block

 Endoplasmic reticulum (ER): This organelle makes direct contact with the cell
nucleus and functions in the transport of materials such as proteins and RNA
molecules. Composed of membrane-bound canals and cavities that extend from
the nuclear membrane to the cell membrane, the ER is the site of lipid and pro-
tein synthesis. The two types of ER are rough, which is dotted with ribosomes on
the outer surface; and smooth, which has no ribosomes on the surface.
 Flagellum: This whip-like cytoplasmic projection lies on the cell’s exterior sur-
face. Found in humans primarily on sperm cells, it’s used for locomotion.
 Golgi apparatus (or body): This organelle consists of a stack of flattened sacs
with membranes that connect with those of the endoplasmic reticulum. Located
near the nucleus, it functions in the storage, modification, and packaging of pro-
teins for secretion to various destinations within the cell.
 Lysosome: A tiny, membranous sac containing acids and digestive enzymes, the
lysosome breaks down large food molecules such as proteins, carbohydrates,
and nucleic acids into materials that the cell can use. It destroys foreign particles
in the cell and helps to remove nonfunctioning structures from the cell.
 Mitochondrion: Called the powerhouse of the cell, this rod-shaped organelle
consists of two membranes — a smooth outer membrane, and an invaginated
(folded inward) inner membrane that divides the organelle into compartments.
The inward-folding crevices of the inner membrane are called cristae. The mito-
chondrion provides critical functions in cell respiration, including oxidizing
(breaking down) food molecules and releasing energy that is stored in ATP mole-
cules in the mitochondrion. This energy is used to accelerate chemical reactions
in the cell, which we cover in Chapter 1.
 Ribosomes: These roughly 25-nanometer structures may be found along the
endoplasmic reticulum or floating free in the cytoplasm. Composed of 60 percent
RNA and 40 percent protein, they translate the genetic information on RNA mole-
cules to synthesize, or produce, a protein molecule.
 Vacuoles: More commonly found in plant cells, these open spaces in the cyto-
plasm sometimes carry materials to the cell membrane for discharge to the out-
side of the cell. In animal cells, food vacuoles are membranous sacs formed
when food masses are pinched-off from the cell membrane and passed into the
cytoplasm of the cell. This process, called endocytosis (from the Greek words
meaning “within the cell”), requires energy to move large masses of material into
the cell. Vacuoles also help to remove structural debris, isolate harmful materi-
als, and export unwanted substances from the cell.

Putting Together New Proteins
Proteins are essential building blocks for all living systems, which helps explain why
the word is derived from the Greek term proteios, meaning “holding first place.” Cells
use proteins to perform a variety of functions, including providing structural support
and catalyzing reactions. Cells synthesize proteins through a systematic procedure
that begins in the nucleus when the gene code for a certain protein is transcribed from
the cell’s DNA into messenger RNA, or mRNA. The mRNA moves through nuclear pores
to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where ribosomes translate the message one
codon of three nucleotides, or base pairs, at a time. The ribosome uses transfer RNA, or
tRNA, to fetch each required amino acid and then link them together through peptide
bonds, also known as amide bonds, to form proteins (see Figure 2-2 for details).
Don’t let the labels confuse you. Proteins are chains of amino acids (usually very long
chains of at least 100 acids). Enzymes, used to catalyze reactions, also are chains of
amino acids and therefore also are categorized as proteins. Polypeptides, or simply
peptides, are shorter chains of amino acids used to bond larger protein molecules, but
they also can be regarded as proteins. Both antibodies and hormones also are pro-
teins, along with almost everything else in the body — hair, muscle, cartilage, and so
on. Even the four basic blood types — A, B, AB, and O — are differentiated by the pro-
teins found in each.

Cycling Along: Grow, Rest, Divide, Die
The cell life cycle, usually referred to simply as the cell cycle or the CDC (cell division
cycle), extends from the beginning of one cell division to the beginning of the next
division. The human body produces new cells every day to replace those that are
damaged or worn out.
33
Chapter 2: The Cell: Life’s Basic Building Block

The cell cycle is divided into two distinct phases:
 Interphase: Sometimes also called the resting stage, that label is a misnomer
because the cell is actively growing and carrying out its normal metabolic func-
tions as well as preparing for cell division.
 Mitosis: The period of cell division that produces new cells. (We cover this phase
in detail in Chapter 3.)
New cells are produced for growth and to replace the billions of cells that stop function-
ing in the adult human body every day. Some cells, like blood and skin cells, are contin-
ually dividing because they have very short life cycles, sometimes only hours. Other
cells, such as specialized muscle cells and certain nerve cells, may never divide at all.
49. Human cells can live
a. A few hours
b. A few days
c. Indefinitely
d. All of the above
50. The cell cycle is measured
a. By the number of times a cell divides
b. From the beginning to the end of one cell division
c. From the beginning of one cell division to the beginning of the next

Answers to Questions on the Cell
The following are answers to the practice questions presented in this chapter.
a–c
The lipid bilayer structure of the cell membrane is made possible because phospholipid mole-
cules contain two distinct regions: The 1. hydrophilic region is attracted to water, and the 
2. hydrophobic region is repelled by water. Because it has both polar and nonpolar regions, a
phospholipid is classified as a(n) 3. amphipathic molecule.
d
The movement of water molecules through a semipermeable membrane is known as c. osmosis.
Why not diffusion? Because diffusion has to do with the passive transport of substances other
than water.
e
A solution having a greater concentration of water than exists in the cell is said to be 
b. hypotonic.
The prefix hypo refers to under or below normal. The prefix hyper refers to excess, or above
normal. Someone who has been out in the cold too long suffers hypothermia — literally insuffi-
cient heat. So a solution, or tonic, with very few particles would be hypotonic.
f
Injecting a large quantity of distilled water into a human’s veins would cause many red blood
cells to a. swell and burst. With more water outside the cell than inside, the membrane would
allow osmosis to continue past the breaking point.
g
The cell membrane does not function c. in the production of energy. Sometimes it may use
energy in the form of ATP, but the cell membrane isn’t involved directly in the production of
energy.
h
The only organelle with direct links to the nucleus is the a. endoplasmic reticulum. The
nuclear lamina, or intermediate filaments, link the ER with the nucleus.
i
DNA is packaged within b. chromosomes. None of the other answer options contains a full
package of DNA.
j
The nucleolus d. assembles ribosomes. It’s not just a coincidence that the nucleolus sits at the
heart of the genetic powerhouse.
k
This cigar-shaped organelle produces energy through aerobic respiration. b. Mitochondrion.
None of the other options are involved in cellular respiration or energy production
l
The most abundant protein in human cells is a. actin. It makes sense that the protein making
up much of the cytoskeleton is the most abundant because the cytoskeleton accounts for up to
50 percent of the cell’s volume.
m
Which organelle gets to take out the cellular trash? c. Vacuole
When it’s time to clean house, you pull out the vacuum. Cells pull out the vacuoles.
n
The very small organelle responsible for protein synthesis (making proteins) is the 
a. ribosome.

E
ver had so many places to be that you wished you could just divide yourself in two?
Your cells already do that. Cell division is how one “mother” cell becomes two identical
twin “daughter” cells. Cell division takes place for several reasons:
 Growth: Multicellular organisms, humans included, each start out as a single cell —
the fertilized egg. That one cell divides (and divides and divides), eventually becoming
an entire complex being.
 Injury repair: Uninjured cells in the areas surrounding damaged tissue divide to
replace those that have been destroyed.
 Replacement: Cells eventually wear out and cease to function. Their younger, more
functional neighbors divide to take up the slack.
 Asexual reproduction: No, human cells don’t do this. Only single-celled organisms do.
Cell division occurs over the course of two processes: mitosis, which is when the chromo-
somes within the cell’s nucleus duplicate to form two daughter nuclei; and cytokinesis, which
takes place when the cell’s cytoplasm divides to surround the two newly formed nuclei.
Although cell division breaks down into several stages, there are no pauses from one step to
another. Cell division as a whole is called mitosis because most of the changes occur during
that process. Cytokinesis doesn’t start until later. But mitosis and cytokinesis do end together.
Keep in mind: Cells are living things, so they mature, reproduce, and die. In this chapter, we
review the cell cycle (as mitosis also is known), and you get plenty of practice figuring out
what happens when and why.
The Mitotic Process
It may look like cells are living out their useful lives simply doing whatever specialized jobs
they do best, but in truth mitosis is a continuous process. When the cell isn’t actively split-
ting itself in two, it’s actively preparing to do so. DNA and centrioles are being replicated, 
and the cell is bulking up on cytoplasm to make sure there’s enough for both daughter cells.
Mitosis may look like a waiting game, but there’s plenty going on behind the scenes.

Waiting for action: Interphase
Interphase is the period when the cell isn’t dividing. It begins when the new cells 
are done forming and ends when the cell prepares to divide. Although it’s also called 
a “resting stage,” there’s constant activity in the cell during interphase.
Interphase is divided into subphases, each of which lasts anywhere from a few hours
for those cells that divide frequently to days or years for those cells that divide less
frequently (nerve cells, for example, can spend decades in interphase). The sub-
phases are as follows:
 G1, which stands for “gap” or “growth.” During G1, the cell creates its organelles,
begins metabolism, grows, and synthesizes proteins.
 S, which stands for “synthesis.” DNA synthesis or replication occurs during this
subphase. The single double-helix DNA molecule inside the cell’s nucleus
becomes two new “sister” chromatids, and the centrosome is duplicated.
 G2, which stands for “gap.” Enzymes and proteins needed for cell division are
produced during this subphase.
Sorting out the parts: Prophase
As the first active phase of mitosis, prophase is when structures in the cell’s nucleus
begin to disappear, including the nuclear membrane (or envelope), nucleoplasm, and
nucleoli. The two centrioles that have formed from the centrosome push apart to
opposite ends of the nucleus. Using protein filaments, they form poles and a mitotic
spindle between them as well as asters (or astral rays) which radiate from the poles
into the cytoplasm. At the same time, the chromatin threads (or chromonemata)
shorten and coil, forming visible chromosomes. The chromosomes divide into chro-
matids that remain attached at an area called the centromere, which produces micro-
tubules called kinetochore fibers. These interact with the spindle to assure that each
daughter cell ultimately has a full set of chromosomes. The chromatids start to
migrate toward the equatorial plane, an imaginary line between the poles.
Dividing at the equator: Metaphase
After the chromosomes are lined up and attached along the cell’s newly formed equa-
tor, metaphase officially debuts. The nucleus itself is gone. The chromatids line up
exactly along the center line of the cell (or the equatorial plane), attaching to the
mitotic spindle by the centromere. The centromere also is attached by microtubules to
opposite poles of the cell.
Packing up to move out: Anaphase
In anaphase, the centromeres split, separating the duplicate chromatids and forming
two chromosomes. The spindles attached to the divided centromeres shorten, pulling
the chromosomes toward the opposite poles. The cell begins to elongate. In late
anaphase, as the chromosomes approach the poles, a slight furrow develops in the
cytoplasm, showing where cytokinesis will eventually take place.

Chapter 3: Divide and Conquer: Cellular Mitosis
Pinching off: Telophase
Telophase occurs as the cell nears the end of division. The spindles and asters of early
mitosis disappear, and each newly forming cell begins to synthesize its own structure.
New nuclear membranes enclose the separated chromosomes. The coiled chromo-
somes unwind, becoming chromonemata once again. There’s a more pronounced
pinching, or furrowing, of the cytoplasm into two separate bodies, but there continues
to be only one cell.
Splitting up: Cytokinesis
Cytokinesis means it’s time for the big break-up. The furrow intended to divide the
newly formed sister nuclei at last gets to finish the job. It migrates inward until it
cleaves the single, altered cell into two new cells. Each new cell is smaller and contains
less cytoplasm than the mother cell, but the daughter cells are genetically identical to
each other and to the original mother cell.

What Can Go Wrong
With the millions upon millions of cell divisions that happen in the human body, it’s
not surprising that sometimes things go wrong. An error during mitosis is called a
mutation. One kind of mutation is nondisjunction, or a failure to separate. In this muta-
tion, newly formed chromosomes don’t quite divide, leaving one daughter cell with
one more chromosome than normal and the other daughter cell one chromosome shy
of a full complement. Down’s syndrome is an example of what happens when nondis-
junction occurs. A normal human cell has 46 chromosomes, but that of a Down’s suf-
ferer has 47.
Mitosis can also end up on fast-forward. Accelerated mitosis can lead to the formation
of a tumor, also called a neoplasm. The rate of division usually restricts itself to replac-
ing worn out or injured cells, but with accelerated mitosis, the cells don’t know when
to stop dividing.

h, what tangled webs we weave! As the chapter title says, histology is the study of tis-
sues, but you may be surprised to find out that the Greek histo doesn’t translate as
“tissue” but instead as “web.” It’s a logical next step after reviewing the cell and cellular
division to take a look at what happens when groups of similar cells “web” together to form
tissues. The four different types of tissue in the body are as follows:
 Epithelial, or skin, tissue (from the Greek epi– for “over” or “outer”)
 Connective tissue
 Muscle tissue
 Nerve tissue
In this chapter, you find a quick review of the basics of each of these types of tissues along
with practice questions to test your knowledge of them.
Getting Under Your Skin
Perhaps because of its unique job of both protecting the outer body and lining internal
organs, epithelial tissue comes in more varieties than any other tissue.
Epithelial tissues, which generally are arranged in sheets or tubes of tightly-packed cells,
always have a free, or apical, surface that can be exposed to the air or to fluid. That free sur-
face also can be covered by additional layers of epithelial tissue. But whether it’s layered or
not, each epithelial cell has polarity (a top and a bottom), and all but one side of the cell is
tucked snugly against neighboring cells. The apical side sometimes has cytoplasmic projec-
tions such as cilia, hair-like growths that can move material over the cell’s surface, or
microvilli, finger-like projections that increase the cell’s surface area for absorption. Opposite
the apical side is the basal side (think basement), which typically attaches to some kind of
connective tissue.
Epithelial tissue serves several key functions, including the following:
 Protection: Skin protects vulnerable structures or tissues deeper in the body.
 Barrier: Epithelial tissues prevent foreign materials from getting inside the body.

 Sensation: Sensory nerve endings embedded in epithelial tissue connect the
body with outside stimuli.
 Secretion: Epithelial tissue in glands can be specialized to secrete enzymes, hor-
mones, and fluids.
Single-layer epithelial tissue is classified as simple. Tissue with more than one layer is
called stratified. Epithelial tissues also can be classified according to shape: Squamous
is a thin, flat cell; cuboidal is, as the name implies, equal in height and width and
shaped like a cube; and columnar cells are taller than they are wide.
Following are the ten primary types of epithelial tissues:
 Simple squamous epithelium: Looking a bit like rolling tundra, this flat layer of
scale-like cells is useful in diffusion, secretion, or absorption. Each cell nucleus is
centrally located and is round or oval. Simple squamous epithelium lines the
lungs’ air sacs where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged; forms blood fil-
ters inside the kidneys; and lines the inner surface of the eardrum, known as the
tympanic membrane.
 Simple cuboidal epithelium: These cube-shaped cells, found in a single layer
that looks like a microscopic mattress, have centrally located nuclei that usually
are round. Found in the ovaries, kidneys, and some glands, this type of epithe-
lium functions in secretion, absorption, and tube formation.
 Simple columnar epithelium: These densely packed cells are taller than they are
wide, with nuclei located near the base of each cell. Found lining the digestive
tract from the stomach to the anal canal, this type of epithelium functions in
secretion and absorption.
 Simple columnar ciliated epithelium: A close cousin to simple columnar epithe-
lium, this type of tissue has hair-like cilia that can move mucus and other sub-
stances across the cell. It’s found lining the small respiratory tubes.
 Pseudostratified columnar epithelium: Pay attention to the prefix pseudo– here,
which means “false.” It may look multilayered because the cells’ nuclei are scat-
tered at different levels, but it’s not. This type of epithelium is found in the sali-
vary glands and some segments of the male reproductive system, including the
urethra.
 Pseudostratified columnar ciliated epithelium: Another variation on a theme,
this tissue is nearly identical to pseudostratified columnar epithelium. The differ-
ence is that this tissue’s free surface has cilia, making it ideal for lining air pas-
sages because the cilia’s uniform waving action causes a thin layer of mucus to
move in one direction — toward the throat and mouth — and trap dust particles.
 Stratified squamous epithelium: This tissue is the stuff you see everyday —
your outer skin, or epidermis. This multilayered tissue has squamous cells on
the outside plus deeper layers of cuboidal or columnar cells. Found in areas
where the outer cell layer is constantly worn away, this type of epithelium regen-
erates its surface layer with cells from lower layers.
 Stratified cuboidal epithelium: This multilayered epithelium can be found in
sweat glands, conjunctiva of the eye, and the male urethra. Its function is prima-
rily protection.
 Stratified columnar epithelium: Also multilayered, this epithelium is found
lining parts of the male urethra, excretory ducts of glands, and some small areas
of the anal mucus membrane.
 Stratified transitional epithelium: This epithelium is referred to as transitional
because its cells can shape-shift from cubes to squamous-like flat surfaces and
back again. Found lining the bladder, the cells flatten out to make room for urine.

Part I: Building Blocks of the Body 

strength of connective tissue comes from a fibrous protein called collagen. All connec-
tive tissues contain a varying mix of collagen, elastic, and reticular fibers.
Following are the primary types of connective tissue:
 Areolar, or loose, tissue: This tissue exists between and around almost every-
thing in the body to bind structures together and fill space. It’s made up of wavy
ribbons called collagenous protein fibers, cylindrical threads called elastic fibers,
and amorphous ground substance, a semisolid gel. Various cells including lympho-
cytes, fibroblasts, fat cells, and mast cells are scattered throughout the ground
substance (see Figure 4-2).
 Dense regular connective tissue: Made up of parallel, densely packed bands or
sheets of fibers (see Figure 4-2), this type of tissue is found in tendons as bundles
of collagenous fibers attaching muscles to bone and in ligaments as bundles of
elastic fibers extending from bone to bone, surrounding a joint, and anchoring
organs. It usually resists force in just two directions.
Illustration by Imagineering Media Services Inc.
 Dense irregular connective tissue: Also known as dense fibrous connective
tissue, it consists of fibers that twist and weave around each other, forming a
thick tissue that can withstand stresses applied from any direction. This tissue
makes up the strong inner skin layer called the dermis as well as the outer cap-
sule of organs like the kidney and the spleen.
 Adipose tissue: Composed of fat cells, this tissue forms padding around internal
organs, reduces heat loss through the skin, and stores energy in fat molecules
called triglycerides. Fat molecules fill the cells, forcing the nuclei against the cell
membranes and giving them a ring-like shape. Adipose has an intracellular matrix
rather than an extracellular matrix.
 Reticular tissue: Literally translated as “web-like” or “net-like,” reticular tissue is
made up of slender, branching reticular fibers with reticular cells overlaying
them. Its intricate structure makes it a particularly good filter, which explains
why it’s found inside the spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow.

Chapter 4: The Study of Tissues: Histology

 Cartilage: These firm but flexible tissues, made up of collagen and elastic fibers,
have no blood vessels or nerve cells (a state called non-vascular or avascular).
Cartilage contains openings called lacunae (from the Latin word lacus for “lake”
or “pit”) that enclose mature cells called chondrocytes, which are preceded by
cells called chondroblasts. A membrane known as the perichondrium surrounds
cartilage tissue, which also contains a gelatinous protein called chondrin. There
are three types of cartilage:
• Hyaline cartilage: The most abundant cartilage in the body, it’s elastic and
made up of a uniform matrix pocked with chondrocytes. It lays the founda-
tion for the embryonic skeleton, forms the rib (or costal) cartilages, makes
up nose cartilage, and covers the articulating surfaces of bones.
• Fibrocartilage: As the name implies, fibrocartilage contains thick, compact
collagen fibers. The sponge-like structure, with the lacunae and chondro-
cytes lined up within the fibers, makes it a good shock absorber. It’s found
in the intervertebral discs of the vertebral column and in the symphysis
pubis at the front of the pelvis.
• Elastic cartilage: Similar to hyaline cartilage, elastic cartilage has more
tightly packed lacunae and chondrocytes between parallel elastic fibers.
This structure, which makes up the ear lobe and other structures where a
specific form is important, tends to bounce back to its original shape after
being bent.
 Bone, or osseous, tissue: Essentially, bone is mineralized connective tissue formed
into repeating patterns called Haversian systems. In the center of each system is a
large opening, the Haversian canal, that contains blood vessels, lymph vessels, and
nerves. The central canal is surrounded by thin membranes called lamellae that
contain the lacunae, which in turn contain osteocytes (bone cells). Smaller canali-
culi connect the lacunae and circulate tissue fluids from the blood vessels to nour-
ish the osteocytes. (We explore bone in more detail in Chapter 5.)
 Blood: Yes, blood is considered a type of connective tissue. Like other connec-
tive tissues, it has an extracellular matrix — in this case, plasma — in which are
suspended erythrocytes (red blood cells), leukocytes (white blood cells), and
thrombocytes (platelets). (Blood also is considered a vascular tissue because it
circulates inside arteries and veins, but we get into that in Chapter 10.) Roughly
half of blood’s volume is fluid or plasma while the other half is suspended cells.
Erythrocytes are concave on both sides and contain a pigment, hemoglobin,
which supplies oxygen to the body’s cells and takes carbon dioxide away. There
are approximately 5 million erythrocytes per cubic millimeter of whole blood.
Thrombocytes, which number approximately 250,000 per cubic millimeter, are
fragments of cells used in blood clotting. Leukocytes are large phagocytic cells
(literally “cell that eats”) that are part of the body’s immune system. There are,
however, relatively few of them — less than 10,000 per cubic millimeter.

Flexing It: Muscle Tissue
Although we review how muscles work in Chapter 6, in histology you should know that
muscle tissue is made up of fibers known as myocytes. The cytoplasm within the fibers
is called sarcoplasm, and within that sarcoplasm are minute myofibrils that contain the
protein filaments actin and myosin. These filaments slide past each other during a
muscle contraction, shortening the fiber.
Following are the three types of muscle tissue (see Figure 4-3):
 Smooth muscle tissue: This type of tissue contracts without conscious control.
Made up of spindle-shaped fibers with large, centrally located nuclei, it’s found in
the walls of internal organs, or viscera. Smooth muscle gets its name from the
fact that, unlike other muscle tissue types, it is not striated.
 Cardiac muscle tissue: Also known as myocardium, cardiac muscle tissue is
made of branching fibers, each with a central nucleus and alternating light and
dark striations. Between the fibers are dark structures called intercalated discs.
As with smooth muscle, cardiac muscle tissue contractions occur through the
autonomic nervous system (involuntary control).
 Skeletal, or striated, muscle tissue: Biceps, triceps, pecs — these are the mus-
cles that bodybuilders focus on. As the name implies, skeletal muscles attach to
the skeleton and are used throughout the central nervous system for movement.
Muscle fibers are cylindrical with several nuclei in each cell (which makes them
multinucleated) and cross-striations throughout.

Getting the Signal Across: Nerve Tissue
There’s only one type of nerve tissue and only one primary type of cell in it: the
neuron. Nerve tissue is unique in that it can both generate and conduct electrical sig-
nals in the body. That process starts when sense receptors receive a stimulus that
causes electrical impulses to be sent through finger-like cytoplasmic projections called

dendrites. From there, the impulse moves through the body of the cell and into another
type of cytoplasmic projection (or nerve process) called an axon that hands the signal
off to the next cell down the line. (We look more closely at how all that happens when
we examine the central nervous system in Chapter 15.)

a
Epithelial cells can be shaped d. all of the above. Cube, column, or flat and thin, it’s still an
epithelial cell.
b
Epithelial tissue is classified by d. both the number of layers and the cell shape. Classification
requires looking at both simultaneously.
c
The epithelial tissue that has the ability to stretch is b. transitional. This tissue lines the blad-
der, so it had better be stretchy!

i
A tissue that’s one layer thick but appears to be multilayered and is composed of cells taller
than they are wide is c. pseudostratified columnar epithelium. To arrive at the correct answer,
consider this question one piece at a time: pseudo is “false,” stratified means “layered” (so you
have “false-layered”), and columns are taller than they are wide.

w
Vascular connective tissue is c. blood.
x
Tissue containing lacunae with osteocytes is b. bone. Remember that osteo is the Latin word

his part gets into what most people think of first
when it comes to anatomy and physiology: bones and
muscles. First we focus on how bones are formed before
broadening the view to the axial skeleton (the parts that
line up from head to toe) and the appendicular skeleton
(the parts that reach out from the central axis). You review
how muscles attach to that framework and watch the
body take shape before wrapping this newly layered
package in the body’s largest single organ: the skin.

uman osteology, from the Greek word for “bone” (osteon) and the suffix –logy, which
means “to study,” focuses on the 206 bones in the adult body endoskeleton. But it’s
more than just bones; it’s also ligaments and cartilage and the joints that make the whole
assembly useful. In this chapter, you get lots of practice exploring the skeletal functions and
how the joints work together.
Understanding Dem Bones
The skeletal system as a whole serves five key functions:
 Protection: The skeleton encases and shields delicate internal organs that might other-
wise be damaged during motion or crushed by the weight of the body itself. For exam-
ple, the skull’s cranium houses the brain, and the ribs and sternum of the thoracic cage
protect organs in the central body cavity.
 Movement: By providing anchor sites and a scaffold against which muscles can con-
tract, the skeleton makes motion possible. The bones act as levers, the joints are the
fulcrums, and the muscles apply the force. For instance, when the biceps muscle con-
tracts, the radius and ulna bones of the forearm are lifted toward the humerus bone of
the upper arm.
 Support: The vertebral column’s curvatures play a key role in supporting the entire
body’s weight, as do the arches formed by the bones of the feet. Upper body support
flows from the clavicle, or collarbone, which is the only bone that attaches the upper
extremities to the axial skeleton and the only horizontal long bone in the human body.
 Mineral storage: Calcium, phosphorous, and other minerals like magnesium must be
maintained in the bloodstream at a constant level, so they’re “banked” in the bones in
case the dietary intake of those minerals drops. The bones’ mineral content is con-
stantly renewed, refreshing entirely about every nine months. A 35 percent decrease in
blood calcium will cause convulsions.
 Blood cell formation: Called hemopoiesis or hematopoiesis, most blood cell formation
takes place within the red marrow inside the ends of long bones as well as within the ver-
tebrae, ribs, sternum, and cranial bones. Marrow produces three types of blood cells:
erythrocytes (red cells), leukocytes (white cells), and thrombocytes (platelets). Most of
these are formed in red bone marrow, although some types of white blood cells are pro-
duced in fat-rich yellow bone marrow. At birth, all bone marrow is red. With age, it con-
verts to the yellow type. In cases of severe blood loss, the body can convert yellow
marrow back to red marrow in order to increase blood cell production.

1. The formation of red blood cells by the bone marrow is known as
a. Hemolysis
b. Hematopoiesis
c. Hemoptysis
d. Hematuria
2. The following mineral is stored inside bones for later use:
a. Phosphorous
b. Calcium
c. Magnesium
d. All of the above
3. Besides support and protection, the skeleton serves other important functions, including
a. Reproduction
b. Locomotion
c. Respiration
d. Circulation
4. The curvatures in some bone structures serve the following purpose:
a. Support the body
b. Make the body more flexible
c. Enhance circulation throughout the body
d. Divide different body areas
62
Part II: Weaving It Together: Bones, Muscles, and Skin 
The following are examples of questions dealing with skeletal functions:
Q. Which of the following is not a
function of the skeleton?
a. Support of soft tissue
b. Hemostasis
c. Production of red blood cells
d. Movement
A. The correct answer, of course, is
hemostasis, which is the stoppage
of bleeding or blood flow. (We dis-
cuss hemostasis further when we
address the circulatory system in
Chapter 10.) This is one of those
frequent times when study of
anatomy and physiology boils down
to rote memorization of Latin and
Greek roots (check out the Cheat
Sheet at the front of this book).
Q. The skeletal system is composed
of
a. Bones
b. Cartilage
c. Joints
d. All of the above
A. If you hesitated to choose “all of
the above,” ask yourself this: If you
suspected one of the three things
was not part of the skeletal system,
to which system would it belong?
Can’t think of a sensible alterna-
tive? Neither can we.

Boning Up on Classifications, Structures,
and Ossification
Adult bones are composed of 30 percent protein (called ossein), 45 percent minerals
(including calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium), and 25 percent water. Minerals give
the bone strength and hardness. At birth, bones are soft and pliable because of carti-
lage in their structure. As the body grows, older cartilage gradually is replaced by hard
bone tissue. Mineral in the bones increases with age, causing them to become more
brittle and easily fractured.
Various types of bone make up the human skeleton, but fortunately for memorization
purposes, bone type names match what the bones look like. They are as follows:
 Long bones, like those found in the arms and legs, form the weight-bearing part
of the skeleton.
 Short bones, such as those in the wrists (carpals) and ankles (tarsals), have a
blocky structure and allow for a greater range of motion.
 Flat bones, such as the skull, sternum, scapulae, and pelvic bones, shield soft 
tissues.
 Irregular bones, such as the mandible (jawbone) and vertebrae, come in a vari-
ety of shapes and sizes suited for attachment to muscles, tendons, and ligaments.
Irregular bones include seed-shaped sesamoid bones found in joints such as the
patella, or kneecap.
Unfortunately for students of bone structures, there’s no easy way to memorize them.
So brace yourself for a rapid summary of what your textbook probably goes into in
much greater detail.
Compact bone is a dense layer made up of structural units, or lacunae, arranged in
concentric circles called Haversian systems (also referred to in short as osteons), each
of which has a central, microscopic Haversian canal. A perpendicular system of canals,
called Volkmann’s canals, penetrate and cross between the Haversian systems. This
network ensures circulation into even the hardest bone structure. Compact bone
tissue is thick in the shaft and tapers to paper thinness at the ends of the bones. The
bulbous ends of each long bone, known as the epiphyses (or singularly as an epiphy-
sis), are made up of spongy bone or cancellous bone tissue covered by a thin layer of
compact bone. The diaphysis, or shaft, contains the medullary cavity and blood
cell–producing marrow. A membrane called the periosteum covers the outer bone to
provide nutrients and oxygen, remove waste, and connect with ligaments and tendons.
Bones grow through the cellular activities of osteoblasts on the surface of the bone,
which produce layers of mature bone cells called osteocytes. Osteoclasts are cells that
function in the developing fetus to absorb cartilage as ossification occurs and function
in adult bone to break down and remove spent bone tissue.
There are two types of ossification, which is the process by which softer tissues harden
into bone. Both types rely on a peptide hormone produced by the thyroid gland, calci-
tonin, which regulates metabolism of calcium, the body’s most abundant mineral. The
two types of ossification are
 Endochondral or intracartilaginous ossification: Occurs when mineral salts,
particularly calcium and phosphorus, calcify along the scaffolding of cartilage
formed in the developing fetus beginning about the fifth week after conception.
This process, known as calcification, takes place in the presence of vitamin D and
63
Chapter 5: A Scaffold to Build On: The Skeleton

a hormone from the parathyroid gland. The absence of any one of these sub-
stances causes a child to have soft bone, called rickets. Next, the blood supply
entering the cartilage brings osteoblasts that attach themselves to the cartilage.
As the primary center of ossification, the diaphysis of the long bone is the first
to form spongy bone tissue along the cartilage, followed by the epiphyses, which
form the secondary centers of ossification and are separated from the diaphysis
by a layer of uncalcified cartilage called the epiphyseal plate where all growth in
bone length occurs. Compact bone tissue covering the bone’s surface is pro-
duced by osteoblasts in the inner layer of the periosteum, producing growth in
diameter.
 Intramembranous ossification: Occurs not along cartilage but instead along a
template of membrane, as the name implies, primarily in compact flat bones of
the skull that don’t have Haversian systems. The skull and mandible (lower jaw)
of the fetus are first laid down as a membrane. Osteoblasts entering with the
blood supply attach to the membrane, ossifying from the center of the bone out-
ward. The edges of the skull’s bones don’t completely ossify to allow for molding
of the head during birth. Instead, six soft spots, or fontanels, are formed: one
frontal or anterior, two sphenoidal or anterolateral, two mastoidal or posterolat-
eral, and one occipital or posterior.
Once formed, bone is surrounded by the periosteum, which has both a vascular layer
(remember the Latin word for “vessel” is vasculum) and an inner layer that contains
the osteoblasts needed for bone growth and repair. A penetrating matrix of connective
tissue called Sharpey’s fibers connects the periosteum to the bone; inside the bone, the
medullary cavity is lined by a thin membrane called the endosteum (from the Greek
endon, meaning “within,” and, of course, that ever-present Greek word osteon).
Following are the basic terms used to identify bone landmarks or surface features:
 Process: A broad designation for any prominence or prolongation
 Spine: An abrupt or pointed projection
 Trochanter: A large, usually blunt process
 Tubercle: A smaller, rounded eminence
 Tuberosity: A large, often rough eminence
 Crest: A prominent ridge
 Head: A large, rounded articular end of a bone; often set off from the shaft by
a neck
 Condyle: An oval articular prominence of a bone
 Facet: A smooth, flat or nearly flat articulating surface
 Fossa: A deeper depression
 Sulcus: A groove
 Foramen: A hole
 Meatus: A canal or opening to a canal

Axial Skeleton: Keeping It All in Line
Just as the Earth rotates around its axis, the axial skeleton lies along the midline, or
center, of the body. Think of your spinal column and the bones that connect directly to
it — the rib (thoracic) cage and the skull. The tiny hyoid bone, which lies just above
your larynx, or voice box, also is considered part of the axial skeleton, although it’s the
only bone in the entire body that doesn’t connect, or articulate, with any other bone.
It’s also known as the tongue bone because the tongue’s muscles attach to it.
There are a total of 80 named bones in the axial skeleton, which supports the head and
trunk of the body and serves as an anchor for the pelvic girdle. Twenty-nine of those
80 bones are in (or very near) the skull. In addition to the hyoid bone, 8 bones form
the cranium to house and protect the brain, 14 form the face, and 6 bones make it pos-
sible for you to hear.
Making a hard head harder
Fortunately for the cramming student, most of the bones in the skull come in pairs. In
the cranium there’s just one of each of the following: frontal bone (forehead), occipital
bone (back and base of the skull), ethmoid bone (made of several plates, or sections,
between the eye orbits in the nasal cavity), and sphenoid bone (a butterfly-shaped
structure that forms the floor of the cranial cavity). But there are two temporal (hous-
ing the hearing organs in the auditory meatus) and parietal (roof and sides of the skull)
bones. These bones are attached along sutures called coronal (located at the top of the
skull), squamosal (located on the sides of the head surrounding the temporal bone),
sagittal (along the midline atop the skull located between the two parietal bones), and
lambdoidal (forming an upside-down V — the shape of the Greek letter lambda — on
the back of the skull).
In the face, there’s only one mandible (jawbone) and one vomer dividing the nostrils,
but there are two each of maxillary (upper jaw), zygomatic (cheekbone), nasal, lacrimal
(a small bone in the eye socket), palatine (which makes up part of the eye socket,
nasal cavity, and roof of the mouth), and inferior nasal concha, or turbinated, bones.
Inside the ear, there are two each of three ossicles, or bonelets, which also happen to
be the smallest bones in the human body: the malleus, incus, and stapes.
The cranial cavity contains several openings, or foramina (the singular is foramen), in
the floor of the cranial cavity that allow various nerves and vessels to connect to the
brain. The holes in the ethmoid bone’s cribriform plate allow olfactory — or sense of
smell — receptors to pass through to the brain. A large hole in the occipital bone
called the foramen magnum allows the spinal cord to connect with the brain. The sphe-
noid bone is riddled with foramina. The optic foramen allows passage of the optic
nerves, whereas the jugular foramen allows passage of the jugular vein and several cra-
nial nerves. The foramen rotundum allows passage of the trigeminal nerve, which is the
chief sensory nerve to the face and controls the motor functions of chewing. The fora-
men ovale allows passage of the nerves controlling the tongue, among other things.
The foramen spinosum allows passage of the middle meningeal artery, which supplies
blood to various parts of the brain. The sphenoid bone also features the sella turcica,
or Turk’s saddle, that cradles the pituitary gland and forms part of the foramen
lacerum, through which pass several key components of the autonomic nervous
system.
69
Chapter 5: A Scaffold to Build On: The Skeleton

Encased within the frontal, sphenoid, ethmoid, and maxillary bones of the skull are
several air-filled, mucous-lined cavities called paranasal sinuses. While you may think
their primary function is to drive you crazy with pressure and infections, the sinuses
actually lighten the skull’s weight, making it easier to hold your head up high; warm
and humidify inhaled air; and act as resonance chambers to prolong and intensify the
reverberations of your voice. Mastoid sinuses drain into the middle ear (hence the ear-
ache referred to as mastoiditis). Maxillary sinuses are flanked by the bones of the max-
illa, the upper jaw. The paranasal sinuses are the ones that drain into the nose and
cause so much trouble when you cry or have a cold.
Putting your backbones into it
The axial skeleton also consists of 33 bones in the vertebral column, laid out in four
distinct curvatures, or areas.
 The cervical, or neck, curvature has 7 vertebrae, with the atlas and axis bones
positioned in the first and second spots, respectively. (In a sense, the atlas bone
holds the world of the head on its shoulders, as the Greek god Atlas held the
Earth.)
 The thoracic, or chest, curvature has 12 vertebrae that articulate with the ribs,
which attach to the sternum anteriorly by costal cartilage, forming the rib cage.
 The lumbar, or small of the back, curvature contains 5 vertebrae and carries
most of the weight of the body, which means that it generally suffers the most
stress.
 The pelvic curvature includes the 5 fused vertebrae of the sacrum anchoring the
pelvic girdle and 4 fused vertebrae of the coccyx, or tailbone. (Thanks to evolu-
tion, there’s no need for tail openings in our trousers.)
The spinal cord extends down the center of the vertebrae only from the base of the
brain to the uppermost lumbar vertebrae.
Each vertebra consists of a body and a vertebral arch, which features a long dorsal
projection called a spinous process that provides a point of attachment for muscles and
ligaments. On either side of this are the laminae, broad plates of bone on the posterior
surface that form a bony covering over the spinal canal. The laminae attach to the two
transverse processes, which in turn are attached to the body of the vertebra by regions
called the pedicles.
Articulating, or connecting, to the vertebral column are the 12 pairs of ribs that make
up the thoracic cage. All 12 pairs attach to the thoracic vertebrae, but the first 7 pairs
attach to the sternum, or breastbone, by costal cartilage; they’re called true ribs. Pairs 8,
9, and 10 attach to the cartilage of the seventh pair, which is why they’re called false
ribs. The last two pairs aren’t attached in front at all, so they’re called floating ribs.
The sternum has three parts:
 Manubrium: The superior region that articulates with the clavicle and the first
two pairs of ribs is located up top, where you can feel a notch in your chest in
line with your clavicles, or collar bones.
 Body: The middle part of the sternum forms the bulk of the breastbone and has
notches on the sides where it articulates with the third through seventh pairs 
of ribs.
 Xiphoid process: The lowest part of the sternum is an attachment point for the
diaphragm and some abdominal muscles.

Appendicular Skeleton: Reaching 
Beyond Our Girdles
Whereas the axial skeleton lies along the body’s central axis, the appendicular skele-
ton’s 126 bones include those in all four appendages — arms and legs — plus the two
primary girdles to which the appendages attach: the pectoral (chest) girdle and the
pelvic (hip) girdle.
The pectoral girdle is made up of a pair of clavicles, or collar bones, which attach to
the sternum medially and to the scapula laterally articulating with the acromion
process, and a pair of scapulae, better known as shoulder blades. Each scapula has a
depression in it called the glenoid fossa where the head of the humerus (upper arm
bone) is attached. The lower end of the humerus articulates with the forearm’s long
ulna bone to form the elbow joint. The process called the olecranon forms the elbow
and is also referred to as the funny bone, although banging it into something usually
feels anything but funny. The forearm also contains a bone called the radius; together
the ulna and radius articulate with the eight small carpal bones that form the wrist.
The carpals articulate with the five metacarpals that form the hand, which in turn con-
nect with the phalanges (finger bones), which are found as a pair in the thumb and as
triplets in each of the fingers. (Toe bones also are called phalanges, but we get to that
in a moment.)
The pelvic girdle consists of two hip bones, called os coxae, as well as the sacrum
and coccyx, more commonly referred to as the tail bone. During early developmental
years, the os coxa consists of three separate bones — the ilium, the ischium, and the
pubis — that later fuse into one bone sometime between the ages of 16 and 20.
Posteriorly, the os coxa articulates with the sacrum, forming the sacroiliac joint, the
source of much lower back pain; it’s formed by the connection of the hip bones at 
the sacrum. Toward the front of the pelvic girdle, the two os coxae join to form the
symphysis pubis, which is made up of fibrocartilage. A cup-like socket called the acetab-
ulum articulates with the ball-shaped head of the leg’s femur (thigh bone). (The femur
is the longest bone in the body.) The femur articulates with the tibia (shin bone) at the
knee, which is covered by the patella (kneecap). Also inside each lower leg is the fibula
bone, which joins with the tibia to connect with the seven tarsal bones that make up
the ankle. The tarsals join with the five metatarsals that form the foot, which in turn
connect to the phalanges of the toes — a pair of phalanges in the big toe and triplets in
each of the other toes.

Arthrology: Articulating the Joints
Arthrology, which stems from the ancient Greek word arthros (meaning “jointed”), is
the study of those structures that hold bones together, allowing them to move to vary-
ing degrees — or fixing them in place — depending on the design and function of the
joint. The term articulation, or joint, applies to any union of bones, whether it moves
freely or not at all.
82
Part II: Weaving It Together: Bones, Muscles, and Skin 

Inside some joints, such as knees and elbows, are fluid-filled sacs called bursae that
help reduce friction between tendons and bones; inflammation in these sacs is called
bursitis. Some joints are stabilized by connective tissue called ligaments that range
from bundles of collagenous fibers that restrict movement and hold a joint in place to
elastic fibers that can repeatedly stretch and return to their original shapes.
The three types of joints are as follows:
 Fibrous: Fibrous tissue rigidly joins the bones in a form of articulation called
synarthrosis, which is characterized by no movement at all. The sutures of the
skull are fibrous joints.
 Cartilaginous: This type of joint is found in two forms:
• Synchondrosis articulation involves rigid cartilage that allows no move-
ment, such as the joint between the ribs, costal cartilage, and sternum.
• Symphysis joints occur where cartilage fuses bones in such a way that
pressure can cause slight movement, called amphiarthrosis. Examples
include the intervertebral discs and the symphysis pubis.
 Synovial: Also known as diarthrosis, or freely moving, joints, this type of articula-
tion involves a synovial cavity, which contains articular fluid secreted from the
synovial membrane to lubricate the opposing surfaces of bone. The synovial
membrane is covered by a fibrous joint capsule layer that’s continuous with the
periosteum of the bone. Ligaments surrounding the joint strengthen the capsule
and hold the bones in place, preventing dislocation. In some synovial joints,
such as the knee, fibrous connective tissue called meniscus develops in the
cavity, dividing it into two parts. In the knee, this meniscus stabilizes the joint
and acts as a shock absorber.
There are six classifications of moveable, or synovial, joints:
 Gliding: Curved or flat surfaces slide against one another, such as between the
carpal bones in the wrist or between the tarsal bones in the ankle.
 Hinge: A convex surface joints with a concave surface, allowing right-angle
motions in one plane, such as elbows, knees, and joints between the finger bones.
 Pivot (or rotary): One bone pivots or rotates around a stationary bone, such as
the atlas rotating around the odontoid process at the top of the vertebral
column.
 Condyloid: The oval head of one bone fits into a shallow depression in another,
allowing the joint to move in two directions, such as the carpal-metacarpal joint
at the wrist, or the tarsal-metatarsal joint at the ankle.
 Saddle: Each of the adjoining bones is shaped like a saddle (the technical term is
reciprocally concavo-convex), allowing various movements, such as the car-
pometacarpal joint of the thumb.
 Ball-and-socket: The round head of one bone fits into a cup-like cavity in the
other bone, allowing movement in many directions so long as the bones are nei-
ther pulled apart nor forced together, such as the shoulder joint between the
humerus and scapula and the hip joints between the femur and the os coxa.
The following are the types of joint movement:
 Flexion: Decrease the angle between two bones
 Extension: Increase the angle between two bones
 Abduction: Movement away from the midline of the body
83
Chapter 5: A Scaffold to Build On: The Skeleton

 Adduction: Movement toward the midline of the body
 Rotation: Turning around an axis
 Pronation: Downward or palm downward
 Supination: Upward or palm upward
 Eversion: Turning of the sole of the foot outward
 Inversion: Turning of the sole of the foot inward
 Circumduction: The forming of a cone with the arm

Answers to Questions on the Skeleton
The following are answers to the practice questions presented in this chapter.
a
The formation of red blood cells by the bone marrow is known as b. hematopoiesis. The term
hemopoiesis also would be correct here, but it’s not one of the answer options.
b
The following mineral is stored inside bones for later use: d. All of the above (phosphorous,
calcium, and magnesium). The bones act as a mineral bank for the entire body.
c
Besides support and protection, the skeleton serves other important functions, including 
b. locomotion. You’d be a motionless blob without a skeleton to support coordinated 
movement.
d
The curvatures in some bone structures serve the following purpose: a. Support the body. And
now you know why your back aches most where it curves.
e
The most abundant mineral in the body is c. calcium.
f
A decrease in calcium concentration in the body fluids by 35 percent causes c. convulsions. Go
much beyond that and the situation becomes fatal.
g
Calcitonin is produced by the a. thyroid gland. There’s that busy little thyroid gland, control-
ling metabolism.
h
Bones are encased by a membrane called the b. periosteum. Back to Greek again: peri means
“around” and osteon means “bone,” so the periosteum is “around the bone.”
i
A bone’s encapsulating membrane is attached by c. Sharpey’s fibers. Described by anatomist
William Sharpey in 1846, these are also called perforating fibers.
j
Bone marrow can be found inside the a. medullary cavity. This is where you’ll find yellow
marrow, although in infants red marrow also is present.
k
The six structures in the skull of an infant are called b. fontanels. These separate floating plates
are why you can see a bald baby’s pulse throbbing on the top of its head.
l
Volkmann’s canals a. are found in cancellous bone only. Ironically, anatomist Alfred Wilhelm
Volkmann was most noted for his observations of the physiology of the nervous system, not
bones.
m
Blood vessels entering through Volkmann’s canals reach the bone cells through the 
b. Haversian canal. The name comes from the first physician to describe them, Clopton
Havers.
n
The hormone released when calcium ion concentration is abnormally high is b. calcitonin. This
peptide hormone lowers plasma calcium.
o–y
Bones are first laid down as 15. cartilage during the fifth week after conception. Development
of the bone begins with 16. calcification, the depositing of calcium and phosphorus. Next, the
blood supply entering the cartilage brings 17. osteoblasts that attach themselves to the carti-
lage. Ossification in long bones begins in the 18. diaphysis of the long bone and moves toward
the 19. epiphysis of the bone. The epiphyseal and diaphyseal areas remain separated by a layer
of uncalcified cartilage called the 20. epiphyseal plate.
87
Chapter 5: A Scaffold to Build On: The Skeleton

Another very large cell that enters with the blood supply is the 21. osteoclast, which helps
absorb the cartilage as ossification occurs. Later it helps absorb bone tissue from the center of
the long bone’s shaft, forming the 22. medullary or marrow cavity. After ossification, the
spaces that were formed by the osteoclasts join together to form 23. Haversian canal systems,
which contain the blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and nerves. Unlike bones in the rest of the
body, those of the skull and mandible (lower jaw) are first laid down as 24. membrane. In the
skull, the edges of the bone don’t ossify in the fetus but remain membranous and form 25.

uch of what we think of as “the body” centers around our muscles and what they can
do, what we want them to do, and how tired we get trying to make them do it. With
all that muscles do and are, it’s hard to believe the word “muscle” is rooted in the Latin
word musculus, which is a diminutive of the word for “mouse.” Well, the muscle is a mouse
that roars. Muscles make up most of the fleshy parts of the body and average 43 percent of
the body’s weight. Layered over the skeleton, they largely determine the body’s form. There
are over 500 muscles large enough to be seen by the unaided eye, and thousands more are
visible only through a microscope. Although there are three distinct types of muscle tissue,
every muscle in the human body shares one important characteristic: contractility, the abil-
ity to shorten, or contract.
Flexing Your Muscle Knowledge
The study of muscles is called myology after the Greek word mys, which means “mouse.”
Muscles perform a number of functions vital to maintaining life, including
 Movement: Skeletal muscles (those attached to bones) convert chemical energy into
mechanical work, producing movement ranging from finger tapping to a swift kick of a
ball by contracting, or shortening. Reflex muscle reactions protect your fingers when
you put them too close to a fire and startle you into watchfulness when an unexpected
noise sounds. Many purposeful movements require several sets, or groups, of muscles
to work in unison.
 Vital functions: Without muscle activity, you die. Muscles are doing their job when
your heart beats, when your blood vessels constrict, and when your intestines squeeze
food along your digestive tract in peristalsis.
 Antigravity: Perhaps that’s overstating it, but muscles do make it possible for you to
stand and move about in spite of gravity’s ceaseless pull. Did your mother tell you to
improve your posture? Just think how bad it would be without any muscles!
 Heat generation: You shiver when you’re cold and stamp your feet and jog in place
when you need to warm up. That’s because chemical reactions in muscles result in
heat, helping to maintain the body’s temperature.
 Keep the body together: Muscles are the warp and woof of your body’s structure,
binding one part to another.

As you may remember from studying tissues, muscle cells — called fibers — are some
of the longest in the body. Fibers are held together by connective tissue and enclosed
in a fibrous sheath called fascia. Some muscle fibers contract rapidly, whereas others
move at a leisurely pace. Generally speaking, however, the smaller the structure to be
moved, the faster the muscle action. Exercise can increase the thickness of muscle
fibers, but it doesn’t make new fibers. Skeletal muscles have a rich vascular supply
that dilates during exercise to give the working muscle the extra oxygen it needs to
keep going.
Two processes are central to muscle development in the developing embryo: myogene-
sis, during which muscle tissue is formed; and morphogenesis, when the muscles form
into internal organs. By the eighth week of gestation, a fetus is capable of coordinated
movement.
Following are some important muscle terms to know:
 Fascia: Loose, or areolar, connective tissue that holds muscle fibers together to
form a muscle organ
 Fiber: An individual muscle cell
 Insertion: The more movable attachment of a muscle
 Ligament: Elastic connective tissue that supports joints and anchors organs
 Motor nerve: Nerve that stimulates contraction of a muscle
 Myofibril: Fibrils within a muscle cell that contain protein filaments such as
actin and myosin that slide during contraction, shortening the fiber (or cell)
 Origin: The immovable attachment of a muscle, or the point at which a muscle is
anchored by a tendon to the bone
 Sarcoplasm: The cellular cytoplasm in a muscle fiber
 Tendon: Connective tissue made up of collagen, a fibrous protein that attaches
muscles to bone; lets muscles apply their force at some distance from where a
contraction actually takes place
 Tone, or tonus: State of tension present to a degree at all times, even when the
muscle is at rest

Classifications: Smooth, 
Cardiac, and Skeletal
Muscle tissue is classified in three ways based on the tissue’s function, shape, and
structure:
 Smooth muscle tissue: So-called because it doesn’t have the cross-striations typ-
ical of other kinds of muscle, the spindle-shaped fibers of smooth muscle tissue
do have faint longitudinal striping. This muscle tissue forms into sheets and
makes up the walls of hollow organs such as the stomach, intestines, and blad-
der. The tissue’s involuntary movements are relatively slow, so contractions last
95
Chapter 6: Getting in Gear: The Muscles

longer than those of other muscle tissue, and fatigue is rare. Each fiber is about 
6 microns in diameter and can vary from 15 microns to 500 microns long. If
arranged in a circle inside an organ, contraction constricts the cavity inside the
organ. If arranged lengthwise, contraction of smooth muscle tissue shortens
the organ.
 Cardiac muscle tissue: Found only in the heart, cardiac muscle fibers are
branched, cross-striated, feature one central nucleus, and move through involun-
tary control. An electron microscope view of the tissue shows separate fibers
tightly pressed against each other, forming cellular junctions called intercalated
discs that look like tiny, dark-colored plates. Some experts believe intercalated
discs are not cellular junctions but rather special structures that help move an
electrical impulse throughout the heart.
 Skeletal muscle tissue: This is the tissue that most people think of as muscle. 
It’s the only muscle subject to voluntary control through the central nervous
system. Its long, striated cylindrical fibers contract quickly but tire just as fast.
Skeletal muscle, which is also what’s considered meat in animals, is 20 percent
protein, 75 percent water, and 5 percent organic and inorganic materials. Each
multinucleated fiber is encased in a thin, transparent membrane called a sar-
colemma that receives and conducts stimuli. The fibers, which vary from 10
microns to 100 microns in diameter and up to 4 centimeters in length, are subdi-
vided lengthwise into tiny myofibrils roughly 1 micron in diameter that are sus-
pended in the cell’s sarcoplasm.
The following practice questions test your knowledge of muscle classifications:

a. Cardiac

Contracting for a Contraction
Before we can explain how muscles do what they do, it’s important that you under-
stand the anatomy of how they’re put together. Use Figure 6-1 as a visual guide as you
read through this section.
We base this description of muscle on the most studied classification of muscle: skele-
tal. Each fiber packed inside the sarcolemma contains hundreds, or even thousands, of
myofibril strands made up of alternating filaments of the proteins actin and myosin.
Actin and myosin are what give skeletal muscles their striated appearance, with alter-
nating dark and light bands. The dark bands are called anisotropic, or A-bands. The
light bands are called isotropic, or I-bands. In the center of each I-band is a line called
the Z-line that divides the myofibril into smaller units called sarcomeres. At the center
of the A-band is a less-dense region called the H-zone.
Now, here’s where the actin and myosin come in. Each sarcomere contains thick fila-
ments of myosin in the A-band and thin filaments of actin primarily in the I-band but
extending a short distance between the myosin filaments into the A-band. Actin fila-
ments don’t extend all the way into the central area of the A-band, which explains why
the less-dense H-zone can be found there. Those thin actin filaments are anchored to
the Z-line at their midpoints, which holds them in place and creates a structure against
which the filaments exert their pull during contraction.
The theory of contraction called the Interdigitating Filament Model of Muscle
Contraction, or the Sliding Theory of Muscle Contraction, says that the myosin of the
thick filaments combines with the actin of the thin filaments, forming actomyosin and
prompting the filaments to slide past each other. As they do so, the H-zone is reduced
or obliterated, pulling the Z-lines closer together and reducing the I-bands. (The 
A-bands don’t change.) Voila! Contraction has occurred!

Chapter 6: Getting in Gear: The Muscles

So you know how muscles contract. Now you need to figure out what stimulates them
to do so. We cover the details of the nervous system in Chapter 15, but here you can
find out what’s happening as an impulse stimulates a skeletal muscle.
The impulse, or stimulus, from the central nervous system is brought to the muscle
through a nerve called the motor, or efferent, nerve. On entering the muscle, the motor
nerve fibers separate to distribute themselves among the thousands of muscle fibers.
Because the muscle has more fibers than the motor nerve, individual nerve fibers
branch repeatedly so that a single nerve fiber innervates from 5 to as many as 200
muscle fibers. These small terminal branches penetrate the sarcolemma and form a
special structure known as the motor end plate, or synapse. This neuromuscular unit
consisting of one motor neuron and all the muscle fibers that it innervates is called the
motor unit.
Interference — either chemical or physical — with the nerve pathway can affect the
action of the muscle or stop the action altogether, resulting in muscle paralysis. There
also are afferent, or sensory, nerves that carry information about muscle condition to
the brain.
When an impulse moves through the synapse and the motor unit, it must arrive virtu-
ally simultaneously at each of the individual sarcomeres to create an efficient contrac-
tion. Enter the transverse system, or T-system, of tubules. The fiber’s membrane forms
deep invaginations, or inward-folding sheaths, at the Z-line of the myofibrils. The
resulting inward-reaching tubules ensure that the sarcomeres are stimulated at nearly
the same time.
Does it matter whether the signal received is strong or weak? Nope. That’s the all-or-
none law of muscle contraction. The fiber either contracts completely or not at all. In
other words, if a single muscle fiber is going to contract, it’s going to do so to its fullest
extent.

20. A weak stimulus causes a muscle fiber to contract only partway.
a. True
b. False
Pulling Together: Muscles as Organs
A muscle organ has two parts:
 The belly, composed predominantly of muscle fibers
 The tendon, composed of fibrous, or collagenous, regular connective tissue. If the
tendon is a flat, sheet-like structure attaching a wide muscle, it’s called an aponeurosis.
Each muscle fiber outside of the sarcolemma is surrounded by areolar connective tissue 
called endomysium that binds the fibers together into bundles called fasciculi (see Figure 6-2).
Each bundle, or fasciculus, is surrounded by areolar connective tissue called perimysium.
All the fasciculi together make up the belly of the muscle, which is surrounded by areolar 
connective tissue called the epimysium. Blood vessels, lymph vessels, and nerves pass into 
the fasciculus through areolar connective tissue called the trabecula. These blood vessels in
turn branch off into capillaries that surround the muscle fibers in the endomysium.

Assuming the Right Tone
As we note earlier in this chapter, when it comes to contraction of a muscle fiber,
it’s an all-or-nothing affair. Nonetheless, it has been demonstrated that fewer action
potentials — a weaker stimulus, as it were — causes fewer motor units to become
involved in a contraction. Maximum stimulus, on the other hand, brings all motor units
to bear together. So it’s true that a muscle organ can have varying degrees of contrac-
tion depending on the level of stimulation. As for how this can be so, one theory pro-
poses that individual fibers have specific thresholds of excitation; thus, those with
higher thresholds only respond to stronger stimuli. The other theory holds that the
deeper a fiber is buried in the muscle, the less accessible it is to incoming stimuli.
In physiology, a muscle contraction is referred to as a muscle twitch. A twitch is the fun-
damental unit of recordable muscular activity. Complete fatigue occurs when no more
twitches can be elicited, even with increasing intensity of stimulation.
The short lapse of time between the application of a stimulus and the beginning of
muscular response is called the latent period. In mammalian muscle, latency is about
.001 second, or one one-thousandth of a second.
Two types of muscle contraction relate to tone:
 Isometric: Occurs when a contracting muscle is unable to move a load (or heft a
piece of luggage or push a building to one side). It retains its original length but
develops tension. No mechanical work is accomplished, and all energy involved
is expended as heat.
 Isotonic: Occurs when the resistance offered by the load (or the gardening hoe
or the cold can of soda) is less than the tension developed, thus shortening the
muscle and resulting in mechanical work.
But muscles aren’t independent sole proprietors. Each muscle depends upon compan-
ions in a muscle group to assist in executing a particular movement. That’s why mus-
cles are categorized by their actions. The brain coordinates the following groups
through the cerebellum.
 Prime movers: Just as it sounds, these muscles are the workhorses that produce
movement.
 Antagonists: These muscles exist in opposition to prime movers.
 Fixators or fixation muscles: These muscles serve to steady a part while other
muscles execute movement. They don’t actually take part in the movement itself.
 Synergists: These muscles control movement of the proximal joints so that the
prime movers can bring about movements of distal joints.
Flex your knowledge of muscle tone and function with these practice questions:

Leveraging Muscular Power
Skeletal muscle power is nothing without lever action. The bone acts as a rigid bar, the
joint is the fulcrum, and the muscle applies the force. Levers are divided into the
weight arm, the area between the fulcrum and the weight; and the power arm, the area
between the fulcrum and the force. When the power arm is longer than the weight
arm, less force is required to lift the weight, but range, or distance, and speed are sac-
rificed. When the weight arm is longer, the range of action and speed increase, but
power is sacrificed. Therefore, 90 degrees is the optimum angle for a muscle to attach
to a bone and apply the greatest force.
Three classes of levers are at work in the body:
 Class I, or seesaw: The fulcrum is located between the weight and the force
being applied. An example is a nod of the head: The head-neck joint is the ful-
crum, the head is the weight, and the muscles in the back of the neck apply the
force.
 Class II, or wheelbarrow: The weight is located between the fulcrum and the
point at which the force is applied. An example is standing on your tiptoes: The
fulcrum is the joint between the toes and the foot, the weight is the body, and
the muscles in the back of the leg at the heel bone apply the force.
 Class III: The force is located between the weight and the fulcrum. An example is
flexing your arm and showing off your biceps: The elbow joint is the fulcrum, the
weight is the lower arm and hand, and the biceps insertion on the lower arm
applies the force.
101
Chapter 6: Getting in Gear: The Muscles

The direction in which the muscle fibers run also plays a critical role in leverage. Here
are the possible directions:
 Longitudinal: Fibers run parallel to each other, or longitudinally, the length of
the muscle. Example: sartorius.
 Pennate: Fibers attach to the sides of the tendon, which extends the length of
the muscle. These come in subcategories:
• Unipennate, where fibers attach to one side of the tendon; example: tibialis
posterior
• Bipennate, where fibers attach to two sides of the tendon; example: rectus
femoris
• Multipennate, where fibers attach to many sides of the tendon; example:
deltoideus
 Radiate: Fibers converge from a broad area into a common point. Example: pec-
toralis major.
 Sphincter: Fibers are arranged in a circle around an opening. Example: orbicularis
oculi.
The three types of fasciae, which Gray’s Anatomy describes as “dissectable, fibrous
connective tissues of the body,” are as follows:
 Superficial fasciae: Found under the skin and consisting of two layers: an outer
layer called the panniculus adiposus containing fat; and an inner layer made up of
a thin, membranous, and highly elastic layer. Between the two layers are the
superficial arteries, veins, nerves, and mammary glands.
 Deep fasciae: Holds muscles or structures together or separates them into
groups that function in unison. It’s a system of splitting, rejoining, and fusing
membranes involving
• An outer investing layer that’s found under the superficial fasciae covering
a large part of the body
• An internal investing layer that lines the inside of the body wall in the
torso, or trunk, region
• An intermediate investing layer that connects the outer investing layer and
the internal investing layer
 Subserous fasciae: Located between the internal investing layer of the deep fas-
ciae and the peritoneum. It’s the serous membrane that lines the abdominopelvic
cavity, also known as the peritoneal cavity.

What’s In a Name? Identifying Muscles
It may seem like a jumble of meaningless Latin at first, but muscle names follow a strict
convention that lets them be named for one or more of four things:
 Function: These muscle names usually have a verb root and end in a suffix (–or
or –eus), followed by the name of the affected structure. Example: levator scapu-
lae (elevates the scapulae).
 Compounding points of attachment: These muscle names blend the origin and
insertion attachment with an adjective suffix (–eus or –is). Examples: sternoclei-
domastoideus (sternum, clavicle, and mastoid process) and sternohyoideus
(sternum and hyoid).
 Shape or position: These muscle names usually have descriptive adjectives that
may be followed by the names of the locations of the muscles. Examples: rectus
(straight) femoris, rectus abdominus, and serratus (sawtooth) anterior.
 Figurative names: These muscle names are based on the muscles’ resemblance
to some objects. Examples: gastrocnemius (resembles the stomach) and trapez-
ius (resembles a tablet).

Answers to Questions on Muscles
The following are answers to the practice questions presented in this chapter.
a
Which of the following is not a true statement? a. Muscles represent 90 percent of the total
body weight. The average is less than half that, around 43 percent.
b
Muscle functions include c. converting chemical energy into mechanical work.
c
A necessary property for a muscle to perform work is b. contractility. If it doesn’t contract, it’s
not a muscle.
d
The cellular unit in muscle tissue is the c. fiber. When it comes to muscle, fiber equals cell
equals fiber.
e
A partial state of contraction, in part, defines b. tonus. That’s the elusive muscle “tone” for the
flabby amongst us.
f
It’s possible to completely relax every muscle in the body. b. False. If every muscle in the body
were to relax, the heart would stop beating and food would stop moving through the digestive
system.
g
During embryonic development, tissue development is called c. myogenesis.
To remember this stage of development, combine the Greek myo with genesis, or new 
beginning.
h
Exercise forms new muscle fibers. b. False. Exercise can’t form new fibers, but it can thicken
what’s already there.
i
This type of muscle tissue lacks cross-striations. b. Smooth. Without striations, this tissue can
contract slowly and for a very long time.
j
Skeletal muscle fibers are encased in a. a sarcolemma. That’s a thin membrane that helps move
stimuli.
k
Which muscle type appears only in a single organ? c. Cardiac. And that sole organ is the heart.
l
Intercalated discs b. may play a role in moving electrical impulses through the heart. There’s
evidence that these structures help keep the heart synchronized.
m
Myosin: d. A-band
n
Segment of fibril from Z-line to Z-line: e. Sarcomere
o
Less-dense region of the A-band: a. H-zone
p
Structure to which filaments are attached: b. Z-line
q
Actin: c. I-band
r
Which of these terms doesn’t belong in the following list? e. Sarcolemma. This is the mem-
brane encasing the myofibrils. All the other answer options refer to various protein structures.
s
This part of a muscle doesn’t change during contraction: b. The A-bands. All the other identi-
fied regions grow larger or smaller through the functions of myosin and actin.

t
A weak stimulus causes a muscle fiber to contract only partway. b. False. Muscle contractions
are all-or-nothing; there’s no such thing as a partial contraction.
u
Membrane covering a muscle fiber: e. Sarcolemma
v
Bundles of muscle fibers: d. Fasciculi
w
Connective tissue that surrounds a bundle of muscle fibers: a. Perimysium
x
Connective tissue through which arteries and veins enter muscle bundles: c. Trabecula
y
Flat, sheet-like tendon that serves as insertion for a large flat muscle: b. Aponeurosis
A
Muscles that tend to counteract or slow an action are called a. antagonists.
The muscles are against the action, so think of them as antagonistic.
B
Which of the following statements finishes this sentence and makes it not true: A contracting
muscle unable to move a load d. does no mechanical work and therefore doesn’t develop any
tension. This statement is false because the contraction of the muscle causes tension in all
cases.
C
A muscle contraction is referred to as c. a twitch. Keep in mind the twitch is the fundamental
measure of muscle activity.
D
Which of the following in Figure 6-3 is a Class II lever? b.
E
Which of the following would provide the force in a Class III lever? a. Biceps brachii. It’s the
Popeye weight-lifting class, after all.
F
Which of the following would produce a wide range of movement with speed while sacrificing
power? b. Long weight arm, short power arm. The longer the weight arm, the greater the
range of action and speed but the less power there is.
G
Identify the bipennate bundle arrangement. b. Rectus femoris. Keep in mind the muscle naming
conventions.
H
Which of the following is considered a dissectable connective tissue? c. Fasciae. This connec-
tive tissue can be found in most of the body.
I
The most extensive fascia in the body is b. deep.
J
In the naming of the muscles, the latissimus dorsi, the rectus abdominis, and the serratus ante-
rior are names based upon a. shape. Latissimus stems from the Latin for “wide,” rectus from the
Latin word for “straight,” and serratus from the Latin word for “notched” or “scalloped.”
K
In the naming of muscles, the sternocleidomastoid is based upon c. attachment. You can figure
out this answer by recalling that cleido stems from the Latin word for “collarbone.”
L
In humans, the origin of the biceps brachii would best include which of the following? 
a. Scapula
M
Which of the following are insertions for the triceps and biceps brachii? d. Radius and ulna

2
Which of the following is not included in the quadriceps group? c. Rectus abdominis. The term
abdominis is the giveaway here because it should make you think of the abdomen. The rest of
the quadriceps group is found in the upper leg, where they belong.
3
Where would you find the muscles called the biceps? e. Both a and c (arm and leg). Biceps is a
muscle with two heads or points of origin. Although people usually think of the biceps brachii
in the arm, you can’t forget about the biceps femoris at the back of the thigh.
4
What muscle divides the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity? a. Diaphragm. And with-
out it, you couldn’t breathe.
5
The gastrocnemius and the soleus contribute to the e. tendon of Achilles. The soleus lies
under the gastrocnemius in the calf of each leg.

It’s Skin Deep: The Integumentary
System
In This Chapter
 Going below the surface of the skin
 Getting on your nerves
 Checking out hair, nails, and glands
D
id you know that the skin is the body’s largest organ? In an average person, its 17 to 
20 square feet of surface area represents 15 percent of the body’s weight. Self-repairing
and surprisingly durable, the skin is the first line of defense against the harmful effects of
the outside world. It helps retain moisture; regulates body temperature; hosts the sense
receptors for touch, pain, and heat; excretes excess salts and small amounts of waste; and
even stores blood to be moved quickly to other parts of the body when needed.
Skin is jam-packed with components; it has been estimated that every square inch of skin
contains 15 feet of blood vessels, 4 yards of nerves, 650 sweat glands, 100 oil glands, 1,500
sensory receptors, and over 3 million cells with an average lifespan of 26 days that are con-
stantly being replaced.
In this chapter, we peel back the surface of this most-visible organ system. We also give you
plenty of opportunities to test your knowledge.
Dermatology Down Deep
Skin — together with hair, nails, and glands — composes the integumentary system (shown in
Figure 7-1). The name stems from the Latin verb integere, which means “to cover.” The rele-
vant Greek and Latin roots include dermato and cutis, both of which mean “skin.”
The skin consists of two primary parts: the epidermis and the dermis. (Recall the Greek root
epi–, which means “upon” or “above.”) Underlying the epidermis and dermis is the hypoder-
mis or superficial fascia (also sometimes called subcutaneous tissue), which acts as a founda-
tion but is not part of the skin. Composed of areolar (porous) and adipose (fat) tissue, it
anchors the skin through fibers that extend from the dermis. Underneath, the hypodermis
attaches loosely to tissues and organs so that muscles can move freely. Around elbow and
knee joints, the hypodermis contains fluid-filled sacs called bursae. The fat in the hypodermis
buffers deeper tissues and acts as insulation, preventing heat loss from within the body’s
core. The hypodermis also is home to pressure-sensitive nerve endings called lamellated or
Pacinian corpuscles that respond to a deeper poke in the skin.

Epidermis: Don’t judge this book by its cover
Epidermis, which contains no blood vessels, is made up of layers of closely packed
epithelial cells. From the outside in, these layers are the following:
 Stratum corneum (literally the “horny layer”) is about 20 layers of flat, scaly,
dead cells containing a type of water-repellent protein called keratin. These cells,
which represent about three-quarters of the thickness of the epidermis, are said
to be cornified, which means that they’re tough and horny like the cells that form
hair or fingernails. Humans shed this layer of tough, durable skin at a prodigious
rate; in fact, much of household dust consists of these flaked-off cells. Where the
skin is rubbed or pressed more often, cell division increases, resulting in calluses
and corns.
 Stratum lucidum (from the Latin word for “clear”) is found only in the thick skin
on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. This translucent layer of
dead cells contains eleidin, a protein that becomes keratin as the cells migrate
into the stratum corneum, and it consists of cells that have lost their nuclei and
cytoplasm.
Figure 7-1:
The integu-
mentary
system.
114
Part II: Weaving It Together: Bones, Muscles, and Skin 

 Stratum granulosum is three to five layers of flattened cells containing kerato-
hyalin, a substance that marks the beginning of keratin formation. No nourish-
ment from blood vessels reaches this far into the epidermis, so cells are either
dead or dying by the time they reach the stratum granulosum. The nuclei of cells
found in this layer are degenerating; when the nuclei break down entirely, the
cell can’t metabolize nutrients and dies.
 Stratum spinosum (also sometimes called the spinous layer) has ten layers con-
taining prickle cells, named for the spine-like projections that connect them with
other cells in the layer. Langerhans cells, believed to be involved in the body’s
immune response, are prevalent in the upper portions of this layer and some-
times the lower part of the stratum granulosum; they migrate from the skin to
the lymph nodes in response to infection. Some mitosis (cell division) takes
place in the stratum spinosum, but the cells lose the ability to divide as they
mature.
 Stratum basale (or stratum germinativum) is also referred to as the germinal layer
because this single layer of mostly columnar stem cells generates all the cells
found in the other epidermal layers. It rests on the papillary (rough or bumpy)
surface of the dermis, close to the blood supply needed for nourishment and
oxygen. The mitosis that constantly occurs here replenishes the skin; it takes
about two weeks for the cells that originate here to migrate up to the stratum
corneum, and it’s another two weeks before they’re shed. About a quarter of this
layer’s cells are melanocytes, cells that synthesize a pale yellow to black pigment
called melanin that contributes to skin color and provides protection against
ultraviolet radiation (the kind of radiation found in sunlight). The remaining 
cells in this layer become keratinocytes, the primary epithelial cell of the skin.
Melanocytes secrete melanin directly into the keratinocytes in a process called
cytocrine secretion. Merkel’s cells, a large oval cell believed to be involved in the
sense of touch, occasionally appear amid the keratinocytes.
In addition to melanin, the epidermis contains a yellowish pigment called carotene (the
same one found in carrots and sweet potatoes). Found in the stratum corneum and the
fatty layers beneath the skin, it produces the yellowish hue associated with Asian
ancestry or increased carrot consumption. The pink to red color of Caucasian skin is
caused by hemoglobin, the red pigment of the blood cells. Because Caucasian skin con-
tains relatively less melanin, hemoglobin can be seen more easily through the epider-
mis. Sometimes the limited melanin in Caucasian skin pools in small patches. Can you
guess the name of those patches of color? Yep, they’re freckles. Albinos, on the other
hand, have no melanin in their skin at all, making them particularly sensitive to ultravi-
olet radiation.
Ridges and grooves form on the outer surface of the epidermis to increase the friction
needed to grasp objects or move across slick surfaces. On hands and feet, these ridges
form patterns of loops and whorls — fingerprints, palm prints, and footprints — that
are unique to each person. You leave these imprints on smooth surfaces because of
the oily secretions of the sweat glands on the skin’s surface. In addition to these finer
patterns, the areas around joints develop patterns called flexion lines. Deeper and
more permanent lines are called flexion creases.
Dermis: It’s more than skin deep
Beneath the epidermis is a thicker, fibrous structure called the dermis, or corium. It
consists of the following two layers, which blend together:
 The outer, soft papillary layer contains elastic and reticular (net-like) fibers that
project into the epidermis to bring blood and nerve endings closer. Papillae
(finger-like projections) containing loops of capillaries increase the surface area
of the dermis and anchor the epidermis. Some of these papillae contain

Part II: Weaving It Together: Bones, Muscles, and Skin 
Meissner’s corpuscles, nerve endings that are sensitive to soft touch. It’s the
dermal papillae that form the epidermal ridges referred to as fingerprints.
 The inner, thicker reticular layer (from the Latin word rete for “net”) is made up of
dense, irregular connective tissue containing interlacing bundles of collagenous
and elastic fibers that form the strong, resistant layer used to make leather and
suede from animal hides. This layer is what gives skin its strength, extensibility,
and elasticity. Within the reticular layer are sebaceous glands (oil glands), sweat
glands, fat cells, and larger blood vessels.
Cells in the dermis include fibroblasts (from which connective tissue develops),
macrophages (which engulf waste and foreign microorganisms), and adipose tissue.
Thickest on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, the dermis is thinnest over
the eyelids, penis, and scrotum. It’s thicker on the back (posterior) than on the stom-
ach (anterior) and thicker on the sides (lateral) than toward the middle of the body
(medial). The various skin “accessories” — blood vessels, nerves, glands, and hair 
follicles — are embedded here.

Touching a Nerve in the 
Integumentary System
At least four kinds of receptors are involved in creating the sensation of touch.
 Free nerve endings: These afferent nerve endings are dendrites (branched exten-
sions) of sensory neurons that act primarily as pain receptors, although some
sense temperature, touch, and muscles (including the sensation of “stretch”).
Found all over the body, free nerve endings are especially prevalent in epithelial
and connective tissue. These small-diameter fibers have a swelling at the end
that responds to touch and sometimes heat, cold, or pain. Some of the endings
are disc-shaped structures called Merkel discs that function as light-touch recep-
tors within the deep layers of the epidermis.
 Meissner’s corpuscles: These light-touch mechanoreceptors lie within the
dermal papillae. They’re small, egg-shaped capsules of connective tissue sur-
rounding a spiraled end of a dendrite. Most abundant in sensitive skin areas such
as the lips and fingertips, these corpuscles and free nerve endings can sense a
quick touch but not a sustained one. That’s why your skin is able to ignore the
touch sensation of your own clothing.
 Pacinian corpuscles: These deep-pressure mechanoreceptors are dendrites 
surrounded by concentric layers of connective tissue. Found deep within the
dermis, they respond to deep or firm pressure and vibrations. Each is over 2 mil-
limeters long and therefore visible to the naked eye.
 Hair nerve endings: These mechanoreceptors respond to a change in position
of a hair. They consist of bare dendrites.
There are two primary temperature receptors, one for heat and one for cold:
 End-bulbs of Krause: Also known as Krause’s corpuscles, these cold receptors
usually activate below 68 degrees F (20 degrees C). They consist of a bulbous
capsule surrounding the dendrite and are commonly found throughout the body
in the dermis as well as in the lips, the tongue, and the conjunctiva of the eyes. 
 Brushes of Ruffini: Also known as Ruffini cylinders or Ruffini’s corpuscles, these
warmth receptors respond to temperatures between 77 degrees and 113 degrees F
(25 degrees to 45 degrees C). Found primarily in the dermis and subcutaneous
tissue, they’re dendrite endings enclosed in a flattened capsule. Because there
are fewer of them than Krause’s end-bulbs and because they lie in deeper tissue,
the body is less sensitive to heat than to cold.
In addition to the receptors for touch and temperature, the dermis has neuromuscular
spindles (also called proprioceptors) that transmit information to the spinal cord and
brain about the lengths and tensions of muscles. This information helps provide
awareness of the body’s position and the relative position of body parts. The spindles
also assist with muscle coordination and muscle action efficiency.

Accessorizing with Hair, Nails, and Glands
Mother Nature has accessorized your fashionable over-wrap with a variety of special-
ized structures that grow from the epidermis: hair, fingernails, toenails, sebaceous
glands, and sweat glands.
Wigging out about hair
Like most mammals, hair covers the entire human body except for the lips, eyelids,
palms of the hands, soles of the feet, nipples, and portions of external reproductive
organs. But human body hair generally is sparser and much lighter in color than that
sported by most other mammals. Animals have hair for protection and temperature
control. For humans, however, body hair is largely a secondary sex characteristic.
A thick head of hair protects the scalp from exposure to the sun’s harmful rays and
limits heat loss. Eyelashes block sunlight and deflect debris from the eyes. Hair in the
nose and ears prevents airborne particles and insects from entering. Touch receptors
connected to hair follicles respond to the lightest brush. The average adult has about
5 million hairs, with about 100,000 of those growing from the scalp. Normal hair loss
from an adult scalp is about 70 to 100 hairs each day, although baldness can result
from genetic factors, hormonal imbalances, scalp injuries, disease, dietary deficien-
cies, radiation, or chemotherapy.
Each hair grows at an angle from a follicle embedded in the epidermis and extending
into the dermis; scalp hairs sometimes reach as far as the hypodermis. Nerves reach
the hair at the follicle’s expanded base, called the bulb, where a nipple-shaped papilla
of connective tissue and capillaries provide nutrients to the growing hair. Epithelial
cells in the bulb divide to produce the hair’s shaft (the part that extends out of the folli-
cle). (The part of the hair within the follicle is called the root.) The shape of a hair’s
cross section can vary from round to oval or even flat; oval hairs grow out appearing
wavy or curly, flat hairs appear kinky, and round hairs grow out straight. Each scalp
hair grows for two to three years at a rate of about 1⁄3 to 1⁄2 millimeter per day, or 10 to
18 centimeters per year. When mature, the hair rests for three or four months before
slowly losing its attachment. Eventually, it falls out and is replaced by a new hair.

Part II: Weaving It Together: Bones, Muscles, and Skin 

Hair pigment (which is melanin, just as in the skin) is produced by melanocytes in the
follicle and transferred to the hair’s cortex and medulla cells. Three types of melanin —
black, brown, and yellow — combine in different quantities for each individual to pro-
duce different hair colors ranging from light blonde to black. Gray and white hairs grow
in when melanin levels decrease and air pockets form where the pigment used to be.
Wondering why you have to shampoo so often? Hair becomes oily over time thanks to
sebum, a mixture of cholesterol, fats, and other substances secreted from a sebaceous
(or holocrine) gland found next to each follicle. Sebum keeps both hair and skin soft, pli-
able, and waterproof. Attached to each follicle is a smooth muscle called an arrector pili
(literally “raised hair”) that both applies pressure to the sebaceous gland and straight-
ens the hair shaft, depressing the skin in a pattern called goose bumps or goose pimples.
Each hair is made up of three concentric layers of keratinized cells:
 A central core, called the medulla, consists of large cells containing eleidin that are
separated by air spaces; in fine hair, the medulla may be small or entirely absent.
 A cortex surrounding the medulla forms the major part of the hair shaft with sev-
eral layers of flattened cells. The cortex also has elongated pigment-bearing cells
in dark hair and air pockets in white hair.
 The outermost cuticle is a single layer of overlapping cells with the free end
pointing upward. The cuticle strengthens and compacts the inner layers, but
abrasion tends to wear away the end of the shaft, exposing the medulla and
cortex in a pattern known as split ends.
Nailing the fingers and toes
Human nails (which actually are vestigial claws) have three parts: a root bed at the nail
base, a body that’s attached to the fingertip, and a free edge that grows beyond the end
of the finger or toe. Heavily cornified tissue forms the nails from modified strata
corneum and lucidum. A narrow fold of the stratum corneum turns back to form the
eponychium, or cuticle. Under the nail, the nail bed is formed by the strata basale and
spinosum. At the base of the nail, partially tucked under the cuticle, the strata thicken
to form a whitish area called the lunula (literally “little moon”) that can be seen
through the nail. Beneath the lunula is the nail matrix, a region of thickened strata
where mitosis pushes previously formed cornified cells forward, making the nail grow.
Under the free edge of the nail, the stratum corneum thickens to form the hypony-
chium. Nails are pinkish in color because of hemoglobin in the underlying capillaries,
which are visible through the translucent cells of the nail.
On average, fingernails grow about 1 millimeter each week. Toenails tend to grow even
more slowly. Nails function as an aid to grasping, as a tool for manipulating small
objects, and as protection against trauma to the ends of fingers and toes.
Sweating the details
Humans perspire over nearly every inch of skin, but anyone with sweaty palms or
smelly feet can attest to the fact that sweat glands are most numerous in the palms
and soles, with the forehead running a close third. There are two types of sweat, or
sudoriferous, glands: eccrine and apocrine. Both are coiled tubules embedded in the
dermis or subcutaneous layer composed of simple columnar cells.
Eccrine glands are distributed widely over the body — an average adult has roughly
3 million of them — and produce the watery, salty secretion you know as sweat. Each
gland’s duct passes through the epidermis to the skin’s surface, where it opens as a
121
Chapter 7: It’s Skin Deep: The Integumentary System

sweat pore. The sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system controls when
and how much perspiration is secreted depending on how hot the body becomes.
Sweat helps cool the skin’s surface by evaporating as fast as it forms. About 99 percent
of eccrine-type sweat is water, but the remaining 1 percent is a mixture of sodium chlo-
ride and other salts, uric acid, urea, amino acids, ammonia, sugar, lactic acid, and
ascorbic acid.
Apocrine sweat glands are located primarily in armpits (known as the axillary region)
and the groin area. Usually associated with hair follicles, they produce a white, cloudy
secretion that contains organic matter. Although apocrine-type sweat contains the
same basic components as eccrine sweat and also is odorless when first secreted, bac-
teria quickly begin to break down its additional fatty acids and proteins — explaining
the post-exercise underarm stench. In addition to exercise, sexual and other emotional
stimuli can cause contraction of cells around these glands, releasing sweat.
Getting an earful
The occasionally troublesome yellowish substance known as earwax is secreted in the
outer part of the ear canal from modified sudoriferous glands called ceruminous glands
(the Latin word cera means “wax”). Lying within the subcutaneous layer of the ear
canal, these glands have ducts that either open directly into the ear canal or empty
into the ducts of nearby sebaceous glands. Technically called cerumen, earwax is the
combined secretion of these two glands. Working with ear hairs, cerumen traps any
foreign particles before they reach the eardrum. As the cerumen dries, it flakes and
falls from the ear, carrying particles out of the ear canal.

Answers to Questions on the Skin
The following are answers to the practice questions presented in this chapter.
a
The layer of epidermis in which mitosis takes place is the stratum e. basale.
This layer also is called the stratum germinativum, but a simpler memory tool is simply to
associate it with the “base” of the epidermis.
b
The papillary layer of the dermis e. all of the above. Busy little finger-like projections, those
papillae.
c
The function of the epidermal ridges on the fingers is to b. increase the friction of the epider-
mal surface. It’s Mother Nature’s way of helping you cling to tree branches or grab food.
d
The color of Caucasian skin is due to c. less melanin in the skin, allowing the blood pigment to
be seen. Here’s a fun experiment: Turn off the lights, press your fingers together, and hold a
flashlight under them. See the red glow? That’s hemoglobin, too.
e
The sequence of layers in the epidermis from the dermis outward is d. basale, spinosum,
granulosum, lucidum, corneum.
Memory tool time: Base, spine, grain, Lucy, corny. Or try the first letters of Be Super Greedy,
Less Caring. Insensitive, yes, but effective.
f
The subcutaneous layer of tissue can be called the b. superficial fascia. Subcutaneous is the
same as hypodermis (from the Greek hypo– for “beneath”).
g
The lines in fingerprints are determined by a. the contours of the dermal papillae.
h
A function not pertaining to the skin is e. provides movement. That would be in the realm of
muscles.
i
A layer of dense, irregular connective tissue containing interlacing bundles of collagenous and
elastic fibers is the b. reticular layer of the dermis. The description in this question sounds
like a tough structure, so it may help you to remember that the reticular layer is what’s used to
make leather from animal hides.
j
The stratum corneum cells contain a tough, water-repellant protein called c. keratin. Associate
the words “corneum” and “keratin,” and you’re in great shape.
k
The epidermal layer containing keratohyalin is the d. stratum granulosum. Keratohyalin even-
tually becomes keratin, so think of the layer where the cells are starting to die off.
l
The layer of skin attached to the superficial fascia is the e. reticular layer of the dermis.
Reticular means net-like; it makes sense that this netting lies between the dermis and the 
hypodermis.
m
Flattened and irregular cells with small, spine-like projections that connect them with other
cells in the layer are referred to as a. prickle cells. The spines make them look prickly, hence
the name.
n
If melanin forms into patches, it’s referred to as b. freckles. Ever noticed how kids have more
freckles at the end of a long summer spent outdoors? That’s ultraviolet radiation working on
those melanin patches.

o
The sensation of a soft touch is received by e. Meissner’s corpuscles. While it’s true that sev-
eral different nerves are involved in the overall sense of touch, the Meissner’s are the most
responsive to touch.
p
End-bulbs of Krause are receptors for cold that usually are activated at temperatures below 
c. 68 degrees F.
Specific temperatures may seem tough to remember, but look at it this way: When it’s 45
degrees F, you definitely need a jacket. When it’s 77 degrees F, you don’t. But when it’s 68
degrees F, you’ll want to carry a light jacket in case it gets colder. Voila! A cold receptor activa-
tion temperature!
q
The cuticle is also called the c. eponychium. Recall that the prefix ep– refers to “upon” or
“around,” whereas the prefix hypo– refers to “below” or “under.” The cuticle is around the base
of the nail, so it’s the eponychium, not the hyponychium.
r
Perspiration is formed by the e. sudoriferous glands. The Latin word sudor means “sweat.”
s
The cause of graying hair is d. lack of melanin in the shaft of the hair. Despite the medical
cause, people often suspect that answer “e. parenthood” has a lot to do with graying hair.
t
Hair develops from a(n) c. follicle. The Latin translation of this word is “small cavity” or “sac,”
so it makes sense that this would be an origination place.
u
The nails are modifications of the epidermal layers a. corneum and lucidum. These are the two
upper layers.
v
The muscle that straightens a hair and puts pressure on a gland causing it to secrete is the 
b. arrector pili muscle. “Arrector” is similar to “erector” (in fact, the muscle is sometimes
called that), which implies straightening, and the Latin word for “hair” is pili.
w
A factor not associated with baldness is d. lack of carotene. This answer just means that your
hair won’t turn orange, not necessarily that it will fall out of your scalp.
x
Sebaceous glands b. produce an oily mixture of cholesterol, fats, and other substances. That
secretion’s called sebum — hence “sebaceous glands.”
y
The bulb of the follicle of a hair contains epithelial cells (germinating cells) that are continuous
with the c. stratum germinativum. Germinating cells from the germinativum. Don’t forget,
though, that this layer also is called the stratum basale, or base stratum.
A
Cooling of the skin’s surface is aided by the e. sweat glands. The evaporation of perspiration
cools the skin naturally.
B
This gland contains true sweat, fatty acids, and proteins, and acquires an unpleasant odor
when bacteria breaks down the organic molecules it secretes. a. Apocrine sweat gland. These
are the truly stinky sweat glands.
Here’s a memory tool for the difference between apocrine and eccrine sweat glands: You may
have to APOlogize for your APOcrine glands but not your eccrine glands.
C
Which of the following is true about fingernails? d. They grow about 1 millimeter per week.
The other answer options are either just plain wrong or nonsensical.
D
The gland that secretes an oily mixture of cholesterol, fats, and other substances into hair
follicles to keep hair and skin soft, pliable, and waterproof is the b. sebaceous gland. Sebum,
sebaceous, oily — just don’t call it sweat.

Each of the chapters in this part delves into a different
major body system, starting with the respiratory system
and what a few deep breaths can do for the human
machine. Next up is the digestive system, fueling the
system with food; you follow a mouthful of food from its
entry in the mouth to expulsion of waste after every possi-
ble nutrient has been wrung from it. We check in on the cir-
culatory system and its blood-filled internal transit routes
that carry both nutrients and oxygen to every nook and
cranny of the body. Then it’s on to the lymphatic system’s
distribution of crucial immune system functions. Of course,
all this supply and transport is bound to lead to a waste
issue; we close out this part with a look at how the urinary
system collects the body’s trash and dispenses with it.

P
eople need lots of things to survive, but the most urgent need from moment to moment
is oxygen. Without a continual supply of this vital element, we don’t last long. But if we
have reserves of the other things we need — carbohydrates, fats, and proteins — why don’t
we have some kind of storehouse of oxygen, too? Simple. It’s readily available in the air
around us, so we’ve never needed to evolve a means for storing it. Nonetheless, our stored
food supplies would be useless without oxygen; our bodies can’t metabolize the energy they
need from these substances without a constant stream of oxygen to keep things percolating
along. All that metabolizing creates another equally important need, however. We must have
a means for getting rid of our bodies’ key gaseous waste — carbon dioxide, or CO2. If it
builds up in our systems, we die. It must be removed from our bodies almost as fast as it’s
formed. Conveniently, breathing in fulfills our need for oxygen and breathing out fulfills our
need to expel carbon dioxide.
In this chapter, you get a quick review of Mother Nature’s dual-purpose system and plenty of
opportunities to test your knowledge about the lungs and other parts of the respiratory
system.
Breathing In Oxygen, Breathing Out CO2
Respiration, or the exchange of gases between an organism and its environment, occurs in
three distinct processes:
 Breathing: The technical term is pulmonary ventilation, or the movement of air into
and out of the lungs. (Breathing is also called inspiration and expiration.)
 Exchanging gases: This takes place between the alveolar cells in the lungs, the blood,
and the body’s cells in two ways:
• Pulmonary, or external, respiration: The exchange in the lungs when blood
gains oxygen and loses carbon dioxide, transforming it from venous blood into
arterial blood
• Systemic, or internal, respiration: The exchange within systemic capillaries
when the blood releases some of its oxygen and collects carbon dioxide from the
tissues
 Cellular respiration: Oxygen is used in the catabolism of substances like glucose for
the production of energy (see Chapter 1).

Here are some key respiratory terms to keep in mind:
 Adult breathing rate: About 12 to 20 times per minute.
 Anoxia: Oxygen deficiency in which the cells either don’t have or can’t utilize
sufficient oxygen to perform normal functions.
 Asphyxia: Lack of oxygen with an increase in carbon dioxide in the blood and
tissues; accompanied by a feeling of suffocation leading to coma.
 Expiration or exhalation: The diaphragm returns to its domed shape as the
muscle fibers relax, via elastic recoil of the lungs and tissues lining the thoracic
cavity, the external intercostal muscles relax, and the internal intercostal muscles
contract. This movement pulls the ribs back into place, decreasing the volume of
the thoracic cavity and increasing pressure, forcing air out of the lungs.
 Hypoxia: Low oxygen content in the inspired air.
 Inspiration or inhalation: When the muscles of the diaphragm contract, its
dome shape flattens; simultaneously, the contraction of the external intercostal
muscles pulls the ribs upward and increases the volume of the thoracic cavity,
decreasing the intra-alveolar pressure. The pressure difference between the
atmosphere and the lungs diffuses air into the respiratory tract.
 Lung capacity: The vital capacity plus the residual air.
 Mediastinum: The region between the lungs extending from the sternum ven-
trally (at the front) to the thoracic vertebrae dorsally (at the back), and superi-
orly (top) from the entrance of the thoracic cavity to the diaphragm inferiorly
(at the bottom).
 Minimal air: The volume of air in the lungs when they’re completely collapsed
(150 cubic centimeters in an adult).
 Phrenic nerve: The nerve that innervates (stimulates) the diaphragm.
 Residual air: The volume of air remaining in the lungs after the most forceful
expiration (1,200 cubic centimeters in an adult).
 Respiratory centers: Nerve centers for regulating breathing located in the
medulla oblongata, or brain stem. The centers are influenced by the amount of
carbon dioxide in the blood.
 Tidal air: The volume of air inspired and expired in the resting state (500 cubic
centimeters in an adult).
 Vital capacity: The volume of air moved by the most forceful expiration after a
maximum inspiration. It represents the total moveable air in the lungs (4,600
cubic centimeters in an adult).
Here’s what happens as you breathe in and out (see Figure 8-1): Red blood cells use a
pigment called hemoglobin to carry oxygen and carbon dioxide throughout the body
through the circulatory system (for more on that system, turn to Chapter 10).
Hemoglobin bonds loosely with oxygen, or O2, to carry it throughout the body; the
bonded hemoglobin is called oxyhemoglobin.
After hemoglobin releases its oxygen molecules, it picks up carbon dioxide, or CO2, 
to deliver to the lungs for exhalation. The freshly bonded hemoglobin becomes 
carbohemoglobin (carbhemoglobin or carbaminohemoglobin).

Inhaling the Basics about 
the Respiratory Tract
We fill and empty our lungs by contracting and relaxing the respiratory muscles, which
include the dome-shaped diaphragm and the intercostal muscles that surround the rib
cage. As these muscles contract, air moves through a series of interconnected cham-
bers in the following order (see Figure 8-2): Nose →Pharynx →Larynx →Trachea →
Bronchi →Bronchioles →Alveolar ducts →Alveoli. We look at the details of each
chamber in that order.
Knowing about the nose (and sinuses)
You may care a great deal about how your nose is shaped, but the shape actually
makes little difference to your body. The nose is simply the most visible part of your
respiratory tract. Beyond those oh-so-familiar nostrils — which are formally called
nares — the septum divides the nasal cavity into two chambers called the nasal fossae.
The internal openings at the posterior of the fossae are called the choanae. Inside the
nostril is a slight dilation extending to the apex of the nose called the vestibule; it’s
lined by skin covered with hairs, plus mucous glands and sebaceous glands that help
trap dust and particles before they can enter the lungs.
Each nasal cavity is divided into an olfactory region and a respiratory region.
 The olfactory region lies in the upper part of the nasal cavity. Fine filaments dis-
tributed over its mucous membrane are actually special nerves devoted to the
sense of smell. The bipolar olfactory cells’ axons thread through openings in the
cribriform plate (from the Latin cribrum for “sieve”) and then come together to
form the olfactory nerve (cranial nerve I) that terminates in the olfactory cen-
ters of the brain’s cerebral cortex.
 The nasal cavity’s respiratory region is covered by a mucous membrane made
up of pseudostratified, ciliated columnar epithelium (remember the ten types of
epithelium in Chapter 4?) containing mucous and sebaceous glands. The secre-
tions from these glands form a protective layer that warms, moistens, and helps
132
Part III: Feed and Fuel: Supply and Transport 
a. Low O2 content in air breathed in
b. O2 lacking and excessive CO2
c. Gaseous exchange between 
capillaries and cells
d. Without O2 at the cell level
e. Gaseous exchange in lungs

to filter air as it’s inhaled. Beneath the protective layer, areolar connective tissue
containing lymphocytes (which form a thin lymphoid tissue) removes foreign
materials. A layer of blood vessels next to the periosteum (the membrane cover-
ing the surface of bones) forms a rich plexus (network) that tends to swell when
irritated or inflamed, closing the ostia (openings) of the nasal sinuses. Don’t you
just hate it when that happens?
Ah, the sinuses. They can be such headaches. Lined with a ciliated columnar epithe-
lium (refer to Chapter 4’s tissue discussion), sinuses are cavities in the bone that
reduce the skull’s weight and act as resonators for the voice. Each of the sinuses is
named for the bone containing it, as follows:
 Frontal sinuses are located in the front bone behind the eyebrows. (If you’ve
ever flown in an airplane with a sinus infection, these are the suckers that hit you
right behind the eyes.)
 Maxillary sinuses are located in the maxillae, or upper lip.
 Ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses are located in the ethmoid and sphenoid bones
in the cranial cavity’s floor.
Beyond the sinuses and connected to them are nasal ducts that extend from the medial
angle of the eyes to the nasal cavity. These ducts let serous fluid — a biology term
referring to any fluid resembling serum — from the eyes’ lacrimal glands (tear ducts)
flow into the nasal cavity.
The nasal cavity performs several important functions:
 It drains mucous secretions from the sinuses.
 It drains lacrimal secretions from the eyes.
 It prepares inhaled air for the lungs by warming, moistening, and filtering it. Dust
and bacteria are caught in the mucous and passed outward from the nasal cavity
by the motion of the cilia. Some of that gunk is taken up by lymphatic tissue in the
nasal cavity and respiratory tubes for delivery to the lymph nodes, which
destroy invading germs.
Beyond the nasal cavity is the nasopharynx, which connects — you guessed it — the
nasal cavity to the pharynx.
With a bit of a refresher on the nasal and sinus passages, do you think you can hit the
following practice questions on the nose?
13. Which of the following statements about the mucous membranes of the nasal cavity is 
not true?
a. They contain an abundant blood supply.
b. They moisten the air that flows over them.
c. They’re composed of stratified squamous epithelium.
d. They become inflamed, causing the membrane to swell and close the nasal sinuses.

Part III: Feed and Fuel: Supply and Transport 

 Pharynx: The pharynx is an oval, fibromuscular sac about 5 inches long and
tapering to 1⁄2 inch in diameter at its anteroposterior end, which is a fancy biology
term meaning “front to back.” In fact, the point where the pharynx connects to
the esophagus is the narrowest part of the entire digestive tract. Eustachian
tubes connected to the middle ears enter the pharynx on each side. On the back
wall of the pharynx is a mass of lymphoid tissue called the pharyngeal tonsil, or
adenoids.
 Larynx: Connecting the pharynx with the trachea, this collection of nine carti-
lages is what makes a man’s prominent Adam’s apple. Also called the voice box,
the larynx looks like a triangular box flattened dorsally and at the sides that
becomes narrow and cylindrical toward the base (see Figure 8-3). Ligaments con-
nect the cartilages controlled by several muscles; the inside of the larynx is lined
with a mucous membrane that continues into the trachea.
Three of the larynx’s nine cartilages go solo — the thyroid, the cricoid, and the 
epiglottis — while three more come in pairs — the arytenoids, the corniculates, and the
cuneiforms. The thyroid cartilage (thyroid in Greek means “shield-shaped) is largest
and consists of two plates called laminae that are fused just beneath the skin to form a
shield-shaped process, the Adam’s apple. Immediately above the Adam’s apple, the
laminae are separated by a V-shaped notch called the superior thyroid notch. The ring-
shaped cricoid cartilage is smaller but thicker and stronger, with shallow notches at
the top of its broad back that connect, or articulate, with the base of the arytenoid car-
tilages. The arytenoid cartilages both are shaped like pyramids, with the vocal folds
attached at the back and the controlling muscles that move the arytenoids attached at
the sides, moving the vocal cords. On top of the arytenoids are the corniculate carti-
lages, small conical structures for attachment of muscles regulating tension on the
vocal cords. Nestled in front of these and inside the aryepiglottic fold, the cuneiform
cartilages stiffen the soft tissues in the vicinity. The epiglottis, sometimes called the lid
on the voice box, is a leaf-shaped cartilage that projects upward behind the root of the
tongue. Attached at its stem end, the epiglottis opens during respiration and reflex-
ively closes during swallowing to keep food and liquids from getting into the respira-
tory tract.
Two types of folds play different roles inside the larynx. The true vocal folds, or cords,
are V-shaped when relaxed. When talking, the folds stretch for high sounds or slacken
for low sounds, causing the opening into the glottis — the opening in the larynx — to
form an oval. Sounds are produced when air is forced over the folds, causing them to
vibrate. Just above these folds are the ventricular vocal folds, also known as vestibular
or false folds, that don’t produce sounds. Muscle fibers within these folds help close
the glottis during swallowing.

Going deep inside the lungs
After the pharynx and larynx comes the trachea, more popularly known as the wind-
pipe. Roughly 6 inches long in adults, it’s a tube connected to the larynx in front of the
esophagus that’s made up of C-shaped rings of hyaline cartilage and fibrous connec-
tive tissue that strengthen it and keep it open. Like the larynx, the trachea’s lined with
mucous membrane covered in cilia. Just above the heart, the trachea splits into two
bronchi divided by a sharp ridge called the carina, with each leading to a lung. But
they’re not identical: The right primary bronchus is shorter and wider than the left pri-
mary bronchus. Each primary bronchus divides into secondary bronchi with a branch
going to each lobe of the lung; the right side gets three secondary bronchi while the
left gets only two. Once inside a designated lobe, the bronchus divides again into terti-
ary bronchi. The right lung has ten such branches: three in the superior (or upper)
lobe, two in the middle lobe, and five in the inferior (or lower) lobe. The left lung has
only four tertiary bronchi: two in the upper lobe and two in the lower lobe.
Each tertiary bronchi subdivides one more time into smaller tubes called bronchioles
(see Figure 8-4), which lack the supporting cartilage of the larger structures. Each
bronchiole ends in an elongated sac called the atrium (also known as an alveolar duct
or alveolar sac). Alveoli (or air cells) surround the atria, as do small capillaries that
pick up oxygen for delivery elsewhere in the body and dump off carbon dioxide
fetched from elsewhere. Overall, there are 23 branches in the respiratory system, with
a combined surface area (counting the alveoli) the size of a tennis court!
Knowing that the bronchi aren’t evenly distributed, you may have guessed that the
lungs aren’t identical either. You’re right. They’re both spongy and porous because of
the air in the sacs, but the right lung is larger, wider, and shorter than the left lung and
has three lobes. The left lung divides into only two lobes and is both narrower and
longer to make room for the heart because two-thirds of that organ lies to the left of
the body’s midline. Each lobe is made up of many lobules, each with a bronchiole
ending in an atrium inside.
Covering each lung is a thin serous membrane called the visceral pleura that folds back
on itself to form a second outer layer, the parietal pleura, with a pleural cavity between
the two layers. These two layers secrete a watery fluid into the cavity to lubricate the
surfaces that rub against each other as you breathe. When the pleural membrane
becomes inflamed in a condition called pleurisy, a sticky discharge roughens the
pleura, causing painful irritation. An accompanying bacterial infection means that pus
accumulates in the pleural cavity in a condition known as empyema.
137
Chapter 8: Oxygenating the Machine: The Respiratory System

Blood comes to the lungs through two sources: the pulmonary arteries and the
bronchial arteries. The pulmonary trunk comes from the right ventricle of the heart
and then branches into the two pulmonary arteries carrying venous blood (the only
arteries that contain blood loaded with carbon dioxide from various parts of the body)
to the lungs. That blood goes through capillaries in the lungs where the carbon dioxide
leaves the blood and enters the alveoli to be expelled during exhalation; oxygen leaves
the alveoli through the capillaries to enter the bloodstream. After that, oxygenated
arterial blood returns to the left atrium through the pulmonary veins (the only veins
that contain oxygenated blood), completing the cycle. Bronchial arteries branch off
the thoracic aorta of the heart, supplying the lung tissue with nutrients and oxygen.

In This Chapter

 Spending time in the stomach
 Passing through the intestines and other organs for enzyme digestion
I
t’s time to feed your hunger for knowledge about how nutrients fuel the whole package
that is the human body. In this chapter, we help you swallow the basics about getting
food into the system and digest the details about how nutrients move into the rest of the
body. You also get plenty of practice following the nutritional trail from first bite to final
elimination.
Digesting the Basics: It’s Alimentary!
Before jumping into a discussion on the alimentary tract, we need to review some basic
terms.
 Ingestion: Taking in food
 Digestion: Changing the composition of food — splitting large molecules into smaller
ones — to make it usable by the cells
 Deglutition: Swallowing, or moving food from the mouth to the stomach
 Absorption: Occurs when digested food moves through the intestinal wall and into
the blood
 Egestion: Eliminating waste materials or undigested foods at the lower end of the
digestive tract; also known as defecation
The alimentary tract develops early on in a growing embryo. The primitive gut, or archen-
teron, develops from the endoderm (inner germinal layer) during the third week after concep-
tion, a stage during which the embryo is known as a gastrula. At the anterior end (head end),
the oral cavity, nasal passages, and salivary glands develop from a small depression called 
a stomodaeum in the ectoderm (outer germinal layer). The anal and urogenital structures
develop at the opposite, or posterior, end from a depression in the ectoderm called the 
proctodaeum. In other words, the digestive tract develops from an endodermal tube with
ectoderm at each end.
Whereas the respiratory tract is a two-way street — oxygen flows in and carbon dioxide flows
out — the digestive tract is designed to have a one-way flow (although when you’re sick or
your body detects something bad in the food you’ve eaten, what goes down sometimes comes

back up). Under normal conditions, food moves through your body in the following
order (see Figure 9-1):
Mouth →Pharynx →Esophagus →Stomach →Small intestine →Large intestine
When you swallow food, it’s mixed with digestive enzymes in both saliva and stomach
acids. Circular muscles on the inside of the tract and long muscles along the outside of
the tract keep the material moving right through defecation at the end of the line.
Chew on these sample questions about the alimentary tract:

Nothing to Spit At: Into the Mouth 
and Past the Teeth
In addition to being very useful for communicating, the mouth serves a number of
important roles in the digestive process:
 Chewing, formally known as mastication, breaks down food mechanically into
smaller particles.
 The act of chewing increases blood flow to all the mouth’s structures and the
lower part of the head.
 Saliva from salivary glands in the mouth helps prepare food to be swallowed and
begins the chemical breakdown of carbohydrates.
 Taste buds on the tongue stimulate saliva production. Interestingly, studies have
shown that taste preferences can change in reaction to the body’s specific needs.
In addition, the smell of food can get gastric juices flowing in preparation for
digestion.
The mouth’s anatomy begins, of course, with the lips, which are covered by a thin,
modified mucous membrane. That membrane is so thin that you can see the red blood
145
Chapter 9: Fueling the Functions: The Digestive System

in the underlying capillaries. (That’s the unromantic reason for the lips’ natural rosy
glow.) The mouth itself is divided into two regions defined by the arches of the upper
and lower jaws. The vestibule is the region between these dental arches, cheeks, and
lips, whereas the oral cavity is the region inside the dental arches.
Entering the vestibule
The inner surface of the lips is covered by a mucous membrane. Sickle-shaped pieces of
tissue called labial frenula attach the lips to the gums. Within the mucous membrane
are labial glands, which produce mucus to prevent friction between the lips and the
teeth. The cheeks are made up of buccinator muscles and a buccal pad, a subcutaneous
layer of fat. The buccinator muscles keep the food between the teeth during the act of
chewing. Elastic tissue in the mucous membrane keeps the lining of the cheeks from
forming folds that would be bitten during chewing (usually — most people have bitten
the insides of their cheeks at one time or another). Also stashed away in the cheek, just
in front of and below each ear, is a parotid gland, which is the largest salivary gland; it
releases saliva through a duct opposite the second upper molar tooth. Two other pairs
of salivary glands also secrete into the mouth: the submaxillary glands along the side of
the lower jaw and the sublingual glands in the floor of the mouth near the chin.
The dental arches are formed by the maxillae (upper jaw) and the mandible (lower
jaw) along with the gingivae (gums) and teeth of both jaws. The gingivae are dense,
fibrous tissues attached to the teeth and the underlying jaw bones; they’re covered by
a mucous membrane extending from the lips and cheeks to form a collar around the
neck of each tooth. The gums are very vascular (meaning that lots of blood vessels run
through them) but poorly innervated (meaning that, fortunately, they’re not generally
very sensitive to pain).
Teeth rise from openings in the jawbone called sockets, or alveoli. You have a number
of different kinds of teeth, and each has a specific contribution to the process of biting
and chewing. Humans get two sets of teeth in a lifetime. The first temporary, or decidu-
ous, set is known as milk teeth. Babies between 6 months and 2 years old “cut,” or
erupt, four incisors, two canines, and two molars in each jaw. These teeth are slowly
replaced by permanent teeth from about 5 or 6 years of age until the final molars —
referred to as wisdom teeth — erupt between 17 and 25 years of age.
An adult human has the following 16 teeth in each jaw (for a total set of 32 teeth):
 Four incisors, which are chisel-shaped teeth at the front of the jaw for biting into
and cutting food
 Two canines, or cuspids, which are pointed teeth on either side of the incisors for
grasping and tearing
 Four premolars, or bicuspids, which are flatter, shallower teeth that come in pairs
just behind the canines
 Six molars, which are triplets of broad, flat teeth on either side of the jawbone for
grinding and mixing food prior to swallowing
Regardless of type, each tooth has three primary parts, which you can see in Figure 9-2:
 Crown: The part that projects above the gum
 Neck: The region where the gum attaches to the tooth
 Root: The internal structure that firmly fixes the tooth in the alveolus (socket)
146
Part III: Feed and Fuel: Supply and Transport 

Teeth primarily consist of yellowish dentin with a layer of enamel over the crown and 
a layer of cementum over the root and neck, which are connected to the bone by the
periodontal membrane. Cementum and dentin are nearly identical in composition to
bone; enamel consists of 94 percent calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate and is
thickest over the chewing surface of the tooth.
Depending on the structure of the tooth, the root can be a single-, double-, or even
triple-pointed structure. In addition, each tooth has a pulp cavity at the center that’s
filled with connective and lymphatic tissue, nerves, and blood vessels that enter the
tooth through the root canal via an opening at the bottom called the apical foramen.
Now you know why it hurts so much when dentists have to drill down and take out
that part of an infected tooth!
Moving along the oral cavity
The roof of the oral cavity is formed by both the hard palate, a bony structure covered
by fibrous tissue and the ever-present mucous membrane, and the soft palate, a mov-
able partition of fibromuscular tissue that prevents food and liquid from getting into
the nasal cavity. (It’s also the tissue that sometimes vibrates in sleep, causing a
sonorous grating sound referred to as snoring.) The soft palate hangs at the back of the
oral cavity in two curved folds that form the palatine arches. The uvula, a soft conical
process (or piece of tissue), hangs in the center between those folds.
Beyond the soft palate, the palatopharyngeal (or pharyngopalatine) arch curves sharply
toward the midline and blends with the wall of the pharynx, ending at the dorsum
(back) of the tongue. Another structure, the anterior palatoglossal (or glossopalatine)
arch, starts on the surface of the palate at the base of the uvula and continues in a wide
curve forward and downward, ending next to the posterior (back) one-third of the
tongue. At the base of these arches and between the folds lie the palatine tonsils — if a
surgeon hasn’t removed them because of frequent childhood infections. The faucial 
isthmus or oropharynx is the junction between the oral cavity and the pharynx
(described in detail in Chapter 8). It opens during swallowing and closes when you
move the dorsum of the tongue against the soft palate when breathing.
The tongue
The tongue, which is a tight bundle of interlaced muscles, and its associated mucous
membrane form the floor of the oral cavity. Two distinct groups of muscles — extrinsic
and intrinsic — are used in tandem for mastication (chewing), deglutition (swallowing),
and to articulate speech.
 The extrinsic muscles, which are used to move the tongue in different directions,
originate outside the tongue and are attached to the mandible, styloid processes
of the temporal bone and the hyoid and, along with a fold of mucous membrane
called the lingual frenulum, anchor the tongue.
 The intrinsic muscles are a complex muscle network allowing the tongue to
change shape for talking, chewing and swallowing.
Three primary types of papillae (nipple-shaped protrusions) cover the tongue’s for-
ward upper surface:
 Filiform papillae are fine, brush-like papillae that cover the dorsum, the tip, and
the lateral margins of the tongue. They’re the most numerous papillae and don’t
hold any taste buds.

Chapter 9: Fueling the Functions: The Digestive System

19.–30. Use the terms that follow to identify the parts of a tooth shown in Figure 9-2.
148
Part III: Feed and Fuel: Supply and Transport 
 Fungiform papillae are large, red, mushroom-shaped papillae scattered among
the filiform papillae. They have taste buds, which are special receptors that com-
municate taste signals to the brain.
 Vallate papillae, also called circumvallate papillae, are flattened structures, each
with a moat-like trough ringing it. There are 12 of these on the tongue, and they
surround a V-shaped furrow toward the back of the tongue called the sulcus 
terminalis.
There are no papillae on the back (posterior) one-third of the tongue; that part has
only a mucous membrane covering lymphatic tissue, which forms the lingual tonsils.
The salivary glands
As we explain in the earlier section “Entering the vestibule,” the oral cavity has three
pairs of salivary glands producing saliva. The submandibular (or submaxillary) salivary
glands are about the size of a walnut and release fluid onto the floor of the mouth,
under the tongue. The smallest pair of the trio, the sublingual salivary glands, lies near
the tongue under the oral cavity’s mucous membrane floor to release secretions
directly onto the mucous membrane.
And those secretions are nothing to spit at. Saliva does the following:
 Dissolves and lubricates food to make it easier to swallow
 Contains ptyalin, or salivary amylase, an enzyme that initiates chemical digestion
of certain carbohydrates
 Moistens and lubricates the mouth and lips, keeping them pliable and resilient
for speech and chewing
 Frees the mouth and teeth of food, foreign particles, and epithelial cells
 Produces the sensation of thirst to prevent you from becoming dehydrated
Following are some practice questions regarding the vestibule and oral cavity:
Q. The function of the mouth is
a. Mixing of solid foods with saliva
b. Breaking down of the milk pro-
tein by the enzyme rennin
c. Mastication or the breaking
down of food into small particles
d. A and c
e. A, b, and c
A. The correct answer is mixing of
solid foods with saliva and masti-
cation. The mouth does lots of
things, including mixing saliva 
into the food to add the enzyme
ptyalin, but that’s not rennin. With
answer options like these, it’s best
to stick to the basics.

Stomaching the Body’s Fuel
Deglutition (swallowing) occurs in three phases:
1. The tip of the tongue elevates slightly, pushing against the hard palate, sliding
food onto the back of the tongue, and ultimately propelling it toward the 
pharynx.
2. Tensor muscles tighten the palate while levator muscles raise it until the
palate meets the pharyngeal wall, sealing off the nasopharynx from the
oropharynx. 
This action momentarily stops breathing and ensures that food and fluid won’t
regurgitate through the nose — unless someone makes you laugh, of course.
3. The bolus (food mass) heads “down the hatch.”
The pharynx is an oval fibrous muscular sac, about 5 inches long. It opens into the
nasal cavity, the oral cavity, the larynx, and the esophagus. On the lateral walls are
located the openings to the Eustachian tubes, which connect with the middle ear. In
the posterior wall is a mass of lymphatic tissue, the pharyngeal tonsil or adenoid.
This “hatch,” borrowed nautical slang for the esophagus, is approximately 10 inches
long and 1⁄2 inch in diameter and carries food through three body regions: the neck, the
thorax, and the abdomen. It’s not a straight tube, but rather curves slightly to the left as
it passes through the diaphragm 1 inch to the left of the midline. The very thick walls 
of the esophagus are lined with non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium and
include a fibrous outer layer made up of elastic fibers that permit distention during 
swallowing (think of a snake swallowing a whole egg — there’s some major stretching
going on there). A muscular layer contains both longitudinal and circular layers of
smooth muscle. The circular layers contract in sequence, like a series of shrinking and
expanding rings, in a movement called peristalsis that forces the bolus downward. The
longitudinal layers act in concert with the circular muscles, pulling the esophagus over
the bolus as it moves downward.
All this pushing and pulling ultimately releases the bolus into the stomach, a pear-
shaped bag of an organ that lies just beneath the ribs and diaphragm. About 1 foot
long and 1⁄2 foot wide, a human stomach’s normal capacity is about 1 quart. When
empty, the stomach’s mucous lining lies in folds called rugae; rugae allow expansion of
the tummy when you gorge and then shrink the stomach when it’s empty to decrease
the surface area exposed to acid. Food enters the upper end of the stomach, called the
cardiac region, through a ring of muscles called the cardiac sphincter, which generally
remains closed to prevent gastric acids from moving up into the esophagus. The

dome-shaped area below the cardiac region is called the fundus region; it expands
superiorly with really big meals. The lower part of the stomach, shaped like the letter J,
is the pylorus. The middle part of the body of the stomach forms a large curve called
the greater curvature. The right, much shorter, border of the stomach’s body is
called the lesser curvature. The far end of the stomach remains closed off by the pyloric
sphincter until its contents have been digested sufficiently to pass into the duodenum
of the small intestine.
The wall of the stomach consists of three layers of smooth muscle lined by mucous
membrane and covered by the peritoneum (see Figure 9-3). The fibers of the outer
layer of muscle run longitudinally, the middle layer of muscle consists of circular fibers
that encircle the stomach, and the inner layer of muscle fibers runs obliquely only
along the fundus region. The stomach’s mucous membrane is covered with nonciliated
columnar epithelium containing mucous glands.
The three types of gastric glands in the stomach’s epithelium (lining) are
 Cardiac glands: Found in the cardiac region (of course)
 Pyloric glands: Secrete mucous in the pyloric region
 Fundic glands: Lined with chief cells and parietal cells and are located through-
out the stomach’s body and fundus
The three types of cells in the mucosa (lining) of the stomach are
 Mucous cells: Secrete mucin (mucous) to protect the mucosa from the high acid-
ity of the gastric juices
 Chief cells: Secrete pepsinogen, a precursor to the enzyme pepsin that helps
break down certain proteins into peptides. (Chief cells in children also produce
an enzyme called rennin, not found in adults, which acts upon milk proteins.)
 Parietal cells: Lie alongside chief cells and secrete the hydrochloric acid that
combines with pepsinogen to form pepsin to catalyze protein digestion
The peristaltic contractions that get the bolus into the stomach aren’t limited to the
esophagus. Instead, peristalsis continues into the musculature of the stomach and
stimulates the release of a hormone called gastrin. Within minutes, gastrin triggers
secretion of gastric juices that reduce the bolus of food to a thick semiliquid mass
called chyme, which passes through the pyloric sphincter into the small intestine
within one to four hours of the food’s consumption.
Gastric juices are thin, colorless fluids with an extremely acid pH that ranges from 1 to 4.
The quantity of acid released depends on the amount and type of food being digested.
One more part attached to the stomach that we should mention is the greater omen-
tum. This is a peritoneal fold that hangs like an apron from the greater curvature of the
stomach all the way down to the transverse colon, covering all the small intestine and
most of the large intestine. Also called a caul or velum, this lining can be laden with fat,
particularly in obese people.

Breaking Down the Work 
of Digestive Enzymes
So what exactly does all the work of digesting and breaking down food? That question
brings you back into the realm of proteins. Proteins called enzymes act as catalysts,
meaning that they initiate and accelerate chemical reactions without themselves being
permanently changed in the reaction. Enzymes are very picky proteins indeed; they’re
effective only in their own pH range, they catalyze only a single chemical reaction, they
act on a specific substance called a substrate, and they function best at 98.6 degrees
Fahrenheit, which just happens to be normal body temperature!
The following sections take you on a tour of the organs in which digestive enzymes do
their job.
Small intestine
Most enzyme reactions — in fact most digestion and practically all absorption of 
nutrients — takes place in the small intestine. Stretching 7 meters (which is nearly 
23 feet!), this long snake of an organ extends from the stomach’s pylorus to the ileoce-
cal junction (the point where the small intestine meets the large intestine), gradually
diminishing in diameter along the way.
Three regions of the small intestine play unique roles as chyme moves through it:
 Duodenum: The first section of the small intestine is also the shortest and
widest section. As partially digested food enters the duodenum, its acidity stimu-
lates the intestine to secrete the intestinal hormone enterocrinin, which controls
the secretion of intestinal juices, stimulates the pancreas to secrete its juices,
and stimulates the liver to secrete bile. Both the liver and pancreas share a
common opening into the duodenum. Lined with large and numerous villi, the
duodenum also has Brunner’s glands that secrete a clear alkaline mucous. The
glands are most numerous near the entry to the stomach and decrease in
number toward the opposite, or jejunum, end.
154
Part III: Feed and Fuel: Supply and Transport 

 Jejunum: This region of the small intestine also contains villi, but unlike the duo-
denum, it has numerous large circular folds at the beginning that decrease in
number toward the ileum end.
 Ileum: Peyer’s patches, which are aggregates of lymph nodes, line this region of
the small intestine, becoming largest and most numerous at the distal end. The
ileum opens into the cecum of the large intestine through the ileocaecal valve.
A microscopic look at the small intestine reveals circular folds called plicae circularis,
which project 3 to 10 millimeters into the intestinal lumen and extend anywhere from
half to entirely around the tube. These are permanent folds that don’t smooth out even
when the intestine is distended. Also present are finger-like projections called villi that
greatly increase the surface area through which the small intestine can absorb nutri-
ents. Each villus contains a network of capillaries and a central lymph vessel, or
lacteal, which contains a milk-white substance called chyle. Simple sugars, amino
acids, vitamins, minerals, and water are absorbed by the lacteal and combine to form
the triglycerides found in the blood. The surface of the villus is simple columnar
epithelium (if you can’t recall what that means, flip to Chapter 4). Electron microscopy,
which can magnify tissues far more than an optical microscope can, reveals that the
surface of each villus is further increased by microvilli. Peristalsis continues into the
small intestine, shortening and lengthening the villi to mix intestinal juices with food
and increase absorption. Intestinal glands lie in the depressions between villi, and
packed inside these glands are antimicrobial Paneth cells within glands called the
crypts of Lieberkühn, which secrete enzymes that assist pancreatic enzymes.
Intestinal juices contain three types of enzymes:
 Enterokinase has no enzyme action by itself, but when added to pancreatic
juices, it combines with trypsinogen to form trypsin, which can break down 
proteins.
 Erepsins, or proteolytic enzymes, don’t directly digest proteins but instead
complete protein digestion started elsewhere. They split polypeptide bonds,
separating amino acids.
 Inverting enzymes split disaccharides into monosaccharides as follows:
Enzyme
Disaccharide
Monosaccharides
Maltase
Maltose
Glucose + Glucose
Lactase
Lactose
Glucose + Galactose
Sucrase
Sucrose
Glucose + Fructose
Liver
The largest gland in the body, the liver is divided into a large right lobe and a small left
lobe by the falciform ligament, another peritoneal fold. Two smaller lobes — the
quadrate and caudate lobes — are found on the lower (inferior) and back (posterior)
sides of the right lobe. The quadrate lobe surrounds and cushions the gallbladder, a
pear-shaped structure that stores and concentrates bile, which it empties periodically
through the cystic duct to the common bile duct and on into the duodenum during
digestion. Bile aids in the digestion and absorption of fats; it consists of bile pigments,
bile salts, and cholesterol.
The liver secretes diluted bile through the hepatic ducts into the cystic duct and on
into the gallbladder. Liver tissue is made up of rows of cuboidal cells separated by
155
Chapter 9: Fueling the Functions: The Digestive System

microscopic blood spaces called sinusoids. Blood from the interlobular veins and arter-
ies circulates through the sinusoids with food and oxygen for the liver cells, picking up
materials along the way. The blood then enters the intralobular veins, which carry it to
the sublobular veins, which empty into the hepatic vein, which leads to the inferior
vena cava. Bile secreted from the liver cells is carried by biliary canaliculi (bile capil-
laries) to the bile ducts and then to the hepatic ducts.
Considering the number of vital roles the liver plays, the complexity of that process
isn’t too surprising. Among the liver’s various functions are
 Production of blood plasma proteins including albumin, antibodies to fend off
disease, a blood anticoagulant called heparin that prevents clotting, and bile pig-
ments from red blood cells, the yellow pigment bilirubin, and the green bile pig-
ment biliverdin
 Storage of vitamins and minerals as well as glucose in the form of glycogen
 Conversion and utilization through enzyme activity of fats, carbohydrates, and
proteins
 Filtering and removal of nonfunctioning red blood cells, toxins (isolated by
Kupffer cells in the liver) and waste products from amino acid breakdown, such
as urea and ammonia
Unfortunately, a number of serious diseases can damage the liver. The hepatitis virus
inflames the gland, and cirrhosis caused by repeated toxic injury (often through alco-
hol or other substance abuse) destroys Kupffer cells and replaces them with scar
tissue. Also, painful gallstones can develop when cholesterol clumps together to form
a center around which the gallstone can form.
Pancreas
Equally important. though not as large as the liver, the pancreas looks like a roughly 
7-inch long, irregularly shaped prism. It has a broad head lodged in the curve of the
duodenum. The head is attached to the body of the gland by a slight constriction
called the neck, and the opposite end gradually tapers to form a tail. The pancreatic
duct extends from the head to the tail, receiving the ducts of various lobules that
make up the gland. It generally joins the common bile duct, but some 40 percent of
humans have a pancreatic duct and a common bile duct that open separately into 
the duodenum.
Uniquely, the pancreas is both an exocrine gland, meaning that it releases its secretion
externally either directly or through a duct, and an endocrine gland, meaning that it
produces hormonal secretions that pass directly into the bloodstream without using a
duct. However, most of the pancreas is devoted to being an exocrine gland secreting
pancreatic juices into the duodenum. The endocrine portion of the gland secretes
insulin vital to the control of sugar metabolism in the body through small, scattered
clumps of cells known as islets of Langerhans. Because it contains sodium bicarbonate,
pancreatic juice is alkaline, or base, with a pH of 8. Enzymes released by the pancreas
act upon all types of foods, making its secretions the most important to digestion. Its
enzymes include pancreatic amylase, or carbohydrate enzymes; pancreatic lipase, or
fat enzymes; trypsin, or protein enzymes; and nuclease, or nucleic acid enzymes.
The most commonly known pancreatic disease is called diabetes mellitus, or sugar
diabetes, which occurs when the islets of Langerhans cease producing insulin. Without
insulin, the body can’t use sugar, which builds up in the blood and is excreted by the
kidneys.

Large intestine
After chyme works its way through the small intestine, it then must move through
5 feet or so of large intestine. The byproduct of the small intestine’s work enters at the
ileocaecal valve and then moves through the following regions of the large intestine:
Cecum →Vermiform appendix →Ascending colon→Transverse colon →
Descending colon →Sigmoid colon →Rectum →Anus
The large intestine is about 3 inches wide at the start and decreases in width all the
way to the anus. As the unabsorbed material moves through the large intestine, excess
water is reabsorbed, drying out the material. In fact, most of the body’s water absorp-
tion takes place in the large intestine. Peristaltic movement continues, albeit rather
feebly, in the cecum and ascending colon. The large intestine has a longitudinal muscle
layer in the form of three bands running from the cecum to the rectum called the
taenia coli. The large intestine serves no digestive function and secretes only mucus.
It has no villi, nor does it have any intestinal glands. Truly, it is the end of the line.
That’s a lot of material to digest. See how much you remember:

The sequential contraction of circular muscles as food moves through the esophagus is called
d. peristalsis.
A bit of Greek may help you remember this term, which comes from the word peristaltikos,
which means “to wrap around.”
2
Two muscular rings control movement of food into and out of the stomach. They’re called c.

The lower part of the stomach that’s shaped like a J is called the b. pylorus. This question calls
upon your knowledge of Greek prefixes and suffixes: pyl– means “gate,” and –orus means
“guard.”

Food that’s ready to leave the stomach has been reduced to a thick, semiliquid mass called 
d. chyme.
A silly but effective memory tool for this term is this: When food is ready to leave the stomach,
it rings a chime.

The muscle that contracts to prevent gastric juices of the stomach from entering the esophagus
is the b. cardiac sphincter.
To remember this one, keep in mind that the sphincter that serves this purpose is the closest
digestive sphincter to the heart.

The organ in which most digestion occurs is the e. small intestine. It’s certainly the longest
path for the food to follow! Seeing as the food spends the most time there, it makes sense that
it’s the site of a lot of digestion.

The enzyme found in the intestinal juices that activates the pancreatic enzyme into an active
enzyme that can break down protein is called e. enterokinase.
It’s tricky to remember which of these enzymes is inactive until it combines with something
else. You can either try to memorize the function of each enzyme, or you can pick apart the
terms. The prefix entero– comes from the Greek word for “intestine.” The suffix –kinase stems
from the Greek word for “moving.” “Moving through the intestine” sounds like a good guess,
don’t you think?

What structure of the small intestine is composed of a network of capillaries with a central
lymph vessel or lacteal, which contains a milky-white substance? b. Villi. A network of capillar-
ies must be pretty small, and villi are definitely small. Besides, all but one of the other answer
options — rugae, islets of Langerhans, and plicae circularis — aren’t even in the small intestine.

Microscopical1y, the liver is composed of rows of cuboidal cells with small blood spaces run-

his chapter gets to the heart of the well-oiled human machine to see how its central
pump is the hardest-working muscle in the entire body. From a month after you’re con-
ceived to the moment of your death, this phenomenal powerhouse pushes a liquid connec-
tive tissue — blood — and its precious cargo of oxygen and nutrients to every nook and
cranny of the body, and then it keeps things moving to bring carbon dioxide and waste
products back out again. In the first seven decades of human life, the heart beats roughly
2.5 billion times. Do the math: How many pulses has your ticker clocked if the average heart
keeps up a pace of 72 beats per minute, 100,000 per day, or roughly 36 million per year?
Moving to the Beat of a Pump
Also called the cardiovascular system, the circulatory system includes the heart, all blood
vessels, and the blood that moves endlessly through it all (see Figure 10-1). It’s what’s
referred to as a closed double system; the term “closed” is used for three reasons: because 
the blood is contained in the heart and its vessels; because the vessels specifically target the
blood to the tissues; and because the heart critically regulates blood flow to the tissues. 
The system is called “double” because there are two distinct circuits and cavities within the
heart separated by a wall of muscle called the septum. (Each cavity in turn has two chambers
called atria on top and ventricles below). The double circuits are the following:
 The pulmonary circuit carries blood to and from the lungs for gaseous exchange.
Centered in the right side of the heart, this circuit receives blood saturated with
carbon dioxide from the veins and pumps it through the pulmonary artery (or trunk)
to capillaries in the lungs, where the carbon dioxide departs the system. That same
blood, freshly loaded with oxygen, then returns to the left side of the heart through
the pulmonary veins where it enters the second circuit.
 The systemic circuit uses the oxygen-rich blood to maintain a constant internal environ-
ment around the body’s tissues. From the left side of the heart, the blood moves
through the aorta to a variety of systemic arteries for distribution throughout the body.

After oxygen is exchanged for carbon dioxide, the blood returns to the pul-
monary circuit on the right side of the heart via the superior and inferior venae
cavae (the singular is vena cava).
Although cutely depicted in popular culture as uniformly curvaceous, the heart actu-
ally looks more like a blunt, muscular cone (roughly the size of a fist) resting on the
diaphragm. A fluid-filled, fibrous sac called the pericardium (or heart sac) wraps
loosely around the package; it’s attached to the large blood vessels emerging from the
heart but not to the heart itself. The sternum (breastbone) and third to sixth costal
cartilages of the ribs provide protection in front of (ventrally to) the heart. Behind it lie
the fifth to eighth thoracic vertebrae. Two-thirds of the heart lies to the left of the
body’s center, with its apex (cone) pointed down and to the left. At less than 5 inches
long and a bit more than 3 inches wide, an adult human heart weighs around 10
ounces — a couple ounces shy of a can of soda.
Three layers make up the wall of the heart.
 On the outside lies the epicardium (or visceral pericardium), which is composed
of fibroelastic connective tissue dappled with adipose tissue (fat) that fills exter-
nal grooves called sulci (the singular is sulcus). The larger coronary vessels and
nerves are found in the adipose tissue that fills the sulci.
 Beneath the epicardium lies the myocardium, which is composed of layers and
bundles of cardiac muscle tissue.
 The endocardium, the heart’s interior lining, is composed of simple squamous
endothelial cells.

Too much to remember? To keep the layers straight, turn to the Greek roots. Epi– is
the Greek term for “upon” or “on” whereas endo– comes from the Greek endon mean-
ing “within.” The medical definition of myo– is “muscle.” And peri– comes from the
Greek term for “around” or “surround.” Hence the epicardium is on the heart, the
endocardium is inside the heart, the myocardium is the muscle between the two,
and the pericardium surrounds the whole package. By the way, the root cardi– comes
from the Greek word for heart, kardia. 
The pericardium is made up of two parts — a tough inelastic sac called the fibrous peri-
cardium on the outside and a serous (or lubricated) membrane nearer the heart called
the parietal pericardium. Between the serous layers of the epicardium and the parietal
pericardium is the small pericardial space and its tiny amount of lubricating pericardial
fluid. This watery substance prevents irritation during systole (contraction of the
heart) and diastole (relaxation of the heart).

Finding the Key to the Heart’s Chambers
The heart’s lower two chambers, the ventricles, are quite a bit larger than the two atria
up top. Yet the proper anatomical terms for their positions refer to the atria as being
“superior” (above) and the ventricles “inferior” (below). In this case, size isn’t the
issue at all.
The atria
Sometimes referred to as “receiving chambers” because they receive blood returning
to the heart through the veins, each atrium has two parts: a principal cavity with a
smooth interior surface and an auricle, a smaller, dog-ear-shaped pouch with muscular
ridges inside called pectinate muscles, or musculi pectinati, that resemble the teeth of a
comb.
The right atrium appears slightly larger than the left and has somewhat thinner walls
than the left. Its principal cavity, the sinus venarum cavarum, is between the two vena
cavae and the atrioventricular (between an atrium and a ventricle) openings. The point
where the right atrium’s auricle joins with its principal cavity is marked externally by
the sulcus terminalis and internally by the crista terminalis. Openings into the right
atrium include the following:
 The superior vena cava, which has no valve and returns blood from the head,
thorax, and upper extremities and directs it toward the atrioventricular opening
 The inferior vena cava, which returns blood from the trunk and lower extremities
and directs it toward the fossa ovalis in the interatrial septum, which also has no
valve
 The coronary sinus, which opens between the inferior vena cava and the atrio-
ventricular opening, returns blood from the heart, and is covered by the ineffec-
tive Thebesian valve
 An atrioventricular opening covered by the tricuspid valve
166

a. Visceral pericardium
b. Sulci
c. Endocardium
d. Myocardium
e. Parietal pericardium

 The fossa ovalis is an oval depression in the interatrial septum that corresponds
to the foramen ovale of the fetal heart. If the foramen ovale does not close at
birth, it causes a condition known as “blue baby.”
The left atrium’s principal cavity contains openings for the four pulmonary veins, two
from each lung, which have no valves. Frequently, the two left veins share a common
opening. The left auricle, a dog-ear-shaped blind pouch, is longer, narrower, and more
curved than the right, marked interiorly by the pectinate muscles, and the left atrium’s
atrioventricular (or AV) opening is smaller than on the right and is protected by the
mitral, or bicuspid, valve.
The ventricles
The heart’s ventricles are sometimes called the pumping chambers because it’s their
job to receive blood from the atria and pump it back to the lungs and out into the
body’s network of arteries. More force is needed to move the blood great distances,
so the myocardium of the ventricles is thicker than that of either atrium, and the
myocardium of the left ventricle is thicker than that of the right.
The right ventricle only has to move blood to the lungs, so its myocardium is only one-
third as thick as that of its neighbor to the left. Roughly triangular in shape, the right
ventricle occupies much of the sternocostal (front) surface of the heart and forms the
conus arteriosus where it joins the pulmonary artery, or trunk. The right ventricle
extends downward toward where the heart rests against the diaphragm. A circular
opening into the pulmonary trunk is covered by the pulmonary semilunar valve, so-
called because of its three crescent-shaped cusps. When the ventricle relaxes, the
blood from the pulmonary artery tends to flow back toward the ventricle, filling the
pockets of the cusps and causing the valve to close. The oval AV opening is sur-
rounded by a strong fibrous ring and covered by the tricuspid valve, named after its
three unequally sized cusps. The atrial surface of the tricuspid valve is smooth, but
the side toward the ventricle is irregular, forming a ragged edge where the chordae
tendineae attach. These fibrous cords, which are attached to nipple-shaped projec-
tions called papillary muscles in the ventricle’s wall, prevent blood from flowing back
into the atrium. Cardiac muscle in the ventricle’s wall is in an irregular pattern of bun-
dles and bands called the trabeculae carneae.
Longer and more conical in shape, the left ventricle’s tip forms the apex of the heart.
Its walls are three times thicker than those of the right ventricle. Its AV opening is
smaller than that in the right ventricle and is covered by the bicuspid, or mitral, valve
that’s comprised of two unequal cusps. This ventricle’s chordae tendineae are fewer,
thicker, and stronger, and they’re attached by only two larger papillary muscles, one
on the front (anterior) wall and one on the back (posterior). More ridges are packed
more densely in the muscular trabeculae carneae. Its opening to the aorta is protected
by the aortic semilunar valve, composed of three half-moon cusps that are larger,
thicker, and stronger than the pulmonary valve’s cusps. Between these cusps and the
aortic wall are dilated pockets called aortic sinuses, which are openings for the coro-
nary arteries.

Conducting the Heart’s Music
The mighty, nonstop heart keeps up its rhythm because of a carefully choreographed
dance of electrical impulses called the conduction system that has the power to pro-
duce a spontaneous rhythm and conduct an electrical impulse. Four structures play
key roles in this dance — the sinoatrial node, atrioventricular node, atrioventricular
bundle, and Purkinje fibers. (You can see them in Figure 10-4.) Each is formed of highly
tuned modified cardiac muscle. Rather than both contracting and conducting impulses
as other cardiac muscle does, these structures specialize in conduction alone, setting
the pace for the rest of the heart. Following is a bit more information about each one:
 Sinoatrial node: This node really is the pacemaker of the heart. Located at the
junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium, this small knot, or mass,
of specialized heart muscle initiates an electrical impulse that moves over the
musculature of both atria, causing atrial walls to contract simultaneously and
emptying blood into both ventricles. It’s also called the S-A node, sinoauricular
node, and sinus node.
 Atrioventricular node: The impulse that starts in the S-A node moves to this mass
of modified cardiac tissue that’s located in the septal wall of the right atrium. Also
called the A-V node, it directs the impulse to the A-V bundles in the septum.
 Atrioventricular bundle: From the A-V node, the impulse moves into the atri-
oventricular bundle, also known as the A-V bundle or bundle of His (pronounced
“hiss”). The bundle breaks into two branches that extend down the sides of the
interventricular septum under the endocardium to the heart’s apex.
 Purkinje fibers: At the apex, the bundles break up into terminal conducting fibers,
or Purkinje fibers, and merge with the muscular inner walls of the ventricles. The
pulse then stimulates ventricular contraction that begins at the apex and moves
toward the base of the heart, forcing blood toward the aorta and pulmonary artery.
One of the best ways to detect cardiac tissue under a microscope is to look for undu-
lating double membranes called intercalated discs separating adjacent cardiac muscle
fibers. Gap junctions in the discs permit ions to pass between the cells, spreading the

action potential of the electrical impulse and synchronizing cardiac muscle contrac-
tions. Potential problems include fibrillation, a breakdown in rhythm or propagation of
the impulses that causes individual fibers to act independently, and heart block, an
interruption that causes the atria and ventricles to take on their own rates of contrac-
tion. Usually the atria contract faster than the ventricles.

A healthy heart makes a “lub-dub” sound as it beats. The first sound (the “lub”) is
heard most clearly near the apex of the heart and comes at the beginning of ventricu-
lar systole (the closing of the atrioventricular valves and opening of the semilunar
valves). It’s lower in pitch and longer in duration than the second sound (the “dub”),
heard most clearly over the second rib, which results from the semilunar valves clos-
ing during ventricular diastole. Defects in the valves can cause turbulence or regurgita-
tion of blood that can be heard through a stethoscope. Called murmurs, these sounds
indicate imperfect closure of one or more valves.

Riding the Network of Blood Vessels
Blood vessels come in three varieties, which you can see illustrated in Figure 10-5:
 Arteries carry blood away from the heart. The largest artery is the aorta. Small
ones are called arterioles, and microscopically small ones are called metarterioles.
 Veins carry blood toward the heart; all veins except the pulmonary veins contain
deoxygenated blood. Small ones are called venules, and large venous spaces are
called sinuses.
 Microscopically small capillaries carry blood from arterioles to venules, but
sometimes tiny spaces in the liver and elsewhere called sinusoids replace 
capillaries.
The walls of arteries and veins have three layers: the outermost tunica externa (some-
times called tunica adventitia) composed of white fibrous connective tissue, a central
“active” layer called the tunica media composed of smooth muscle fibers and yellow
elastic fibers, and an inner layer called the tunica intima made up of endothelium that
aids in preventing blood coagulation by reducing the resistance of blood flow. Arterial
walls are very strong, thick, and very elastic to withstand the great pressure to which
the arteries are subjected. Arteries have no valves. 
There are two types of arteries: elastic and muscular. In elastic arteries, found prima-
rily near the heart, the tunica media is composed of yellow elastic fibers that stretch
172
Part III: Feed and Fuel: Supply and Transport 

with each systole and recoil during diastole; essentially they act as shock absorbers to
smooth out blood flow. In muscular arteries, the tunica media consists primarily of
smooth muscle fibers that are active in blood flow and distribution of blood. The
larger blood vessels have smaller blood vessels, the vasa vasorum, that carry nourish-
ment to the vessel wall.
While larger in diameter than arteries, veins have thinner walls and are less distensible
and elastic. Veins that carry blood against the force of gravity, such as those in the legs
and feet, contain valves to prevent backsliding into the capillaries. Normally the blood
that veins are returning to the heart is unoxygenated (contains carbon dioxide); the
one exception is the pulmonary vein, which returns oxygenated blood to the heart
from the lungs.
Capillaries are breathtakingly tiny and capable of forming vast networks, or capillary
beds. Their walls are a single layer of squamous endothelial cells. Precapillary 
sphincters take the place of valves to regulate blood flow. All exchange occurs at 
the capillaries.
Blood from the digestive tract takes a detour through the hepatic portal vein to
the liver before continuing on to the heart. Called the hepatic portal system, this 
circuitous route helps regulate the amount of glucose circulating in the bloodstream
(see Figure 10-6). As the blood flows through the sinusoids of the liver, hepatic
parenchymal cells remove the nutrient materials. Phagocytic cells in the sinusoids
remove bacteria and other foreign materials from the blood. The blood exits the liver
by the hepatic veins, which carry it to the inferior vena cava, which ultimately returns
it to the heart.

Beating from the Start: Fetal Circulation
Because nutrients and oxygen come from the mother’s bloodstream, fetal circulation
requires extra vessels to get the job done. Two umbilical arteries — the umbilical vein
and the ductus venosus — fill the bill. Fetal blood leaves the placenta through the
umbilical vein, which branches at the liver to become the ductus venosus before enter-
ing the inferior vena cava that carries blood to the right atrium and then through a
hole in the septum called the foramen ovale into the left atrium. From there it flows
into the left ventricle and is pumped through the aorta to the head, neck, and upper
extremities. It returns to the heart through the superior vena cava, to the right atrium,
to the right ventricle, to the pulmonary trunk (lungs inactive), goes through the ductus
arteriosus into the aorta, to the abdominal and pelvic viscera and lower extremities,
and to the placenta through the umbilical artery. After birth, these circulation path-
ways quickly shut down, eventually leaving a depression in the septum, the fossa
ovale, where the hole of the foramen ovale once was.
Now is your chance to practice circulating through the circulatory system:

 Delving into lymphatic ducts
 Noodling around with nodes
 Exploring the lymphatic organs
You see it every rainy day — water, water everywhere, rushing along gutters and down
storm drains into a complex underground system that most would rather not give a
second thought. Well, it’s time to give hidden drainage systems a second thought: Your
body has one. You already know that the body is made up mostly of fluid. Interstitial or
extracellular fluid moves in and around the body’s tissues and cells constantly. It leaks out
of blood capillaries at the rate of nearly 51 pints a day, carrying various substances to and
away from the smallest nooks and crannies. Most of that fluid gets reabsorbed into blood
capillaries. But the one or two liters of extra fluid that remain around the tissues become a
substance called lymph that needs to be managed to maintain fluid balance in the internal
environment. That’s where the lymphatic system steps in, forming an alternative route for
the return of tissue fluid to the bloodstream.
But the lymphatic system is more than a drainage network. It’s a body-wide filter that traps
and destroys invading microorganisms as part of the body’s immune response network. It
can remove impurities from the body, help absorb and digest excess fats, and maintain a
stable blood volume despite varying environmental stresses. Without it, the cardiovascular
system would grind to a halt.
We bet that you won’t take your little lymph nodes for granted anymore after you’re done
with this chapter.
Duct, Duct, Lymph
The story of the lymphatic system (shown in Figure 11-1) begins deep within the body’s tis-
sues at the farthest reaches of blood capillaries, where nutrients, plasma, and plasma pro-
teins move out into cells, while waste products like carbon dioxide and the fluid carrying
those molecules move back in through a process known as diffusion. Roughly 10 percent of
the fluid that leaves the capillaries remains deep within the tissues as part of the interstitial
(meaning “between the tissues”) fluid. But in order for the body to maintain sufficient
volume of water within in the circulatory system, eventually this plasma and its protein must
get back into the blood. So the lymphatic vessels act as a recycling system to gather, trans-
port, cleanse, and return this fluid to the bloodstream.

To collect the fluid, minute vessels called lymph capillaries are woven throughout the body, with a
few caveats and exceptions. There are no lymph capillaries in the central nervous system, teeth,
outermost layer of the skin, certain types of cartilage, any other avascular tissue, and bones. And
because bone marrow makes lymphocytes, which we explain in the next section, it’s considered
part of the lymphatic system. Plus, lacteals (lymphatic capillaries found in the villi of the intes-
tines) absorb fats to mix with lymph, forming a milky fluid called chyle. (See Chapter 9 for details
on lacteals.) Unlike blood capillaries, lymph capillaries dead-end (terminate) within tissue. Made
up of loosely overlapping endothelial cells anchored by fine filaments, lymph capillaries behave
as if their walls are made of cellular one-way valves. When the pressure outside the capillary is

greater than it is inside, the filaments anchoring the cells allow them to open, permit-
ting interstitial fluid to seep in. Rising differential pressure across the capillary walls
eventually forces the cell junctions to close. Once in the capillaries, the trapped fluid is
known as lymph, and it moves into larger, vein-like lymphatic vessels. The lymph moves
slowly and without any kind of central pump through a combination of peristalsis, the
action of semilunar valves, and the squeezing influence of surrounding skeletal mus-
cles, much like occurs in veins.
In the skin, lymph vessels form networks around veins, but in the trunk of the body and
around internal organs, they form networks around arteries. Lymph vessels have thin-
ner walls than veins, are wider, have more valves, and — most important — regularly
bulge with bean-shaped sacs called lymph nodes (more on those in the later section
“Poking at the Nodes”). Just as small tree branches merge into larger ones and then into
the trunk, lymphatics eventually merge into the nine largest lymphatic vessels called
lymphatic trunks. The biggest of these at nearly 11⁄2 feet in length is the thoracic duct;
nearly all the body’s lymph vessels empty into it. Only those vessels in the right half of
the head, neck, and thorax empty into its smaller mate, the right lymphatic duct. Lymph
returns to the bloodstream when both ducts connect with the subclavian (under the
collarbone) veins.
The thoracic duct, which also sometimes is called the left lymphatic duct, arises from
a triangular sac called the chyle cistern (or cisterna chyli) into which one intestinal
trunk and two lumbar lymphatic trunks (which drain the lower limbs) flow. Both the
thoracic duct and the much smaller right lymphatic duct drain into the subclavian
(behind the collarbone) veins. The remaining four trunks are a pair serving the jugular
region (sides of the throat) and a pair serving the bronchomediastinal region (the cen-
tral part of the chest).

Poking at the Nodes
Lymph nodes (see Figure 11-2) are the site of filtration of the lymphatic system. 
Also sometimes incorrectly referred to as lymph glands — they don’t secrete anything,
so technically they’re not glands — these kidney-shaped sacs are surrounded by 
connective tissue (and therefore are tough to spot). Lymph nodes contain
macrophages, which destroy bacteria, cancer cells, and other matter in the lymph
fluid. Lymphocytes, which produce an immune response to microorganisms, also are
found in lymph nodes. Like the kidneys, the indented part of each node is referred to
as the hilus. The stroma (body) of each node is surrounded by a fibrous capsule that
dips into the node to form trabeculae, or septa (thin dividing walls) that divide the
node into compartments. Reticular (net-like) fibers are attached to the trabeculae and
form a framework for the lymphoid tissue and lymphocytes (white blood cells) in clus-
ters called lymphatic nodules.
Inside the node is a cortex where most of the lymphocytes gather, and at the center is a
medulla, which is less dense than the cortex but also contains lymphocytes. The outer
cortex consists of lymphocytes arranged in masses called lymphatic nodules, which
have central areas called germinal centers that produce the lymphocytes. Lymph fluid
enters the node on its convex side through afferent (inbound) vessels that have valves
opening only toward the node. Lymph circulates through the node, where it’s filtered
and then allowed to depart through efferent (outbound) vessels in the hilus with
valves pointing exclusively away from the node. (If you have trouble remembering
your afferent from your efferent, think of the “a” as standing for “access” and the “e” 
as standing for “exit”.)
Although some lymph nodes are isolated from others, most nodes occur in groups, or
clusters, particularly in the inguinal (groin), axillary (armpit), and mammary gland
areas. The following are the primary lymph node regions:
 Head
 Neck
 Upper extremities
 Lower extremities
184
Part III: Feed and Fuel: Supply and Transport 

 Abdomen and pelvis
 Viscera
 Thorax
LifeART Image Copyright 2007 ©. Wolters Kluwer Health — Lippincott Williams & Wilkins
Nodes in the head drain lymph from the scalp, upper neck, ear, parts of the eye, nose,
and cheek. Lymph vessels from the head and the neck carry lymph to the nodes in the
neck. Axillary nodes found in the armpit receive lymph from the upper arm, while the
lymphatic vessels on the radial side of the arm supply nodes in the clavicle region.
Lymph nodes in the chest region process lymph from the thoracic wall. Lymph nodes in
the abdominal and pelvic region filter fluid from the lower body regions, reproductive
organs, and thighs. Viscera nodes or gastric lymph nodes function in the drainage of
the digestive organs. The inguinal nodes function to drain the lower extremities.
Each node acts like a filter bag filled with a network of thin, perforated sheets of
tissue — a bit like cheesecloth — through which lymph must pass before moving on.
White blood cells line the sheets of tissue, including several types that play critical
roles in the body’s immune defenses. This filtering action explains why, when infec-
tion first starts, lymph nodes often swell with the cellular activity of the immune
system launching into battle with the invading microorganisms.
The cortex of each lymph node contains monocytes and two types of lymphocytes:
B cells and T cells.
 Monocytes within the lymph nodes develop into large invader-eaters called
macrophages that are capable of destroying a variety of microorganisms and
sometimes even cancer cells.
 B cells don’t attack pathogens directly but instead may produce molecules called
antibodies that do the dirty work. Or they may instruct other cells called phago-
cytes (literally “cells that eat”) to attack the invaders.
 T cells are lymphocytes that started out in the bone marrow but matured in the
thymus gland (hence the name T cells) before moving on to the lymph nodes and
spleen.

Having a Spleen-ded Time with 
the Lymphatic Organs
While the lymph nodes are the most numerous lymphatic organs, several other vital
organs exist in the lymphatic system, including the spleen, thymus gland, and tonsils.
187
Chapter 11: Keeping Up Your Defenses: The Lymphatic System

The spleen
The spleen, the largest lymphatic organ in the body, is a 5-inch, roughly egg-shaped
structure to the left of and slightly behind the stomach. Like lymph nodes, it has a
hilus through which the splenic artery, splenic vein, and efferent (remember “e” for
“exit”) vessels pass. Also like lymph nodes, the spleen’s surrounded by a fibrous cap-
sule that folds inward to section it off. Arterioles leading into each section are sur-
rounded by masses of developing lymphocytes that give those areas of so-called white
pulp their appearance. On the outer edges of each compartment, tissue called red pulp
consists of blood-filled cavities. Unlike lymph nodes, the spleen doesn’t have any affer-
ent (access) lymph vessels, which means that it doesn’t filter lymph, only blood.
Blood flows slowly through the spleen to allow it to remove microorganisms, exhausted
erythrocytes (red blood cells), and any foreign material that may be in the stream.
Among its various functions, the spleen can be a blood reservoir. When blood circula-
tion drops while the body is at rest, the spleen’s vessels can dilate to store any excess
volume. Later, during exercise or if oxygen concentrations in the blood begin to drop,
the spleen’s blood vessels constrict and push any stored blood back into circulation.
But the spleen’s primary role is as a biological recycling unit, capturing and breaking
down defective and aged blood cells to reuse their components later. Iron stored by
the spleen’s macrophages goes to the bone marrow where it’s turned into hemoglobin
in new blood cells. By the same token, bilirubin for the liver is generated during break-
down of hemoglobin. The spleen produces red blood cells during embryonic develop-
ment but shuts down that process after birth; in cases of severe anemia, the spleen
sometimes starts up production of red blood cells again.
Fortunately, the spleen isn’t considered a vital organ; if it’s damaged or has to be surgi-
cally removed, the liver and bone marrow can pick up where the spleen leaves off.
T cell central: The thymus gland
Tucked just behind the breastbone and between the lungs in the upper chest, the
thymus gland was a medical mystery until recent decades. Its two oblong lobes are
largest at puberty when they weigh around 40 grams (somewhat less than an adult
mouse). Through a process called involution, however, the gland atrophies and shrinks
to roughly 6 grams by the time an adult is 65. (You can remember that term as the
inverse of evolution.)
The thymus gland serves its most critical role — as a nursery for immature T lympho-
cytes, or T cells — during fetal development and the first few years of a human’s life.
Prior to birth, fetal bone marrow produces lymphoblasts (early stage lymphocytes)
that migrate to the thymus. Shortly after birth and continuing until adolescence, the
thymus secretes several hormones, collectively called thymosin, that prompt the early
cells to mature into full-grown T cells that are immunocompetent, ready to go forth
and conquer invading microorganisms. (These hormones are the reason the thymus is
considered part of the endocrine system, too.)
As with other lymphatic structures, the thymus is surrounded by a fibrous capsule
that dips inside to create chambers called lobules. Within each lobule is a cortex made
of T cells held in place by reticular fibers and a central medulla of unusually onion-like
layered epithelial cells called thymic corpuscles, or Hassall’s corpuscles, as well as scat-
tered lymphocytes.

Opening wide and moving along: 
The tonsils and Peyer’s patches
Like the thymus gland, the tonsils, which are misunderstood masses of lymphoid
tissue, are largest around puberty and tend to atrophy as an adult ages. Unlike the
thymus, however, the tonsils don’t secrete hormones but do produce lymphocytes and
antibodies to protect against microorganisms that are inhaled or eaten. Although only
two are visible on either side of the pharynx, there are actually six tonsils: the two you
can identify, which are called palatine tonsils; two more called adenoids or pharyngeal
tonsils in the wall of the pharynx; and two in the posterior one-third of the tongue
called lingual tonsils. Invaginations (ridges) in the tonsils form pockets called crypts,
which trap bacteria and other foreign matter.
Peyer’s patches, also called aggregate glands or agminate glands, are masses of lymph
tissue just below the surface of the ileum, the lowest section of the small intestine.
When harmful microorganisms get into the intestine, Peyer’s patches can mobilize an
army of B cells and macrophages to fight off infection.

Answers to Questions on 
the Lymphatic System
The following are answers to the practice questions presented in this chapter.
a
The lymphatic system plays an important role in regulating b. interstitial fluid protein. By
keeping the interstitial fluid volume between tissue cells in balance, the lymphatic system also
keeps the body in homeostasis.
b
Terminated vessels that return plasma proteins to the blood are c. lymph capillaries.
“Terminated vessels” is a technical way of saying they’re a one-way path straight back to the
source.
c
The thoracic duct does not drain lymph from the b. right side of the head. In fact, that’s one of
the very few areas the thoracic duct doesn’t drain.
d
The largest lymphatic vessel in the body is the c. thoracic duct. Yes, this duct is the largest
lymphatic vessel. “Spleen” isn’t the correct answer because that’s the largest lymphatic organ.
e
The lymphatic system does not function to d. produce erythrocytes. Those are red blood cells,
which develop in the bone marrow.
f
An encapsulated mass of lymph tissue connected to lymph vessels is a e. lymph node. Don’t let
a $5 word like “encapsulated” fool you. It just means that the mass is wrapped in connective
tissue.
g
The lymph organ that has afferent and efferent lymph vessels is the a. lymph node. The
thymus and spleen have no inbound (afferent) vessels, and Peyer’s patches and tonsils don’t
have much to do with lymph circulation.
h
Cells attached to the reticular fibers in a lymph node are d. lymphocytes. The reticular fibers
create a net on which these cells can cluster.
i
A function of the lymph nodes is to c. produce lymphocytes. That’s one of their two primary
functions.
j
The stroma of the lymph node does not consist of e. villi. Nope, no finger-like projections here.
k
Lymphocytes are produced in the lymph nodules in the region called the b. germinal center.
That’s the heart of lymphocyte production in a nodule.
l
The connective tissue fiber that forms the framework of the lymphoid tissue is e. reticular. It
provides both a tissue framework and a type of netting to hold clusters of lymphocytes.
m
When infection first starts, the lymph nodes tend to b. swell. This reaction occurs as the battle
begins in your immune system at the cellular level.
n
T cells get their name because they start out in the bone marrow and mature in the c. thymus.
o
Cells that remove foreign matter from the lymph in the lymph nodes are the e. macrophages.
These are the mature monocytes that can engulf a microorganism.
p
Which of the following is not a lymphatic organ? c. Liver. No lymph fluid here.
192
Part III: Feed and Fuel: Supply and Transport 

q
The lymphatic organ that stops growth during adolescence and atrophies with aging is the 
a. thymus.
Here’s a memory tool that only word-play students will love: “The thymus runs out of thyme.”
r
Lymphoid tissue located in the pharynx that protects against inhaled or ingested pathogens
and foreign substances is called the b. tonsils. When you remember where the pharynx is —
the back of the throat — this question becomes more obvious.
s
Lymphatic nodules found in the ileum of the small intestines are e. Peyer’s patches. It’s almost
like they’re “patched” onto the ileum.
t
The spleen is in close relation with the a. stomach. It’s certainly nearest to the stomach.
u
The lymphatic organ found in the superior mediastinum is the c. thymus.
Break this question into parts and it becomes easier to locate which gland is being referenced:
Superior means “upper,” media– means “middle” (or “midline”), and –stinum refers to the ster-
num, or breastbone.
v
Lymphocytes are the predominant cells in the c. white pulp of the spleen. They’re what give it
its whitish color.
w
The lymphatic organ responsible for removal of aged and defective blood cells is the b. spleen.
It recycles critical components from the spent blood cells and sends them to the bone marrow
to be turned into fresh cells.
x
The lymphatic organ that secretes hormones to make T lymphocytes immunocompetent is the
e. thymus. It’s where these cells get the “T” in their name.
y
Which of the following is not a true tonsil? d. Sublingual tonsil. If it’s not pharyngeal, palantine,
or lingual, it’s not a real tonsil.
A
The lymph system offers an alternative route for the return of the tissue fluid to the blood-
stream. True
B
The fluid surrounding the cells that will enter the lymph capillaries is called interstitial fluid.
True
C
Lymph from the lymph vessels flows into the right thoracic duct and the left thoracic duct.
False. There is no right thoracic duct, only a right lymphatic duct.
D
The lymph capillaries are composed of loosely overlapping reticular fiber. False. The lymph
capillaries actually are composed of overlapping endothelial cells.
E
The spleen filters both lymph and blood. False
F
The thymus gland is functional in the early years of life and is most active in old age. False. The
opposite is true; the thymus is practically nonexistent in old age.
G
Tonsils function to protect against pathogens and foreign substances that are inhaled or
ingested. True
H
The spleen functions in the removal of aged and defective blood cells and platelets from the
blood. True
193
Chapter 11: Keeping Up Your Defenses: The Lymphatic System

I
The gastric lymph nodes drain the lymphatic vessels on the radial side of the arm. False. This
statement doesn’t make much sense because “gastric” refers to the digestive system.
J
The thoracic duct originates from a triangular sac called the chyle cistern (or cisterna chyli).
True
K
The bilobular thymus gland is located in the superior mediastinum.
L
Once in the lymphatic system, interstitial fluid becomes known as lymph. What else could it be
called?
M
Peyer’s patches are masses of lymphatic nodules found in the distal portion of the small intes-
tines. Don’t let that “distal” fool you; just think of it as “distant.”
N
The largest lymphatic organ in the body is the spleen. You may be tempted to write “thoracic
duct” here, but that’s incorrect because the duct is the largest vessel, not the largest organ.
O
The lymph nodes of the lower extremities drain the knee, leg, and foot. It’s a dead giveaway
seeing as how those are all part of the lower extremities.
P
In the center of the nodules of the lymph node are areas called germinal centers. When you
read “germinal,” think of the word “germinate,” and then think of a place where lymphocytes
can sprout and mature.

Filtering Out the Junk: 
The Urinary System
In This Chapter
 Putting the kidneys on clean-up duty
 Tracking urinary waste out of the body
I
f you read Chapter 9 on the digestive system, you may be chewing on the idea that undi-
gested food is the body’s primary waste product. But it’s not — that title belongs to
urine. We make more of it than we do feces — in fact, our bodies are making small amounts
of urine all the time — and we release it more often throughout the day. Most important,
urine captures all the leftovers from our cells’ metabolic activities and jettisons them before
they can build up and become toxic. In addition, urine helps maintain homeostasis, or the
proper balance of body fluids.
In short, the urinary system
 Excretes useless and harmful material that it filters from blood plasma, including urea,
uric acid, creatinine, and various salts
 Removes excess materials, particularly anything normally present in the blood that
builds up to excessive levels
 Maintains proper osmotic pressure, or fluid balance, by eliminating excess water when
concentration rises too high at the tissue level
In this chapter, we look at how the urinary system collects, manages, and excretes the waste
that the body’s cells produce as they go about busily metabolizing all day. You practice iden-
tifying parts of the kidneys, ureter, urinary bladder, and urethra.
Examining the Kidneys, the Body’s Filters
The kidneys are nonstop filters that sift through 1.2 liters of blood per minute. Humans have a
pair of kidneys just above the waist (lumbar region) toward the back of the abdominal cavity.
While sometimes the same size, the left kidney tends to be a bit larger than the right. The last
two pairs of ribs surround and protect each kidney, and a layer of fat, called perirenal fat, pro-
vides additional cushioning. Kidneys are retroperitoneal, which means that they’re posterior
to the peritoneum. The renal capsule, or outer lining of the kidney, is a layer of collagen fibers;
these fibers extend outward to anchor the organ to surrounding structures.
Each kidney is dark red, about 41⁄2 inches long, and shaped like a bean (hence the type of
legumes called kidney beans). The portion of the bean that folds in on itself, referred to as
the medial border, is concave with a deep depression in it called the hilus, or hilum. The
hilus opens into a fat-filled space called the renal sinus, which in turn contains the renal
pelvis, renal calices, blood vessels, nerves, and fat. The renal artery and renal vein, which

provide the kidney’s blood supply, as well as the ureter that carries urine to the bladder
leave the kidney through the hilus.
Immediately below the renal capsule is a granular layer called the renal cortex, and just
below that is an inner layer called the medulla that folds into anywhere from 8 to 18
conical projections called the renal pyramids. Between the pyramids are renal columns
that extend from the cortex inward to the renal sinus. The tips of these pyramids, the
renal papillae, empty their contents into a collecting area called the minor calyx. It’s
one of several sac-like structures referred to as the minor and major calyces which
form the start of the urinary tract’s “plumbing” system and collect urine transmitted
through the papillae from the cortex and medulla. Although the number varies
between individuals, generally each of two or three major calyces branches into four
or five minor calyces, with a single minor calyx surrounding the papilla of one pyra-
mid. Urine passes through the minor calyx into its major calyx and then on into the
ureter for the trip to the bladder.
Going molecular
At the microscopic level, each kidney contains hundreds of thousands of tiny tubes
known as uriniferous tubules, or nephrons. These are the primary functional units of the
urinary system. At one end, each nephron is closed off and folded into a small double-
cupped structure called a Bowman’s capsule, or the glomerular capsule, where the
actual process of filtration occurs. Leading away from the capsule, the nephron forms
into the first or proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), which is lined with cuboidal epithe-
lial cells having microvilli brush borders that increase the area of absorption. This
tube straightens to form a structure called the descending loop of Henle and then
bends back in a hairpin turn into another structure called the ascending loop of Henle.
After that, the tube becomes convoluted again, forming the second or distal convoluted
tubule (DCT), which is made of the same types of cells as the first tubule but without
any microvilli. This tubule connects to a collecting tubule that it shares with the
output ends of many other nephrons. The collecting tubules open into the minor
calyces of the renal pelvis, which in turn open into the major calyces.
Because of their role as the body’s key filters, the kidneys receive about 20 percent of all
the blood pumped by the heart each minute. A large branch of the abdominal aorta,
called the renal artery, carries that blood to them. After branching into smaller and
smaller vessels, the blood eventually enters afferent arterioles, each of which branches
into tufts of five to eight capillaries called a glomerulus (the plural is glomeruli) inside
the Bowman’s capsule. After picking up waste products from the filters inside the wall of
the capsule, the capillaries come back together to form efferent arterioles, which then
branch to form the peritubular, or second, capillary bed surrounding the convoluted
tubules, the loop of Henle, and the collecting tubule. The capillaries come together once
again to form a small vein that empties blood into the renal vein to depart the kidneys.
Each glomerulus and its surrounding Bowman’s capsule make up a single renal corpus-
cle where basic filtration takes place. Like all capillaries, glomeruli have thin, membra-
nous walls, but unlike their capillary cousins elsewhere, these vessels have unusually
large pores called fenestrations or fenestrae (from the Latin word fenestra for “window”).
Focusing on filtering
To understand how the renal corpuscles work, think of an espresso machine: Water is
forced under pressure through a sieve containing ground coffee beans, and a filtrate
called brewed coffee trickles out the other end. Something similar takes place in the
renal corpuscles. Hydrostatic pressure forces fluids across the glomerular membranes,
which capture about 125 milliliters of material per minute in the Bowman’s capsules.
196
Part III: Feed and Fuel: Supply and Transport 

Selective reabsorption occurs (mostly in the PCT) as these filtered materials then
move through the nephrons’ network of tubules, returning the bulk of the water and
much of the needed materials back to the bloodstream through the peritubular capil-
lary bed surrounding the nephrons’ structures.
So despite 125 milliliters of material coming out of the blood every minute, only 
1 milliliter of urine is generated each minute. This is a matter of simple subtraction:
Reabsorption of about 100 milliliters per minute takes place in the proximal convoluted
tubules. The loop of Henle returns 7 milliliters per minute more. The distal convoluted
tubules return 12 milliliters, and the collecting tubules return about 5 milliliters. Voila!
That totals 124 milliliters of reabsorption per minute and explains the 1 milliliter of
urine that comes out when all is said and done.
While all this filtering and absorption is going on, the kidneys also sometimes secrete
an enzyme called renin (also known by its more complicated chemical name of
angiotensinogenase) that converts a peptide generated in the liver, called angiotensino-
gen, into angiotensin I. Angiotensin I moves into the lungs where a converting enzyme
turns it into angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. Say what? Try this explanation,
instead: The kidneys work to ensure that systemic blood pressure remains high
enough for them to do their filtering job properly. That’s what a vasoconstrictor is: a
substance that causes blood vessels to narrow, increasing the pressure of the fluids
moving through them. Rising blood pressure also triggers the adrenal glands perched
atop each kidney to release aldosterone, causing the renal tubules to absorb more
sodium and pumping up blood volume. The pituitary gland also plays a role in urine
production by releasing an antidiuretic hormone (ADH) that causes water retention at
the kidneys and elevated blood pressure.
You’ve absorbed a lot in the last few paragraphs. See how much of it is getting caught

Getting Rid of the Waste
After your kidneys filter out the junk, it’s time to deliver it to the bladder. Here is how
that’s done.
Surfing the ureters
Ureters are narrow, muscular tubes through which the collected waste travels. About
10 inches long, each ureter descends from a kidney to the posterior lower third of the
bladder. Like the kidneys themselves, the ureters are behind the peritoneum outside
the abdominal cavity, so the term retroperitoneal applies to them, too. The inner wall
of the ureter is a simple mucous membrane. It also has a middle layer of smooth
muscle tissue that propels the urine by peristalsis — the same process that moves food
through the digestive system. So rather than trickling into the bladder, urine arrives in
small spurts as the muscular contractions force it down. The tube is surrounded by an
outer fibrous layer of connective tissue that supports it during peristalsis.
Ballooning the bladder
The urinary bladder is a large muscular bag that lies in the pelvis behind the pubis
bones. In female humans, it’s beneath the uterus and in front of the vagina. In male
humans, the bladder lies between the rectum and the symphysis pubis. There are
three openings in the bladder: two on the back side where the ureters enter and one
on the front for the urethra, the tube that carries urine outside the body. The bladder’s
trigone is the triangular area between these three openings. The neck of the bladder
surrounds the urethral attachment, and the internal sphincter (smooth muscle that pro-
vides involuntary control) encircles the junction between the urethra and the bladder.
Inside, the bladder is lined with highly elastic transitional epithelium tissue. When full,
the bladder’s lining is smooth and stretched; when empty, the lining lies in a series of
folds called rugae (just as the stomach does). When the bladder fills, the increased
pressure stimulates the organ’s stretch receptors, prompting the individual to urinate. 
The male and female urethras
Both males and females have a urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder to
a body opening, or orifice. Both males and females have an internal sphincter con-
trolled by the autonomic nervous system and composed of smooth muscle to guard
the exit from the bladder. Both males and females also have an external sphincter com-
posed of circular striated muscle that’s under voluntary control. But as we all well
know, the exterior plumbing is rather different.
The female urethra is about one and a half inches long and lies close to the vagina’s
anterior (front) wall. It opens just in front of the vaginal opening. The external sphinc-
ter for the female urethra lies just inside the urethra’s exit point.
The male urethra is about 8 inches long and carries a different name as it passes
through each of three regions:

Part III: Feed and Fuel: Supply and Transport 
 The prostatic urethra leaving the bladder contains the internal sphincter and
passes through the prostate gland. Several openings appear in this region of the
urethra, including a small opening where sperm from the vas deferens and ejacu-
latory duct enters, and prostatic ducts where fluid from the prostate enters.
 The membranous urethra is a small 1- or 2-centimeter portion that contains the
external sphincter and penetrates the pelvic floor. The tiny bulbourethral (or
Cowper’s) glands lie on either side of this region.
 The cavernous urethra, also known as the spongy urethra, runs the length of the
penis on its ventral surface through the corpus spongiosum, ending at a vertical
slit at the end of the penis. Ducts from the Cowper’s glands enter at this region.
Now test your knowledge of how the human body gets rid of its waste:
Q. The separation of the reproductive
and urinary systems is complete in

a. Male
b. Female
c. Both
A. The correct answer is female. The
male urethra runs through the
same “plumbing” as the male
reproductive system.

17. The internal sphincter found at the junction of the bladder neck and the urethra is 
composed of
a. Striated muscle tissue
b. Squamous endothelial tissue
c. Mucous membrane
d. Transitional epithelium
e. Smooth muscle tissue
Spelling Relief: Urination
Urination, known by the medical term micturition, occurs when the bladder is emptied
through the urethra. Although urine is created continuously, it’s stored in the bladder
until the individual finds a convenient time to release it. Mucus produced in the blad-
der’s lining protects its walls from any acidic or alkaline effects of the stored urine.
When there is about 200 milliliters of urine distending the bladder walls, stretch recep-
tors transmit impulses to warn that the bladder is filling. Afferent impulses are trans-
mitted to the spinal cord, and efferent impulses return to the bladder, forming a reflex
arc that causes the internal sphincter to relax and the muscular layer of the bladder to
contract, forcing urine into the urethra. The afferent impulses continue up the spinal
cord to the brain, creating the urge to urinate. Because the external sphincter is com-
posed of skeletal muscle tissue, no urine usually is released until the individual volun-
tarily opens the sphincter.

Answers to Questions on the Urinary System
The following are answers to the practice questions presented in this chapter.
a
Cortex: b. Granular outer layer
b
Medulla: a. Composed of folds forming the renal pyramids
c
Renal pelvis: e. Found in the renal sinus
d
Calyx: c. Irregular sac-like structures for collecting urine in the renal pelvis
e
Collecting tubule: d. Transports urine from the cortex
f
The functional kidney is responsible for e. only b and c (excretion of waste and removal of
excessive materials in the blood). The other answer option can’t be correct because carbon
dioxide exits the body through the lungs.
g
The ureter leaves the kidney through the depression known as the a. hilus. That’s the part
where the “bean” folds in on itself.
h
The human kidney is not included in the abdominal cavity, which makes it a. retroperitoneal.
Peritoneal refers to the peritoneum, the membrane lining the abdominal cavity; and retro can
be defined as “situated behind.”
i
The functional unit of the kidney is the d. nephron. Each nephron contains a series of the parts
needed to do the kidney’s filtering job.
j
The correct sequence for removal of material from the blood through the nephron is a.
Afferent arteriole →Glomerulus →Proximal convoluted tubule →Loop of Henle →Distal
convoluted tubule →Collecting tubule. In short, blood comes through the artery (arteriole)
and material gloms onto the nephron before twisting through the near (proximal) tubes, loop-
ing the loop, twisting through the distant (distal) tubes, and collecting itself at the other end.
Try remembering artery-glom-proxy-loop-distant-collect.
k
Brush borders of villi are found primarily in the b. proximal convoluted tubule. Those brush
borders provide extra surface area for reabsorption, so it makes sense that they congregate in
the first area after filtration.
l
Filtration occurs primarily in the d. glomerulus. The glomerulus is a collection of capillaries
with big pores, so think of it as the initial filtering sieve.
m
Reabsorption occurs primarily in the d. proximal convoluted tubules. These tubules have the
most surface area with all those villi brush borders, so they reabsorb the most.
n
The interior of the bladder is lined with elastic b. transitional epithelium. It’s transitional
because it needs to be able to stretch and collapse as needed.
o
The urine formed in the kidney is passed down the ureter by e. peristaltic contractions. It’s the
same action that moves food through the digestive system.
p
The circular striated muscle known as the external sphincter is found in the d. urethra. If it’s
external, it has to be in the tube that heads outside.
203
Chapter 12: Filtering Out the Junk: The Urinary System

q
The internal sphincter found at the junction of the bladder neck and the urethra is composed of
e. smooth muscle tissue. The internal sphincter is smooth muscle tissue that prevents urine
leakage from the bladder.

ndividually, humans don’t need to reproduce to survive. But to survive as a species,
a number of individuals must produce and nurture a next generation, carrying their
uniqueness forward in the genetic pool. Humans are born with the necessary organs to
do just that.
In this chapter, you get an overview of the parts and functions of the male reproductive
system, along with plenty of practice questions to test your knowledge. (We cover the guys
first because their role in the basic reproduction equation isn’t nearly as long or complex
as it is for their mates. We address the female reproductive system in Chapter 14.)
Identifying the Parts of the Male
Reproductive System
On the outside, the male reproductive parts, which you can see in Figure 13-1, are straight-
forward — a penis and a scrotum. At birth, the apex of the penis is enclosed in a fold of skin
called the prepuce, or foreskin, which often is removed during a surgery called circumcision.

The scrotum is a pouch of skin divided in half on the surface by a ridge called a raphe
that continues up along the underside of the penis and down all the way to the anus. The
left side of the scrotum tends to hang lower than the right side to accommodate a longer
spermatic cord, which we explain later in this section.
There are two scrotal layers: the integument, or outer skin layer, and the dartos tunic,
an inner smooth muscle layer that contracts when cold and elongates when warm.
Why? That has to do with the two testes (the singular is testis) inside (see Figure 13-2).
These small ovoid glands, also referred to as testicles, need to be a bit cooler than
body temperature in order to produce viable sperm for reproduction. When the dartos
tunic becomes cold, such as when a man is swimming, it contracts and draws the
testes toward the body for warmth. When the dartos tunic becomes overly warm, it
slackens to allow the testes to hang farther away from the heat of the body.
Illustration by Imagineering Media Services Inc.
A fibrous capsule called the tunica albuginea encases each testis and extends into the
gland forming incomplete septa (partitions), which divide the testis into about 200
lobules. These compartments contain small, coiled seminiferous tubules where sperm
are produced by spermatogenesis, or meiosis, which we review in the next section.
Distributed in gaps between the tubules are interstitial cells called Leydig cells that
produce the male sex hormone testosterone. The tubules of each lobule come together
in an area called the mediastinum testis and straighten into tubuli recti before forming
a network called the rete testis that leads to the efferent ducts (also called ductules).
These ducts carry sperm to an extremely long (about 20 feet), tightly coiled tube
called the epididymis for storage.
The epididymis merges with the ductus deferens, or vas deferens, which carries sperm up
into the spermatic cord, which also encases the testicular artery and vein, lymphatic
vessels, and nerves. Convoluted pouches called seminal vesicles lie behind the base of
the bladder and secrete an alkaline fluid containing fructose, vitamins, amino acids, and
prostaglandins to nourish sperm as it enters the ejaculatory duct.

Part IV: Survival of the Species 

From there the mixture containing sperm enters the prostatic urethra that’s surrounded
by the prostate gland. This gland secretes a thin, opalescent substance that precedes
the sperm in an ejaculation. The alkaline nature of this substance reduces the natural
acidity of the female’s vagina to prepare it to receive the sperm.
Two yellowish pea-sized bodies called Cowper’s glands, or bulbourethral glands, lie on
either side of the urethra and secrete a clear alkaline lubricant prior to ejaculation; it
neutralizes the acidity of the urethra and acts as a lubricant for the penis. Once all the
glands have added protective and nourishing fluids to the 400 to 500 million departing
sperm, the mixture is known as seminal fluid or semen.
During sexual arousal, two columns of spongy erectile tissue in the penis — the corpus
spongiosum penis and the corpus cavernosum penis — swell with blood to make it rigid
and capable of entering the female’s vagina. At the time of ejaculation, smooth muscles
in the wall of the epididymis force sperm through the ductus deferens, located in the
inguinal canal, toward the urinary bladder. After mixing with the secretions from the
seminal vesicles and the prostate gland, the semen travels along the urethra and out a
vertical slit in the glans penis, or head of the penis.

Packaging the Chromosomes for Delivery
Sperm, the male sex cell, is produced during a process called meiosis (which also
produces the female sex cell, or ovum). Meiosis involves two divisions.
 The first, a reduction division, divides a single diploid cell with two sets of
chromosomes into two haploid cells with only one set each.
 The second process is a division by mitosis that divides the two haploid cells
into four cells with a single set of chromosomes each.

A diploid cell (or 2N) has two sets of chromosomes, whereas a haploid cell (or 1N) has
one set of chromosomes.
Meiosis, which you can see in Figure 13-3, is a continuous process. Once it starts, it
doesn’t stop until gametes are formed. Meiosis is described in a series of stages as
follows (for more on the terminology of cells, see Chapter 2):
1. Interphase: The original diploid cell — called a spermatocyte in a man and an
oocyte in a woman — is said to be in a “resting stage,” but it actually undergoes
constant activity. Just before it starts to divide, the DNA molecules in the
chromanemata (chromatin network) duplicate.
2. Prophase I: Structures disappear from the nucleus, including the nuclear mem-
brane, nucleoplasm, and nucleoli. The cell’s centrosome divides into two centri-
oles that move to the ends of the nucleus and form poles. Structures begin to
appear in the nuclear region, including spindles (protein filaments that extend
between the poles) and asters, or astral rays (protein filaments that extend from
the poles into the cytoplasm). The chromanemata contract, forming chromo-
somes. Those chromosomes then start to divide into two chromatids but remain
attached by the centromere. Homologous chromosomes that contain the same
genetic information pair up and go into synapsis, twisting around each other to
form a tetrad of four chromatids. These tetrads begin to migrate toward the equa-
torial plane (an imaginary line between the poles).
3. Metaphase I: The tetrads align on the equatorial plane, attaching to the spindles
by the centromere.
4. Anaphase I: Homologous chromosomes separate by moving along the spindles
to opposite poles. In late anaphase, a slight furrowing is apparent in the cyto-
plasm, initiating cytokinesis (the division of the cytoplasm).
211
Chapter 13: Why Ask Y?: The Male Reproductive System

Illustration by Imagineering Media Services Inc.
5. Telophase I: The contracted and divided homologous chromosomes are at oppo-
site poles. Spindle and aster structures disappear, and a nuclear membrane and
nucleoplasm begin to appear in each newly forming cell. Chromosomes remain
as chromatids, still contracted and divided. The furrowing seen in anaphase con-
tinues to deepen, dividing the cytoplasm. In the male, the cytoplasm divides
equally between the two cells. In the female, cytoplasmic division is unequal.
6. Interkinesis: The cytoplasm separates. Two genetically identical haploid cells are
formed with half the number of chromosomes as the original cell. In the male, the
cells are of equal size. In the female, one cell is large and the other is small.
7. Prophase II: The cells enter the second phase of meiosis. Once again, structures
disappear from the nuclei and poles appear at the ends. Spindles and asters
appear in the nuclear region. Chromosomes are already contracted and divided
into chromatids attached by the centromere, and they begin to migrate toward
the equatorial plane.

8. Metaphase II: The chromatids align on the equatorial plane and attach to the
spindles by the centromere.
9. Anaphase II: The chromatids separate, becoming chromosomes that move along
the spindles to the poles. A slight furrowing appears in the cytoplasm.
10. Telophase II: With the chromosomes at the poles, spindles and asters disappear
while new nuclear structures appear. The chromosomes uncoil, returning to
chromanemata and their chromatin network. Cytoplasmic division continues to
deepen and each haploid cell divides, forming four cells.
At the end of this process, the male has four haploid sperm of equal size. As the sperm
matures further, a flagellum (tail) develops. The female, on the other hand, has produced
one large cell, the ovum, and three small cells called polar bodies; all four structures con-
tain just one set of chromosomes. The polar bodies eventually disintegrate and the
ovum becomes the functional cell. When fertilized by the sperm, the resulting zygote
(fertilized egg) is diploid, containing two sets of chromosomes.

Answers to Questions on the Male
Reproductive System
The following are answers to the practice questions presented in this chapter.
a
The cutaneous pouch containing the testes and part of the spermatic cord is the a. scrotum.
“Cutaneous” simply means “skin.”
b
The scrotum adjusts to surrounding temperatures through the action of the c. dartos tunic.
This is the inner smooth muscle layer of the scrotum.
c
Spermatogenesis occurs in the c. seminiferous tubules. Immature sperm cells line the walls of
the tubules.
d
Testosterone is produced in the e. Leydig cells. “Interstitial cells” would also be correct
because the word “interstitial” can be translated as “placed between.” But alas, that’s not
one of the answer options.
e
Select the correct sequence for the movement of sperm: a. Seminiferous tubules →Tubuli
recti →Rete testis →Epididymis →Ductus deferens →Ejaculatory duct →Urethra. The
sperm develop in the coiled tubules, move through the straighter tubes (tubuli recti), continue
across the network of the testis (rete testis) and into the epididymis (remember the really long
tube), and travel past the ductus (or vas) deferens and the ejaculatory duct into the urethra.
f
Which of the following does not add a secretion to the sperm as it moves through the reproduc-
tive ducts? a. Interstitial cells. Interstitial cells secrete testosterone, which goes into the blood.
g
The convoluted tube that stores sperm is called the d. epididymis. The other answer options
don’t come into play until it’s time to release semen.
h
The fluid accompanying the sperm is called the b. semen.
i
An average ejaculation will contain sperm numbering approximately b. 400 to 500 million.
Keep in mind that sperm are microscopically small, so quite a few can fit in a tiny amount
of semen.
j
A thin, milky liquid imparting alkaline characteristics to the seminal fluid is produced by the
e. prostate gland.
k
The process in sexual reproduction involving the union of gametes is called d. fertilization.
Oh, come now — fission? Pollination? Remember that we’re talking human anatomy here!
l
Gametes are formed by c. meiosis. Gametes — sperm and ova — are the end goal of this
process.
m
A man has 46 chromosomes in a spermatocyte. How many chromosomes are in each sperm?
b. 23. Divide the number 46 in half.
n
Synapsis, or side-by-side pairing, of homologous chromosomes e. occurs in meiosis.
o
Anaphase I of meiosis is characterized by which of the following? d. Homologous chromo-
somes separate and move poleward with centromeres intact.
217
Chapter 13: Why Ask Y?: The Male Reproductive System

218
Part IV: Survival of the Species 
p
During ovum production, the three nonfunctional cells produced are called c. polar bodies.
They eventually disintegrate.
q
The stage (or period) in meiosis between the first and second division is called d. interkinesis.
Inter– means “between,” and –kinesis means “motion,” so it’s clear that this phase is “between
motions.”
r
After meiosis, each diploid spermatocyte has become c. four haploid sperm of equal size.
There’s no such thing as a diploid sperm because as a sex cell, sperm carries only half the regu-
lar complement of 46 chromosomes. And because another division takes place after the initial
division in meiosis, the final product of the process is four cells, not two.
s
Following is a summary of what should appear in your drawings and descriptions of the stages
of meiosis. For further reference, check out Figure 13-3.
In the drawing for late prophase I, at least two pairs of homologous chromosomes should
be shown grouped into tetrads (in truth, there are 23 pairs, but simplified illustrations tend
to show just two). The description for prophase I should include reference to the tetrad for-
mation. The drawing for metaphase I should show the equatorial plane (a center horizontal
line) with the tetrads aligned along it. The illustration also should show spindles radiating
from each pole, with the tetrads attached to them by their centromeres. The description
should include reference to the equatorial plane, the poles, and the spindles.
The drawing for anaphase I should show the tetrads moving to the top and bottom of the cell
along the spindles and the cytoplasm slowly beginning to divide. In telophase I, the division
becomes more pronounced and two new nuclei form. As the process enters interkinesis, the
cytoplasm pinches off into two cells.
During prophase II, which also is the start of the second meiotic division, the contracted and
divided chromatids migrate toward a new equatorial plane. The drawing of metaphase II
should show all chromatids aligned on the equatorial plane. For anaphase II, you should show
the chromatids pulling apart into chromosomes and moving toward the poles. In the final
stage, telophase II, you should draw new nuclei forming around the chromosomes.

M
en may have quite a few hard-working parts in their reproductive systems, but women
are the ones truly responsible for survival of the species (biologically speaking,
anyway). The female body prepares for reproduction every month for most of a woman’s
adult life, producing an ovum and then measuring out delicate levels of hormones to prepare
for nurturing a developing embryo. When a fertilized ovum fails to show up, the body hits the
biological reset button and sloughs off the uterine lining before building it up all over again for
next month’s reproductive roulette. But that’s nothing compared to what the female body
does when a fertilized egg actually settles in for a nine-month stay. Strap yourselves in for a
tour of the incredible female baby-making machinery — practice questions included.
Identifying the Female Reproductive 
Parts and Their Functions
First and foremost in the female reproductive repertoire are the two ovaries, which usually
take a turn every other month to produce a single ovum. Roughly the size and shape of large
unshelled almonds, the female gonads lie on either side of the uterus, below and slightly
behind the Fallopian tubes (also called the uterine tubes). Each ovary has a stroma (body) of
connective tissue surrounded by a dense fibrous connective tissue called the tunica albuginea
(literally “white covering”); yes, that’s the same name as the tissue surrounding the testes. In
fact, the ovaries in a female and the testes in a male are homologous, meaning that they share
similar origins. External to the tunica albuginea is a layer of cuboidal cells known as the
germinal epithelium. During growth of the ovary in a female fetus prior to birth, the germinal
epithelium dips into the body of the ovary in various places. Over time, a mass of epithelial
cells called primordial follicles, or primary follicles, becomes separated from the main body of
the ovary. The ovaries of a young girl contain from 100,000 to 400,000 of these follicles, most
of them present at birth.

At puberty and approximately once each month until menopause (which we cover in
the later section “Growing, Changing, and Aging”), the following happens:
1. The pars distal (anterior lobe) of the hypophysis (pituitary gland) secretes
follicle-stimulating hormones, or FSH, which prompt about 1,000 of the pri-
mordial follicles to resume cellular division by meiosis.
Usually, only one follicle matures to become a Graafian follicle (twins, triplets, or
even more fetuses result if more than one follicle matures to the point of releas-
ing an ovum).
2. One cell of this mass, the oocyte (produced by oogenesis, or meiosis), becomes
the ovum while the remaining cells surround the ovum as part of the cumulus
oophorus and others line the fluid-filled follicular cavity as the membrana
granulosa.
3. As the ovum matures, its follicle moves toward the ovary’s surface and begins
secreting the hormone estrogen, which signals the endometrium (uterine
lining) to build up in preparation for pregnancy.
4. As blood levels of estrogen begin to rise, the pituitary stops releasing FSH and
begins releasing luteinizing hormone, or LH, which prompts the Graafian fol-
licle now at the surface of the ovary to rupture, triggering ovulation — the
release of the ovum.
5. Ringed by follicular cells in what’s called the corona radiata, the ovum
enters the coelom (body cavity) and is swept into the Fallopian tube by a
fringe of tissue called fimbriae.
6. It takes approximately three days for the ovum to travel from the Fallopian
tube to the uterus.
Meanwhile, back at the ovary, a clot has formed inside the ruptured follicle and the
membrana granulosa cells are being replaced by yellow luteal cells, forming a corpus
luteum (literally “yellow body”) on the surface of the ovary. This new endocrine gland
secretes progesterone, a hormone that signals the uterine lining to prepare for possible
implantation of a fertilized egg, inhibits the maturing of Graafian follicles, ovulation,
and the production of estrogen to prevent menstruation; and stimulates further
growth in the mammary glands (which is why some women get sore breasts a few days
before their periods begin). If pregnancy occurs, the placenta also will release proges-
terone to prevent menstruation throughout the pregnancy.
If the ovum isn’t fertilized, the corpus luteum dissolves after 10 to 14 days to be
replaced by scar tissue called the corpus albicans. If pregnancy does occur, the corpus
luteum remains and grows for about six months before disintegrating. Only about 400
of a woman’s primordial follicles ever get a chance to make the trip to the uterus. The
rest ripen to various stages before degenerating into what are known as atretic follicles
(or corpora atretica) over the course of her lifetime. Figure 14-1 shows what happens
inside an ovary.
Fallopian tubes, oviducts, uterine tubes — call them what you will, but they’re where
the real business of fertilization takes place. Why? Because an egg must be fertilized
within 24 hours of its release from the ovary to remain viable. These small, muscular
tubes lined with cilia are nearly 5 inches long and, somewhat surprisingly, aren’t
directly connected to the ovaries. Instead, the funnel-shaped end, the infundibulum,
of a tube is fragmented into finger-like projections called fimbriae that help to move
220
Part IV: Survival of the Species 

the ovum from the body cavity into the tube. When it’s in the tube, where fertilization
takes place, the combined motions of both cilia and peristalsis (the same muscle
contractions that move food through the digestive system) propel the ovum toward
the uterus for implantation. If a fertilized egg implants anywhere else — say in the
hollow of the Fallopian tube itself — the pregnancy is referred to as ectopic and the
woman must have immediate surgery to remove the developing embryo before it can
damage any vital organs.
While not attached to the ovaries, the Fallopian tubes are attached to the pear-shaped
uterus, which is located between the urinary bladder and the rectum. Its upper, wide
end is called the fundus; the lower, narrow end that opens into the vagina is the cervix;
and the central region is the body. Endometrium lines the uterus in varying amounts
depending on the stage of a woman’s menstrual cycle or pregnancy. This lining is sup-
ported by a thick muscular layer called the myometrium, which is under the control of
the autonomic nervous system and comes into play when the uterus contracts, such
as during labor.
Sperm enter and menstrual fluid leaves through the vagina, a muscular tube that
connects the uterus with the outside of the body. Lined with a fold of highly elastic
mucous membrane, the vagina can enlarge greatly during childbirth. A folded mem-
brane of connective tissue called the hymen lies at the opening of the vaginal canal
until it is ruptured or torn, often by sexual intercourse but sometimes by other physical
activities. At either side of the vaginal opening are two Bartholin glands that secrete a
lubricating mucous.
On the outside, the female genitalia extends toward the posterior from a mound of
soft, fatty tissue called the mons pubis that covers the bone structure called the pubic
symphysis. Behind this, the vulva consists of two flaps of fatty tissue: the outer lips, or
labia majora; and the smaller, hairless inner lips, the labia minora. Just above where
the inner lips join is a small flap of tissue called the clitoral hood, under which is the
clitoris, erectile tissue that swells during sexual arousal. Below the clitoris is the exter-
nal opening of the urethra and below that is the introitus, the opening to the vagina.

Making Eggs: A Mite More Meiosis
We cover meiosis in detail in Chapter 13, but we also cover the process in this section,
exploring how meiosis contributes to making a zygote (fertilized egg) and its chromo-
somal makeup. Normal human diploid, or 2N, cells contain 23 pairs of homologous
chromosomes for a total of 46 chromosomes each. One chromosome from each pair
comes from the individual’s mother, and the other comes from the father. Each homol-
ogous pair contains the same type of genetic information, but the expression of this
genetic information may differ from one chromosome of the pair to the homologous
chromosome. For example, one chromosome from the mother may carry the genetic
coding for blue eyes, whereas the homologous chromosome from the father may code
for brown eyes.
Although all the body’s cells have 46 chromosomes — including the cells that eventu-
ally mature into the ovum and the sperm — each gamete (either ovum or sperm)
must offer only half that number if fertilization is to succeed. That’s where meiosis
steps in. As you see in Figure 14-3, the number of chromosomes is cut in half during
the first meiotic division, producing gametes that are haploid, or 1N. The second mei-
otic division produces four haploid sperms in the male but only one functional haploid
ovum in the female. When fertilization occurs, the new zygote will contain 23 pairs of
homologous chromosomes for a total of 46 chromosomes. The zygote then proceeds
through mitosis to produce the body’s cells, distributing copies of all 46 chromosomes
to each new cell.

Making Babies: An Introduction
to Embryology
Fertilization (the joining of ovum and sperm) occurs in the Fallopian tube as the ovum
travels toward the uterus. Fertilization must occur within 24 hours of ovulation or the
ovum degenerates. But that doesn’t mean that sexual intercourse outside that time
frame can’t lead to pregnancy. Research indicates that spermatozoa can survive up to
seven days inside the uterus and Fallopian tubes. If a sperm is still motile — that is, if
it’s still whipping its flagellum tail — when an ovum comes down the tube, it will do
what it was made to do and penetrate the ovum’s membrane.
When the sperm penetrates the ovum, it releases enzymes that allow it to digest its way
into the ovum, leaving its flagellum behind. After that first sperm penetrates, the mem-
brane instantly solidifies around the ovum, preventing any other sperm from getting
inside. Presto! You’ve got a zygote. Over the next three to five days, the zygote moves
through the Fallopian tube to the uterus, undergoing cleavage (mitotic cell division)
along the way: Two cells become four smaller cells, four cells become eight smaller cells,
and then those eight cells become a solid 16-cell ball called a morula. After five days of
cleavage, the cells form a hollow ball of approximately 32 cells called a blastula, or blasto-
cyst. The inner hollow region is called the blastocoele, and the outer-layer cells are called
the trophoblast. Figure 14-4 illustrates this process of development.
Within three days of its arrival in the uterine cavity (generally within a week of fertiliza-
tion), the blastocyst implants in the endometrium, and some of the blastocyst’s cells —
called totipotent embryonic stem cells — organize into an inner cell mass called the
embryonic disk, or embryoblast. Over time, the embryonic disk differentiates into the tis-
sues of the developing embryo (see Figure 14-4). Cells above the disk form the amniotic
cavity, and those below form the gut cavity and two primitive germ layers. The layer near-
est the amniotic cavity forms the ectoderm while that nearest the gut cavity forms the
endoderm. Between the two layers, additional ectodermal cells develop to form a third
layer, the mesoderm. The ectoderm forms skin and nerve tissue; the mesoderm forms
bones, cartilage, connective tissue, muscles, and organs; and the endoderm forms the
linings of the organs and glands.
To keep these terms straight, remember that endo– means “inside or within,” ecto–
means “outer or external,” and meso– means “middle.”
After three weeks of development, the heart begins beating. In the fourth week of
development, the embryonic disk forms an elongated structure that attaches to the
developing placenta by a connecting stalk. A head and jaws form while primitive buds
sprout; the buds will develop into arms and legs. During the fifth through seventh
weeks, the head grows rapidly and a face begins to form (eyes, nose, and a mouth).
Fingers and toes grow at the ends of the elongating limb buds. All internal organs have
started to form. After eight weeks of development, the embryo begins to have a more
human appearance and is referred to as a fetus.
The outer cells of the embryo, together with the endometrium of the uterus, form the
placenta, a new internal organ that exists only during pregnancy. The placenta attaches
the fetus to the uterine wall, exchanges gases and waste between the maternal and
fetal bloodstreams, and secretes hormones to sustain the pregnancy.

Growing from Fetus to Baby
Pregnancy is divided into three periods called trimesters (although many new parents
bemoan a postnatal fourth trimester until the baby sleeps through the night). The first
12 weeks of development mark the first trimester, during which organogenesis (organ
formation) is established. During the second trimester, all fetal systems continue to
develop and rapid growth triples the fetus’s length. By the third trimester, all organ
systems are functional and the fetus usually is considered viable (capable of surviving

outside the womb) even if it’s born prematurely. The overall growth rate slows in the
third trimester, but the fetus gains weight rapidly.
Milestones in fetal development can be marked monthly.
 At the end of the second month (when the terminology changes from “embryo”
to “fetus”), the head remains overly large compared to the developing body, and
the limbs are still short. All major regions of the brain have formed.
 During the third month, body growth accelerates and head growth slows. The
arms reach the length they will maintain during fetal development. The bones
begin to ossify, and all body systems have begun to form. The circulatory
(cardiovascular) system supplies blood to all the developing extremities, and
even the lungs begin to practice “breathing” amniotic fluid. By the end of the
third month, the external genitalia are visible in the male (ultrasound technicians
call this a “turtle sign”). The fetus is a bit less than 4 inches long and weighs
about 1 ounce.
 The body grows rapidly during the fourth month as legs lengthen, and the skele-
ton continues to ossify as joints begin to form. The face looks more human. The
fetus is about 7 inches long and weighs 4 ounces.
 Growth slows during the fifth month, and the legs reach their final fetal propor-
tions. Skeletal muscles become so active that the mother can feel fetal movement.
Hair grows on the head, and lanugo, a profusion of fine soft hair, covers the skin.
The fetus is about 12 inches long and weighs 1⁄2 to 1 pound.
 The fetus gains weight during the sixth month, and eyebrows and eyelashes
form. The skin is wrinkled, translucent, and reddish because of dermal blood
vessels. The fetus is between 11 and 14 inches long and weighs a bit less than
11⁄2 pounds.
 During the seventh month, skin becomes smoother as the fetus gains subcuta-
neous fat tissue. The eyelids, which are fused during the sixth month, open.
Usually, the fetus turns to an upside-down position. It’s between 13 and 17 inches
long and weighs from 21⁄2 to 3 pounds.
 During the eighth month, subcutaneous fat increases, and the fetus shows more
baby-like proportions. The testes of a male fetus descend into the scrotum. The
fetus is now 16 to 18 inches long and has grown to just under 5 pounds.
 During the ninth month, the fetus plumps up considerably with additional sub-
cutaneous fat. Much of the lanugo is shed, and fingernails extend all the way to
the tips of the fingers. The average newborn at the end of the ninth month is
20 inches long and weighs about 71⁄2 pounds.

Growing, Changing, and Aging
After a baby arrives, the female reproductive system goes into a different form of
overdrive. Throughout the pregnancy, the placenta has been producing estrogen and
progesterone to sustain the fetus. But after the baby is born, the sudden drop in hor-
monal blood levels triggers the pituitary gland to release prolactin, a hormone that
stimulates the woman’s mammary glands to secrete milk in a process called lactation.
First, however, the glands produce colostrum, a thin, yellowish fluid rich in antibodies
and minerals to sustain a newborn. Both colostrum and milk flow from a number of
lobes inside the breast through lactiferous ducts that converge on the nipple.
From birth to 4 weeks of age, the newborn is called a neonate. Faced with survival after
its physical separation from the mother, a neonate must abruptly begin to process
food, excrete waste, obtain oxygen, and make circulatory adjustments.
From 4 weeks to 2 years of age, the baby is called an infant. Growth during this period is
explosive under the stimulation of circulatory growth hormones from the pituitary gland,
adrenal steroids, and thyroid hormones. The infant’s deciduous teeth, also called baby or
milk teeth, begin to form and erupt through the gums. The nervous system advances,
making coordinated activities possible. The baby begins to develop language skills.
From 2 years to puberty, you’re looking at a child. Influenced by growth hormones,
growth continues its rapid pace as deciduous teeth are replaced by permanent teeth.
Muscle coordination, language skills, and intellectual skills also develop rapidly.
From puberty, which starts between the ages of 11 and 14, to adulthood, the child is
called an adolescent. Growth occurs in spurts. Girls achieve their maximum growth
rate between the ages of 10 and 13, whereas boys experience their fastest growth
between the ages of 12 and 15. Primary and secondary sex characteristics begin to
appear. Growth terminates when the epiphyseal plates of the long bones ossify some-
time between the ages of 18 and 21. Motor skills and intellectual abilities continue to
develop, and psychological changes occur as adulthood approaches.
The young adult stage covers roughly 20 years, from the age of 20 to about 40. Physical
development reaches its peak and adult responsibilities are assumed, often including a
career, marriage, and a family. After about age 30, physical changes that indicate the
onset of aging begin to occur.
From age 40 to about 65, physiological aging continues. Gray hair, diminished physical
abilities, and skin wrinkles are outward signs of aging. Women go through menopause,
the cessation of monthly cycles, which is also known as climacteric or the change of
life. While menarche (the onset of menstruation) may begin any time between 10 and
15 years of age, the female body’s monthly reproductive cycle slows and stops entirely
229
Chapter 14: Carrying Life Forward: The Female Reproductive System

between the ages of 40 and 55. With the cessation of menses comes a decrease in size
of the uterus, shortening of the vagina, shrinkage of the mammary glands, disappear-
ance of Graafian follicles, and shrinkage of the ovaries. For about six years prior to
menopause, many women experience a stage called perimenopause during which
increasingly irregular hormone secretions can cause fluctuations in menstruation and
a sensation called hot flashes.
From age 65 until death is the period of senescence, the process of aging. Individual
adults can show widely varying patterns of aging in part because of differences in
genetic background and physical activities. Signs of senescence include loss of skin
elasticity and accompanying sagging or wrinkling; weakened bones and decreasingly
mobile joints; weakened muscles; impaired coordination, memory, or intellectual func-
tion; cardiovascular problems; reduced immune responses; decreased respiratory
function caused by reduced lung elasticity; and decreased peristalsis and muscle tone
in the digestive and urinary tracts.

Answers to Questions on the Female
Reproductive System
The following are answers to the practice questions presented in this chapter.
a
Follicular growth (or change) in the ovary is started by d. FSH. That’s short for follicle stimulat-
ing hormone, which is released by the pituitary gland.
b
Which one of the following is not part of the maturing Graafian follicle? d. Corpora atretica.
Follicles that never matured all the way become corpora atretica over time.
c
Which one of the following is not a function of estrogen? c. Supporting development of the
corpus luteum. By the time the corpus luteum starts to develop, estrogen already has begun to
bow out of the reproductive equation.
d
Which of the following does not produce a hormone? d. Corpus albicans. Corpus albicans is the
scar tissue that follows disintegration of the corpus luteum, so it makes sense that it doesn’t
produce any hormones.
e
Ectopic: c. Development of out-of-place embryo. Ektopos in Greek literally means “out of place.”
f
Gestation: a. Period of intrauterine development. “Gestation” is just a fancy term for pregnancy,
and intra– means “within.”
g
Ovulation: d. Release of ovum into coelom. Ignore the reference to the body cavity. “Release of
ovum” is the giveaway here.
h
Menopause: b. Cessation of menses. Menses is the same as menstruation.
i
Luteinization: e. Glandular development by membrana granulosa. The granulosa cells
become luteal cells to form the corpus luteum, which is actually a new gland each month.
j
Progesterone is produced by the d. corpus luteum.
k
Corona radiata: c. Follicle cells surrounding the ovum
l
Endometrium: e. Inner lining of the uterus
m
Corpus luteum: a. Endocrine gland that secretes progesterone
n
Stroma: d. Body of the ovary
o
Membrana granulosa: b. Lining of the follicle
p
Prevents menstruation in pregnant females: a. Progesterone

K
How many chromosomes are in each sperm produced by a male? b. 23. Cut the usual comple-
ment in half to form a gamete.
L
How many chromosomes are in each ovum produced by a female? b. 23. Same answer for the
same reason as in the preceding question.
M
How many chromosomes are in a newly fertilized egg, or zygote? a. 46. The 23 in the ovum plus
the 23 in the sperm equals 46.
N
A haploid cell contains how many chromosomes? b. 23.
The number of chromosomes in a haploid cell may be easier to remember this way: Haploid is
half, but diploid is double that.
O
The process of chromosomal reduction is called c. meiosis. Don’t be fooled by this question;
mitosis is when a cell replicates itself — with a full complement of chromosomes. Meiosis is also
cell division, but it occurs only when the body is working to make gametes for reproduction.
P–W
Meiosis produces sperm and ovum, which contributes to making a 41. zygote (fertilized egg)
and its chromosomal makeup. Normal humans have 42. diploid, or 2N, cells containing 23 pairs
of homologous chromosomes for a total of 46 chromosomes each. A pair of chromosomes con-
taining the same type of genetic information are 43. homologous chromosomes. An ovum and a
sperm are called sex cells or 44. gametes. The number of chromosomes is cut in half during the
first meiotic division, producing gametes that are 45. haploid, or 1N. The second meiotic divi-
sion produces 46. four haploid sperms in the male but only 47. one functional haploid ovum
in the female. The zygote then proceeds through 48. mitosis to produce the body’s cells.

roughly 7 inches long and 4 ounces
5th month: Mother can feel fetal movement, hair grows on head, lanugo covers skin, about
12 inches long and 8 to 16 ounces
6th month: Eyebrows and eyelashes form, weight gain accelerates, roughly 11 to 14 inches
long and just under 1 1⁄2 pounds
7th month: Subcutaneous fat begins to form, eyelids open, usually turns to upside-down posi-

hroughout this book, you look at the human body from head to toe, exploring how it
collects and distributes the molecules it needs to grow and thrive, how it reproduces
itself, and even how it gets rid of life’s nastier byproducts. In this chapter, however, you look
at the living computer that choreographs the whole show, the one system that contributes
the most to making us who we are as humans.
The nervous system is the communications network that goes into nearly every part of the
body, enervating your muscles, pricking your pain sensors, and letting you reach beyond
yourself into the larger world. More than 80 major nerves make up this intricate network,
and each nerve contains somewhere around 1 million neurons (individual nerve cells).
It’s through this complex network that you respond both to external and internal stimuli,
demonstrating a characteristic called irritability (the capacity to respond to stimuli, not the
tendency to yell at annoying people).
There are three functional types of cells in the nervous system: receptor cells that receive a
stimulus (sensing); conductor cells that transmit impulses (integrating); and effector cells, or
motor neurons, which bring about a response such as contracting a muscle. Put another way,
there are three functions of the human nervous system as a whole: orientation, or the ability
to generate nerve impulses in response to changes in the external and internal environments
(this also can be referred to as perception); coordination, or the ability to receive, sort, and
direct those signals to channels for response (this also can be referred to as integration); and
conceptual thought, or the capacity to record, store, and relate information received and to
form plans for future reactions to environmental change (which includes specific action).
In this chapter, you get a feel for how the nervous system is put together. You practice identi-
fying the parts and functions of nerves and the brain itself as well as the structure and activi-
ties of the Big Three parts of the whole nervous system: the central, the peripheral, and the
autonomic systems. In addition, we touch on the sensory organs that bring information into
the human body.

Building from Basics: Neurons, Nerves,
Impulses, Synapses
Before trying to study the system as a whole, it’s best to break it down into building
blocks first.
Neurons
The basic unit that makes up nerve tissue is the neuron (also called a nerve cell). Its
properties include that marvelous irritability that we speak of in the chapter introduc-
tion as well as conductivity, otherwise known as the ability to transmit a nerve impulse.
The central part of a neuron is the cell body, or soma, that contains a large nucleus
with one or more nucleoli, mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, numerous ribosomes, and
Nissl bodies that are associated with conduction of a nerve impulse. (See Chapter 2 for
an overview of a cell’s primary parts.) Extending from the cell body are threads of
cytoplasm, or cytoplasmic projections, containing specialized fibrils, or neurofibrillae.
Two types of cytoplasmic projections play a role in neurons: Dendrites conduct
impulses to the cell body while axons (nerve fibers) usually conduct impulses away
from the cell body (see Figure 15-1). Each neuron has only one axon; however, each
axon can have many branches called axon collaterals, enabling communication with
many target cells. The point of attachment on the soma is called the axon hillock. In
addition, each neuron may have one dendrite, several dendrites, or none at all.
There are three types of neurons, as follows:
 Motor neurons, or efferent neurons, transmit messages from the brain and spinal
cord to effector organs, including muscles and glands, triggering them to
respond. Motor neurons are classified structurally as multipolar because they’re
star-shaped cells with a single large axon and numerous dendrites.
 Sensory neurons, or afferent neurons, are triggered by physical stimuli, such as
light, and pass the impulses on to the brain and spinal cord. Sensory fibers have
special structures called receptors, or end organs, where the stimulus is propa-
gated. Sensory neurons can be classified structurally as either monopolar or bipo-
lar. Monopolar neurons have a single process (a projection or outgrowth of tissue)
that divides shortly after leaving the cell body; one branch conveys impulses from
sense organs while the other branch carries impulses to the central nervous
system. Bipolar neurons have two processes — one dendrite and one axon.
 Association neurons (also called internuncial neurons, interneurons, or interca-
lated neurons) are triggered by sensory neurons and relay messages between
neurons within the brain and spinal cord. Interneurons, like motor neurons, are
classified structurally as multipolar.
Here are a couple of handy memory devices: Afferent connections arrive, and efferent
connections exit. Dendrites deliver impulses while axons send them away.
238
Part V: Mission Control: All Systems Go 

Nerves
Whereas neurons are the basic unit of the nervous system, nerves are the cable-like
bundles of axons that weave together the peripheral nervous system. There are three
types of nerves:
 Afferent nerves are composed of sensory nerve fibers (axons) grouped together
to carry impulses from receptors to the central nervous system.
 Efferent nerves are composed of motor nerve fibers carrying impulses from the
central nervous system to effector organs, such as muscles or glands.
 Mixed nerves are composed of both afferent and efferent nerve fibers.
The diameter of individual axons (nerve fibers) tends to be microscopically small —
many are no more than a micron, or one-millionth of a meter. But these same axons
extend to lengths of 1 millimeter and up. The longest axons in the human body run
from the base of the spine to the big toe of each foot, meaning that these single-cell
fibers may be 1 meter or more in length.
Each axon is swathed in myelin, a white fatty material made up of concentric layers of
Schwann cells in peripheral nerves. Oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system are
also associated with myelinated nerve fibers. The result is a structure referred to as a
myelin sheath. Gaps in the sheath called nodes of Ranvier give the underlying nerve
fiber access to extracellular fluid, to speed up propagation of the nerve impulse.
Nonmyelinated nerve fibers lie within body organs and therefore don’t need protective
myelin sheaths to help them transmit impulses. Many peripheral nerve cell fibers also
are protected by a neurilemmal sheath, a membrane that surrounds both the nerve
fiber and its myelin sheath.

Chapter 15: Feeling Jumpy: The Nervous System

From the inside out, nerves are composed of the following:
 Axon: The impulse-conducting process of a neuron
 Myelin sheath: An insulating envelope that protects the nerve fiber and facilitates
transmission of nerve impulses
 Neurolemma (or neurilemma): A thin membrane present in many peripheral
nerves that surrounds the nerve fiber and the myelin sheath
 Endoneurium: Loose, or areolar, connective tissue surrounding individual fibers
 Fasciculi: Bundles of fibers within a nerve
 Perineurium: The same kind of connective tissue as endoneurium; surrounds a
bundle of fibers
 Epineurium: The same kind of connective tissue as endoneurium and perineurium;
surrounds several bundles of fibers
There also is a class of cells called neuroglia, or simply glia, that act as the supportive
cells of the nervous system, providing neurons with nutrients and otherwise protecting
them. Glia include oligodendrocytes that support the myelin sheath within the central
nervous system; star-shaped cells called astrocytes that both support nerve tissue and
contribute to repairs when needed; and microgliacytes, cells that remove dead or dying
parts of tissue (this type of cell is called a phagocyte, which literally translates from the
Greek words for “cell that eats”).
Impulses
Neuron membranes are semi-permeable (meaning that certain small molecules like
ions can move in and out but larger molecules can’t), and they’re electrically polarized
(meaning that positively charged ions called cations rest around the outside mem-
brane surface while negatively charged ions called anions line the inner surface; you
can find more about ions in Chapter 1).
A neuron that isn’t busy transmitting an impulse is said to be at its resting potential. But
the nerve impulse theory, or membrane theory, says that things switch around when a
stimulus — a nerve impulse, or action potential — moves along the neuron. A stimulus
changes the specific permeability of the fiber membrane and causes a depolarization
due to a reshuffling of the cations and anions. This change spreads along the nerve
fiber and constitutes the nerve impulse. It’s called an all-or-none response because
each neuron has a specific threshold of excitation. Once that threshold is exceeded, the
nerve fiber responds with a fixed impulse. After depolarization, repolarization occurs
followed by a refractory period, during which no further impulses occur, even if the
stimuli’s intensity increases.
Intensity of sensation, however, depends on the frequency with which one nerve
impulse follows another and the rate at which the impulse travels. That rate is deter-
mined by the diameter of the impacted fiber and tends to be more rapid in large nerve
fibers. It’s also more rapid in myelinated fibers than nonmyelinated fibers. The cyto-
plasm of the axon or nerve fiber is electrically conductive and the myelin decreases
the capacitance to prevent charge leakage through the membrane. Depolarization at
one node of Ranvier is sufficient to trigger regeneration of the voltage at the next node.
Therefore, in myelinated nerve fibers the action potential does not move as a wave but
recurs at successive nodes, traveling faster than in nonmyelinated fibers. This is
referred to as saltatory conduction (from the Latin word saltare, which means “to hop
or leap”).
240
Part V: Mission Control: All Systems Go 

Synapses
Neurons don’t touch, which means that when a nerve impulse reaches the end of a
neuron, it needs to cross a gap to the next neuron or to the gland or muscle cell for
which the message is intended. That gap is called a synapse, or synaptic cleft. An electric
synapse — generally found in organs and glial cells — uses channels known as gap junc-
tions to permit direct transmission of signals between neurons. But in other parts of the
body, chemical changes occur to let the impulse make the leap. The end branches of an
axon each form a terminal knob or bulb called a bouton terminal (that first word’s pro-
nounced boo-taw), beyond which there is a space between it and the next nerve path-
way. When an impulse reaches the bouton terminal, the following happens:
1. Synaptic vesicles in the knob release a transmitter called acetylcholine that
flows across the gap and increases the permeability of the next cell mem-
brane in the chain.
2. An enzyme called cholinesterase breaks the transmitter down into acetyl and
choline, which then diffuse back across the gap.
3. An enzyme called choline acetylase in the synaptic vesicles reunites the
acetyl and choline, prepping the bouton terminal to do its job again when
the next impulse rolls through.

Minding the Central Nervous System 
and the Brain
Together, the brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous system. The spinal
cord, which forms very early in the embryonic spinal canal, extends down into the tail
portion of the vertebral column. But because bone grows much faster than nerve
tissue, the end of the cord soon is too short to extend into the lowest reaches of the
spinal canal. In an adult, the 18-inch spinal cord ends between the first and second
lumbar vertebrae, roughly where the last ribs attach. Its tapered end is called the conus
medullaris. The cord continues as separate strands below that point and is referred to
as the cauda equina (horse tail). A thread of fibrous tissue called the filum terminale
extends to the base of the coccyx (tailbone) and is attached by the coccygeal ligament.

Spinal cord
An oval-shaped cylinder with two deep grooves running its length at the back and the
front, the spinal cord doesn’t fill the spinal cavity by itself. Also packed inside are the
meninges, cerebrospinal fluid, a cushion of fat, and various blood vessels.
Three membranes called meninges envelop the central nervous system, separating it
from the bony cavities. The dura mater, the outer layer, is the hardest, toughest, and
most fibrous layer and is composed of white collagenous and yellow elastic fibers. The
arachnoid, or middle membrane, forms a web-like layer just inside the dura mater.
The pia mater, a thin inner membrane, lies close along the surface of the central nerv-
ous system. The pia mater and arachnoid may adhere to each other and are considered
as one, called pia-arachnoid.
There are spaces or cavities between the pia mater and the arachnoid where major
regions join, for instance where the medulla oblongata and the cerebellum join. These
sub-arachnoid spaces are called cisterna. Spaces or cavities between the arachnoid
layer and the dura mater layer are referred to as subdural.
Two types of solid material make up the inside of the cord, which you can see in
Figure 15-2: gray matter (which is indeed grayish in color) containing unmyelinated
neurons, dendrites, cell bodies, and neuroglia; and white matter, so-called because of
the whitish tint of its myelinated nerve fibers. At the cord’s midsection is a small
central canal surrounded first by gray matter in the shape of the letter H and then by
white matter, which fills in the areas around the H pattern. The legs of the H are called
anterior, posterior, and lateral horns of gray matter, or gray columns.
Illustration by Imagineering Media Services Inc.
The white matter consists of thousands of myelinated nerve fibers arranged in three
funiculi (columns) on each side of the spinal cord that convey information up and
down the cord’s tracts. Ascending afferent (sensory) nerve tracts carry impulses to
the brain; descending efferent (motor) nerve tracts carry impulses from the brain.
Each tract is named according to its origin and the joint of synapse, such as the corti-
cospinal and spinothalmic tracts.
Thirty-one pairs of spinal nerves arise from the sides of the spinal cord and leave the
cord through the intervertebral foramina (spaces) to form the peripheral nervous

system, which we discuss in the later section “Taking Side Streets: The Peripheral
Nervous System.” 
Brain
One of the largest organs in the adult human body, the brain tips the scales at 3 pounds
and packs roughly 100 billion neurons (yes, that’s billion with a “b”) and 900 billion
supporting neuroglia cells. In this section, we review six major divisions of the brain
from the bottom up (see Figure 15-3): medulla oblongata, pons, midbrain, cerebellum,
diencephalon, and cerebrum.
Medulla oblongata
The spinal cord meets the brain at the medulla oblongata, or brainstem, just below the
right and left cerebellar hemispheres of the brain. In fact, the medulla oblongata is con-
tinuous with the spinal cord at its base (inferiorly) and back (dorsally) and located
anteriorly and superiorly to the pons. All the afferent and efferent tracts of the cord
can be found in the brainstem as part of two bulges of white matter forming an area
referred to as the pyramids. Many of the tracts cross from one side to the other at the
pyramids, which explains why the right side of the brain controls the left side of the
body and vice versa.
Along with the pons, the medulla oblongata also forms a network of gray and white
matter called the reticular formation, the upper part of the so-called extrapyramidal
pathway. With its capacity to arouse the brain to wakefulness, it keeps the brain alert,
directs messages in the form of impulses, monitors stimuli entering the sense recep-
tors (accepting some and rejecting others it deems to be irrelevant), refines body
movements, and effects higher mental processes such as attention, introspection, and
reasoning. Although the cortex of the cerebrum is the actual powerhouse of thought, it
must be stimulated into action by signals from the reticular formation.
Nerve cells in the brainstem are grouped together to form nerve centers (nuclei) that
control bodily functions, including cardiac activities, and respiration as well as reflex
activities such as sneezing, coughing, vomiting, and alimentary tract movements. The
medulla oblongata affects these reactions through the vagus, also referred to as cra-
nial nerve X or the 10th cranial nerve. Three other cranial nerves also originate from
this area: the 9th (IX) or glossopharyngeal, 11th (XI) or accessory, and 12th (XII) or
hypoglossal.
Pons
The pons (literally “bridge”) does exactly as its name implies: It connects the cerebel-
lum through a structure called the middle peduncle, the cerebrum by the superior
peduncle, and the medulla oblongata by the inferior peduncle. It also unites the cere-
bellar hemispheres, coordinates muscles on both sides of the body, controls facial
muscles (including those used to chew), and regulates the first stage of respiration.
Oh, and it contains the nuclei for the following cranial nerves: the 5th (V) or trigemi-
nal, the 6th (VI) or abducens, 7th (VII) or facial, and 8th (VIII) or vestibulocochlear.
Midbrain
Between the pons and the diencephalon lies the mesencephalon, or midbrain. It con-
tains the corpora quadrigemina, which correlates optical and tactile impulses as well
as regulates muscle tone, body posture, and equilibrium through reflex centers in the
superior colliculus. The inferior colliculus contains auditory reflex centers and is
believed to be responsible for the detection of musical pitch. The midbrain contains
245
Chapter 15: Feeling Jumpy: The Nervous System

the cerebral aqueduct, which connects the third ventricle of the thalamus with the
fourth ventricle of the medulla oblongata (see the section “Ventricles” later in this
chapter for more). The mesencephalon contains nuclei for the 3rd (III) or oculomotor
cranial nerve and the 4th (IV) or trochlear cranial nerve. The red nucleus that contains
fibers of the rubrospinal tract, a motor tract that acts as a relay station for impulses
from the cerebellum and higher brain centers, also lies within the midbrain, constitut-
ing the superior cerebellar peduncle.
Cerebellum
The cerebellum also is known as the little brain or small brain. The second-largest divi-
sion of the brain, it’s just above and overhangs the medulla oblongata and lies just
beneath the rear portion of the cerebrum. Inside, the cerebellum resembles a tree called
the arbor vitae, or “tree of life.” A central body called the vermis connects the two lateral
masses called the cerebellar hemispheres and assists in motor coordination and refine-
ment of muscular movement, aiding equilibrium and muscle tone. The cerebellar cortex
or gray matter contains Purkinje neurons with pear-shaped cell bodies, a multitude of
dendrites, and a single axon. It sends impulses to the white matter of the cerebellum and
to other deeper nuclei in the cerebellum, and then to the brainstem. The cerebellar
cortex has parallel ridges called the folia cerebelli, which are separated by deep sulci.
Diencephalon
The diencephalon, a region between the mesencephalon and the cerebrum, contains
separate brain structures called the thalamus, epithalamus, subthalamus, and hypothal-
amus. The region where the two sides of the thalami come in contact and join forces is
called the intermediate mass. The thalamus is a primitive receptive center through
which the sensory impulses travel on their way to the cerebral cortex. Here, nerve
fibers from the spinal cord and lower parts of the brain synapse with neurons leading
to the sensory areas of the cortex of the cerebrum. The thalamus is the great integrat-
ing center of the brain with the ability to correlate the impulses from tactile, pain,
olfactory, and gustatory (taste) senses with motor reactions.
The epithalamus contains the choroid plexus, a vascular structure that produces spinal
fluid. The pineal body and olfactory centers also lie within the epithalamus, which
forms the roof of the third ventricle. The subthalamus is located below the thalamus
and regulates the muscles of emotional expression.
The hypothalamus contains the centers for sexual reflexes; body temperature; water,
carbohydrate, and fat metabolism; and emotions that affect the heartbeat and blood
pressure. It also has the optic chiasm (connecting the optic nerves to the optic tract),
the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland, and a funnel-shaped region called the
infundibulum that forms the stalk of the pituitary gland.
Cerebrum
The cerebrum, or forebrain, is often called the true brain. It has two cerebral hemi-
spheres — the right and the left. A thin outer layer of gray matter called the cerebral
cortex features folds or convolutions called gyri; furrows and grooves are referred to as
sulci, and deeper grooves are called fissures. A longitudinal fissure separates the cere-
brum. The transverse fissure separates the cerebrum and the cerebellum. Each hemi-
sphere has a set of controls for sensory and motor activities of the body. Interestingly,
it’s not just right-side/left-side controls that are reversed in the cerebrum; the upper
areas of the cerebral cortex control the lower body activities while the lower areas of
the cortex control upper-body activities in a reversal called “little man upside down.”
Commissural fibers, a tract of nerves running from one side of the brain to the other,
coordinate activities between the right and left hemispheres. The corpus callosum
246
Part V: Mission Control: All Systems Go 

physically unites the two hemispheres and is the largest and densest mass of commis-
sural fibers. A smaller mass called the fornix also plays a role.
Different functional areas of the cerebral cortex are divided into lobes:
 Frontal lobe: The seat of intelligence, memory, and idea association
 Parietal lobe: Functions in the sensations of temperature, touch, and sense of
position and movement as well as the perception of size, shape, and weight
 Temporal lobe: Is responsible for perception and correlation of acoustical stimuli
 Occipital lobe: Handles visual perception
Medulla
The medulla, the region interior to the cortex, is composed of white matter that con-
sists of three groups of fibers. Projection fibers carry impulses afferently from the brain
stem to the cortex and efferently from the cortex to the lower parts of the central nerv-
ous system. Association fibers originate in the cortical cells and carry impulses to the
other areas of the cortex on the same hemisphere. Commissural fibers connect the two
cerebral hemispheres.
Ventricles
The brain’s four ventricles are cavities and canals filled with cerebrospinal fluid. Two
lateral ventricles are separated by the septum pellucidum. The lateral ventricles com-
municate with the third ventricle through the foramen of Monro. The third ventricle is
connected by the cerebral aqueduct to the fourth ventricle, which is continuous with
the central canal of the spinal cord and contains openings to the meninges. The fourth
ventricle has openings that allow fluid to enter into the subarachnoid spaces.
Lining the ventricles is a thin layer of epithelial cells known as ependyma, or the
ependymal layer. Along with a network of capillaries from the pia mater, the ependyma
and capillaries form the choroid plexus, which is the source of cerebrospinal fluid. The
choroid plexus of each lateral ventricle produces the greatest amount of fluid. Fluid
formed by the choroid plexus filters out by osmosis (refer to Chapter 2) and circulates
through the ventricles. Fluid is returned to the blood through the arachnoid villi,
finger-like projections of the arachnoid meninx, which absorbs the fluid.
Twelve pairs of cranial nerves connect to the central nervous system via the brain (as
opposed to the 31 pairs that connect via the spinal cord). Cranial nerves are identified
by Roman numerals I through XII, and memorizing them is a classic test of anatomical
knowledge. Check out Table 15-1 for a listing of all the nerves, and then read on for a

Taking Side Streets: The Peripheral
Nervous System
The peripheral nervous system is the network that carries information to and from the
spinal cord. Among its key structures are 31 pairs of spinal nerves (see Figure 15-4),
each originating in a segment of the spinal cord called a neuromere. Eight of the spinal
nerve pairs are cervical (having to do with the neck), 12 are thoracic (relating to the
chest, or thorax), five are lumbar (between the lowest ribs and the pelvis), five are
sacral (the posterior section of the pelvis), and one is coccygeal (relating to the tail-
bone). Spinal nerves connect with the spinal cord by two bundles of nerve fibers, or
roots. The dorsal root contains afferent fibers that carry sensory information from
receptors to the central nervous system. The cell bodies of these sensory neurons lie
outside the spinal cord in a bulging area called the dorsal root ganglion (refer to the
cross-section of the spinal cord in Figure 15-2). A second bundle, the ventral root, con-
tains efferent motor fibers with cell bodies that lie inside the spinal cord. In each
spinal nerve, the two roots join outside the spinal cord to form what’s called a
mixed spinal nerve.
Spinal reflexes, or reflex arcs, occur when a sensory neuron transmits a “danger”
signal — like a sensation of burning heat — through the dorsal root ganglion. An inter-
nuncial neuron (or association neuron) in the spinal cord passes along the signal to a
motor neuron (or efferent fiber) that stimulates a muscle, which immediately pulls the
burning body part away from heat (see Figure 15-5).

After a spinal nerve leaves the spinal column, it divides into two small branches. The
posterior, or dorsal ramus, goes along the back of the body to supply a specific seg-
ment of the skin, bones, joints, and longitudinal muscles of the back. The ventral, or
anterior ramus, is larger than the dorsal ramus and supplies the anterior and lateral
regions of the trunk and limbs.

Groups of spinal nerves interconnect to form an extensive network called a plexus
(Latin for “braid”), each of which connects through the anterior ramus, including the
cervical plexus of the neck, brachial plexus of the arms, and lumbosacral plexus of
the lower back (including the body’s largest nerve, the sciatic nerve). However, there’s
no plexus in the thoracic area. Instead, the anterior ramus directly supplies the inter-
costal muscles (literally “between the ribs”) and the skin of the region.

Keep Breathing: The Autonomic
Nervous System
Just as the name implies, the autonomic nervous system functions automatically.
Divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems, it activates the involuntary
smooth and cardiac muscles and glands to serve such vital systems that function auto-
matically as the digestive tract, circulatory system, respiratory, urinary, and endocrine
systems. Autonomic functions are under the control of the hypothalamus, cerebral
cortex, and medulla oblongata. The sympathetic system, which is responsible for the
body’s involuntary fight-or-flight response to stress, is defined by the autonomic fibers
that exit the thoracic and lumbar segments of the spinal cord. The parasympathetic
system is defined by the autonomic fibers that either exit the brainstem via the cranial
nerves or exit the sacral segments of the spinal cord.
The sympathetic and parasympathetic systems oppose each other in function, helping
to maintain homeostasis, or balanced activity in the body systems. Yet, often the sympa-
thetic and parasympathetic systems work in concert. The sympathetic system dilates
the eye’s pupil, but the parasympathetic system contracts it again. The sympathetic
system quickens and strengthens the heart while the parasympathetic slows the heart’s
action. The sympathetic system contracts blood vessels in the skin so more blood goes
to muscles for a fight-or-flight reaction to stress, and the parasympathetic system
dilates the blood vessels when the stress concludes.
253
Chapter 15: Feeling Jumpy: The Nervous System

As shown in Figure 15-6, a pair of sympathetic trunks lies to the right and left of the
spinal cord and is composed of a series of ganglia that form nodular cords extending
from the base of the skull to the front of the coccyx (tailbone). Sympathetic nerves origi-
nate as a short preganglionic neuron with its cell body inside the lateral horn of the gray
matter of the spinal cord from the first thoracic to the third lumbar. Axons of these
nerves then pass through the ventral root of the spinal nerve, leaving it through a
branch of the spinal nerve called the white rami (named for their white myelin sheaths),
which connect to one of the two chains of ganglia in the trunks. Within these hubs,
synapses distribute the nerves to various parts of the body.
The parasympathetic system is referred to as a craniosacral system because its ganglia
originate in the medulla oblongata (brainstem), mesencephalon, and the sacral portion of
the spinal nerves, sending out impulses through the following cranial nerves: the oculo-
motor III, the facial VII, glossopharyngeal IX, and the vagus X. Parasympathetic nerves
consist of long preganglionic fibers that synapse in a terminal ganglion near or within the
organ or tissue that’s being innervated. Generally speaking, the parasympathetic system
acts in opposition to the sympathetic system.

Coming To Your Senses
The nervous system must have some way to perceive its environment in order to gen-
erate appropriate responses. That’s where the senses come in. Sense receptors are
those numerous organs that respond to stimuli — like increased temperature, bitter
tastes, and sharp points — by generating a nerve impulse. While there are millions of
general sense receptors found throughout the body that can convey touch, pain, and
physical contact, there are far fewer of the special sense receptors — those located in
the head — that really bring meaning to your world.
Sense receptors are classified by the stimuli they receive, as follows:
 Exteroceptors: Receive stimuli from the external environment. These are sen-
sory nerve terminals, such as those in the skin and mucous membranes, that are
stimulated by the immediate external environment.
 Interoceptors: Receive stimuli from the internal environment. These can be any
of the sensory nerve terminals located in and transmitting impulses from the
viscera.
 Proprioceptors: Part of the “true” internal environment. They’re sensory nerve
terminals chiefly found in muscles, joints, and tendons that give information
concerning movements and position of the body.
 Teleceptors: Sensory nerve terminals stimulated by emanations from distant
objects. They exist in the eyes, ears, and nose.
255
Chapter 15: Feeling Jumpy: The Nervous System

Eyes
Although there are many romantic notions about eyes, the truth is that an eyeball is
simply a hollow sphere bounded by a trilayer wall and filled with a gelatinous fluid
called, oddly enough, vitreous humor (see Figure 15-7). The outer fibrous coat is made
up of the sclera in back and the cornea in front. The sclera provides mechanical
support, protection, and a base for attachment of eye muscles, and it assists in the
focusing process. The cornea covers the anterior with a clear window.
An intermediate, or vascular, coat called the uvea provides blood and lymphatic fluids to
the eye, regulates light, and also secretes and reabsorbs aqueous humor, a thin watery
liquid that fills the anterior chamber of the eyeball in front of the iris. A pigmented coat
has three layers: the iris, containing blood vessels, pigment cells, and smooth muscle
fibers to control the pupil’s diameter; the ciliary body, which is attached to the periphery
of the iris; and the choroid, a thin, dark brown, vascular layer lining most of the sclera on
the back and sides of the eye. The choroid contains arteries, veins, and capillaries that
supply the retina with nutrients, and it also contains pigment cells to absorb light and
prevent reflection and blurring. An optic nerve enters at the back (posterior) of each eye.
The retina is part of an internal nervous layer that connects with the optic nerve. The
nervous tissue layers along the inner back of the eye contain rods and cones (types of
neurons that analyze visual input). The rods are dim light receptors whereas the cones
detect bright light and construct form, structure, and color. The retina has an optic
disc, which is essentially a blind spot incapable of producing an image.
The crystalline lens consists of concentric layers of protein. It’s biconcave in shape,
bulging outward. Located behind the pupil and iris, the lens is held in place by liga-
ments attached to the ciliary muscles. When the ciliary muscles contract, the shape of
the lens changes, altering the visual focus. This process of accommodation allows the
eye to see objects both at a distance and close up.
The palpebrae (eyelids) extend from the edges of the eye orbit, into which roughly
five-sixths of the eyeball is recessed. Eyelids come together at medial and lateral
angles of the eye that are called the canthi. In the medial angle of the eye is a pink
region called the caruncula, or caruncle. The caruncula contains sebaceous glands and
sudoriferous (sweat) glands. A mucous membrane called the conjunctiva covers the
inner surface of each eyelid and the anterior surface of the eye. Up top and to the side
of the orbital cavities are lacrimal glands that secrete tears that are carried through a
series of lacrimal ducts to the conjunctiva of the upper eyelid. Ultimately, secretions
drain from the eyes through the nasolacrimal ducts.
Ears
Human ears — otherwise called vestibulocochlear organs — are more than just organs
of hearing. They also serve as organs of equilibrium, or balance. Here are the three
divisions of the ear:
 The external ear includes the auricle, or pinna, which is the folded, rounded
appendage made of cartilage and skin. Extending into the skull is the ear canal,
or external auditory meatus, a short passage through the temporal bone ending
at the tympanic membrane, or eardrum. Sebaceous glands near the external open-
ing and ceruminous glands in the upper wall produce the brownish substance
known as earwax, or cerumen.
256
Part V: Mission Control: All Systems Go 

 The middle ear is a small, usually air-filled cavity in the skull that’s lined with
mucous membrane. It communicates through the Eustachian tube with the phar-
ynx. The Eustachian tube keeps air pressure equal on both sides of the eardrum
(tympanic membrane), equalizing pressure in the middle ear with atmospheric
pressure from outside. Three small bones called auditory ossicles occupy the
middle ear, deriving their names from their shapes: the malleus (hammer), the
incus (anvil), and the stapes (stirrup).
 The internal ear is the most complex structure of the entire organ because it’s
where vibrations are translated. It’s composed of a group of interconnected
canals or channels called the cochlea. Within the cochlea are three canals sepa-
rated from each other by thin membranes; two of the canals — the vestibular and
the tympanic — are bony chambers filled with a perilymph fluid, and the third
canal — the cochlear canal — is a membranous chamber filled with endolymph.
The cochlear canal lies between the vestibular and tympanic canals and contains
the organ of Corti, a spiral-shaped organ made up of cells with projecting hairs
that transmit auditory impulses.
The process of hearing a sound follows these basic steps:
1. Sound waves travel through the auditory canal, striking the eardrum and
making it vibrate and setting the three ossicle bones into motion.
2. The stapes at the end of the chain strikes against the oval window of the
vestibular canal, translating the motion into the perilymph fluid in the vestibu-
lar and tympanic canals of the cochlea.
3. The vibrating fluid begins moving the basilar membrane that separates the
two canals, stimulating the endolymph fluid in the membranous area of
the cochlea.
4. The stimulated endolymph fluid in turn stimulates the hair cells of the organ
of Corti, which transmit the impulses to the brain over the auditory nerve.
That’s the hearing part of your ears. Equilibrium requires that some additional parts
come into play. Three semicircular canals, each with an ampulla (or small, dilated por-
tion) at each end, lie at right angles to each other. The ampullae connect to a fluid-filled
sac called a utricle, which in turn connects to another fluid-filled sac called a saccule.
Both sacs contain regions called maculae that are lined with sensitive hairs and contain
concretions (solid masses) of calcium carbonate called otoliths (or otoconia). When
linear acceleration pulls at them, the otoliths press on the hair cells and initiate an
impulse to the brain through basal sensory nerve fibers. When the head changes posi-
tion, it causes a change in the direction of force on the hairs. Movement of the hairs
stimulates dendrites of the vestibulocochlear nerve (the eighth cranial nerve) to carry
impulses to the brain.

Raging Hormones: 
The Endocrine System
In This Chapter
 Absorbing what endocrine glands do
 Checking out the ringmasters: Pituitary and hypothalamus glands
 Surveying the supporting glands
 Understanding how the body balances under stress
T
he human body has two separate command and control systems that work in harmony
most of the time but also work in very different ways. Designed for instant response, the
nervous system cracks its cellular whip using electrical signals that make entire systems
hop to their tasks with no delay (refer to Chapter 15). By contrast, the endocrine system’s
glands use chemical signals called hormones that behave like the steering mechanism on a
large, fully loaded ocean tanker; small changes can have big impacts, but it takes quite a bit
of time for any evidence of the change to make itself known. At times, parts of the nervous
system stimulate or inhibit the secretion of hormones, and some hormones are capable of
stimulating or inhibiting the flow of nerve impulses.
The word “hormone” originates from the Greek word hormao, which literally translates as
“I excite.” And that’s exactly what hormones do. Each chemical signal stimulates some specific
part of the body, known as target tissues or target cells. The body needs a constant supply of
hormonal signals to grow, maintain homeostasis, reproduce, and conduct myriad processes.
In this chapter, we go over which glands do what and where, as well as review the types of
chemical signals that play various roles in the body. You also get to practice discerning what
the endocrine system does, how it does it, and why the body responds like it does.
No Bland Glands
Technically, there are ten or so primary endocrine glands with various other hormone-
secreting tissues scattered throughout the body. Unlike exocrine glands (such as mammary
glands and sweat glands), endocrine glands have no ducts to convey their secretions. Instead,
hormones move directly into extracellular spaces surrounding the gland and from there move
into capillaries and the greater bloodstream. Although they spread throughout the body in the
bloodstream, hormones are uniquely tagged by their chemical composition. Thus they have
separate identities and stimulate specific receptors on target cells so that usually only the
intended cells or tissues respond to their signals.
All of the many hormones can be classified either as steroid (derived from cholesterol) or
nonsteroid (derived from amino acids and other proteins). The steroid hormones — which
include testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, and cortisol — are the ones most closely

associated with emotional outbursts and mood swings. Steroidal hormones, which are
nonpolar (see Chapter 2 for details on cell diffusion), penetrate cell membranes easily
and initiate protein production at the nucleus.
Nonsteroid hormones are divided among four classifications:
 Some are derived from modified amino acids, including such things as epineph-
rine and norepinephrine, as well as melatonin.
 Others are peptide-based, including an antidiuretic hormone called ADH, oxytocin,
and a melanocytes-stimulating hormone called MSH.
 Glycoprotein-based hormones include follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH),
luteinizing hormone (LH), and chorionic gonadotropin — all closely associated
with the female reproductive system.
 Protein-based nonsteroid hormones include such crucial substances as insulin
and growth hormone as well as prolactin and parathyroid hormone.
Hormone functions include controlling the body’s internal environment by regulating
its chemical composition and volume, activating responses to changes in environmen-
tal conditions to help the body cope, influencing growth and development, enabling
several key steps in reproduction, regulating components of the immune system, and
regulating organic metabolism.

Mastering the Ringmasters
The key glands of the endocrine system include the pituitary (also called the hypophy-
sis), adrenal (also referred to as suprarenal), thyroid, parathyroid, thymus, pineal, islets
of Langerhans (within the pancreas), and gonads (testes in the male and ovaries in the
female). But of all these, it’s the pituitary working in concert with the hypothalamus in
the brain that really keeps things rolling (see Figure 16-1).
The hypothalamus is the unsung hero linking the body’s two primary control systems —
the endocrine system and the nervous system. Part of the brain and part of the
endocrine system, the hypothalamus is connected to the pituitary via a narrow stalk
called the infundibulum that carries regular system status reports to the pituitary. In its
supervisory role, the hypothalamus provides neurohormones to control the pituitary
gland and influences food and fluid intake as well as weight control, body heat, and the
sleep cycle.
The hypothalamus sits just above the pituitary gland, which is nestled in the middle of
the human head in a depression of the skull’s sphenoid bone called the sella turcica.
The pituitary’s anterior lobe, also called the adenohypophysis or pars distalis, is some-
times called the “master gland” because of its role in regulating and maintaining the
other endocrine glands. Hormones that act on other endocrine glands are called tropic
hormones; all the hormones produced in the anterior lobe are polypeptides. Two capil-
lary beds connected by venules make up the hypophyseal portal system, which connect
the anterior lobe with the hypothalamus.

Chapter 16: Raging Hormones: The Endocrine System

Among the hormones produced in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland are the
following:
 Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH): Signals an immature Graafian follicle in an
ovary to mature into an ovum, which then produces the hormone estrogen.
Negative feedback from the estrogen blocks further secretion of FSH. Guys, don’t
think you needn’t worry about FSH: It’s present in you, too, encouraging develop-
ment and maturation of sperm.
 Luteinizing hormone (LH): Stimulates formation of the yellow body, or corpus
luteum, on the surface of the ovary after an ovum has been released. In men,
LH stimulates the development of interstitial cells and fresh production of
testosterone.
 Lactogenic hormone, or prolactin (PRL): Promotes milk production in mammary
glands, which are considered nonendocrine targets.
 Interstitial-cell stimulating hormone (ICSH): Stimulates formation and secretion
of testosterone.
 Thyrotropic hormone, or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH): Controls the
development and release of thyroid gland hormones thyroxin and triiodothyronine.
The hypothalamus regulates TSH secretion by secreting thyrotropin-releasing
hormone (TRH).
 Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), or corticotropin: Is a polypeptide
composed of 39 amino acids that regulates the development, maintenance,
and secretion of the cortex of the adrenal gland.
 Somatotropic hormone, or growth hormone (GSH): Stimulates body weight
growth and regulates skeletal growth. This is the only hormone secreted by the
anterior lobe that has a general effect on nearly every cell in the body (also
regarded as nonendocrine targets).
For a review of the male and female reproductive systems, flip to Chapters 13 and 14.
The posterior lobe, or neurohypophysis, of the pituitary gland stores and releases secre-
tions produced by the hypothalamus. This lobe is connected to the hypothalamus
by the hypophyseal tract, nerve axons with cell bodies lying in the hypothalamus.
Whereas the adenohypophysis is made up of epithelial cells, the neurohypophysis is
largely composed of modified nerve fibers and neuroglial cells called pituicytes.
Among the hormones produced in the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland are the
following:
 Oxytocin: Stimulates contraction of the uterine smooth muscle during childbirth
and release of breast milk in nursing women
 Vasopressin, or antidiuretic hormone (ADH): Constricts smooth muscle tissue in
the blood vessels, elevating blood pressure and increasing the amount of water
reabsorbed by the kidneys, which reduces the production of urine. The hypothal-
amus has special neurons called osmoreceptors that monitor the amount of solute
in the blood.

Supporting Cast of Glandular Characters
While the pituitary orchestrates the show at center stage, the endocrine system enjoys
the support of a number of other important glands. Lying in various locations through-
out the body, these glands secrete check-and-balance hormones that keep the body
in tune.
Topping off the kidneys: The adrenal glands
Also called suprarenals, the adrenal glands lie atop each kidney. The central area of
each is called the adrenal medulla, and the outer layers are called the adrenal cortex.
Each glandular area secretes different hormones. The cells of the cortex produce
over 30 steroids, including the hormones aldosterone, cortisone, and some sex hor-
mones. The medullar cells secrete epinephrine (you may know it as adrenaline) and
norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline).
Made up of closely packed epithelial cells, the adrenal cortex is loaded with blood ves-
sels. Layers form an outer, middle, and inner zone of the cortex. Each zone is com-
posed of a different cellular arrangement and secretes different steroid hormones.
 The zona glomerulosa (outer zone) produces aldosterone.
 The zona fasciculata (middle zone) secretes cortisone (also called cortisol).
 The zona reticularis (inner zone) secretes small amounts of gonadocorticoids or
sex hormones.
The following are among the hormones produced by the cortex:
 Aldosterone, or mineralocorticoid, regulates electrolytes (sodium and potassium
mineral salts) retained in the body. It promotes the conservation of water and
reduces urine output.
 Cortisone, or cortisol, acts as an antagonist to insulin, causing more glucose to
form and increasing blood sugar to maintain normal levels. Elevated levels of
cortisone speed up protein breakdown and inhibit amino acid absorption.
 Androgens and estrogen are cortical sex hormones. Androgens generally convey
antifeminine effects, thus accelerating maleness, although in women adrenal
androgens maintain the sexual drive. Too much androgen in females can cause
virilism (male secondary sexual characteristics). Estrogen has the opposite
effect, accelerating femaleness. Too much estrogen in a male produces feminine
characteristics.
The adrenal medulla is made of irregularly shaped chromaffin cells arranged in groups
around blood vessels. The sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system con-
trols these cells as they secrete adrenaline and noradrenaline. Both hormones have
similar molecular structure and physiological functions. The adrenal cortex produces
approximately 80 percent adrenaline and 20 percent noradrenaline. Adrenaline accel-
erates the heartbeat, stimulates respiration, slows digestion, increases muscle effi-
ciency, and helps muscles resist fatigue. Noreadrenaline does similar things but also
raises blood pressure by stimulating contraction of muscular arteries.
270
Part V: Mission Control: All Systems Go 

The terms “adrenaline” and “noradrenaline” are interchangeable with the terms
“epinephrine” and “norepinephrine.” You’re likely to encounter both in textbooks
and exams.
Thriving with the thyroid
The largest of the endocrine glands, the thyroid is like a large butterfly with two lobes
connected by a fleshy isthmus positioned in the front of the neck, just below the larynx
and on either side of the trachea. A transport mechanism called the iodide pump
moves the iodides from the bloodstream for use in creating its two primary hormones,
thyroxin and triiodothyronine, which regulate the body’s metabolic rate. Extrafollicular
cells (also called parafollicular or C cells) secrete calcitonin, a polypeptide hormone
that helps regulate the concentration of calcium and phosphate ions by inhibiting the
rate at which they leave the bones. High blood calcium levels stimulate the secretion
of more calcitonin.
Thyroxin (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) regulate cellular metabolism throughout the
body, but the thyroid needs iodine to manufacture those hormones. Iodine insufficiency
causes the thyroid to swell in a condition called a goiter.
Pairing up with the parathyroid
The parathyroid consists of four pea-sized glands that lie posterior to the thyroid gland
secreting parathormone, or parathyroid hormone (PTH). This large polypeptide regu-
lates the balance of calcium levels in the blood and bones as well as controls the rate at
which calcium is excreted into urine. When blood calcium levels dip, the parathyroid
secretes PTH, which increases calcium absorption from the intestine, decreases cal-
cium excretion, increases phosphate excretion, removes calcium from the bones, and
stimulates secretion of calcitonin by the thyroid C cells. Blood calcium ion homeostasis
is critical to the conduction of nerve impulses, muscle contraction, and blood clotting.
Pinging the pineal gland
The pineal gland, also called the epiphysis, is a small, oval gland thought to play a role
in regulating the body’s biological clock. It lies between the cerebral hemispheres and
is attached to the thalamus near the roof of its third ventricle.
Because it both secretes a hormone and receives visual nerve stimuli, the pineal gland
is considered part of both the nervous system and the endocrine system. Its hormone
melatonin is believed to play a role in circadian rhythms, the pattern of repeated behav-
ior associated with the cycles of night and day. The pineal gland is affected by changes
in light, producing its highest levels of secretion at night and its lowest levels during
daylight hours.
Thumping the thymus
As discussed in Chapter 11, the thymus is thought to secrete a group of peptides
called thymosin that affect the production of lymphocytes (white blood cells).
Thymosin promotes the production and maturation of T lymphocyte cells as part of
the body’s immune system. The gland is large in children and atrophies with age.

Chapter 16: Raging Hormones: The Endocrine System

Pressing the pancreas
The pancreas is both an exocrine and an endocrine gland, which means that it secretes
some substances through ducts while others go directly into the bloodstream. (We
cover its exocrine functions in Chapter 9.) The pancreatic endocrine glands are clusters
of cells called the islets of Langerhans. Within the islets are a variety of cells, including
 A cells (alpha cells) that secrete the hormone glucagon, a polypeptide of

Dealing with Stress: Homeostasis
Nothing upsets your delicate cells more than a change in their internal environment.
A stimulus such as fear or pain provokes a response that upsets your body’s carefully
maintained equilibrium. Such a change initiates a nerve impulse to the hypothalamus
that activates the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system and increases
secretions from the adrenal glands. This change — called a stressor — produces a con-
dition many know oh so well: stress. The body’s immediate response is to push for
homeostasis — keeping everything the same inside.
The body’s effort to maintain homeostasis invokes a series of reactions called the gen-
eral stress syndrome that’s controlled by the hypothalamus. When the hypothalamus
receives stress information, it responds by preparing the body for fight or flight; in other
words some kind of decisive, immediate, physical action. This reaction increases blood
levels of glucose, glycerol, and fatty acids; increases the heart rate and breathing rate;
redirects blood from skin and internal organs to the skeletal muscles; and increases
the secretion of adrenaline from the adrenal medulla. The hypothalamus releases corti-
cotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) that stimulates the anterior lobe of the pituitary to
secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which tells the adrenal cortex to secrete
more cortisone. That cortisone supplies the body with amino acids and an extra
energy source needed to repair any injured tissues that may result from the impending
crisis.
As part of the general stress syndrome, the pancreas produces glucagon, and the ante-
rior pituitary secretes growth hormones, both of which prepare energy sources and
stimulate the absorption of amino acids to repair damaged tissue. The posterior pitu-
itary secretes antidiuretic hormone, making the body hang on to sodium ions and
spare water. The subsequent decrease in urine output is important to increase blood
volume, especially if there’s bleeding or excessive sweating.
Wow. With the body gearing up like that every time, it’s no wonder that people subjected
to repeated stress are often sickly.
We try not to stress you out with these practice questions:
36.–40. Mark the statement with a T if it’s true or an F if it’s false:
36. _____ The hypothalamus controls reactions to combat general stress syndrome.
37. _____ The pancreas is an endocrine gland only.
38. _____ During stress, the pancreas produces thyroxin (T4).
39. _____ Alpha cells in the pancreas secrete the hormone insulin.

Answers to Questions on the Endocrine System
The following are answers to the practice questions presented in this chapter.
a
The endocrine system brings about changes in the metabolic activities of the body tissue.
True. Metabolism is one of the areas influenced by hormones.
b
The amount of hormone released is determined by the body’s need for that hormone at the
time. True. In many ways, it’s a self-regulating system: Just enough hormones are distributed
to balance everything else out.
c
The glands of the endocrine system are composed of cartilage cells. False. That connection
makes no sense whatsoever.
d
Endocrine glands aren’t functional in reproductive processes. False. The endocrine system is a
key component in reproduction.
e
Some hormones can be derivatives of amino acids, whereas others are synthesized from choles-
terol. True. Amino acids for the nonsteroids and cholesterol for the steroid-based hormones.
f
Glands that secrete their product into the interstitial fluid, which flows into the blood, are
b. endocrine glands.
g
Cells that respond to a hormone are c. target cells. Hormones actually go looking for these
specific targets.
h
The pituitary gland consists of two parts: an endocrine gland and modified nerve tissue. True.
Remember that the anterior lobe is mostly epithelial cells, whereas the posterior lobe contains
primarily nerve cells.
i
The pituitary gland is found in the sella turcica of the temporal bone. False. The pituitary gland
is in the sphenoid bone, not the temporal bone.
j
The adenohypophysis is called the master gland because of its influence on all the body’s tis-
sues. False. It earned the title “master gland” because of its influence over the other endocrine
glands.
k
ADH causes constriction of smooth muscle tissue in the blood vessels, which elevates the
blood pressure. True.
l
The neurohypophysis stores and releases secretions produced by the hypothalamus. True.
Seems a strange thing for a structure made of nerve cells to do, but it does its job well.
m
The gland that does the most to regulate and maintain the function of other glands is the
b. pituitary. That’s why it’s the master gland.
n
Which of the following is not a pituitary hormone? a. Progesterone. That’s made by the corpus
luteum on the ovary following ovulation.
o
The adrenal glands are located in the cortex of the kidneys. False. They’re atop the kidneys.
p
Adrenaline is functional in the absorption of stored carbohydrates and fat. False. Adrenaline
does lots of things, but not that.
277
Chapter 16: Raging Hormones: The Endocrine System

q
Aldosterone is functional in regulating the amount of insulin in the body. False. This hormone
regulates mineral salts.
r
The sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system controls the cells of the adrenal
medulla. True.
s
The layers of the adrenal medulla form outer, middle, and inner zones. False. The layers of the
adrenal cortex form those three zones.
t
The endocrine gland that initiates antibody development by producing thymosin is the
c. thymus.
The name of the hormone, thymosin, should be your first clue that it’s produced by the
thymus. See the resemblance?
u
The hormone that regulates the amount of electrolytes retained in the body is a. aldosterone.
v
Iodine is a necessary component of thyroxin (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). True. The body
can’t make those hormones without iodine.
w
Follicular cells of the thyroid produce hormones that affect the metabolic rate of the body. True.
x
A transport mechanism called the sodium pump moves the iodides into the follicle cells. False.
Don’t let the thyroid’s iodide pump make you think it also has a sodium pump. It doesn’t.
y
Thyroxin (T4) is normally secreted in lower quantity than triiodothyronine (T3). False. In fact,
it’s just the opposite — more T4 is secreted than T3.
A
The hormone calcitonin helps regulate the concentration of sodium and potassium. False.
Actually, calcitonin lowers plasma calcium and phosphate levels.
B
Which statement is not true of the pineal gland? e. It promotes immunity. It’s more of a
biological-clock kind of gland.
C
Insufficiency of iodine causes the thyroid gland to enlarge, causing e. simple or endemic
goiter. Sometimes this swelling becomes visible at the base of the neck.
D
The parathyroid gland contains cells that secrete parathormone or parathyroid hormone
(PTH). True.
E
Melatonin is a polypeptide that regulates the balance of calcium in the blood and bones. False.
Melatonin is thought to regulate circadian rhythms.
F
The pineal gland responds to light, producing higher levels of secretions at night than during
the day. True. That’s why it’s also considered part of the nervous system.
G
Thymosin promotes the production and maturation of erythrocyte cells. False. Thymosin
works on lymphocytes.
H
The parathyroid hormone can prompt calcium to move from bone. True. After all, the bones
are mineral reservoirs.
I
The endocrine gland that produces 80 percent epinephrine is the c. medulla of the adrenal.
That’s about all the adrenal medulla does.
278
Part V: Mission Control: All Systems Go 

J
The endocrine gland associated with metabolic rate is the b. thyroid. Controlling the body’s
metabolic rate is its primary role.
K
The hypothalamus controls reactions to combat general stress syndrome. True.
L
The pancreas is an endocrine gland only. False. It’s also an exocrine gland.
M
During stress, the pancreas produces thyroxin (T4). False. That’s the thyroid’s job, and T4 has
nothing to do with stress, anyway.
N
Alpha cells in the pancreas secrete the hormone insulin. False. A cells secrete glucagon.
O
Changes in the body’s environment called stressors produce a condition called stress. True.
P
When changes occur in the body’s internal environment, a reaction is initiated by c. the hypo-
thalamus. It stimulates the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system and adrenal
medulla.
Q
Stress activates a set of body responses called b. the general stress syndrome.
R
The body’s initial reaction to a stressor is a. fight or flight response. You’re either going to put
up your dukes or run like the wind.
S
Which of the following is a response to stress? d. Increase the respiratory rate. That brings in
more oxygen in case you need to move fast.
T
The pancreas, testes, and ovaries all have this in common: b. All are considered to be both
exocrine and endocrine. Secretions go directly into the bloodstream and through ducts.

identifying ten useful tidbits for students of anatomy
and physiology. We identify ten Web sites that can help
you advance your knowledge and ten top study tips

anatomy and physiology courses.

Ten Study Tips

 Getting the most out of study groups

W
hat’s the best way to tackle anatomy and physiology and come out successful on the
other side? Of course, a good memory helps, but it’s not as critical to anatomy and
physiology success as it’s cracked up to be. With a little advance planning and tricks of the
study trade, even students who complain that they can’t remember their own names on
exam day can summon the right terminology and information from their scrambled synaptic
pathways. In this chapter, we cover ten key things you can start doing today to ensure suc-
cess not only in anatomy and physiology but in any number of other classes.
Write It Down in Your Own Words
This is a simple idea that far too few students practice regularly. Don’t stop at underlining
and highlighting important material in your textbooks and study guides: Write it down. Or
type it up. Whatever you do, don’t just regurgitate it exactly as presented in the material
you’re studying. Find your own words. Create your own analogies. Tell your own tale of
what happens to the bolus as it ventures into the digestive tract. Detail the course followed
by a molecule of oxygen as it enters through the nose. Draw pictures of the differences
between meiosis and mitosis. Completely relax into the process with the knowledge that no
one else ever has to see what you write, type, or sketch. All they’ll ever see is your successful
completion of the course!
Better Knowledge through Mnemonics
Studying anatomy and physiology involves remembering lists of terms, functions, and
processes. Sprinkled throughout this book are suggestions to take just the first letter or two of
each word from a list to create an acronym. Occasionally, we help you go one step beyond the
acronym to a clever little thing called a mnemonic device. Simply put, the mnemonic is the
thing you commit to memory as a means for remembering the more technical thing for which
it stands. For example, a question in Chapter 7 asks you to list in order the epidermal layers
from the dermis outward; we suggest that you commit the following phrase to memory: Be
Super Greedy, Less Caring. Just like that, a complicated list like basale, spinosum, granulosum,
lucidum, corneum gets a little closer to a permanent home in your brain.

Not feeling terribly clever at the moment you need a useful mnemonic? Surf on over to
www.medicalmnemonics.com, which touts itself as the world’s database of these
useful tools. Here’s a sampling of the site’s offerings:
 To remember the three types of tonsils: “PPL (people) have tonsils: Pharyngeal,
Palatine, and Lingual.”
 To remember the spleen’s location and dimensions: “Count 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11: The
spleen is 1 inch by 3 inches by 5 inches, weighs 7 ounces, and underlies ribs 9
through 11.”
 To remember the cranial bones; “Think PEST OF 6: Parietal, Ethmoid, Sphenoid,
Temporal, Occipital, Frontal.”
Stylish Learning
Every person has his or her own sense of style, and woe betide anyone who tries to
shoehorn the masses into a single style. The same, of course, is true of students. To get
the most out of your study time, you need to figure out what your learning style is and
alter your study habits to accommodate it. No idea what we’re talking about? Answer the
questionnaire posted at www.vark-learn.com/english/page.asp?p=questionnaire,
and the VARK guide to learning styles will tell you more about yourself than your last
psychotherapist.
VARK, as you may have suspected, is an acronym that stands for Visual (learning by
seeing), Aural (learning by hearing), Reading/Writing (learning by reading and writing),
and Kinesthetic (learning by touching, holding, or feeling). If you’re a visual learner, you
may get more out of anatomy and physiology by seeing the real thing in the flesh. If
you’re an aural learner, you may learn best in the classroom as the teacher lectures.
If you’re a reading and writing kind of learner, you’ll get the most out of our first tip to
write stuff down. And if you’re a kinesthetic learner, there’s nothing like touching or
holding to commit something to memory.
Grecian Formula
If you keep thinking “It’s all Greek to me,” congratulations on your insight! The truth of
the matter is that most of it actually is Greek. So dust off your foreign language learning
skills and begin with the basic vocabulary of medical terminology. (Get started with the
Greek and Latin roots, prefixes, and suffixes that appear on this book’s Cheat Sheet —
the tear-out page in the front of the book.) You’ll soon discover that for every “little”
word you learn, there’s a whole mountain of additional terms and phrases just waiting
to be discovered.
Connecting with Concepts
It happens time and again in anatomy and physiology that one concept or connection
mirrors another yet to be learned. But because you’re focusing so hard on this week’s
lesson, you lose sight of the value in the previous month’s lessons. For example, a
284
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

concept like metabolism comes up in a variety of ways throughout your study of
anatomy and physiology. When you encounter a repeat concept like that, create a
special page or two for it at the back of your notebook, or link the concept to a sepa-
rate computer file. Then, every time the term comes up in class or in your textbook,
add to the running list of notes on that concept. You’ll have references to metabolism
at each point it comes up and you’ll be able to analyze its influences across different
body systems.
Grouping Studies
If you’re really lucky, someone in your class (or maybe it’s even you) has already sug-
gested forming that time-honored tradition — a study group. The power of group
members to fill gaps in your knowledge is priceless. But don’t restrict it to late-night
cramming just before each test. Meet with your group at least once a week to go over
lecture notes and textbook readings. If it’s true that people only retain about 10 per-
cent of what they hear or read, then it makes sense that your fellow group members
will recall things that slipped immediately from your mind.
Outlining What’s to Come
As you read through a chapter of your textbook to prepare for the next lecture, pre-
pare an outline of what you’re reading, leaving plenty of space between subheadings.
Then, during the lecture, take your notes within the outline you’ve already created.
Piecing together an incomplete puzzle shows you where the key gaps in your knowl-
edge may be.
Practice, Practice, Practice
Flash cards, mnemonic drills, practice tests — be creative and practice, practice,
practice! The more you know about the format of any upcoming exam, the better.
Sometimes instructors share tidbits about what they plan to emphasize, but some-
times they don’t. In the end, if you’ve done the work and put in the time to study and
practice with information outside of class, the exact structure and content of an exam
shouldn’t make much difference.
Sleuthing Out Clues
Okay, it’s test time! Take advantage of the test itself. You may find that the answer to
an exam question that stumps you is revealed — at least partially — in the phrasing of
a subsequent question. Stay alert to these blessed little gifts even when you think that
you already understand the whole anatomical process. You wouldn’t be the first stu-
dent to change an answer after working your way through an exam.
285
Chapter 17: Ten Study Tips

Learning from Mistakes
The test is done and the grades are in. So there was a really tough question or two on
the test and you blew it big-time? It’s hardly a missed opportunity — this is where
rolling with the punches really pays off. Go back over the entire test and pay extra
attention to what you got wrong. Start your next practice sessions with those ques-
tions, and stay alert for upcoming material that may trip you up in a similar way.
