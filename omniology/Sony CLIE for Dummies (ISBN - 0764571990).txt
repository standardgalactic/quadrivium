About the Author
Denny Atkin has been writing about technology since 1987, a primitive age
where pioneer computer users toyed with Atari 800s and Commodore Amigas
and actually typed in programs printed in magazines instead of downloading
them. His articles have appeared in a variety of magazines ranging from
pioneering technology/science publications Compute! and OMNI to Wired,
Entertainment Weekly, Computer Gaming World, Computer Shopper, and Handheld
Computing magazine. He has written a number of books, such as the one you’re
holding, and has appeared on Tech TV and CNN.
He’s been using handhelds since the days of the original Apple “I don’t under-
stand what you’re trying to write” Newton. He practices what he preaches,
typically traveling with a CLIÉ, a folding keyboard, and a Bluetooth cell phone
instead of a bulky laptop.
Atkin lives with his wife and son in Vermont, where he’s doing long-term tests
of the CLIÉ’s ability to operate during ridiculously lengthy periods of sub-zero
temperatures.


Dedication
To my supportive, creative, and astonishing wife Dawn, who kept me sane
and laughing and kept the world running while I wrote this book.


Author’s Acknowledgments
This book owes its existence to the CLIÉ community, which has been
amazingly helpful in its production. I’d like to offer my sincere thanks to
these folks:
Tiffany Franklin for giving me the opportunity to do this book, and for her
patience as Murphy decided to use my office to enforce his Law.
Paul Levesque for making sure this book was up to the high standards you
expect from a For Dummies title. Virginia Sanders for doing a brilliant copy-
editing job and actually increasing the number of puns in the book. Darren
Gladstone for an excellent technical review.
Sony’s Eric Geruldsen, who provided invaluable help and ensured that this
book had the most up-to-date info on the latest CLIÉ models.
Christie Burgner, Lisa Burnett, Sebastian Dijmarescu, Jonathan Fernstad,
Kathleen Gilpatrick, Andrew Golden, Alexis Hinds, Mitch Kneppers, Jonathan
Korzen, Candice Kwok, David Levitt, Parker Minardo, Aaron Roth, Moto
Watanabe, Mike Wong, and Ellen Yeomans for ensuring that I had access to
the best CLIÉ software and hardware.
Props to the CLIÉSource gaming gang — sj22Gam3r (aka Mac Tyler), orol,
rightfuture, Remier, and fssia — for making sure that I had all the most
addictive handheld games covered.
And, of course, to Dr. Carol Shuman, Denny Atkin Sr., and Don Thorburn for
introducing me to publishing and technology and for providing years of
inspiration and encouragement.

Sony CLIÉ For Dummies

Introduction
I
f you bought a Sony CLIÉ expecting it to be nothing more than a personal
organizer, boy, are you in for a pleasant surprise. After all, the somewhat
oddball CLIÉ name stands for Communication, Link, Information, and
Entertainment. (Or is that Éntertainment?) That’s promising a lot for a hand-
held computer, but Sony delivers.
Although this device is small enough to fit in your pocket, it’s more than a
replacement for the dog-eared day planner. The CLIÉ is also a miniature game
arcade, a library, and an office computer. Some models even manage to
squeeze in a photo studio, a movie theater, a concert hall, and an Internet ter-
minal. Heck, the CLIÉ outpaces the expectations of science fiction authors
from not long ago.
The CLIÉ is a very useful tool, but it’s also lots of fun. In this book, I point out
the dozens of amazing things that you can do with this electronic wonder.
The CLIÉ has come a long way since it first arrived on the scene way back in
2000, and the newest models are so versatile that I even discovered some
cool new applications for them during the writing of this book.
About This Book
Sony CLIÉ For Dummies is designed to be a comprehensive reference and
tutorial for discovering how to use your CLIÉ. It progresses from the very
basics to advanced topics, from setting up your CLIÉ and entering informa-
tion by using the stylus and keyboard to using wireless technology and set-
ting security features. Along the way, I also show you how to play games,
watch movies, and listen to your favorite tunes.
If you’re new to the CLIÉ, you can start from the first chapter and work your
way through the book, cover to cover. If you’ve already mastered the basics,
feel free to skip around and read the chapters that cover topics that are new
or useful to you. Alternatively, you could use this book as a handy reference
for the next time that you try to do something with the CLIÉ and you’re
stumped. Each chapter is designed to stand by itself, and if I do cover a
related topic somewhere else in the book, I make sure to point you there.

Sony CLIÉ For Dummies focuses on the newest CLIÉ models that are running
Palm OS 5. It’s the first book to cover the newest developments, such as built-
in wireless and Sony’ s innovative CLIÉ Organizer software. Even if you have
an older CLIÉ, you can find plenty of helpful information here. The bundled
software and precise design of particular programs might vary somewhat
from the newest CLIÉs, but most of what I cover here applies to Palm OS 4
CLIÉs as well.
Who Are You?
In writing this book, I made a few assumptions about you, which is always
risky. (You might have heard the old adage about what happens when you
assume.) Nevertheless, this book is for you if some of these are true:
 You have a Sony CLIÉ and you want to find out how to get the most 
from it.
 You don’t have a Sony CLIÉ yet, and you’re wondering just what one
could do for you.
 You’re looking for a book that doesn’t assume (there’s that word again)
that you know all the jargon and tech terms used in the PDA industry.
(PDA stands for Personal Digital Assistant, by the way.)
 You want a reference that shows you how, step by step, to do useful and
cool things with the CLIÉ without bogging you down with unnecessary
background or theory.
 You’re tired of hauling your 10-pound laptop with you on trips, and
you’re wondering how to turn your CLIÉ into a miniature traveling office.
 You no longer want to be tied to your desktop system for the critical
activities in your life, such as playing games, watching movies, and surf-
ing the Internet.
 You want to know how to pronounce CLIÉ. (It’s KLEE-a_. Now aren’t you
glad you bought this book?)
 You’re looking for the secret Deluxe Macaroni and Cheese tip hidden in
one of this book’s figures.
What’s in This Book
CLIÉ For Dummies is organized in seven parts, and each part is further
divided into chapters that are related to the part’s theme. And of course, the
handy section headers (like the one a few lines up from this sentence)
quickly lead you to specific topics.

Sony CLIÉ For Dummies 

Part I: Getting to Know Your CLIÉ
Part I starts with the absolute basics, the stuff that too many manuals assume
you somehow learned by osmosis the first time you picked up your CLIÉ. To
get you jazzed up to find out more, I start with a brief overview of all the
amazingly cool things that the CLIÉ can do for you. Next, you discover how to
interact with your CLIÉ and why it doesn’t automatically understand your
handwriting. Part I wraps up with a look at how your CLIÉ and your desktop
system work together and how you can install all sorts of slick add-on 
programs.
Part II: Getting Organized
Part II covers the applications that PDAs are best known for: the personal
organizer programs. You find out how to enter and manage your Address
Book, create appointments, wrangle your To Do list, and get rid of all the
yellow sticky notes cluttering your desk. After that, you’ll have all sorts of
extra free time, right? Not after you see the fun that I have in store for you in
Part III.
Part III: Multimedia and Entertainment
Part III is where things get fun and creative. I show you how to manage your
photos on your CLIÉ — and how to shoot new ones with the built-in camera.
The fun doesn’t stop with stills, as you find out after you discover how to
convert and watch movies on your CLIÉ. If your CLIÉ’s equipped to play
music, Part III is the place to go to find the full scoop on music players and
how to transfer tunes to a Memory Stick. The real fun begins with a look 
at the best CLIÉ games, and I wrap up on a literary note with eBooks and
audiobooks.
Part IV: An Office in Your Pocket
Part IV is where you discover how you can often leave the laptop at home but
still have full access to your Word documents and Excel spreadsheets — and
even plug in an adapter that lets you do PowerPoint presentations right from
your CLIÉ. You work step by step through the office suite that was probably
bundled with your CLIÉ, and I explore the best third-party office add-ons.

Introduction

Part V: Reaching Outside the CLIÉ Box
Part V shows you how to enhance your CLIÉ and connect it to the outside
world. You find out about the various types of Memory Sticks, why you want
one, and how you can use one to manage your files. You see the various ways
that you can connect to the Internet with a variety of wireless technologies
and then take a look at how to take advantage of your CLIÉ’s online software.
After you expand your CLIÉ and teach it how to talk to the outside world, 
I show you what else you need to make it the only computing device that 
you need when you hit the road.
Part VI: Securing and Protecting Your CLIÉ
Part VI delves into how to protect your CLIÉ’s data from prying eyes — and
from dead batteries and system crashes. After spending a good portion of the
book convincing you that you can pretty much organize your life, manage
your business, and centralize your entertainment on your CLIÉ, I’d be doing
you a disservice if I didn’t show you how to protect this now-vital tool. You
find out about file encryption, data backups, emergency power sources, and
how to protect your CLIÉ from physical damage.
Part VII: The Part of Tens
Part VII focuses on some useful Top Ten lists. You find out about the very
best add-on programs, the best Web sites, and the must-have hardware
accessories. And you find solutions to ten of the most vexing problems a CLIÉ
owner can encounter, and maybe an Easter egg or two to wrap things up.

Sony CLIÉ For Dummies 
Your CLIÉ may vary
With 33 CLIÉs released in less than four years,
these little electronic marvels vary from model
to model. Of those 33 CLIÉs, not a single one has
every feature that I cover in this book. In several
instances, I point out the models that boast
more unique features, but if I did that every time,
this book would be about 100 pages thicker and
that much harder to find a spot for in the bath-
room. For the most part, you can quickly find out
whether a CLIÉ has a feature that’s discussed
here. The easiest way to tell is to look for the
icon for the application you’re reading about in
the Program Launcher. If you don’t see it listed,
your CLIÉ didn’t include that particular option.

Icons in This Book
This book rarely delves into the geeky, technical details, but when it does,
this icon warns you. Read on if you want to get under the hood a little or just
skip ahead if you aren’t interested in the gory details.
Here’s where you can find shortcuts, commands, and other tricks that can
make you a CLIÉ power user in no time. Pay special attention to the para-
graphs with this icon to get the most out of your CLIÉ.
This icon highlights an important point that you don’t want to forget because
it just might come up again. I’d never be so cruel as to spring a pop quiz on
you, but paying attention to these details can definitely help you.
Danger, Will Robinson! Don’t pass over these crucial points; they could save
you from screaming, tears, hair-pulling, or lost data.

Sony CLIÉ For Dummies 

Part I
Getting to Know
Your CLIÉ

In this part . . .
I
n this section, you find out what your CLIÉ is and isn’t.
It’s a personal organizer. It’s a game machine. It’s an
entertainment system. It’s a productivity tool. However, it
is neither a dessert topping nor a floor wax.
This first part also discusses how to communicate with
your CLIÉ by using Graffiti 2, the keyboard, and all the but-
tons and dials festooning the device. You also discover
how to connect and synchronize your CLIÉ’s contents
with your desktop system — because even computers
need friends.

In This Chapter

 Managing your personal information
 Showing your pictures and playing music
 Watching (and recording!) video on the go
 Keeping in touch with work and friends
 Having fun with CLIÉ
I
n the broadest sense, a Sony CLIÉ is a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA).
But categorizing the CLIÉ as just a PDA is like calling J.Lo just a singer.
Sure, these little electronic wonders are useful for the stuff that people have
been doing with PDAs since the early days: organizing schedules, tracking
phone numbers, managing To Do lists, and introducing users to the entertain-
ing game of Find the Misplaced Stylus. But Sony created the CLIÉ to do more
than the typical PDA. The name is actually an acronym for Communication,
Link, Information, Entertainment — and as Sony has added new models to
the mix, the company has occasionally reworded the acronym to include the
words Lifestyle and Emotion. Yes, this device is too versatile for its own
acronym.
The emphasis on entertainment makes the CLIÉ different from the typical
PDA. No other PDA comes so loaded to the gills with built-in features for
viewing digital images, listening to music, playing games, and various other
fun stuff. So unless your idea of fun is rescheduling conflicting meetings, the
CLIÉ is a natural choice. Sure, you can watch videos or take pictures with a
Palm or a Pocket PC, but doing so often involves gathering, installing, and
configuring a ton of add-on programs and accessories. Thanks, but I’d rather
spend the time actually having fun or even being — gasp — productive.

Today’s CLIÉs wrap the functions of numerous devices into one pocket-sized
unit. The CLIÉ can do many things that a desktop computer can do, such as
surf the Web, play games, or edit word processing and spreadsheet files.
Many models of these versatile handhelds can also take the place of MP3
music players, voice recorders, digital cameras, and camcorders. You can do
dozens of things with the PDA the moment you take it out of the box (well,
after you charge the battery), but that’s just the beginning. With dozens of
add-ons available and literally thousands of third-party programs only a
download away, the CLIÉ can do things even its designers never dreamed of.
Most of this book focuses on what you can do with your CLIÉ the moment
you take it out of the box — which is a lot. Besides, my choices were either
focus on the built-in stuff or write Sony CLIÉ For Dummies: The 10 Volume Set,
which would have been much harder to cram into your briefcase.
What Your CLIÉ Can Do for You
Over the next few pages, I take a look at some of the more useful — or just
plain cool — tasks and tricks that you can do with your CLIÉ. I cover each of
these in more depth later in the book, so when you find something that
intrigues you, feel free to skip ahead. But before you do, here are a few basics
to keep in mind as you read this book:
 Cost: Not all CLIÉs are created equal; just look at the differences in
the models pictured in Figure 1-1. Over the course of writing this book,
12 models were available, ranging in price from $149 to $799. High-end
models have a wide variety of enhancements, such as built-in digital
cameras or wireless features, that may not be available in midrange or
entry-level CLIÉs.
 Standard features: Despite the differences in built-in features, all CLIÉ
models offer a beefy set of standard capabilities: high-resolution color
screens, enhanced contact-management software, a rich set of bundled
applications, and the ability to run all Palm OS programs. So fear not —
the majority of this book does apply no matter which model you own.
 Enhanced features: On the occasions when I do write about features
that are unique to only a few CLIÉ models, I mention the model numbers
in the discussion. However, given that Sony typically releases an average
of one new CLIÉ model every month, not seeing your model mentioned
doesn’t mean that it lacks those features. When in doubt, be sure to
check the specifications of your specific model to see if it has the feature
in question.
 Tweaks: Sony often makes minor tweaks to the programs that come with
every CLIÉ when it releases new models, so screen configurations or
menu items may differ slightly on your CLIÉ from what you see here.

Chapter 1: It’s CLIÉ but Not Cliché
When a CLIÉ is a Palm
All Sony CLIÉ models run the Palm Operating
System, typically called Palm OS. Palm OS 5 is
the latest version of the software originally
designed for the very first mainstream PDA, the
Palm Pilot. This is great news for CLIÉ owners
because the Palm OS is the most popular oper-
ating system for handheld computers, and over
20,000 programs are available for it.
In general, you want to look for Palm OS 
programs rather than for CLIÉ software.
Although many of the Palm OS programs 
have enhancements to take advantage of the
CLIÉ’s special features, they also work on other
Palm OS PDAs, such as the Palm Zire and the
Handspring Treo.
The CLIÉ doesn’t run programs written for the
Microsoft Pocket PC operating system. But
that’s no reason for concern. Pocket PCs have
far fewer programs available than Palm OS
devices. The CLIÉ gives you access to the
widest selection of handheld software avail-
able. And just as important, the CLIÉ (like all
Palm OS devices and Pocket PCs) can con-
nect to desktop computers running Microsoft
Windows and synchronize data such as
appointments and address books.
Note that the CLIÉ does have one thing in
common with the Pocket PC: Neither device
comes equipped with support for connecting to
a Macintosh. Third-party programs can make
your CLIÉ and Mac get along swimmingly, how-
ever. I cover those in Chapter 3.

Now, don’t get jealous because your CLIÉ PEG-ZXR8000 didn’t include the
holographic projector and tailfins found on the PEG-ZXR9000XT. Even a sup-
posedly average CLIÉ still blows the socks off a more corporate PDA when it
comes to fun per ounce.
Manage Your Personal Information
Although I brag about the CLIÉ’s special abilities with the enthusiasm of a
new parent pointing out how his baby isn’t all scrunched like the others in
the nursery, the device isn’t all about the bells and whistles. At the core of
Sony’s little multimedia marvel is a top-notch personal information manager
that can keep track of all your contacts, appointments, To Do items, and
notes. (See Figure 1-2.) So add that paper day timer to the list of items that
you can toss in the closet.
If you’re already keeping all your contact and schedule information on your
desktop system, fear not — you don’t have to reenter your entire database
with a stylus or tiny keyboard. A key feature of the CLIÉ (as with almost all
PDAs) is the ability to share data with a desktop computer. In this case, the
process is called HotSyncing.
Your CLIÉ and your desktop system always contain the same personal orga-
nizer data after a sync. So as long as you remember to HotSync regularly, you
always have your latest appointment and contact information in your pocket.
You can use the desktop system’s keyboard to enter new information when
you’re at your desk — which beats a stylus or thumb keyboard any day.
When you add a new contact on the road, HotSyncing copies that information
to your desktop computer.
My favorite feature is the ability to HotSync with more than one computer. If
you purchase an extra cradle, you can HotSync your CLIÉ at home and at
work. Doing so ensures that you have identical personal organizer informa-
tion at home, at work, and on the road. With up-to-date schedules and
appointment alarms, you’ll never have an excuse to miss an appointment
again — which is usually a good thing. I give you the full scoop on HotSyncing
in Chapter 3.

Part I: Getting to Know Your CLIÉ 

Show Off Your Pictures and Play Video
With its high-resolution screen, the CLIÉ is a natural for showing off pictures.
Slideshows created using Sony’s PhotoStand software are a heck of a lot more
impressive than showing someone old-fashioned pictures stored in a yellow-
ing plastic wallet holder.
And just try carrying a movie in your wallet! Your CLIÉ can play full-screen
videos, as shown in Figure 1-3. Carry short videos of the kids along or enter-
tain yourself on your next flight with episodes of The Simpsons taped with
Sony’s Memory Stick video recorder.
Plus, many CLIÉ models boast built-in cameras, so you can add to your photo
album — or even shoot short videos — while you’re on the road.

Chapter 1: It’s CLIÉ but Not Cliché

When you’re talking to someone who’s more interested in business than baby
pictures, you can use your handheld to present a very small PowerPoint
slideshow. Or, as you see in Chapter 13, with a simple add-on you can even
connect your CLIÉ to a projector and show your PowerPoint slides (or vaca-
tion pictures) on the big screen.
Rock Out or Listen to a Good Book
Most CLIÉ models are equipped with a headphone jack and support for play-
ing MP3 music. You can rip (digital music lingo for convert) songs from your
CD collection into MP3 files or download them from the Internet. MP3 files
take up much less space than the original songs on CDs, allowing you to fit
about two hours of music on a typical 128MB Memory Stick. Figure 1-4 shows
the Audio Player application built into many CLIÉs.
Of course, shrinking the files does reduce quality somewhat, but it’s a small
price to pay for portability — and only serious audiophiles are likely to
notice the difference. The CLIÉ has built-in support for MP3 and ATRAC3
songs; the latter is a propriety Sony format that’s better ignored. The only
downside to the CLIÉ’s music capabilities is that it doesn’t support legally
downloaded music from sites like the Apple iTunes store (www.apple.com/
itunes)and Napster 2.0 (www.napster.com). Fear not, though — in 
Chapter 10, I show you how to get around this limitation and give you the 
full scoop on CLIÉ music support.
Figure 1-3:
Sure, you
can carry
pictures in

but the

14
Part I: Getting to Know Your CLIÉ 

Some CLIÉ models also support audiobooks from Audible (audible.com).
You can choose from a huge selection of audiobook adaptations of best-
sellers, as well as a wide variety of radio shows, all at a fraction of the price
you’d pay for an audiobook on CD or cassette. Using a cassette or FM adapter
with the CLIÉ’s headphone jack, you can even listen to books while you drive.
Keep in Touch with Work and Friends
The first letter in CLIÉ stands for Communication, so it’s no surprise that the
device makes a great companion for people who want to stay in touch with
friends or the office when they’re on the go. You can read and respond to
e-mail while sitting in a waiting room or check the local movie times while
you’re out eating dinner.
Best of all, you can do all this even if your CLIÉ doesn’t have built-in wireless
networking. Sony’s CLIÉ Mail application lets you download your e-mail mes-
sages when you HotSync to your desktop system. On the next sync, you can
upload any responses that you’ve written. And using applications like
AvantGo and HandStory Suite, you can even download your favorite Web
pages and read them offline with no live connection to the Internet.

Chapter 1: It’s CLIÉ but Not Cliché

Many CLIÉ models have built-in support for wireless Internet connections, 
or you can easily gain wireless access by adding a wireless card or by con-
necting the PDA to a cell phone. Wireless access means that you can check
your e-mail, look something up on the Web, or see how your eBay auction is
progressing — all using a pocket-sized device! And this stuff is about ten-
times easier to do with a CLIÉ than with so-called smartphones. Figure 1-5
shows CLIÉ’s wireless access at work.
Play Games, Read eBooks, and More!
This chapter just skims the surface of the thousands of uses people have put
their CLIÉs to. Among other popular CLIÉ pastimes are
 Gaming: With its bright, high-resolution color screen, excellent audio
support, and even an optional add-on game controller available for some
models, the CLIÉ is an excellent time-killer. Games range from adapta-
tions of classic arcade titles to detailed role-playing games to fast-paced,
real-time strategy titles like Warfare Incorporated, as shown in Figure 1-6.

Part I: Getting to Know Your CLIÉ 

 Reading eBooks: The CLIÉ is a surprisingly good companion for book-
worms. Thousands of titles (best-sellers, science fiction books, periodi-
cals, and much more) are available in downloadable eBook format from
sites like Palm Digital Media (www.palmdigitalmedia.com) and
Fictionwise (www.fictionwise.com). And you can even download
public-domain classics, such as works by Mark Twain and H.G. Wells,
free of charge. The CLIÉ’s crisp, backlit liquid crystal display (LCD)
screen is as easy to read in a variety of conditions. Plus, because you
always have the device with you, you can sneak in a few pages while
waiting in a line or otherwise killing time.
 Traveling: With companion applications like Vindigo (you can find a
demo version on your CLIÉ Installation CD), you can locate the best
restaurants, night spots, bookstores, and other vital locations when
traveling to major cities. And with the aid of a plug-in Global Positioning
System (GPS) module, you’ll never get lost again.
 And much, much more: Track your diet and exercise, keep your budget
in check, control your home entertainment system, or even replace your
bulky laptop computer.
As you’re starting to see, the sky’s the limit for CLIÉ users. So sit back, strap
in, and get ready for takeoff!

W
orking with your CLIÉ is a lot like working with a desktop computer.
Well, except for the lack of a keyboard. And a mouse. And disk drives.
And a power plug. Well, okay, it’s not exactly like working with a desktop com-
puter. But any PC or Mac users will be instantly comfortable with the CLIÉ’s
icons, drop-down menus, on-screen buttons, and other interface components.
Although it runs the Palm OS, the interface on your CLIÉ might seem some-
what unfamiliar if you’re upgrading from a Palm or Handspring device — or
even an older CLIÉ. The standard Palm OS main screen of today — called the
Program Launcher or just plain Launcher — differs little from the original
Palm Pilots released in 1996. Sony, on the other hand, continually innovates
and experiments with its interface design. Three variations on the Program
Launcher are in use on the current models. Fear not, however — they all offer
point-and-click simplicity. Most CLIÉ functions require just a couple taps of
the stylus or a single press of a button.
In this chapter, I cover working with the CLIÉ from top to bottom: from
switches and slots to writing with the stylus to keeping it in sync with your
desktop computer.
Before you even turn on your trusty CLIÉ, though, I want you to familiarize
yourself with the lay of the land. (Don’t worry; you have me as your guide,
your scout, your cicerone, your docent, your . . . you get the idea.)

Pushing the Right Buttons
Before you launch the stylus from its silo, go ahead and take a look at the
CLIÉ’s buttons, which give you one-touch access to your favorite applications.
The exact layout of these buttons differs among various CLIÉ models. No
other Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) manufacturer comes close to the vari-
ety of device configurations that Sony offers. CLIÉs come in standard PDA
forms: twist-and-flip models, mini-notebook styles, and with or without built-
in mini-keyboards. They typically include the same basic buttons and
switches but with minor variations in placement. The UX series mini-laptop-
style models diverge more dramatically from the Palm standard, but these
differences are mostly of concern to game players who might not find the
right buttons available for zapping evil aliens. If variety is the spice of life, the
Sony CLIÉ line is like a pile of electronic habeñero hot peppers.
The primary controls on all CLIÉ models are the application hard buttons.
Despite the name, they’re amazingly easy to use — hard refers to the fact that
they’re actual, physical buttons that you press with your fingers, rather than
the buttons on the screen or in the silk-screened writing area that are designed
to be activated with the stylus. The hard buttons give you one-touch access to
the organizer application so that you can very quickly, say, look up an address.
They even turn on the CLIÉ when you press them. Some CLIÉ models with fold-
ing screens actually feature two sets of application hard buttons, as shown in
Figure 2-1.
If a hard button is set to launch an application that you don’t use very often —
say, Memo Pad — you can redefine it to launch your favorite program. Just
launch the Prefs application (I’m getting ahead of myself here, but you can
find out all about launching applications in the later section “Icon Do It!”) and
choose Buttons from the drop-down menu at the top-right corner of the
screen. Now, tap the pop-up menu next to any of the button icons on the
screen and select an application from the list that appears. Choose wisely,
though, grasshopper. You don’t want to set a button to launch your favorite
game and then have your CLIÉ erupt with the Pac-Man theme during the
middle of a business meeting.
Between the application hard buttons on most models, you find the Up and
Down buttons, which you can use to scroll through lists of data.
20
Part I: Getting to Know Your CLIÉ 

On most CLIÉ models, you also find a slider labeled Hold. On older models,
it’s an individual slider; on newer units, it’s integrated with the power button.
Moving this slider up toward the top of the unit puts the device in the Hold
mode. (Which, ironically, is designed for when you’re not holding the CLIÉ. 
Go figure!) When in Hold mode, the CLIÉ doesn’t turn on if you press one of
the application hard buttons — in fact, on units with a separate power
switch, even the power switch doesn’t turn it on when Hold is engaged!
The Hold slider serves two purposes. First, it keeps your CLIÉ from acciden-
tally getting turned on when it’s being carried in your pocket or briefcase.
Also, if your CLIÉ is equipped with an MP3 music player, you can start a tune
playing and then move the Hold slider to disable both the application but-
tons and the screen. The display turns off, but your tunes keep playing, dra-
matically increasing your battery life. And if your CLIÉ includes a wired
headphone extension that features music playback controls, you can con-
tinue to use that to control playback even in Hold mode.

Chapter 2: Communicating with Your CLIÉ

If your CLIÉ has a separate power switch, and you can’t get it to turn on,
check the Hold slider before you panic.
The CLIÉ pioneered the concept of including a jog dial on the side of a PDA to
allow one-handed scrolling and selection. Just turn the jog dial to scroll
through lists or page up and down through a document, and press it to select
an item.
Apparently, jog dials aren’t sedentary creatures. In some models, such as the
PEG-TG50 and PEG-NX80V, the jog dial rests in its traditional side-mounted,
thumb-controlled spot, but it started wandering on the UX series, where it
dropped below the keyboard. Now the jog dial sits below the screen on some
models and is even found on the back of the PEG-TH55. And it’s apparently
talked other buttons into adopting its nomad ways. The newest CLIÉs (see
Figure 2-2) feature the jog dial surrounded by the former Up and Down but-
tons, which are now Left and Right. (Though Left is actually Up, and Right is
Down. Makes perfect sense, down? Er, I mean, right?) Many CLIÉs also feature
a Back button next to the jog dial, which lets you back up after making a
selection. A few models, however, omit this useful switch.

Part I: Getting to Know Your CLIÉ 

Rounding out the hard-button brigade are the Capture and Voice Rec buttons.
Now that every new CLIÉ includes a built-in camera, you find the Capture
hard button on every current unit. Pressing it once loads the CLIÉ Camera
application if it’s not already running; if it is, pressing the button takes a
photo. The Voice Rec hard button works in a similar manner: Press it once to
launch the Voice Recorder program and begin recording.
Silky Soft Buttons
Along with the physical buttons, CLIÉs also have a series of soft buttons that
are designed to be pressed with the stylus, rather than your fingers. These
soft buttons are sometimes referred to in program documentation as silk-
screen buttons because they were preprinted next to the writing area below
the screen. That’s still the case on some CLIÉ models, such as the TJ series,
but on high-end units with larger screens, these buttons are now displayed
right on the screen. This virtual writing area gives you the benefit of being
able to make the buttons go away when you’re not using them and thus use
that area to see more data. Despite the fact that the icons are merely graph-
ics on these models, Sony still calls this the silk-screen area.
You can find four soft buttons on all CLIÉ models, either silk-screened or
drawn on the liquid crystal display (LCD) screen. In Figure 2-3, clockwise
from the top-right corner, they are:

 Calculator: As you may guess, this button launches the Calculator 
application — either the built-in simple calculator or the souped-up
powerOne Personal calculator that’s included on your CLIÉ’s install CD. 
I cover the calculator in Chapter 12, along with a bunch of other useful
business tools.
 Find: Tapping this button pops open a window so that you can search
for data such as names, addresses, and phone numbers. Just enter the
information that you’re looking for (capitalization doesn’t matter), and
the Find application searches for it first within the program that you’re
running, then in the built-in applications, and finally in third-party pro-
grams. This simple feature is amazingly useful for finding important
information quickly. Check out Chapter 3 for some searching tips.
 Menu: Tapping this button activates any drop-down menus available in
the program that you’re currently running. These work just like the
menus that you’re probably familiar with on your desktop computer, and
you can use them to access program settings and make adjustments.
Note that some programs also have tap-down menus, typically on the
right side of the screen. These have a small, black, downward-pointing
arrow next to them and are activated by tapping the arrow, rather than
by using the Menu icon.
The Menu button is a toggle. If you inadvertently tapped it and didn’t
really intend to choose a menu option, just tap it again, and it goes away.
 Home: The button with the picture of the house takes you to the CLIÉ’s
Program Launcher application, which is the home from which you set
out on all your CLIÉ explorations. Whatever program you happen to be
using, just tap the Home button to return the Program Launcher.
If you’re already looking at the Program Launcher screen, tapping the
Home button switches between program categories — more on those in
the sidebar “I’ll take the games category, Alex,” later in this chapter.
One other tiny button lurks next to the Menu button. It’s a small circle that
looks like a sunburst. Fear not — this button doesn’t cause your CLIÉ to
engage a fusion reaction and transform into a small, handheld star. Rather,
tapping this causes a slider to appear that lets you adjust your screen’s
brightness level.
Sliding the control to the left turns the screen brightness down. Turning the
brightness down to the lowest comfortable level can greatly increase your
battery life. See Figure 2-4 and then head to Chapter 20 if you want more
details.

Belly Up to the Status Bar
An additional set of icons on the Status Bar appears at the bottom of the
screen on large-screen Hi-Res+ (high-resolution) models such as the PEG-
NX73V and PEG-TH55. These models lack a preprinted silk-screen text entry
area, but instead use screen graphics to represent a virtual writing area. 
(If you have a square-screen CLIÉ, you can skip to the next section.) In 
Figure 2-5, from left to right, the icons are:
 Home, Menu, and Find: These three icons duplicate the functionality of
their larger soft-button counterparts. They’re useful when you’re run-
ning an application with the full screen and the Graffiti writing area isn’t
visible.
 Silk Plug-In: You can use this icon to select a replacement for the stan-
dard Graffiti writing area. A plug-in for Decuma, an alternative handwrit-
ing recognition application, is included with the newest CLIÉ models.

Chapter 2: Communicating with Your CLIÉ

Numerous third-party plug-ins are also available. You can even down-
load applications that let you put pictures of your favorite people in the
Graffiti writing area. Or for stress relief, upload pictures of your least
favorite people and pretend that you’re stabbing at them with the blunt
end of your stylus as you write.
 Battery Status: This little meter visibly drains as your battery starts to
run down, giving you a visual warning when it’s getting to be time to
recharge. On newer CLIÉs, tapping the icon brings up a more detailed
display (shown in Figure 2-6), which shows the exact battery percentage
remaining, as well as whether the battery is recharging or draining.
 Memory Stick Status: This icon glows blue if you have a Memory Stick
inserted, a particularly useful feature on models like the PEG-TH55 that
have an enclosed Memory Stick slot. If you see a slash through the icon,
no Memory Stick is installed. If a small key appears above the icon, the
Memory Stick is write-protected — that is, the little write-protect tab on
the card has been moved so you can read from the Stick, but not delete
or alter its contents.

 Wi-Fi Status: This icon glows blue if you have a Wi-Fi Internet connection
active or gray if you’re offline. It’s made up of three boxes, and the more
boxes you see in blue, the stronger your Wi-Fi signal. Tapping the icon
when you’re online brings up a status window showing which access
point you’re connected to and how strong the signal is.
 Volume Control: Tap this icon to bring up the CLIÉ’s volume controls.
 Resize: This is why you bought a big-screen CLIÉ! Tapping the rightmost
icon causes the Graffiti writing area to slide off the bottom of the screen,
giving you 50 percent more vertical screen real estate. If you’re using a
CLIÉ model with a built-in keyboard, such as the PEG-UX50, you can
actually leave the writing area hidden all the time, of course. On models
like the PEG-TH55, just tap the Resize icon when you need to enter text
to bring up the writing area, and tap it again when you’re finished. 
(See Figure 2-7.)

Chapter 2: Communicating with Your CLIÉ
Odd CLIÉ out: The PEG-TG50
Sony’s PEG-TG50 is like that kid in your class
who always did things differently, yet still man-
aged to do a great job. This is the only keyboard-
equipped CLIÉ without a Hi-Res+ screen and a
virtual Graffiti area. The PEG-TG50 also includes
a pair of dual-function buttons that you can’t
find on any other CLIÉ model.
As you see in the following figure, to the left of
the Date Book button is the Home/Menu button.
Press it quickly to bring up the CLIÉ Program
Launcher, or hold it down to activate the CLIÉ’s
drop-down menus. To the right of the Memo Pad
icon is the Graffiti/Find button. Give it a quick
press when the CLIÉ is waiting for text input,
and a full-screen Graffiti writing area appears.
(You probably bought the PEG-TG50 because of
its keyboard, but it’s good to know that Graffiti is
available if you need it.) Hold the button down,
and the Find window opens.
Note that the PEG-
TG50 was in the
process of being
phased out as this
book was being
completed. But you
may still find them
in stores, or you
may have snatched
up one of these
versatile devices
before they were
gone. And given
that Sony releases
new CLIÉ models
so frequently that
it could offer a CLIÉ
of the Month Club, I wouldn’t be surprised to see
a similar configuration appear before long.

Stylus 101
Your CLIÉ’s stylus does double duty as a replacement for both a keyboard
and a mouse. You can use it to write characters on the screen — just like
using a pen, but without the ink. You can also use it like a mouse to select
menus, icons, and other items on a screen. Unlike a mouse, though, no
double-clicking is involved — just tap the item to select it. Be gentle; the CLIÉ
needs only a light stylus tap. In fact, it recognizes your input better when you
don’t press down too hard.
One unique stylus entry method is the stroke. Strokes are quick stylus motions
typically used as shortcuts for more involved procedures. For instance, a
stroke from the lower-left to the upper-right corner of the Graffiti writing area
brings up a shortcut bar on the bottom of the screen that offers options such
as Copy and Paste.
The styluses that come with many CLIÉs aren’t the most comfortable input
tools around, particularly for those of us with hands so big that André the
Giant would look at them and go “Whoa!” Not to mention that the collapsi-
ble styluses included with some CLIÉs tend to, well, collapse when you’re
trying to write. I’ve found that my own stylus precision goes up dramatically

Chapter 2: Communicating with Your CLIÉ
Command strokes
Though unrelated to the popular band The
Strokes, Command strokes are likely to rock
your program usage. The Command stroke is
basically a forward slash drawn in the writing
area; its graphical representation can be seen
at the left of the following figure. (This figure
shows what pops up on the bottom of the screen
when you enter the stroke.) The Command
strokes give you quick access to the Cut, Copy,
and Paste commands (the icons on the right
side of the figure). Just make the Command
stroke and then tap the respective icon to cut,
copy, or paste data.
The Command stroke can also give quick
access to menus without pulling them down.
Shortcuts for various menu functions are listed
on the right side of each drop-down menu. In
the menu in the following figure, for instance,
stroke-N — where you make the handy
Command stroke and then write out N with the
stylus or the keyboard — to create a new
schedule event.
Like a demanding boss, the Command stroke
lacks patience and wants information from you
now. You have only a few seconds to tap an icon
or enter a letter after making the stroke gesture.
Otherwise, the Command window goes away,
and you need to enter the stroke again.
when using a larger stylus, such as the Cross Matrix shown in Figure 2-8. You
can often find full-size pen/stylus/pencil combos at your local office supply
store. If you don’t find one there that fits your needs, check out www.stylus
central.com. You can find more styluses there than you can shake, well, a
stylus at.
When using a combo pen/stylus, be sure that it’s in Stylus mode before you
write on the screen. The pen tip can leave a nasty gash on your screen. And
even though you can use a fingernail to make a quick selection on the screen,
for the most part you should stick with a real stylus to avoid screen damage.

Charge and Go
The first half of this chapter covers the basics, but now I help you make sure
that your CLIÉ is ready to rock and roll. After you unpack your brand-new
CLIÉ, the first thing to do is plug it in to fully charge it. It very likely arrived
with a dead (or at least nearly comatose) battery. Charging it takes three to
four hours — a long time to wait before playing with a new toy. In the future,
you’ll usually just “top off the tank” on a partially charged CLIÉ, so typical
recharges go much quicker.
Install the CD that comes with your CLIÉ on your desktop computer before
you connect the HotSync cradle or cable that ships with your CLIÉ to your
computer. (You can find more on installing software from the CD and on the
whole HotSync process in Chapter 3.) Charge your CLIÉ and go through the
initial setup first (more on that in just a few lines), and then you can insert
the software CD and connect the cradle/cable when prompted to do so
during the installation process. But first, here’s how you set up the CLIÉ
itself.

Part I: Getting to Know Your CLIÉ 

The first time you turn on your CLIÉ, you’re greeted by the Setup screen,
which takes you through a simple four-step process that lets you calibrate
the screen digitizer — more on that later — and set the local time.
Tap the screen once to start the setup process. The CLIÉ then prompts you to
tap the center of a series of targets to calibrate the digitizer, as shown in
Figure 2-9. Do what to the what, you ask? The digitizer is the part of the glass
covering the screen that detects where you’re tapping with the stylus. Be
extremely precise as you tap each target; if you’re more than a little off, the
CLIÉ may later have trouble figuring out what you’re trying to tap. Don’t
worry, though. Your CLIÉ is as smart as it is snappy, and it figures out if
you’re too far off the mark and takes you through the process again.
If you later discover that your taps seem to be going a little off the mark — if
you have to hit slightly above or below an icon for the tap to register — you
can take another run through the calibration process. You do this by launch-
ing the CLIÉ’s Preferences application and choosing Digitizer from the drop-
down menu in the top-right corner of the screen. This re-launches the
calibration process that you just completed.
The next stage of the setup procedure, shown in Figure 2-10, prompts you to
set your country, time zone, and the current time and date. To set the coun-
try, just tap the drop-down menu arrow next to the word Region; do the same
with the arrow next to Daylight Saving to tell your CLIÉ whether your region
acknowledges Daylight Saving Time.
Figure 2-9:
Calibrating

31
Chapter 2: Communicating with Your CLIÉ

The default time zone is USA (Pacific). If that’s not where you live, tap the text
box next to the words Time Zone and select the correct zone. Tap the text box
next to Set Date to — you guessed it — set the date. A small calendar pops up.
Select the current year first, then the month, and finally the day. Finally, tap
the text box next to Set Time. Use the up and down arrows to set each digit,
and then select AM or PM.
Congratulations! Your CLIÉ is ready for use. The last step is to tap Done and
dive in. Yes, you could tap Next, but if you do that, all it does is tell you to
consult the documentation to find out how to use the Graffiti 2 or your com-
puter keyboard to enter data. Real helpful, that!
Icon Do It!
Now that your CLIÉ is up and running, the launch programs can make them-
selves useful. The application hard buttons — the ones I discuss in the
“Pushing the Right Buttons” section, earlier in the chapter — give instant
access to the built-in organizer applications. (Or in the case of the PEG-UX50,
the Web and e-mail programs.) For everything else, you use the Program
Launcher.
The CLIÉ’s Program Launcher comes in more varieties than gelatin flavors at
a southern barbecue. The most popular launcher is the aptly named CLIÉ
Launcher (Figure 2-11, left), which is used on most CLIÉ models. The UX
series CLIÉs offer the somewhat gimmicky CLIÉ 3D Launcher (Figure 2-11,
center), and the new PEG-TH55 integrates launcher functionality with its new
CLIÉ Organizer program (Figure 2-11, right).
Figure 2-10:

Part I: Getting to Know Your CLIÉ 

If you prefer the typical Palm OS Launcher (Figure 2-12), you can easily switch
to it. Just tap the Menu icon to the left of the text entry area, and then choose
Options➪Go to Standard View.
Whichever launcher you’re using, starting programs on the CLIÉ is as easy as
tapping the appropriate icon with the stylus, which is the equivalent of
double-clicking an icon on your desktop computer. (Just tap once, though.)
You can also use the jog dial to scroll through the available programs, and
then press it to select and launch an application — this method is great if
you’re using your CLIÉ one-handed.
To find a program quickly in the launcher, enter the first letter of its name
with the stylus or keyboard. The launcher jumps to the first program whose
name starts with that letter.

The CLIÉ Program Launcher also lets you place your most-used icons in a
Favorite Applications area, where they’re always just a tap away. The Favorite
Applications area has 12 slots. Tap the Menu icon and choose Edit Favorite
Applications. When the screen shown in Figure 2-13 appears, simply tap any
of the numbered slots, and a menu listing all your installed programs
appears. Tap the name of the program that you want to put in that slot.
34
Part I: Getting to Know Your CLIÉ 
I’ll take the games category, Alex
After you install a few third-party programs on
your CLIÉ, your list of icons can start to get
pretty darn crowded, making it harder to find
and launch programs quickly. Like many CLIÉ
programs, the launcher supports program cate-
gories, which make it easy to better organize
your applications. You could put your most-used
programs in the Main category, your Internet
programs in the Web category, your games in
Games, and so on. The CLIÉ ships with a number
of predefined categories, and you can even
create your own.
Sony calls categories Launcher Groups in its
custom launcher. To categorize your programs
in the CLIÉ Program Launcher, tap the Menu
icon, and choose Edit CLIÉ Launcher Group from
the first menu. (On UX series, the menu item is
simply Edit Group.) In the window that appears
(see the following figure ), use the Up and Down
buttons to rearrange group order, the Delete
icon to remove a group, the Edit icon to change
an existing group, or the New icon to create a
new category. Tap Done when you’re finished.
In the standard Palm OS Launcher, tap the drop-
down menu arrow at the top-right corner of the
screen, as shown in the following figure, to pop
up the list of existing categories. Tap a category
to choose it, or tap Edit Categories to create or
edit existing categorizations.
To quickly switch between groups or cate-
gories, tap the Home icon.

Text Entry on Your CLIÉ
The CLIÉ is more accommodating than your average concierge at a $600-per-
night hotel. Do you want to enter your text with a stylus by using tried-and-
true PDA methods, one character at a time? Check. Do you want to try using
your stylus to enter entire words at once? Roger. Tap an on-screen keyboard?
Gotcha covered. Use your thumbs to type? Sure. Sony has CLIÉ models with
mini-keyboards. Use the nice, big keyboard on your desktop system to enter
handheld data? Yup. Beam data over Star Trek style with infrared light beams?
You bet! Interact with your CLIÉ by using nothing but voice recognition? Well,
if you’re reading a tattered copy of this book in 2007, perhaps, but otherwise,
you have to wait on that one. I show you the methods that work without the
use of time travel.
Graffiti 2
The classic tried-and-true method for entering text on a CLIÉ, Graffiti 2 is the
latest offspring of the Graffiti writing scheme pioneered on the original Palm
Pilot. (The original Graffiti, ironically, was replaced by Graffiti 2 after Xerox
accused Palm of copying the technology. Note to Alanis Morissette: Xerox
getting mad about copying is ironic. Rain on your wedding day is not.)
If your interest in PDAs goes as far back as the ancient Apple Newton, you
probably remember that its much-derided handwriting recognition was so
quirky that even the Doonesbury comic strip took time out to make fun of it.
So rather than try to adapt PDAs to human writing, the creators of the Palm
OS decided it might be easier to ask humans to adapt their writing slightly for
the PDAs. After all, humans are a fairly flexible species.

Chapter 2: Communicating with Your CLIÉ

Thus was born Graffiti, a writing method that achieves admirable accuracy
by recognizing printed letters one letter at a time. The writing area at the
bottom of the screen is divided in half. The left side is used to write letters,
and the right side to write numbers. The vast majority of letters and numbers
are written just as you’d print them on paper, with just a few minor adjust-
ments here and there.
Experienced PDA users take note: Graffiti 2 differs from the original Graffiti in
a few minor but significant ways. If you’ve used Graffiti 1, take note of the dif-
ferences, or you may find the letter t so frustrating to write that you’ll just
start trying to find words that don’t use it. Considering I used it 23 times in
the previous sentence, that’s not easy. (Figure 2-14 shows the Graffiti 2 way to
write the letter t.)
Graffiti 2 is actually very similar to the original. The main difference is that
the use of two separate stylus strokes is required to make a few of the charac-
ters, such as t and k. This actually makes writing the characters more like
writing on paper. However, it takes some getting used to if you’re experienced
in the original Graffiti.
What if you just can’t get used to Graffiti 2? Install TealScript from TealPoint
Software, and you can not only fine-tune your CLIÉ to recognize your own
writing style, but also use classic original Graffiti strokes! (Check out the
TealPoint Software Web site at www.tealpoint.com.)
Graffiti 2 has one new feature that makes the writing process much simpler:
easy capital letters. If you want to write a lower-case letter, write it in the text
area on the left. If you want to write a capital letter, center the letter on the
line dividing the text and numeric writing areas. Note that you actually draw
the letter the same way (see Figure 2-15) whether you’re creating an upper-
or lower-case letter. Where you draw it is the key.
Figure 2-14:

2 characters
can be

as t, require

36
Part I: Getting to Know Your CLIÉ 

Go ahead and get your hands dirty — practice entering a few characters.
1. Press the Date Book hard button.
This turns on your CLIÉ and launches the Date Book application so that
you have somewhere to write.
2. Tap just above one of the lines next to a time.
This creates a new entry.
3. Write your message in the text entry area by using Graffiti 2 strokes.
That’s all there is to it!
“Wait!” you say. “I don’t know all the Graffiti 2 strokes!” Well, your CLIÉ box
should have included a convenient, wallet-sized Graffiti 2 reference card.
However, you can look up characters even more easily. Just take your stylus
and do a quick stroke from the bottom center of the screen to the top center.
This brings up an on-screen pop-up Graffiti 2 reference card. Tap the up and
down arrows on the screen or press the Up and Down hard buttons to scroll
through six pages of useful reference info that show you how to create let-
ters, numbers, and symbols, as well as how to execute quick shortcut com-
mands such as Cut and Paste. With the aid of this reference, you’ll be
scribbling words in no time.
Of course, words are a heck of a lot more readable when they’re surrounded
by spaces. Punctuation helps, too. To make a space, simply draw a dash cen-
tered across the letter or number input area. The opposite stroke (a back-
ward, right-to-left dash) acts as a backspace. A period requires just a tap on
the screen, and a comma is drawn like an L that’s fallen on its back. See
Figure 2-16 for more examples of how to create basic punctuation.
Figure 2-15:
The same
alphabet is
used for
both upper-
and lower-
case.
37
Chapter 2: Communicating with Your CLIÉ

Some punctuation marks and symbols require a punctuation shift — a line
drawn from the bottom of the input area to the top — before you write them.
This is typically because they’re similar to other strokes. The beginning
parenthesis, for instance, uses a stroke that’s almost identical to writing a C.
The pop-up Graffiti 2 reference lists an intimidating three pages of punctuation-
shift strokes, but most of these are rarely needed for day-to-day use. Figure 2-17
shows you the ones you may actually end up using.
If Graffiti 2 doesn’t seem to have a very good grasp of what you’re trying to
tell it, don’t give up. One very easy trick can improve the accuracy of Graffiti
2’s character recognition dramatically: Just write big. Try to come as close as
possible to filling the available space in the character entry box, and you may
find that your Graffiti 2 entry accuracy is much, much better.

Part I: Getting to Know Your CLIÉ 

Decuma
If the idea of sitting down and rediscovering how to write the alphabet is as
appealing to you as being told that you need to repeat kindergarten, fear not.
Most CLIÉ models (except for entry-level units such as the PEG-TJ27) now
include an alternative input system called Decuma. Decuma is designed to let
you write entire words and correct them by using traditional writing strokes,
such as writing over an incorrect character or crossing out a word that you
want to delete.
To be honest, Decuma is so far only a little more popular with CLIÉ users
than sidewalk snow-cone stands during a Vermont winter. But that’s more
reflective on its newness than its quality. It’s a relatively recent addition to
the CLIÉ line, so it may build an audience as time passes. And hey, if it’s
included with your CLIÉ, why not try it?
On the newest CLIÉ models, Decuma is built right into the device, so no
installation is necessary. If your CLIÉ includes Decuma, but you don’t see a
Decuma icon in the Program Launcher, you need to install it by using the CD
that came with your CLIÉ.
To activate Decuma on CLIÉs with a silk-screen writing area, tap the Decuma
icon in the Program Launcher, and then choose Settings from the tap-down
menu at the top-right corner of the screen. Finally, select the Enable Decuma
Latin as Default Input Method check box. On these CLIÉs, the Decuma entry
area obscures part of the screen as you write.
On Hi-Res+ CLIÉ units with virtual writing areas, just tap the Silk Plug-In 
icon on the Status Bar, and then select Decuma Latin Input, as shown in
Figure 2-18. The Decuma input area replaces the usual Graffiti 2 writing area.
If you decide to go back to Graffiti 2 later, just repeat the process and choose
Standard Input.
Where Graffiti 2 has you print a character at a time, with Decuma you can
enter entire words. However, Decuma still requires you to print, rather than
handwrite. You use normal upper- and lower-case letters, and the program
even lets you fine-tune characters to better reflect your own writing. The
biggest quirk is that the entry line has room for only about eight to ten char-
acters, so you have to tap the little green arrow to move to the next screen,
and you must remember to include a hyphen if your word doesn’t fit on the
screen. Decuma is closer to typical writing than Graffiti 2 but still requires a
bit of practice.
39
Chapter 2: Communicating with Your CLIÉ

To enter numbers and symbols, tap the blue tab marked 1@* directly 
above the writing area. Tap the green Aa tab to return to character writing.
(See Figure 2-19.)
The software CDs that come with current CLIÉ models have fairly extensive
electronic documentation in PDF format for using and tuning Decuma. (Some
early Decuma-equipped units didn’t include this manual.) You can also find it
online by visiting www.decuma.com, clicking the Support button, and then
selecting the correct manual to download.

Keyboards: The virtual variety
You can avoid the handwriting issue entirely by using the pop-up on-screen
keyboard, which lets you use the stylus to tap out words. It’s easier to use
than Graffiti 2 or Decuma in that there’s nothing to memorize. The CLIÉ repli-
cates a miniature version of a computer keyboard on-screen, as shown in
Figure 2-20. The downside is that the letters are very small, so you have to be
very precise with the stylus.
To activate the on-screen alphabet keyboard, just tap the Keyboard icon —
the little a in the lower-left corner of the Graffiti area. (The 1 in the opposite
corner brings up the numeric keyboard.) When either keyboard is showing,
you can easily switch between the alphabetic, numeric, and international key-
boards by tapping the appropriate selection at the bottom of the screen.
Note that the keyboard appears only when the screen displays an appropri-
ate place to enter text. For instance, open Date Book and tap an appointment
slot, and then you can bring up the on-screen keyboard. If you don’t have an
appointment slot selected, tapping the keyboard icon just results in an error
beep because the program isn’t expecting any text at the moment, just as
entering Graffiti 2 text at this point would do nothing.
The following are few keyboard tips:
 Shiftiness: Because you can’t hold down two on-screen keys at once,
you enter an upper-case letter by first tapping the Shift key — it turns
blue to indicate that it’s selected — and then tapping the character you
wish to enter as a capital letter. The Shift key then turns white again, and
characters that follow are once again lower-cased.
Figure 2-20:

screen

41
Chapter 2: Communicating with Your CLIÉ

 Bustin’ Some Caps: The Cap key is used like Caps Lock on your key-
board; it’s like holding down the Shift key. It’s a toggle, so just tap it 
(it turns blue to show that it’s engaged), enter all the characters you’d
like to have capitalized, and then tap it again to return to lowercase text
entry.
 Legalized Graffiti: You can still use Graffiti 2 when the on-screen key-
board is showing, as shown in Figure 2-21. If I’m writing something that 
I know will use uncommon symbols or punctuation, I often pop up the
numeric keyboard, which is where most of the symbols are. I enter most
of the text below the keyboard by using Graffiti 2, and then just tap the
symbols as I need them.
On Hi-Res+ CLIÉ units with virtual writing areas, you can actually substitute
a mini-keyboard for the usual writing area. Just tap the tiny keyboard icon
below the Find icon on the right side of the text entry area. (Note that the UX
series CLIÉs don’t support the mini-keyboard due to the vertical orientation
of their stylus writing areas.)
On the bright side, the mini-keyboard (shown in Figure 2-22) works just like
the on-screen keyboard, but because it sits in the writing area, it doesn’t
obscure the program that you’re running. Sony managed to fit the number
row on the main keyboard, as well. On the downside, the mini-keyboard is
slightly more cramped than the on-screen keyboard, so it requires even more
stylus precision. It’s good practice if your mother wants you to be a surgeon.

Just as with the Graffiti 2 writing area, you can tap the Resize icon in the
Status Bar to make the mini-keyboard go away when you’re not entering text.
To return to Graffiti 2 entry, just tap the icon that looks like a miniature
replica of the stylus text entry area, directly above the Resize icon.
Keyboards: The real thing
Many newer CLIÉ models offer an actual built-in keyboard. These aren’t
exactly like the keyboard on your computer. The small buttons are designed
to be operated with your thumbs. Still, many users prefer thumb-typing to
writing with the stylus.
These keyboards operate as you’d expect. The one thing to note is the 
inclusion of extra Function Shift keys. Some of these thumb keyboards lack
numeric rows, so you have to hold down the Function Shift key (generally a
key marked with either Fn or a blue dot, as shown in Figure 2-23) to enter
numbers and many punctuation characters. Just press the Function Shift key,
and then press the corresponding number or symbol key.

Chapter 2: Communicating with Your CLIÉ

Note that all these CLIÉ models also let you enter text with the stylus. The
NR, NX, and UX series CLIÉs all offer pop-up virtual text entry areas, and the
PEG-TG50 model has a special pop-up Graffiti area that you can activate by
pressing the Graffiti key at the top-right corner of the keyboard.
Other input alternatives
If all the choices in the previous sections aren’t enough for you, well, I’d hate
to be your waiter. But never let it be said that the CLIÉ isn’t flexible! You can
also enter text by using the following methods:
 Using your computer keyboard and a program like CLIÉ Palm Desktop
or Microsoft Outlook. I take a look at how to do that in the following
chapter.
 Using third-party alternative text-entry utilities. One of my favorites is
Fitaly Virtual, available at www.fitaly.com. (See Figure 2-24.) Letters
are optimized for minimal stylus movement, allowing you to rapidly tap
words on the on-screen keyboard. It’s a Silk Plug-In, so it appears in the
virtual writing area and doesn’t cover the screen.
 Plugging your CLIÉ into a full-sized, folding keyboard. About the same
size as and with the same feel as a laptop keyboard, these pocket won-
ders let you touch type at full speed, yet they fold down to a size not
much larger than your CLIÉ itself. See Chapter 17 for a look at my
favorites.

ongratulations. You’ve mastered the basics of using your CLIÉ, and you
can enter data and launch programs like a natural. Unless, of course,
you haven’t yet checked out Chapter 2. In which case, it’s probably a good
thing that you bought a personal organizer device — it sounds like you 
need one.
With the basics out of the way, it’s time for you to tackle a few slightly more
advanced concepts. Don’t worry, nothing intimidating — see Relativistic
Quantum Mechanics For Dummies for that stuff. Rather, you’re going to find
out how to share information with your desktop system, how to tweak your
CLIÉ to fit your preferences, and how a reset can make the CLIÉ listen when it
stops responding to you.
Getting in (Hot)Sync with Your 
Desktop System
HotSyncing is one of the coolest and most useful tricks that you can do with
your CLIÉ. As you might guess from the name, HotSyncing keeps your CLIÉ in
sync with corresponding programs on your computer. This has all sorts of
great benefits. First and foremost, after you HotSync, all the information that
you’ve entered into your personal information management program is avail-
able on your CLIÉ — and vice versa! If you add a new phone number to your

CLIÉ, it is transferred to your desktop system the next time you HotSync.
Create a To Do item on your desktop system, and it appears on your CLIÉ
after you sync. And if you mark that item as done on the CLIÉ, the change is
noted on your desktop system, as well. HotSync is even smart enough to rec-
ognize conflicts. If you modify an item on both your desktop system and your
CLIÉ, HotSync keeps both versions and notifies you of the problem, allowing
you to fix one entry and delete the other.
As a bonus, HotSyncing backs up the data on your CLIÉ to your desktop
system, so if disaster strikes and you lose your data to a dead battery or
crash, you can reinstall all your data simply by HotSyncing. I talk more about
this safety net in Chapter 19.
Best of all, add-on programs can plug into the HotSync process; many such
third-party programs take advantage of HotSync so that they can include
their own desktop components. For instance, certain database programs,
schedule programs, and even personal journals include both Windows and
Palm versions and share data at synchronization.
Setting up for a HotSync
Even if you plan to HotSync with a different personal organizer program, you
still need to install CLIÉ Palm Desktop because it contains the HotSync man-
ager that’s behind all the synchronization magic. If you haven’t already done
the Install routine yet, go ahead and dredge up the software CD that came
with your CLIÉ and get ready to install Palm Desktop now.
After you get the CLIÉ installation CD fired up in your CD drive, you see that 
it includes loads of software, as shown in Figure 3-1. Throughout this book, 
I cover the important applications on the installation CD, but for now just
install Palm Desktop, the heart of it all, by doing the following:
1. Click the top button in the column on the left, labeled CLIÉ Desktop or
CLIÉ Basic on most models.
Along with installing the Palm Desktop, your current task, you see a vari-
ety of options, depending on your CLIÉ model. These might include
installing CLIÉ Organizer, Acrobat Reader, or CLIÉ Add-Ons.
2. Click the Install button next to the Palm Desktop for CLIÉ entry.
The InstallShield Wizard appears. Click Next to begin and follow the
prompts on the screen to begin copying the Palm Desktop program files.
3. As the installation proceeds, you’re asked to create a user account.
After the program files are copied to your computer’s hard drive, the
Create User Account screen of the Palm Desktop InstallShield Wizard
appears, as shown in Figure 3-2.
48
Part I: Getting to Know Your CLIÉ 

4. Enter a name for your account in the User Name field and then 
click Next.
Choose the name wisely here. This is the name that the HotSync pro-
gram and the Palm Desktop application use to identify your account.
And more important, it’s also the name that most third-party software
producers will ask for to produce a registration code for you when you
buy a program. So although you might think it’s cute that your best
friend calls you Sparkbuns, that might not be a good choice for a user-
name. Your real name is always a safe bet. (Unless it really is
Sparkbuns.)
Keep in mind that the HotSync username is supposed to be a unique
identifier, and thus every PDA that you sync with your computer must
have a different name. So if you call your first CLIÉ something creative
like CLIÉ, and then you buy one for your spouse, you need to come up
with a different moniker for the second handheld, or much electronic
confusion and mixing of data will ensue.
5. Continue following the prompts to complete installation.
You’re just a few clicks away from completing your installation. Just
follow the InstallShield on-screen prompts. Depending on your CLIÉ
model, you might be asked to perform your very first HotSync at the end
of the process. See the next section for the full scoop on how to do that.

Chapter 3: All That and the Kitchen (Hot)Sync

Though Sony sometimes refers to this version of Palm Desktop as CLIÉ 
Palm Desktop or Palm Desktop for CLIÉ, it’s really the same program that’s
included with all Palm OS handhelds. So if a third-party program is designed
to work with Palm Desktop, it’ll work fine with the version included with 
your CLIÉ.
What if you’re upgrading from another CLIÉ or other Palm OS PDA? You still
need to install the latest version of the Palm Desktop software because you
need the program to allow your new CLIÉ to sync. When you’re prompted for
a username, enter the same HotSync username that you used on the older
PDA if you want to transfer all your old data to your new PDA. But be aware
that some programs that are designed for older Palm OS PDAs don’t work
properly on the newest generation of CLIÉs. I suggest downloading the free
CLIÉ Migration Tool, which moves your information manager data over with-
out moving old programs. You can find it at by visiting www.sony.com/clie
and clicking the Support tab.
Sync time!
After you install Palm Desktop — see the previous section for more on that —
it’s time to introduce your CLIÉ to your desktop system. Depending on which
model you own, your CLIÉ came with either a HotSync cradle or a cable.
Their functions are identical — to connect your CLIÉ to your desktop system
and recharge it, as well. Connect the cradle or cable to a USB port on your
desktop system and to your CLIÉ.
After all this setup, you’ll be happy to know that a HotSync is about the easi-
est thing you can do with your CLIÉ. If you have a cradle, just press the
cradle’s HotSync button, shown on the left in Figure 3-3. If you have a cable,
Figure 3-2:
Choose a

CLIÉ.
50
Part I: Getting to Know Your CLIÉ 

you need to tap the HotSync icon in the Program Launcher to launch the
HotSync application, and then press the HotSync icon in the center of the
screen, as shown on the right in Figure 3-3.
Your CLIÉ beeps, and the first time that you HotSync you see a dialog box on
the Windows screen, asking you to confirm your username. Simply click the
HotSync username that you just created and the sync starts. (See Figure 3-4
for a glimpse of what that exciting process looks like.) In the future, you can
just press the button on the cradle — it asks for the username only on the
first sync or if your CLIÉ has lost the contents of its memory.
Speaking of lost memory, one of the most useful pieces of advice that I can
give you is to make HotSyncing a habit. If you enter new contacts, press that
HotSync button. If you download a new e-mail, press that HotSync button. If
your cat hisses at you, press that HotSync button. HotSyncing ensures that
the data on your CLIÉ is current and complete and that it’s backed up on
your desktop system in case your CLIÉ suffers any misfortunes.

Chapter 3: All That and the Kitchen (Hot)Sync

You don’t need to limit yourself to HotSyncing with just one computer, either.
You can install the Palm Desktop software on a second computer, connect
your cradle or cable, and HotSync on it, as well. Your CLIÉ acts as a go-
between, keeping all the data on both computers in sync. For example, add
an appointment on your work laptop, and it’s transferred to your CLIÉ during
the HotSync. Then take the CLIÉ home and HotSync with your personal desk-
top system, and the appointment is saved there, as well. You’ll be so orga-
nized that your biggest problem will be coming up with excuses to miss your
appointments.
Connecting with Outlook
Some people love the Microsoft Outlook personal information manager.
Others think the Magic 8 Ball said it best when it responded, “Outlook not so
good.” If you fall into the former camp and would prefer to use Outlook as
your information organizer, you’re in luck. The CLIÉ includes an application
called Intellisync Lite right on its installation CD. This application allows you
to HotSync the CLIÉ’s personal information management applications with
Outlook instead of Palm Desktop.
On the CDs included with most CLIÉ models, you find the Intellisync Lite
application listed under CLIÉ Utilities. (Refer to Figure 3-1. You see the CLIÉ
Utilities button on the left side of the screen.)You need to install Palm
Desktop before you can install Intellisync Lite because it uses the Palm
Desktop’s HotSync conduit.
Advanced users can actually do a custom installation of Palm Desktop and
just install HotSync manager, omitting the Palm Desktop application.
However, I suggest that you go ahead and install Palm Desktop anyway. The
program takes up little hard disk space, and some third-party programs
incorporate Palm Desktop plug-ins that don’t work with Outlook.
52
Part I: Getting to Know Your CLIÉ 
What about the Mac daddies?
The CLIÉ includes software for HotSyncing only
with Windows systems. Despite this, the CLIÉ
makes an excellent companion for the Mac, as
well. You just need to buy a third-party program
to allow the Mac and CLIÉ to communicate.
Mark/Space offers just the ticket with The
Missing Sync. Not only does it allow you to
HotSync with the Macintosh version of Palm
Desktop, but it also supports mounting your
CLIÉ’s Memory Stick as a drive icon on your
Mac. It even transfers songs between your CLIÉ
and iTunes, and photos between your CLIÉ and
iPhoto. You can find more information at www.
markspace.com/missingsync.html.

After installing Intellisync Lite, you need to configure it. A configuration
window automatically appears on your monitor after installation, as shown in
Figure 3-5. The window asks which CLIÉ applications you want to sync with
Outlook. Most users want to select all four applications, but if you choose,
you can leave an app unselected, and the application continues to sync with
Palm Desktop.
As you select each check box, a window appears, asking which application
you want to sync with. Select Outlook by clicking MS Outlook and then click-
ing the OK button. If you want a little more control over the HotSync process,
you can click the Advanced button on the Intellisync window — refer to
Figure 3-5 — to bring up a dialog box like the one shown in Figure 3-6. The
Conflict Resolution area lets you choose how to handle the situation when
records have been altered on both your Outlook and your CLIÉ between
HotSyncs. You can choose for Intellisync to add (duplicate) conflicting items,
ignore them, notify you, or just give automatic preference to the CLIÉ or
Outlook.

53
Chapter 3: All That and the Kitchen (Hot)Sync

Take note also of the Field Mapping button in the lower-right corner of the
advanced Intellisync Lite configuration dialog box. If you look at Figure 3-7,
you notice that your standard Outlook contact screen has a number of extra
information fields that aren’t found in corresponding CLIÉ applications. If you
need the information contained in one of these fields, you can alter the field
mapping to transfer that info to one of the fields that is present.
If you typically utilize many Outlook fields that aren’t represented in the stan-
dard CLIÉ organizer applications, a better option is to install a third-party
application such as KeySuite from Chapura (www.chapura.com), which recre-
ates all of Outlook’s organizer functions on your CLIÉ. I take a look at the
Chapura option in Chapter 13.
If you have both CLIÉs and Pocket PCs in your home, using Intellisync Lite
keeps the organizer information in sync between both of them — which may
or may not be a desired effect.
If you’re upgrading to a CLIÉ from a PDA based on Microsoft’s Pocket PC
operating system, you can use Intellisync Lite to transfer all your organizer
data from the old PDA. Just install Intellisync Lite and then HotSync your
CLIÉ. All your Pocket PC data — which is stored in Outlook — syncs to your
CLIÉ. After you’ve done this, you can leave Intellisync installed if you want to
continue to use Outlook or remove it if you prefer to use the Palm Desktop.

HotSync 102: Advanced HotSync
This is an easy-A class. Even advanced HotSync adjustments are easy to
handle. These are all tasks that you typically don’t do on a day-to-day basis,
but that could come in handy from time to time.
First, find the HotSync Manager menu, which is where you make adjustments
to HotSync settings. Look in the Windows System Tray in the lower-right
corner of your desktop system’s screen. You see a small blue-and-red circle
with arrows pointing inside it. That’s the HotSync logo. Click this to bring up
the menu shown in Figure 3-8.
At the top of the menu are four or five HotSync options: Local USB, Local
Serial, Modem, Network, and perhaps InfraRed if you’re using a laptop. For
the CLIÉ, you just need to make sure that Local USB is selected. The Local
Serial option is used for older models of other PDA brands. The Modem
option is designed to let you dial directly to your desktop system to sync,
which is a bit dated in today’s wireless Internet world. The Network option is
mostly used in specialized business setups. The InfraRed option lets you
HotSync with a laptop computer without using cables. It’s handy in a pinch
but very slow.
And now, a word about conduits. No, this isn’t a commercial from the electric
company. As you might guess from the name, a conduit is a connector. In this
case, HotSync conduits connect a program on your CLIÉ with a program on
your desktop computer — for instance, the conduit connects the Date Book
application with either the Palm Desktop Date Book or the Outlook Calendar.
The built-in Palm OS programs use conduits, and so do most third-party appli-
cations that transfer data to your desktop system. Because each program has
its own conduit, rather than using one big pipe for all the data, you have lots
of control over exactly what information goes where during a HotSync.
Figure 3-8:
The
HotSync
Manager
menu.
55
Chapter 3: All That and the Kitchen (Hot)Sync

To adjust conduit settings, choose Custom from the HotSync Manager menu.
A window like the one in Figure 3-9 appears, listing all the conduits currently
installed on your system and their current settings. To alter a setting, either
double-click a conduit or click it once and then click Change.
Most conduits have four available settings, as shown in Figure 3-10. Here’s
what they do:
 Synchronize the Files: The default option for most conduits, this setting
ensures that any new data entered on the CLIÉ is sent to your desktop
system, and vice versa. After a HotSync is complete, the data on both
devices should be identical. For normal usage, this is how all conduits
should be set.
 Desktop Overwrites Handheld: This option replaces any information on
the handheld with the information on your desktop system. Any infor-
mation that’s on your CLIÉ that’s not already on your desktop system is
lost. You might use this if you’ve, say, accidentally deleted some data on
your handheld, and you want to copy the info from your desktop system’s
personal information manager back to the handheld. (Otherwise, the syn-
chronization process results in the data being deleted from the desktop,
as well.)
 Handheld Overwrites Desktop: As above, but this time the CLIÉ wins.
The information on your CLIÉ replaces the information on your desktop
computer.
 Do Nothing: This option deactivates this particular HotSync conduit.
Suppose you have a conduit that takes a long time to execute, such as
Mobipocket, which goes out to the Internet to gather data. You could set
the conduit to Do Nothing by default and change it to Synchronize the
Files when you want it to update its information.
Normally, if you alter a conduit’s setting, the change takes effect only during
the next HotSync, after which it returns to its default setting. If you’d like to
change the default behavior, simply select the Set as Default check box after
making the change.
Figure 3-9:
The Custom
window lets

Part I: Getting to Know Your CLIÉ 

Installing Programs
Along with synchronization, one other major task occurs during HotSync:
Installing add-on software. If you’ve purchased or downloaded a new pro-
gram, HotSyncing transfers it to your CLIÉ.
Though a few programs arrive as EXE files and include step-by-step guided
setup programs like you find on your desktop system, most require a bit more
manual intervention from you. Typically, Palm programs are packaged in a ZIP
file on the PC or a SIT file on the Mac. To simplify unpacking and installing
these files, PC users can download a copy of WinZip from www.winzip.com.
Mac owners can use StuffIt, which is included with OS X.
When you open a downloaded ZIP file on your PC, it looks something like
Figure 3-11. The files in this example are the license agreement text file; three
versions of the program for various Palm OS devices; and most important,
the Read Me file. Here’s a breakdown of typical file types that you find in a
Palm OS program distribution ZIP file, based on the last few letters of the end
of the filename:

57
Chapter 3: All That and the Kitchen (Hot)Sync

 PRC: These are program files. If the ZIP file just contains one PRC file,
that’s what you need to install. If you see multiple files, as in the example
in Figure 3-11, consult the program’s documentation to make sure that
you install the correct file for your handheld.
 PDB: These are database files, in other words. These typically contain
music, graphics, text, and other information needed by the Palm pro-
gram that you’re installing. If you see any PDB files in the WinZip
window, chances are they need to be installed, but check the documen-
tation to be sure.
 TXT, HTML, or PDF: This is the documentation that I keep telling you to
check. Generally named something like ReadMe.txt or ProgramName.
html, these files contain both installation instructions and the manuals
for using the program.
After you figure out which files you want to install, just double-click them,
and they appear in the Install Tool. You can also launch the Install Tool manu-
ally from your Windows Start menu. Choose Start➪Program Files➪Sony
Handheld➪Install Tool. Then you can drag and drop files into the Install Tool
window. After you choose the files, the Install Tool window looks something
like Figure 3-12.
If you want to install the files to a Memory Stick to save space in your CLIÉ’s
internal memory, click the Change Destination button in the Install Tool
window. In the window that appears (see Figure 3-13), select any files from
the left column that you’d like to move to the Memory Stick, and then click
the >> button. (If you change your mind, select the unwanted file in the right
column and click the << button to put it back.) Note that you must do this
before you HotSync. If you want to move a file that’s already in your CLIÉ’s
main memory to a Memory Stick, see Chapter 14 for the full scoop. You can
also head to Chapter 14 for info on how to delete files that you no longer need.

After you select the files that you want to transfer, initiate a HotSync applica-
tion to install the files before the rest of your data is synchronized.
Want to automate the install process for your CLIÉ? Visit www.palmgear.com
and download StreamLync. This automated installation program finds the
right files for your CLIÉ and configures them for installation on HotSync — 
no dealing with WinZip or StuffIt.
Doing the Reset Shuffle
I spend a lot of time showing how to communicate with your CLIÉ. But what
about those times when it just doesn’t listen? Unfortunately, even handheld
computers like the CLIÉ can crash or lock up occasionally. It’s rare, but if it
happens, your screen might freeze, or you might be presented with the rather
frightening message Fatal Exception. The good news is that resets aren’t
fatal, and typically they’re not even that big a hassle.
If a program crashes, the error screen might include a Reset button. Go ahead
and tap it if you see it, but I’ve found that the button works only about half
the time. Don’t panic! Pressing the physical Reset button should get you back
up and running.

59
Chapter 3: All That and the Kitchen (Hot)Sync

Resets can be done in three ways. And the good news is that the first two
ways leave all your data intact, and they do the job almost every time.
 Soft reset: This is the equivalent of pressing the Reset button or hitting
Ctrl+Alt+Delete on your desktop computer. Just use the tip of your
stylus to press the button inside the little hole next to the word Reset on
the back or bottom of your CLIÉ. This reboots the CLIÉ. If a soft reset
works, you see the CLIÉ startup screen, followed by the Preferences
application, and everything is as good as new with no loss of data.
 Warm reset: Occasionally, a program that runs in the background, such
as an application that replaces Graffiti 2, crashes your CLIÉ and then
crashes it again whenever the CLIÉ starts up after a reset. If your CLIÉ
crashes immediately after rebooting, hold down the Up button (or the
Left button on CLIÉs with center-mounted jog dials; on the UX series,
hold the PgUp key) and press the Reset switch, and then release the Up
(or Left) button when you see the Palm Powered logo. This reboots your
CLIÉ but disables any programs that run during startup. (It also disables
any communications and wireless programs.) Then you can delete the
offending application and try a soft reset.
 Hard reset: This is the reset of last resort. Use a hard reset only if the
first two don’t work. Fear not: Most users never have to do this. But if
your CLIÉ remains locked up even after you’ve tried soft and warm
resets, a hard reset gets things working by clearing out its memory com-
pletely. The downside is that you lose all the data in main memory. (Data
in the Internal Media area on a UX series unit or on a Memory Stick isn’t
affected.) To perform a hard reset, hold down the power button, press
the Reset switch, and continue to hold the power button until you see
the Palm Powered logo on the screen. When you release the power
button, the CLIÉ prompts you to press Up (or Left on the CLIÉs with
center-mounted jog dials) to erase all data, or press any other key to
abort. If the hard reset is successful, your CLIÉ returns to the same
setup screen that you saw the first time you turned the unit on. Go
through the setup procedure and then HotSync to restore all your data.
If it doesn’t respond after a few tries at a hard reset, it might be time to
take it in for repair.
If your stylus tip doesn’t fit in the Reset hole, try unscrewing the top of the
stylus, where you may find a reset pin. If that doesn’t work, or if you can’t
find your stylus, just unfold a paper clip, insert it into the Reset hole, and use
it to gently press the button inside the hole.

Getting Organized

In this part . . .
P
ersonal Digital Assistants are best known for their
organizer functions, and although the CLIÉ is a 
multitalented device, it doesn’t skimp on the basics. It
enhances them, as you see in these chapters. Making your
way through Part II, you discover how to add photos to
your contact list, drag notes and even movies onto your
schedule, and more.
This part covers not only the standard Palm OS organizer
applications — Date Book, Address book, Memo Pad, and
To Do — but also the hot new integrated CLIÉ Organizer
program.
Taking advantage of these organizer applications gives
you plenty of free time to play with the really fun stuff that
I cover in later chapters.

 Managing addresses in CLIÉ Organizer
I
still remember the address book that my dad used to keep. If you looked
at his entry for me, you could see my moves throughout my childhood, to
college, from coast to coast, and back. It filled a couple pages of addresses, to
the point that my listing had slipped to the B pages, and to the third page of
the real Bs, at that. It had gotten to the point that the book was more useful
as a historical record than as a reference tool. Of course, he could have
gotten a new address book, but that would have required manually copying
all the up-to-date addresses, as well. And that, of course, would be wasting
time that could be better spent on golf!
I’m extremely glad to be living in the 21st century. I have electronic organiz-
ers to handle my addresses, TiVo to let me watch my favorite TV shows on
demand, and a personal hovercraft to jet us to work. Well, two out of three
ain’t bad.

Obviously, an electronic address book like the CLIÉ’s Address Book offers
many advantages over the paper models. Some are obvious, but some might
not have occurred to you.
 Updating is easy — no more crossing out old addresses.
 You have space for thousands of addresses.
 You always have current address info for all your contacts at home, at
work, and on the road.
 The CLIÉ can keep your office and home address book programs in sync.
 You can create an electronic business card that you can beam to other
Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) users.
 You can link addresses to appointments — a neat trick that I cover in
Chapter 5.
 If something happens to your CLIÉ, you still have copies of your orga-
nizer information on your computer. If you lose a paper organizer, you’re
out of luck.
 On CLIÉs that are equipped with Bluetooth wireless communications,
you can dial a Bluetooth cell phone directly from the Address Book.
 The Address Book can interface with add-on programs. For example, a
Global Positioning System (GPS) mapping program can access your
Address Book data to let you look up a destination without having to
enter the entire address — just tap the contact name.
So toss that old paper address book on the pile of stuff to show the kids
someday, along with the slide rule and the Commodore 64. Nothing beats the
convenience of keeping your contact info on your CLIÉ.
Entering New Contacts
Despite its versatility as an address book, when you first take your CLIÉ out
of the box, it’s a clean slate. Entering addresses is a snap, though. If you don’t
currently have your contact information on a computer, it can be a bit time-
consuming, but when the addresses are in electronic form, you never again
have to reenter them — just update them as they change. And isn’t that
worth a little typing?
You can put addresses into your CLIÉ in three ways:
 Enter them directly on your CLIÉ.
 Enter them on your desktop system and HotSync them to the CLIÉ.
 Import them from Outlook or another address manager.

Part II: Getting Organized 

The last option is preferable if the info is already on your desktop system —
unless you just really want to practice your Graffiti 2 skills. But even if your
contact database is already on your desktop system, don’t skip past the next
sections unless you plan to move to a South Sea Island and never make a new
contact again. (Can I come visit?)
Entering contacts on your CLIÉ
Begin by launching the Address Book program. On all CLIÉ models except 
the UX series, you can do this simply by pressing the application hard button
that has a telephone on it. You can also tap the Address icon in the Program
Launcher.
After you open the Address Book program, creating a new entry is a snap.
Just do the following:
1. Tap the New button at the bottom of the Address Book screen.
The Address Edit screen appears with the cursor flashing in the Last
Name field.
2. Enter the last name by using Graffiti 2 or the keyboard.
For more on Graffiti and other options for entering text, see Chapter 2.
3. Tap the First Name field and enter the appropriate info by using
Graffiti 2 or the keyboard.
4. Continue tapping and entering text until all the fields that you want
covered are filled in.
To move to the next field, simply tap it. When you reach the bottom of
the screen, tap the down-pointing arrow near the bottom-right corner of
the screen (see Figure 4-1) or roll the jog dial down. The screen scrolls to
the next set of fields.

Chapter 4: Getting Street Smart with Address Book

Although you can’t add new fields to an Address Book listing, you can use
multiple lines in a field. This can be handy for long addresses or for including
a department along with a company name. (Refer to Figure 4-1.) After you
finish the first line, just enter a Return Graffiti 2 stroke (a forward slash) or
tap Enter on your CLIÉ’s keyboard. When you’re viewing the Address List
screen, you see only the first line, but when you tap an address to display all
its details, you see all the lines.
Adding additional contact info
In addition to the standard Last Name/First Name/Title lines, the Address
Book includes four lines for storing various phone numbers, e-mail addresses,
and similar contact information. The great thing about these lines is that you
can customize them for each contact. A personal contact might list a home
phone, a cell phone, an e-mail address, and an instant messenger name, but a
business contact might list numbers for two different offices, a fax number,
and a pager number. To change the description of a number, tap the down
arrow to the left of the field name to make a pop-up list appear, as shown in
Figure 4-2. Tap the description that’s appropriate for your contact data.
Note that whatever name you choose for a phone number field, the first
phone number in the list is the one that shows on the Address View screen
by default, so listing the most-needed number first could be a time-saver. 
You can change which number is listed by tapping the Details button on the
Address Edit screen (refer to Figure 4-2) and selecting the appropriate
number from the Show in List pop-up menu.
Figure 4-2:

labels are

Part II: Getting Organized 

When you scroll down to the very bottom of the Address Edit screen, you see
four fields called Custom 1 through Custom 4. These can contain any data
that you desire — extra e-mail addresses, spouse and kids’ names, and so 
on. You can even choose custom field names, but note that unlike the phone
fields, which you can customize for each entry, the custom field names show
for all entries. To rename the fields, tap the Menu soft button and choose
Rename Custom Fields from the Options menu. Tap OK when you’re done.
If you’re using Outlook to manage contacts on your desktop system, and
you’re using a few fields that aren’t carried over to your CLIÉ’s Address Book,
you can use the Field Mapping feature in Intellisync Lite to map up to four
fields to the Address Book’s custom fields. (See Chapter 3 for more on the
Intellisync Lite program.)
If you need to enter information about a contact that’s not appropriate for one
of the built-in fields or is too long to fit, tap the Note button at the bottom of
the Address Edit screen. You can now enter up to 4,096 characters (roughly
two printed pages) of additional information about your contact. Entries with
notes gain a Note icon in the far-right column on the Address List screen; just
tap this icon to view the note.
Finally, if you want to keep a contact’s information private, tap the Details
button at the bottom of the Address Edit screen, and then select the Private
check box. You need to enable a password for your CLIÉ for the privacy to
take effect — see Chapter 18 for details.
Adding a photo image
One field is unique to the CLIÉ’s Address Book — the ability to associate a
photo with an address. These pictures can be shots that you’ve taken with
your CLIÉ’s camera or JPEG photos transferred from your desktop system.
Just tap the words No Image at the top-right of the Address Edit screen to
bring up the CLIÉ’s photo browser. Navigate through the browser, tap an
image that you like, and — presto! — it appears at the top of your listing.
If you accidentally choose the wrong image — or you just don’t want to look
at that goofy picture of your ex anymore, but you can’t erase her contact info
because she still has your REO Speedwagon CD collection — just tap the
image again, and a pop-up menu appears, giving you the option of choosing 
a new image or displaying no image.
Keep in mind that images use a lot more memory than text-only entries. 
I recommend associating images with only your most important contacts.
67
Chapter 4: Getting Street Smart with Address Book

Assigning contacts to categories
Sorting contacts into categories makes finding entries much easier when your
Address Book is heavily populated. Careful categorization can save you the
hassle of scrolling through 19 screens of data in a crowded address book just
to locate Renée Zellweger’s number. With an entry open, tap the drop-down
list box in the top-right corner of the Address Edit screen (it reads Unfiled by
default) and choose a category for your entry from the pop-up list. If you don’t
see an appropriate category, tap Edit Categories; tap the New button on the
screen that pops up; and enter a new category name, as shown in Figure 4-3.
The Address Book supports up to 15 categories.
Entering contacts by using Palm Desktop
To enter contacts on your desktop system, load the Palm Desktop by mous-
ing to the Start menu and choosing Sony Handheld➪Palm Desktop for CLIÉ.
When the program loads, you find a group of icons along the left side of the
screen that correspond to the Organizer applications on your CLIÉ. Click the
Address icon to get started.
To enter a new address — you guessed it — click the New Address button at
the bottom of the Address Book screen. A list of the same fields that you see
on your CLIÉ (except for the optional image) appears. Just enter the appro-
priate data in each field by using the mouse or the Tab key to move between
fields.
When you finish an entry, click the OK button to return to the Address List
screen or click New to place the current entry in the list and begin entering 
a new one.
When you finish entering your addresses, execute a HotSync to transfer them
to your CLIÉ. (Chapter 3 gives you all the info that you need for performing
HotSyncs.) Note that addresses are automatically saved when you exit Palm
Desktop, so you don’t have to save your file first.
Figure 4-3:

up to 15

Part II: Getting Organized 

Importing contacts from another program
If your addresses are in Microsoft Outlook or Lotus Organizer, and you’d like
to import them to your CLIÉ, just install Intellisync Lite (see Chapter 3), and
your PDA can sync with Outlook or Organizer instead of Palm Desktop. If you
prefer to use Palm Desktop or the new CLIÉ Organizer program after transfer-
ring your contacts to your CLIÉ, just go to your Windows Control Panel,
choose Add/Remove Programs, and remove Intellisync Lite after you HotSync
your Outlook contacts to your CLIÉ.
If you’re using a different third-party program, fear not. You don’t have to
retype all your contacts. The Palm Desktop’s Import feature handles files in
Address Book Archive (ABA), comma-separated value (CSV), tab-separated
value (TAB), or VCard (VCF) formats. Consult your program’s documentation
to find out how to save a file in one of those formats.
When you have your contact info in a supported format, choose File➪Import
from the Palm Desktop’s main menu, and then locate the file that you created
and double-click it. You see the Import Fields window, shown in Figure 4-4.
Carefully match the field order, which likely differs at least slightly from the
Palm Desktop’s field order. You can use the Scan Records arrows to page
through your entries, and then use your mouse to drag field names up and
down the list to match the order of your address entries. When you’re certain
that everything’s ordered properly, just click the OK button, and your contact
list gets imported to Palm Desktop, ready to HotSync to your CLIÉ.

Chapter 4: Getting Street Smart with Address Book

Viewing and Finding Addresses
Now that you have your virtual black book installed in your CLIÉ, you can
already see how it’s more efficient than the paper variety. Tap the Address
icon in the Program Launcher to bring up the Address Book. Finding informa-
tion on a contact is as easy as scrolling through the Address List by using the
Up and Down hard buttons or the jog dial. When you locate the contact you’re
seeking, just tap it or push the jog dial to bring it up on the Address View
screen and view it in detail. Tap the Done button to return to the Address List
view. If your CLIÉ is equipped with Bluetooth wireless communication, you
can tap a phone number to dial it using your cell phone. (See Chapter 15 for
the scoop on Bluetooth dialing.)
If you typically search for contacts not by name but by company association,
tap the Menu soft button, and then choose Options➪Preferences from the
menu that appears. Here you can choose to list contacts by company name,
and then last name, instead of last name, first name.
After you have more than a couple screens full of addresses, navigating the
list can be a challenge. One way to pare down the number of entries is to 
use categories. When you first load Address Book, the category is set to All.
Tap the down arrow next to the category box at the top-right of the Address
List screen and choose a category to, for example, show only your business
contacts.
To quickly switch between categories, just press the Address Book hard
button. Each time you press it, the program switches to the next category.
Note that entries in the Unfiled category don’t appear if you use this method.
You can use a couple methods for quickly finding entries. At the bottom of
the Address List screen, you see the words Look Up followed by a field. Just
tap the field and enter the first couple of characters of the last name of the
contact you’re looking for.
To search through fields other than the last name or to find, say, all your con-
tacts in the state of Mississippi, just tap the Find soft button and enter any
piece of data — first name, state, area code, and so on. The CLIÉ searches the
current application (in this case, Address Book) first, and then the rest of the
applications installed in your CLIÉ. When you see the entry you were looking
for in the results view, as in Figure 4-5, just tap the entry to bring up the detail
view.
70
Part II: Getting Organized 

Editing, Duplicating, and Deleting Entries
People are awfully nomadic in today’s world, and the ability to easily update
addresses is one reason to switch to the CLIÉ Address Book.
When Aunt Marge relocates from Canada to Florida, updating her address
couldn’t be easier. Just locate her Address Book entry and tap it to call up the
Address View screen, and then tap the Edit button. Doing so brings up the by-
now-familiar Address Edit screen. (Refer to Figure 4-1.) If you want to change
the entry, just alter any field that has changed and tap the Done button when
you’re finished.
If you need to create a new listing that has similar information to an exist-
ing contact — say, people who work in the same company and share an
address — you can duplicate an entry and just change the pertinent informa-
tion. Tap the source entry on the main Address View screen, and then press
the Menu soft button and choose Record➪Duplicate Address from the menu
that appears. An exact duplicate appears with the word Copy added after the
first name. Now you can change just the name, phone, and other fields, and
then save the new entry by tapping the Done button.
To delete a record, tap it to bring up the detailed Address View screen, and
then tap the Menu soft button and choose Record➪Delete Address from the
menu that appears. If you already happen to be in the Address Edit screen
when you decide to delete an entry, just tap the Details button and then tap
the Delete button in the window that pops up.

Part II: Getting Organized 
Introducing CLIÉ Organizer for PC
Sony introduced yet another desktop synchro-
nization application with the new PEG-TG55: the
CLIÉ Organizer for PC. Though it truly changes
the way you work on your handheld by putting
all the major applications on one tabbed screen,
the experience on your desktop computer isn’t
much different from that on the Palm Desktop.
The biggest changes are support for the CLIÉ
Organizer special functions that aren’t available
on other Palm OS handhelds, such as the Free
Notes drawing pad, images in Address Book
entries, and layered To Do items. For the most
part, though, CLIÉ Organizer for PC works very
much like Palm Desktop, so I focus on Palm
Desktop for step-by-step instructions through-
out the book. I cover any differences or
enhancements found in CLIÉ Organizer for PC in
sidebars like this one.
As you can see in the following figure, the CLIÉ
Organizer for PC Address Book works much the
same way as the Palm OS version. The chief dif-
ferences are the ability to display and choose
pictures associated with Address Book entries
(the Palm Desktop just ignores pictures) and the
ability to associate Free Notes with an entry.
(See Chapter 7 for more on Free Notes.)
Note that when you’re choosing an Address
Book image that’s stored on a Memory Stick,
you must use the Data Import program to mount
that Memory Stick as a disk drive on your
Windows system. I show you how to do that in
Chapter 14.

Creating and Beaming a Business Card
Even after working with PDAs for a decade, I still have a huge pile of business
cards on my desk that I need to enter into my information manager as soon
as I finish my quest to capture the mythical free time beast. Luckily, an alter-
native is available in today’s widely wired world. (Try saying that three times
fast.) By creating an electronic business card, you can easily beam your infor-
mation to other handheld users — both Palm OS and recent Pocket PC
devices can send and receive business cards to each other.
Creating a card couldn’t be easier. Just bring up your own contact listing by
tapping it in the Address List screen, and then tap the Menu soft button and
choose Record➪Select Business Card from the menu that appears, as shown
in Figure 4-6. The CLIÉ asks for confirmation; tap Yes. A small icon with a tiny
person next to an infrared beam appears at the top center of the screen to
confirm that this is now your business card entry.
On most CLIÉs, beaming your business card couldn’t be simpler. Just hold
down the Address Book hard button. (On the UX series, you need to tap the
Menu soft button and choose Record➪Beam Business Card because this
series lacks the Address Book hard button.) The CLIÉ pops up a window
asking you whether you want to beam your business card with or without an
image. Tap Send to beam it. Make sure that your CLIÉ’s infrared window is
pointing at — and a few inches away from — your recipient’s address
window. When your recipient receives the card, her PDA asks her to confirm
that it should be entered into the Address Book and which category it should
be placed under.
Figure 4-6:
Setting a
record as a

73
Chapter 4: Getting Street Smart with Address Book

You might want to create a couple listings for yourself — one with business
information and another that stores the personal info that you prefer not to
share with your business contacts, for example. Although Address Book lets
you create only one business card, you can actually beam any entry (such as
your personal record) in your Address Book. Just bring up the Address View
screen, tap the Menu soft button, and choose Record➪Beam Address from
the menu that appears.
74
Part II: Getting Organized 
Address management using CLIÉ Organizer
The handheld version of the CLIÉ Organizer
application included with the PEG-TH55 differs
from the Address Book primarily in appearance.
The main Address List screen has a couple sig-
nificant enhancements — it shows the image
associated with each entry and displays icons
if notes are attached. It also includes a set of
tabs across the top of the screen for quick
access to entries starting with a particular
letter.
You see three icons at the bottom-left corner of
the screen in the following figure. The left icon
toggles off the picture display so that you can
see more entries at once. The middle icon
opens a blank, new entry, and the right icon
brings up a screen designed to allow you to
easily delete multiple entries.
The information contained in the entries is the
same as in Address Book but with the addition
of the ability to associate a Free Note with an
entry by tapping the Free Note button on the
Address Edit screen. See Chapter 7 for more on
Free Notes.
Note that all the standard organizer applica-
tions, including Address Book, are also included
on the PEG-TH55. So if you prefer the classic
version, it’s available from the Program
Launcher. You can even use the Buttons func-
tion in the Preferences application to assign
Address Book to the PEG-TH55’s Address
button in place of CLIÉ Organizer.

I
f you’re having trouble finding the time to sit down and read this book,
this is the chapter for you. The CLIÉ’s Date Book application can do won-
ders for helping you manage your schedule. Daily, weekly, and monthly views
let you know at a glance just how frantic life is about to get, and alarms can
not only pop up to warn you of impending appointments, but they can also
remind you days or even weeks before a project is due. Getting an alarm
about your upcoming anniversary a week or so before the event is a lot 
more useful than getting it the morning of. Your CLIÉ can keep you from 
ever having to say, “Don’t think of it as Red Lobster, honey. Think of it as
Lobster Rouge!” when that’s the only place where you can make a last-second
reservation.
Looking at Your Schedule
Before I show you how to enter your business meetings, kids’ soccer games,
and manicure appointments, I want to take you on a quick tour of the Date
Book program, concentrating first on the various views that it gives you of
your schedule. To launch Date Book, press the Date Book hard button or tap
the Date Book icon in the Program Launcher.

76
Part II: Getting Organized 
Date Book comes up in the Day View (see Figure 5-1), which shows you all
your appointments for a single day. This view also makes use of teeny-tiny
icons for showing you whether particular appointments have notes or alarms
set. (Do you see the teeny-tiny alarm clock on the right in Figure 5-1? Guess
what that one’s for.) Small black lines in the left margin indicate the duration
of an appointment; the line turns red to reflect appointments that overlap.
By default, Date Book compresses your entries to fit on a single screen —
that is, if you have appointments that would normally scroll off the bottom of
the screen, Date Book omits showing some blank appointments slots so that
you can see all your appointments on a single screen.
If you have more appointments than can fit on one screen, simply scroll down
to see the rest of your schedule by tapping the down arrow in the lower-left
corner of the screen, by pressing the Down hard button, or by rolling the jog
dial downward. You can view any other day of the week by tapping the appro-
priate day letter in the top-right corner of the screen. To move forward or
back a week, use the left and right arrows surrounding the day letters
Tapping the Go To button at the bottom of the screen brings up a calendar
for quickly jumping to a specific day; you can find this handy button in all the
different views.
To go instantly to today’s appointments, press the Go To button at the bottom
of the Date Book screen, and then tap the Today button at the bottom of the
Calendar View that pops up.
Figure 5-1:
In this Day
View, thin
lines on the

You can find four small icons at the bottom-left corner of Day View. The first
icon, Day View, should be highlighted. Tap the second icon or press the Date
Book hard button to move to the second view, the Week View, as shown in
Figure 5-2. This gives you an at-a-glance look at your schedule for the week —
handy for figuring out which days are busy and which aren’t. Appointments
are represented by gray boxes, and you can tap any box to see what it 
represents.
If you need to move an appointment to another day, the Week View makes it 
a snap. Just hold the stylus down on the gray box representing that appoint-
ment and drag it to a new day and/or time.
Tap the third icon at the bottom-left of the Week View screen or press the Date
Book hard button again to see the Month View. Here, scheduled appointments
are represented by dots in each day’s box, as shown in Figure 5-3. The Month
View can be made more useful by tapping the Menu soft button, choosing the
Display Options item from the menu that appears, and then selecting all three
options for the Month View. In addition to scheduled meetings, this shows
repeating events and events that don’t have a specific time associated with
them.
Tap any date to jump to the Day View for that day. If you have a large-screen
CLIÉ, you can tap the down arrow on the Status Bar to retract the Graffiti area
and see the first few appointments for the day at the bottom of the screen. To
scroll through days without leaving the Month View, use the jog dial.
Finally, tap the fourth icon at the bottom-left of the Month View screen or
press the Date Book hard button one more time to go to the Agenda View, as
shown in Figure 5-4. This extremely handy at-a-glance screen shows you your
appointments for the day, as well as your pending To Do items.

78
Part II: Getting Organized 
At the top-right corner of the Agenda View, you can see the current date as
well as arrows that you can use to scroll forward and back through the calen-
dar. Tapping any appointment takes you to that appointment in the Day View,
and tapping a To Do item opens the To Do application (which I cover in the
following chapter). At the top-right corner of the To Do section is a small
drop-down menu arrow next to the word All. Tap this arrow to call up a pop-
up menu that you can use to filter To Do entries by category.
Unfortunately, Date Book doesn’t offer categories. If you want to categorize
your appointments, a third-party replacement like Agendus or DateBk5 is for
you. (See Chapter 22 for more info on these great third-party programs.)
Making Appointments
In yet another example of how the CLIÉ can adapt to a variety of usage styles,
you have four, count ’em, four different ways to start a new appointment entry:

 Tap the New button at the bottom of the screen in the Day View to call
up the Set Time window, shown in Figure 5-5. Tap numbers in the hour
and minute columns to set the Start Time value, and then tap the End
Time text box and repeat the process. Tapping the All Day button
assigns all available hours to the appointment, but tapping the No Time
button is useful for creating what are referred to as untimed appoint-
ments, which are events like payday or a birthday, for which no specific
time of day is associated with the event. After you set the time and dura-
tion, tap OK to return to the Day View screen. Now simply write the
details of the event — the line corresponding to the time that you just
set is highlighted.
 Start entering a time by using Graffiti 2 or the keyboard. The Set Time
window appears, and the time that you wrote appears selected in the
Start Time text box. To change from a.m. to p.m., just write a P.
 If your appointment starts on the hour, and you’re in the Day View, you
can tap in the blank line next to the time that your appointment starts
and begin writing. The appointment is set to last one hour by default.
 Tap a time slot in the Week View to select a time. This is useful for get-
ting an overview of how busy your week is before choosing a time for
the appointment. After you choose a time, you’re taken to the Day View,
and the cursor is in the appropriate appointment slot, ready for input.
This works only with appointments that start on the hour, but when
you’re in the Day View, you can adjust the start time if necessary.
Are you trying to slip an appointment in for later today, but you don’t know
what the current time is? Just hold the stylus down on the date at the top-left
corner of any of the views, and the tab changes to show the current time.

Chapter 5: An Appointment with the Date Book

Changing or Deleting Appointments
To alter an appointment, open the Event Details window by tapping the
appointment entry in the Day View and then tapping the Details button at the
bottom of the screen. As you see in Figure 5-6, you can easily alter the
appointment time or date, set an alarm, make the appointment repeat, or flag
the appointment as Private. (For more on private records, see Chapter 18.)
You can also create a note to attach to the appointment in case you need to
include additional information.
To delete an appointment, first select it. Then you can tap the Menu soft
button and choose Record➪Delete Event from the menu that appears, or tap
the Details button and then tap the Delete button in the Event Details window
80
Part II: Getting Organized 
The Address Book link
Suppose you’re making an appointment with
Jessica Jones, and you plan to call her the
morning of the meeting to confirm that it’s still
on. Sure, you could look up the appointment and
then go to the Address Book to look up Joan, but
the CLIÉ makes it easier than that. You can
easily paste a contact’s name and phone
number into an appointment directly from the
Address Book.
Just create an appointment normally, and then
tap the Menu soft button and choose Options➪
Phone Lookup from the menu that appears. 
A list of your contacts appears. You can scroll
through them to find Joan’s name or enter the
first couple of characters of her last name in the
Look Up text line at the bottom of the screen, as
in the following figure. Tap her number and then
tap Add to paste her name and phone number
at the end of your appointment entry. If you
enter a Return character (a forward slash in
Graffiti 2) before performing the phone lookup,
the contact name appears on its own line,
making it easy to read.

when it pops up. A windows appears, asking for confirmation. Selecting the
Save Archive Copy on PC option in this window saves deleted appointments
in a text file in your Palm Desktop directory in case you need to reference
them later.
To delete several outdated appointments at once, tap the Menu soft button
and choose Record➪Purge from the menu that appears. The command
defaults to deleting events more than a week old, but you can tap the arrow
next to the time period and change this to as much as one month.
Repeating appointments
The Repeat feature is useful when an event recurs regularly or if an event
lasts a number of days. After tapping the Details button, tap the text box next
to Repeat in the Event Details window to make the Change Repeat window
appear, as shown in Figure 5-7. Now you need to determine which time period
to use. You can repeat by days, weeks, months, or years.
Here’s what to do if you want to block off a span of time for an event (for this
example, a vacation) in Date Book:
1. With Date Book open, tap the New button at the bottom of the screen
in the Day View.
The Set Time window appears. (Refer to Figure 5-5.)
2. Tap the No Time button to create an untimed appointment, and then
tap the OK button.
Your CLIÉ returns to Day View, where you can enter Vacation in the
entry line that you just created.

5. Tap the Day button at the top of the Change Repeat window and enter
1 in the Every . . . Day(s) field.
6. Tap the drop-down menu arrow next to the End On field, and then
select Choose Date from the menu that appears.
A calendar appears, and from it you can select the last day on which
your appointment should repeat.
7. Tap the last day of your vacation.
The Change Repeat window reappears with your selected end date
entered in the End On field.
8. Click OK to accept your settings and close the Change Repeat window
You now have an untimed appointment marking each day of your 
vacation.
You can use the Week or Month options in the Change Repeat window to set
less frequent events, such as flagging your payday for every two weeks on
Friday. Options abound — you can even set up an appointment to occur, say,
on the third Thursday of each month. And of course, the Every 1 Year(s) set-
ting is very useful for events like birthdays and anniversaries.
Note that if you edit or delete a recurring appointment, a window appears,
offering the choice of deleting only the current occurrence (if, say, you know
you’re going to miss a regular weekly meeting), future occurrences (if an
event is going to stop repeating after a particular date), or all occurrences.

Setting alarms
Sure, having your schedule in one place is great — when you remember to
check it. But what about those events that sneak up on you? Getting an alarm
the day of your mom’s birthday isn’t very helpful when you still need to buy
her a present and mail it to her in Bermuda. Luckily, Date Book has a very
versatile alarm feature.
After you tap the Details button to call up the Event Details window (refer to
Figure 5-6) for an appointment, you see a check box next to Alarm. Select this
check box, and on the line to the right of it, set how far before the event you
want the alarm to go off. If you want the alarm to sound right at the beginning
of a scheduled event, choose zero minutes. If you need to drive to the
appointment, you might want to have the alarm go off two hours before it
begins. If the event requires a lot of planning — say, you need to buy a gift or
a plane ticket beforehand — you can even set the alarm to go off 30 days
before the event.
When an alarm goes off, a window appears with the appointment time and
description. Tap the OK button to dismiss the alarm, the Snooze button to
have the alarm remind you again in five minutes, or the Go To button to jump
to viewing the appointment in Date Book.
If you want every appointment to have an alarm by default, tap the Menu soft
button and choose Options➪Preferences from the menu that appears. In the
Preferences window — shown in Figure 5-8 — select the check box next to
Alarm Preset. With this check box selected, every new appointment you
create automatically has an alarm. The Alarm Preset feature defaults to five
minutes before the appointment, but you can alter the default and still
change the value for individual appointments, as well. You can also choose a
default alarm sound and set how many times the alarm plays if you don’t
cancel it. I suggest setting the Remind Me feature to at least 5 Times just in
case you happen to be away from your CLIÉ when it goes off. It doesn’t repeat
if you acknowledge it, so there’s no harm in a high repeat value.

Chapter 5: An Appointment with the Date Book

84
Part II: Getting Organized 
The CLIÉ Organizer Date Book
The Date Book application included as part of
the CLIÉ Organizer software suite, which first
appeared on the PEG-TH55, is perhaps the most
enhanced of all the updated applications. It has
all the features of the standard Date Book —
and can share data with the standard Date
Book — but it also features a number of very
useful new features.
The first time you run the CLIÉ Organizer Date
Book, a window appears, allowing you to install
the program’s built-in holidays. The program
prompts you to tap the country that you live in,
and you can optionally import all the major
national holidays. You can also add your own
holidays — useful for permanently adding birth-
days, anniversaries, and so on — or delete hol-
idays that you don’t celebrate.
In the visuals department, the CLIÉ Organizer
Date Book adds a new six-month view and the
ability to associate colors with specific dates.
But most dramatic are the changes to the Day
View. You can drag and drop pictures, movies,
voice recordings, free notes, and icons (called
Stickers) right onto your schedule, making this
the most multimedia-oriented data manager yet.
Play with these features to discover just how
useful they are. Suppose you remember an item
that you need to pick up at the grocery store on
the way home. Jot down a Free Note or make a
voice recording, and then drag it to the time slot
for when you’re heading home and set an alarm.
Another slick feature is the ability to write and
draw freehand directly on any of the Date Book
pages, as shown in the following figure. Text
that you write in freehand can’t be found in a
search, but this feature is extremely useful for
highlighting items so that you notice them at a
quick glance.

Dates on the Desktop
The Palm Desktop application for Windows includes the same basic Date
Book views as the CLIÉ version, except that a Year View replaces the Agenda
View. With the Date Book application open, click the New Event button at the
bottom-left corner of the screen and enter the information in the same way
and with the same options as the handheld version, as shown in Figure 5-9.
The column to the right of your schedule can display either Address Book or
To Do items. What’s really slick is that you can drag either of these over to a
time slot to instantly create an appointment containing either the Address
Book contact information or the To Do information. You can then double-
click the item to add further info, set an alarm or repeat value, or change the
duration.
You can also create a new appointment by clicking in an appointment slot
and typing. One nice enhancement is the ability to tap an appointment and
drag it to a different time to quickly reschedule it not only in the Week View,
but in the Day View as well. If you want to shorten or lengthen an appoint-
ment, click it, and a small arrow appears at the bottom of the appointment
box. You can grab the arrow with the mouse and stretch or reduce the dura-
tion of the appointment.
Figure 5-9:

Chapter 5: An Appointment with the Date Book

Note that the Palm Desktop doesn’t play alarms by default. If you want
alarms to register on your desktop system as well as on your CLIÉ, choose
Tools➪Options from the Palm Desktop main menu, and then click the Alarms
tab, as shown in Figure 5-10. Select the Always Available (Put in Startup
Folder) radio button to have the Alarm Manager application start up auto-
matically every time you turn on your desktop system. You can also choose
what happens when an alarm goes off — whether an alarm window pops up,
a sound plays, or a custom WAV sound file of your choice plays.
The CLIÉ Organizer for PC application works much the same way as the Palm
Desktop but with the addition of the ability to add color coding, icons, and
attached Free Notes to appointments. Though you must use your CLIÉ to add
graphics or drawings on the schedule, the desktop version displays these 
elements in the CLIÉ Screen Preview window to the right of your schedule, 
as shown in Figure 5-11. You need to use the CLIÉ to modify or delete multi-
media elements, however.
If you’re using Intellisync Lite to synchronize your schedule with Outlook,
everything transfers as expected with no unwanted surprises. (For more on
Intellisync Lite and Outlook, see Chapter 3.) The one exception is that
appointment categories aren’t carried over, because the CLIÉ Date Book
doesn’t support them.

So Much To Do
In This Chapter
 Creating To Do entries
 Viewing your priorities
 Separating work and play with categories
 Checking off and deleting To Dos
 Looking at the CLIÉ Organizer enhanced To Do list
 Putting To Dos on the desktop
T
he CLIÉ’s To Do application is a like a cute bunny rabbit. A rabid cute
bunny rabbit, that is. At first glance, it looks like a little, unassuming thing,
but start playing with it, and it’s darn scary. After all, seeing your entire To Do
list — all your work deadlines, all your Honey-Do list items from home, and the
various and sundry other looming tasks — in one place can be intimidating.
One look at all those items together could send you into a nervous breakdown.
You have to write the work report before you can clean the yard, which needs
to be done before you can take the kids to the museum, after which you can
update your calendar, which you have to do before writing the work report. It’s
enough to make you wipe the whole list and replace it with a single entry: Run
screaming from the house.
Don’t do it. Putting all your To Dos in one place is the best possible way to
make sure that the important stuff gets done, and it helps you put the unim-
portant stuff in perspective. In a way, the To Do list is one of the most chal-
lenging games available for the CLIÉ. The goal is to fill it up and then get it
back to the way it looked when you first started using it.
Creating To Dos
To launch the To Do list, press the To Do hard button (note that this button
is absent on the UX and TH series) or tap the To Do icon in the Program
Launcher. The list is mercifully free of To Do items, except perhaps a few
sample tasks, but you’ll soon fix that.

To enter a new To Do item, you can tap the New button at the bottom of the
main To Do screen, but you don’t even have to do that. Just start writing with
the stylus or your keyboard, and the text appears in a new To Do entry.
Creating a To Do is simple, but to get the most out of the application, you
want to add a few details to your entries, such as priority and due dates. 
To do that — you guessed it — just select a To Do item and tap the Details
button at the bottom of the screen. The To Do Item Details window appears.
(See Figure 6-1.)
The first setting on the To Do Item Details window is the Priority number, 
with 1 being the highest priority and 5 the lowest. Just tap the number of your
choice. Choose wisely, grasshopper: This setting is key to efficiently using the
list. When you first start using the To Do list, you’ll probably have lots of 1 and
2 items because, after all, everything is important. However, you can actually
make better use of the application if you save Priority 1 for extremely urgent
items. On the other side of the coin, reserve the 5 for items that you want to
address if you have time but that aren’t critical.
You can actually change the Priority listing right on the main To Do screen.
Just tap the number next to a To Do entry, and a menu pops up. Tap your pri-
ority of choice.
Next in the To Do Item Details window is the Category setting, which is perhaps
more useful here than in any of the other applications. Tap the drop-down
menu arrow and choose a category, or choose Edit Categories to create a new
one. The two initial categories — Business and Personal — are useful, but the
application works best if you create several categories for various social, busi-
ness, and personal tasks. Figure 6-2 illustrates setting up custom categories; I
explain how to do that later in this chapter in the “Using the Category menu”
section. By setting up numerous categories, you can quickly and easily find the
appropriate list when you have a free moment. You also avoid the temptation
to always prioritize work tasks to the exclusion of others.
Figure 6-1:

To Do item’s
details.

Part II: Getting Organized 

The Due Date setting is next in the To Do Item Details window. You can ignore
this field if the task doesn’t have an associated deadline. Otherwise, tap the
down arrow to access the menu for setting the due date. Choices include the
convenient Today, Tomorrow, and One Week Later. If none of those fits, tap
Choose Date and select a due date from the calendar that pop ups.
Although you can set due dates, you can’t set an alarm to go with them, so 
you have to remember to check your To Do list periodically to ensure that you
don’t miss a task deadline. If you want to set alarms for your To Do items, con-
sider purchasing ToDo PLUS from Hands High Software (www.handshigh.com),
which adds alarms and other fun features to the To Do application.
Finally, you can select the Private check box to hide or mask a To Do entry.
See Chapter 18 for more on privacy options.
Notice the Note button in the lower-right corner of the To Do Item Details
window? To Do entries can end up filling multiple lines, and you can use the
Return character (a forward slash in Graffiti 2) to add a line break for easier
readability. However, for lengthy items, consider attaching a note instead
because having a number of multi-line items on the screen means that you
see only a small portion of your list without scrolling. Tapping the Note
button lets you add lengthy descriptions — up to 4,096 characters — of a To
Do item. When an entry has a note, a small Note icon appears next it; you can
tap that from the main To Do screen to read the note.
Adding a phone number to a To Do item is easy. Just select the item, tap the
Menu soft button, and choose Options➪Phone Lookup from the menu that
appears. Tap the phone number that you want to show in your To Do item,
and then tap the Add button to paste the name and number into the current
To Do item.

Chapter 6: So Much To Do

Viewing Your Priorities
Much of the To Do application’s versatility comes from all the different views
that it gives you, allowing you to view your impending tasks by category, due
date, or priority.
Setting preferences
To customize your main To Do screen, tap the Show button at the bottom of
the main To Do screen. The To Do Preferences window appears, as shown in
Figure 6-3. Tap the drop-down menu arrow at the top of the screen to choose
the sorting order. You can sort by
 Priority, Due Date
 Due Date, Priority
 Category, Priority
 Category, Due Date
If your To Do items are often deadline-oriented, the Due Date, Priority option
is probably best. The Priority, Due Date option is a good choice if task prior-
ity is king and due dates aren’t as important to you. Because you can easily
toggle the category view from the main screen, the final two selections are
the least useful.
If you deselect the Show Completed Items check box, your To Do items disap-
pear from the main To Do screen when you check them off as completed. This
helps keep your screen from getting cluttered with completed tasks. You can
always re-enable the feature if you need to see the finished items.
Figure 6-3:
The To Do
Preferences
window 
lets you

how you

task list.
92
Part II: Getting Organized 

Selecting the Show Only Due Items check box displays only tasks due today,
overdue tasks, and tasks without a due date. This might be a good item to
enable if you fall way behind and need to address only urgent deadline issues,
but be careful. With this option enabled, major tasks can sneak up on you
because you can’t see them until the day they’re due.
The Record Completion Date option replaces the Due Date value with the date
that you marked an item as completed. This option is handy for tracking your
progress in completing various tasks, but be aware that after the Due Date
value has been overwritten by the completion date, you can’t get the original
Due Date information back.
If you use Due Dates for tasks, you definitely want to select the Show Due
Dates check box, which adds a column on the main To Do screen containing
the due date. (Figure 6-4 shows this handy option in use.) Otherwise, you
have to select an item and tap the Details button to see when it’s due, which
might allow major tasks to sneak up on you.
The Show Priorities option, which is selected by default, displays the priority
to the left of each item. Turn this off only if you don’t prioritize your tasks.
Finally, the Show Categories option adds a column displaying the category for
each item. This can be useful, but it takes away space from the item descrip-
tion column. With Categories and Due Dates both displayed, most of your To
Dos end up taking up two lines of screen space. Because you can check cate-
gories by displaying all items in a category together, you might want to leave
this one off.
You can also view your To Do items from the Agenda View in Date Book,
which I discuss in Chapter 5. This is handy for trying to find time between
scheduled tasks to address items on your To Do list.

Chapter 6: So Much To Do

Using the Category menu
By default, the To Do list mixes all your pending tasks together on the same
screen. Categorizing To Dos is a great way to keep from getting overwhelmed.
At the office, view just the Business category. When you’re at home on
Saturday morning feeling guilty about watching Speed Racer reruns, check
the Around the House category. Are you planning an overseas trip? Put all the
preparatory tasks in a Vacation category.
But you say that your To Do application doesn’t have an Around the House
category? That it has only Business and Personal? You can fix that by doing
the following:
1. From the main To Do screen, tap the drop-down menu arrow in the
top-right corner of the screen and choose the final option, Edit
Categories.
You see a list of your current categories, along with New, Rename,
Delete, and OK buttons. 
2. Tap New.
The Edit Categories Enter screen appears. (Refer to Figure 6-2.)
3. Enter your new category name, tap OK, and then tap OK on the main
Edit Categories window to return to the main To Do screen.
To view a specific category, tap the drop-down menu arrow in the top-right
corner of the main To Do screen. The category list appears, as shown in
Figure 6-5. Choose the category that you want to view or select Edit
Categories if you need to add or delete categories.
If your CLIÉ has a To Do hard button, pressing it while viewing the To Do
application switches the display to the next category. Press it multiple times
to cycle through the category list.

Category
menu to

Part II: Getting Organized 

Checking Off and Deleting To Dos
The best kind of To Do item is the completed one. When you finish a task, 
marking it as completed couldn’t be easier: Just tap the check box to the left 
of the item description. If you have the Show Completed Items option enabled
in the To Do Preferences window, a check mark appears in the box. (For the
scoop on preferences, see the “Setting preferences” section earlier in this 
chapter.)
If the Show Completed Items option is disabled, your item disappears from
the screen when you check it off. It’s not actually gone, just hidden from 
view.
If you want that To Do item to be really, really gone — not just conveniently
hidden away — you have to delete it. You can rub out your To Dos one by
one or all at once. To delete a single To Do, first tap the description. You can
then delete it by tapping the Menu soft button and choosing Record➪Delete
Item from the menu that appears, or by tapping the Details button at the
bottom of the main To Do screen and then tapping Delete in the To Do Item
Details window.
To delete all your completed To Do items, tap the Menu soft button and
choose Record➪Purge from the menu that appears. The Purge window
appears, as shown in Figure 6-6. Tap OK to clear all your checked-off items
from memory. If you select the Save Archive Copy on PC check box, purged
items remain available in an archive file that you can view in Palm Desktop
for later reference.

96
Part II: Getting Organized 
The CLIÉ Organizer supercharged To Do list
The To Do list in the CLIÉ Organizer application
that was introduced on the TH series offers all
the features of the Palm version and a number
of useful new features, such as outline-like hier-
archies and new views of your data.
The most noticeable difference is the addition of
hierarchies, which turn your list into an outline,
as shown in the following figure. You can set up
tasks as subtasks of other items by moving them
to a lower hierarchy. For example, you might
create an item at the top level called Work on
Job Search with the Update Resume task listed
below it at a lower hierarchy level, and the
Rewrite Resume and Photocopy Resume tasks
might fall below that at the third level. By tapping
the Collapse/Expand icon to the right of an entry,
you can hide or display its subtasks so that you
see only the major project. Just tap it again to
see the individual subtasks. When an item is
hiding subtasks, the Collapse/Expand icon has a
plus sign (+) in the circle. If all tasks are showing,
the icon shows a minus sign (–) in the circle.
The four icons at the bottom-right corner of the
screen give you complete manual control over
sorting your To Do items. These icons move an
item up or down in the list and up and down the
hierarchy. Although you can’t sort by priority or
due date, two new view controls let you easily
alter the screen to show items based on those
settings. The View by Priority icon lets you view
items by priority ranges, from showing just
Priority 1 tasks to showing Priorities 1 through 5.
The View by Task Status icons (labeled Term) let
you toggle on or off overdue tasks, current tasks,
and tasks that haven’t yet started. As with the
standard To Do application, you can view tasks
by category, as well. However, the real power
comes from combining all these options. For
instance, you can choose to view only the over-
due Business tasks of Priorities 1 through 3.
To accommodate the Task Status display, the
CLIÉ Organizer To Do list adds a new Start Date
field. Items that aren’t due to be started yet
show up in a light gray font.
Finally, in addition to attaching standard text
notes, you can attach handwritten Free Notes,
which I cover in Chapter 7, to To Do items.

To Do on the Desktop
The Palm Desktop version of the To Do list is very straightforward because it
has the same options as the CLIÉ version.
Load the Palm Desktop on your computer by choosing Start➪Sony Handheld➪
Palm Desktop for CLIÉ. When the program loads, you find a group of icons
along the left side of the screen that correspond to the organizer applications
on your CLIÉ. Click the To Do icon to get started.
To alter a task’s details, simply click the New To Do button on the bottom 
of the screen to create a new task, or highlight an existing task and click Edit
To Do.
The one significant enhancement is the ability to turn tasks into 
appointments — handy if you want them to show up on a day’s schedule 
or you want to associate an alarm with them. Just click the Date icon on the
left side of the Palm Desktop screen, and then click the To Do button to the
right of your appointment list. Then you can drag a To Do item to a Date Book
appointment time slot. Note that the To Do item and the new Date Book
appointment remain separate entities — deleting the To Do task doesn’t
affect the Date Book appointment that you created from it, and vice versa.
The CLIÉ Organizer for PC version of the To Do list is absolutely identical to
the handheld version. After you master the application on your CLIÉ, you’ll
have no problems using the desktop version.
Outlook users can find their To Do items in Outlook’s Task List view. Outlook
handles tasks quite a bit differently than the CLIÉ. The CLIÉ ignores the Start
Date, % Complete, Alarm, and Owner fields in Outlook, as well as the fields 
on the Details tab. Also, Outlook handles priorities differently. CLIÉ items
with Priority 5 sync to Outlook with a Priority setting of Low. Items that are
Priority 2 through4 sync with Normal Priority. Priority 1 items show High
Priority in Outlook.
To HotSync with Outlook, you need to install Intellisync Lite. You can find out
all about this in Chapter 3.

Notes from a Small PDA: Memo
Pad, CLIÉ Memo, and Free Notes
In This Chapter
 Using the Memo Pad
 Sketching in CLIÉ Memo
 Making Free Notes in CLIÉ Organizer
 Taking notes on your desktop system
T
he programs that I show you in previous chapters excel at organizing
your data. But for many people, the most-used pages in their paper orga-
nizers are the blank ones at the back where you make quick scribbles when
you’re in a hurry. You might jot down a grocery list or copy a phone number
that you’ll transfer to your address book later. Some people substitute sticky
notes for the organizer pages, decorating the edges of their computer moni-
tors with rings of lovely yellow paper squares.
Your CLIÉ includes a couple of programs that are perfect for this sort of note-
taking, as well as for creating or copying short documents that you might
want to bring along for reference.
All Palm OS Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) include the classic Memo Pad
program, which is essentially a basic word processor that’s limited to docu-
ments of about two printed pages in length. Most CLIÉs also include CLIÉ
Memo, which is a basic sketchpad application that’s designed to allow you to
quickly jot down basic notes and drawings. Finally, the new CLIÉ Organizer
suite included with the PEG-TH55 replaces CLIÉ Memo with a much-enhanced
note-taking program called Free Notes. So whether you want to write some-
thing for later transfer to another organizer application or your word proces-
sor, or you just want to jot a quick note for later reference, the CLIÉ has you
covered.

Flip Open the Memo Pad
Memo Pad is a simple text editor that’s designed to allow you to take notes 
or write short documents with Graffiti 2 or your CLIÉ’s keyboard. It’s a very
open-ended program, and the types of information that you can keep with it
are limited only by your imagination. Here are a few things that I use Memo
Pad for:
 Grocery lists
 Want lists for individual stores, such as books that I want to pick up next
time I’m at the bookstore
 Meeting notes
 Registration codes for software I’ve purchased
 My secret macaroni and cheese recipe
 Driving directions
 DVDs to rent
 A list of useful info for business trips in new towns, such as good 
restaurants
 Dial-up modem access numbers for cities that I visit
 A quick-reference of useful phrases when visiting a foreign country
 Fantastic ideas and amazing inspirations that I don’t want to forget
Creating memos
To launch the Memo Pad program, just press the Memo hard button (if your
CLIÉ has one) or tap the Memo Pad icon in the Program Launcher.
Entering a new memo couldn’t be easier. When you launch Memo Pad, the pro-
gram opens to the Memo List view, which is your embarking point to the won-
derful world of memo writing. The official method is to tap the New button at
the bottom of this screen to start a new memo. You don’t even have to do that,
however. If you just start writing or typing, a new memo automatically opens.
The first line in your memo is displayed as a title in Memo List view, so you
can think of this as the title or filename for your memo. You can start by
entering something like Shopping List or Places to Visit in Cannes.
Memos can be up to 4,096 characters, which is about 800 words. If you typi-
cally need to create longer documents than that, I suggest looking into some
of the full-featured handheld word processors such as Documents To Go,
which I cover in Chapters 12.
100
Part II: Getting Organized 

Memo Pad includes some basic text-editing capabilities. You can highlight a
sentence or paragraph by tapping the stylus on the screen and dragging it
across the text just as you would do with a mouse on your desktop computer.
(See Figure 7-1.) You can also highlight a single word by quickly double-tapping
it or highlight an entire line by triple-tapping. When it’s highlighted, you can
tap the Menu soft button and use the Cut and Paste commands on the Edit
menu to delete or move text in your document.
If you’ve used the Notes features in the other organizer applications, such as
Address Book, Date Book, and To Do, you know how to use the Memo Pad
because it works the same way. In fact, if you want to take notes during a
meeting, for instance, you could just create a note attached to the meeting
appointment in Date Book to associate it with the entry. However, this has
the disadvantage that you’ll eventually lose access to that note when your
old meetings are purged from memory. By using Memo Pad, the notes stick
around until you manually delete them.
If you tap the Details button at the bottom of the Memo Entry screen, a window
pops up, giving you the opportunity to set a category for your memo and to
mark an entry as Private. (For more on private records, see Chapter 18.)
If you don’t see an appropriate category for your memo, you can create a new
one by doing the following:
1. Tap the drop-down menu arrow in the Details window and select the
final option, Edit Categories.

You see a list of your current categories, along with New, Rename,
Delete, and OK buttons.
2. Tap New and enter your new category name, and then tap OK to
return to the Details window.
When you finish entering a memo, either tap the Done button at the bottom of
the screen or press the Memo Pad hard button to return to Memo List view.
Organizing and deleting memos
When you start accumulating memos, Memo List view can start to become a
bit overwhelming. Memo Pad offers a few different methods for organizing
your data.
Like the To Do list and Address Book, Memo Pad supports categories. Just
define a category for each new entry (see the previous section), and you can
easily switch between business, personal, and other memos by pressing the
Memo Pad hard button repeatedly or by selecting a new category from the
drop-down list box in the top-right corner of the screen.
Memo Pad offers two options for sorting your memos. By default, the pro-
gram is set to sort entries alphabetically. As I discuss in the previous section,
the first line of your memo is used as the title, so be sure to include appropri-
ate info on the top line if you plan to use this option.
You can also manually sort memos. To activate manual sorting, tap the Menu
soft button and choose Options➪Preferences from the menu that appears.
The Memo Preferences window opens, as shown in Figure 7-2. Tap the drop-
down menu arrow next to the Sort By option and choose Manual. (To go back
to alphabetic sorting, follow the same steps, but choose Alphabetic from the
drop-down menu.) With Manual Sorting active, you can move items in the
memo list by holding the stylus down on them and dragging them up or down
the list.
If you’re sorting memos alphabetically, and you want to put an important
memo at the top, just start the first line with a number. Those memos appear
at the top of the list.
To delete a memo, tap it in the memo list to open it. Then either tap the Menu
soft button and choose Record➪Delete Memo from the menu that appears or
first tap the Details button at the bottom of the screen and then tap the Delete
button in the window that pops up. Whichever method you choose, a confirma-
tion dialog asks you to verify your decision. Tap OK to delete the memo. If you
want to keep a backup of the deleted memo in Palm Desktop on your desktop
system, make sure to select the Save Archive Copy on PC check box.

Part II: Getting Organized 

Sketching in CLIÉ Memo
CLIÉ Memo is a very simple application that’s designed to allow you to quickly
jot notes without having to worry about character recognition or typing skills.
It literally acts like a piece of paper. On the upside, this means that you can also
use it to create quick sketches, such as maps or diagrams. On the downside,
the pages don’t take much advantage of their digital format. You can search
only titles, not information contained in the memos, and you can’t turn your
scribbled text into standard computer text.
For anything more sophisticated than a quick sketch, check out the Photo
Editor application, which is included with most CLIÉ models. (Chapter 8 has
more on Photo Editor.)
Creating a sketch
When you start CLIÉ Memo, it opens on a blank page where you can start
sketching immediately. To create something more advanced than a simple
black-and-white sketch, check out the toolbar across the top of the screen. 
In Figure 7-3, from left to right, are the following tools:
 Pen Weight: Three line thicknesses are available.
 Pen Color: The program defaults to just three colors, but you can use up
to 256 colors. I tell you how in the following section.

 Undo: This removes the most recent pen stroke.
 Redo: This places a pen stroke back where it was if you decide to undo
the undo.
 Delete Page: This deletes the current page.
 Add New Page: This inserts a new, blank page at the end of the docu-
ment and takes you to it.
 Create New Document: This closes the current sketch and creates an
entirely new document.
 Return to Memo List: This takes you to Memo List view.
Above the toolbar, you find a memo title and drop-down list box. If you don’t
enter a memo title, the CLIÉ uses the current date and time as the title.
Organizing memos
Memos can have multiple pages, and on some CLIÉ models, you can even
shuffle pages between documents. (Not all CLIÉs offer this feature.) To find
out whether your CLIÉ can manage the pages shuffle, tap the Return to Memo

List icon. If, when you’re back at Memo List view, you see a third icon with a
pair of scissors on it to the right of the Delete Page icon, you can use it to
delete or move pages. Just highlight a memo, tap the Scissors icon, and choose
Delete Pages or Move Pages from the menu that appears. Select the page that
you want to move or delete. If you’re deleting a page, tap the Delete button at
the bottom of the screen to remove the selected pages. If you’re moving a page,
tap Move Pages and then tap the memo that you want to move the page to.
Finally, tap a page in the existing memo (see Figure 7-4) to place the new page
before that page.
You can change the memo sorting order by tapping Date or Title at the top 
of the screen. Tapping Date once sorts by date with the most recent memos
first; tapping it a second time sorts with the oldest memos first. Tapping Title
once sorts the memos in alphabetical order; tap it again to sort in reverse
alphabetical order.
Just like Memo Pad, CLIÉ Memo supports categories, so you can choose to
view, say, just your business-related memos by tapping the drop-down list
box in the top-right corner of the screen and choosing Business — or what-
ever category you created for your memo.
CLIÉ Memos also show up in the CLIÉ Viewer application, which I cover in the
following chapter. CLIÉ Viewer lets you visually select memos from thumbnails.
You can view the memos but not edit them in this application.
To delete a memo from the memo list, just highlight it and tap the Delete Page
icon at the top of the memo list screen. (Refer to Figure 7-4.)

Chapter 7: Notes from a Small PDA: Memo Pad, CLIÉ Memo, and Free Notes

106
Part II: Getting Organized 
Versatile Free Notes
Free Notes is part of the CLIÉ Organizer appli-
cation that’s included with the PEG-TH55. It’s
similar to CLIÉ Memo (which is omitted on units
that include CLIÉ Organizer) in that it lets you
scribble text or make drawings with the stylus.
It’s much more versatile, however, in that it
allows you to include standard CLIÉ text in
addition to handwritten notes; to drag and drop
photos, stills, movies, and voice memos onto
your notes; and to attach Free Notes to entries
in the other CLIÉ Organizer modules, such as
Address and Date Book.
Sometimes a picture really is worth a thousand
words, so take a look at the Free Notes module
in the following figure to see exactly what Free
Notes can do for you.
Directly below the page viewing area is the
Stickers/Contents area. Here you can scroll
through all the photos, movies, and voice
memos in your CLIÉ and drag them onto the
page. When they’re on the page, tapping them
launches the original file, playing the video or
audio file or displaying the photo on the full
screen. You can use this to, for instance, gather
photos and videos from a trip into one central
location where you can easily access them and
show them off.
You can use the text box in the lower-left corner
to toggle the Stickers/Contents area to display
stickers instead of your CLIÉ’s multimedia con-
tent. You can drag the tiny icons onto your
sketch to spruce it up or categorize it.
Unlike CLIÉ Memo, the Free Notes module lets
you enter text with Graffiti 2 or a keyboard, in
addition to scrawling with your stylus. Note that
even though this text is editable, it doesn’t
show up in a Find operation.
Free Notes is the only note-taking module on
the CLIÉ that lets you associate an alarm with a
memo. This is really handy for making sure you
don’t forget to revisit that note you jotted down.
Just tap the Information icon, which opens the
Page Details screen, and then tap the Alarm
check box and choose a date and time for the
alarm.

Customizing CLIÉ Memo
To tweak your CLIÉ Memo settings, tap the Menu soft button and choose
Options➪Preferences from the menu that appears. You find the following four
choices, as shown in Figure 7-5:
 Launch Screen: Every time you start the program, it opens by default to
a new, blank page. If you change the setting from New Note to Latest, it
instead opens to the most recent memo.
 Date: This option controls the date setting for the memo’s filename. By
default, CLIÉ Memo records the date that the memo was created. If you
change the setting to Modification, the date changes every time you
modify a memo.
 Pen Color: This is the most useful of the settings. By default, the pro-
gram offers you just three colors to use — that’s fewer than you’d get
from a 1978 Apple II! Change the setting to 256 Colors to get a more
useful palette to work with.
 Edit Mode: Standard mode is a 1X magnification of your document.
Detail mode zooms in and lets you edit the screen at a higher magnifica-
tion, allowing for better detail.
Notes on Your Desktop System
Support for the CLIÉ’s various memo functions on the desktop system is a
mixed bag. Memo Pad is duplicated exactly, CLIÉ Memo is missing entirely,
and Free Notes has desktop support that’s a bit quirky.

Chapter 7: Notes from a Small PDA: Memo Pad, CLIÉ Memo, and Free Notes

Syncing with Palm Desktop
Palm Desktop includes a Memo module that parrots the CLIÉ Memo Pad’s
functions. To enter or edit on your desktop system, load the Palm Desktop by
choosing Start➪Sony Handheld➪Palm Desktop for CLIÉ. When the program
loads, you notice a group of icons along the left side of the screen that corre-
spond to the organizer applications on your CLIÉ. Click the Memo icon to get
things started.
To create a new memo, just click the New Memo icon or start typing. You can
do quick edits on a memo by clicking it in the memo list, and then altering
the text on the right side of the screen. To open the memo in its own window,
select it from the memo list and click the Edit Memo button.
At the top of the screen, you find drop-down menus that let you choose
which categories to display, as well as whether to sort alphabetically or by
using the order of memos on the handheld.
Note that CLIÉ Memo drawings can be viewed only on your handheld. There’s
no provision for transferring them to your desktop system.
Syncing with Outlook
Intellisync Lite supports only the Memo Pad application, so Outlook users
can’t synchronize data from CLIÉ Memo or Free Notes.
Memos are synchronized with the Notes module in Outlook. This module
uses a simple paradigm with no fields or other sections — just an on-screen
window that looks just like a sticky note — so no data is lost in moving
memos back and forth to the CLIÉ.
Just two minor caveats go with transferring to Outlook Notes. First, the Memo
Pad application doesn’t allow files larger than 4,096 characters, but the Outlook
Notes module allows much longer documents. Any documents that are longer
than the CLIÉ’s limit can transfer, but they get cut off at 4,096 characters.
Also, Intellisync Lite doesn’t transfer categories. That means your Outlook
memos will appear in the Unfiled category on your CLIÉ, and vice versa.
108
Part II: Getting Organized 

109
Chapter 7: Notes from a Small PDA: Memo Pad, CLIÉ Memo, and Free Notes
Syncing Free Notes
CLIÉ Organizer for PC supports the Free Notes
module in a surprisingly full-featured manner.
When you click the Edit button on the right side
of the CLIÉ Organizer for PC screen with a Free
Note selected, you’re essentially presented
with a duplicate of your CLIÉ’s screen. You can
draw on it with the mouse, create text with the
keyboard, and drag and drop graphics and
icons onto it.
Unfortunately, you can’t directly drag pictures,
movies, or recordings from your desktop system
to a Free Note. Also, the support for these files
on your CLIÉ is a bit quirky if they’re stored on a
Memory Stick. Just viewing notes isn’t a prob-
lem — you see the small icon versions of these
files on the desktop system. If you want to add
new media files to a Free Note, display the full-
screen versions of photos on the page, or play
linked voice recordings or movies, your CLIÉ’s
Memory Stick must be mounted as a disk drive
on your desktop system by using the Data
Import feature (see Chapter 14 for details), and
the Memory Stick drive must be assigned by
using the Tools/Options menu item. Also, you
need to run the Data Import program on your
CLIÉ before you begin editing a note. After you
master this procedure, it all works fine, but the
whole process is convoluted enough that you’re
likely to just grab your CLIÉ and make the
changes there.

T
he CLIÉ is a bigger attention hound than a politician 
at a fund-raiser. It’s always showing off. Even the most
basic CLIÉs run around displaying high-resolution photos
and showing how they can run games that used to take a
six-foot-tall arcade machine to play. The audio-equipped
units dazzle you with their ability to play movies or act as
a handheld jukebox. They’re shameless.
This part covers all the fun stuff that you can do with 
your CLIÉ. You find out how to view and shoot photos and
movies on the go and how to transfer your favorite music
files to the CLIÉ. I give a rundown on the very best games
for any kind of gamer, and the entertainment extravaganza
wraps up with a look at eBooks and audiobooks.

f the CLIÉ were a superhero, it would be Captain Multimedia. (And it 
would probably hire a PR agent to come up with a better name.) With its
high-resolution screen, brilliant color, and speedy processor, the CLIÉ is an
excellent tool for viewing pictures and even movies (more on movies in the
following chapter) anywhere you go.
The included photo software differs by CLIÉ model. All CLIÉs include the CLIÉ
Viewer application, and because all currently available models now feature
built-in cameras, they also feature the CLIÉ Camera application.
The wild-card applications are included with older CLIÉ models, as well as
the high-end UX series units. These include the PhotoStand slideshow pro-
gram and the Photo Editor paint program.
All these applications are built in, so the easiest way to determine whether
your CLIÉ is equipped with them is to check the Program Launcher for their
icons. And don’t forget that if you have a TH-series device, you can also view
images directly from the CLIÉ Organizer.
An Eye on CLIÉ Viewer
CLIÉ Viewer is an all-purpose multimedia manager. It not only lets you view
photos, movies, and CLIÉ Memo files, but also lets you move media between
handheld memory and a Memory Stick, rotate images, select them for print-
ing, and more. It even plays back Voice Recorder audio files.

114
Part III: Multimedia and Entertainment 
Tap the CLIÉ Viewer icon in the Program Launcher to get started. The pro-
gram pops up and displays all the supported media files on your CLIÉ
whether they’re in main memory or on a Memory Stick. Files that are stored
on your Memory Stick have a small Memory Stick icon overlaid on their
thumbnail.
Note that CLIÉ Viewer offers different options on each unit, depending on
which other applications are installed, so you may not see some of the icons
depicted in Figure 8-1.
Going from left to right, the top row of icons that you see in the upper-right
corner of the screen offer you the following functions:
 Send to Other Program: Typically, pressing the icon with the drop-down
menu arrow gives you a choice of Photo Editor or CLIÉ Album. After you
select which program you want to send files to, select the photos that
you want to transfer.
 Send to CLIÉ Mail: Select a file to attach to a new CLIÉ Mail e-mail 
message.
 Send to PhotoStand: Select this, and then select the images that you
want to send to PhotoStand, the CLIÉ’s slideshow program.
 Delete Files: Tap the trash can and select the files that you want to
remove.
The lower row of icons in the upper-right corner of the screen is used to filter
out what gets displayed in the main part of the screen. From left to right, the
icons represent photos, movies, memos, and audio recordings. To remove

any of those types of files from the display, just tap the icon, which changes it
from blue (selected) to gray (unselected); tap it again to add them back to
the list. If you want to see everything, just keep all the icons in this row
selected.
The CLIÉ Viewer program also offers a number of functions on its Data drop-
down menu. Just tap the Menu soft button to bring up the menu choices that
are illustrated in Figure 8-2.
The commands are
 Send: Available only on the CLIÉs that are equipped with Bluetooth wire-
less capabilities, this option lets you send a file via Bluetooth to another
PDA or computer, or via Short Messaging System (SMS) to a cell phone.
 Beam: Send a file via an infrared beam.
 Rotate: Rotate an image to better fit it on the CLIÉ’s screen. Note that
this command works only with photos.
 Print: This doesn’t actually print a photo, but marks it for printing next
time you place your CLIÉ’s Memory Stick in a printer that’s equipped
with a Memory Stick slot.
 Move: Move a file to main memory, a Memory Stick, or (on the UX
series) to Internal Media memory.
 Copy: Copy a file to main memory, a Memory Stick, or (on the UX series)
to Internal Media memory, but without deleting the original.
One other menu choice is tucked away on the Options menu. The Preferences
of CLIÉ Viewer command, though oddly translated, lets you sort images by
either the date that they were taken or by the date that the file was created.

To view or play a file, tap it with your stylus or use the jog dial to scroll
through the thumbnails and press the jog dial when the image you want is
highlighted.
Viewing still images
When viewing still images, you see a row of icons across the bottom of the
screen, as shown in Figure 8-3.
Left to right, the icons perform the following functions:
 Display Full Screen: This removes all the icons and borders. Tap the
image to get the icons back.
 Return to Thumbnail View: This exits the file-viewing mode and returns
you to the thumbnail file list.
 Zoom In: Each time you tap the icon, the image is further magnified.
 Zoom Out: Zoom out to reduce the size of the image on the screen. Each
tap zooms out further.
 Show File Information: This displays the filename, the date that the file
was created, the dimensions of the image, and how large the file is in
bytes.
You can also use the jog dial to zoom in and out on an image. Drag the stylus
around a zoomed image to scroll it.

See the following chapter for explanations of the Movie Viewer controls.
Getting the Shot with CLIÉ Camera
By early 2004, all the Sony CLIÉ models were equipped with built-in cameras.
However, don’t toss out your five-megapixel optical zoom camera now that
you have your CLIÉ. The CLIÉ cameras offer low resolution (all current models
The CLIÉ Organizer built-in Viewer
Although units with built-in CLIÉ Organizer soft-
ware include CLIÉ Viewer, you don’t need it for
basic viewing. CLIÉ Organizer includes a Viewer
tab that duplicates most of the functionality of
the standalone CLIÉ Viewer program.
On the main screen, you can find an additional
icon at the bottom-left corner, evident in the 
following figure. You can use this icon to toggle
between the thumbnail view and a text-only list

are one-third-megapixel VGA cameras, though some earlier models have had
high-resolution cameras), no flash, and a basic digital zoom that I recommend
you ignore.
That said, the camera is still a wonderful perk because the most useful
camera is the one you have with you. You probably don’t carry a digital
camera with you 24/7, but you likely do carry your CLIÉ quite often, and
you’ll be glad for even low-resolution photos when unexpected opportunities
come up: the kids doing something cute; somebody denting your car; or Gina
Gershon saying, “Sure, I’ll take a picture with you.” The camera works well
outdoors or in bright light, and the low resolution is fine for e-mail, Web
pages, and 4 x 6 and smaller prints.
To launch CLIÉ Camera, tap the CLIÉ Camera icon in the Program Launcher
or just press the Capture button on your CLIÉ. When the program is running,
press the Capture hard button or its on-screen counterpart to take a photo.
The CLIÉ Camera controls, shown in Figure 8-4, are relatively simple. Along
the thin bar in the middle of the screen is the word Still. If your CLIÉ includes
the Movie Recorder application, tapping this switches the mode from Still to
Movie Recording; otherwise, it does nothing.
Figure 8-4:
The CLIÉ
Camera
interface.

119
Chapter 8: Picturing the World with Your CLIÉ
To the right of Still is the Zoom control. The best advice here is to pretend
that it doesn’t exist. The CLIÉ features a digital zoom, which simulates zoom-
ing by doubling the size of the pixels in the center of the screen. That means
the already-low-resolution image is going to get extremely blocky at 2X zoom
and is going to turn into a fuzzy mess at 3X zoom.
To the right of the Zoom control is the brightness reading, represented by ±0.
I cover how to adjust that in just a moment.
On the wide bar in the middle of the screen is the Wrench icon, which takes
you to the Camera Preferences screen. To the right of the Wrench icon is a
status display, showing, among other things, the File Number counter, resolu-
tion (640 x 480, for example), and an icon representing whether the image will
be stored in main memory or on a Memory Stick when you save. The Play
arrow takes you to CLIÉ Viewer to see your handiwork, and the next icon —
the one that looks kind of like a clock with just one hand — sets the next shot
to be taken on a ten-second delay. Finally, the Capture button takes a photo.
To tweak how your CLIÉ captures images, tap the Wrench icon. This takes
you to the Camera Preferences screen, as shown in Figure 8-5. However, some
options may vary slightly on different CLIÉ models.
Figure 8-5:

120
Part III: Multimedia and Entertainment 
The various options are as follows:
 Save To: This option has three settings. You probably want to leave it
set to PriorityMS, which saves to a Memory Stick (if one is present) or to
the handheld’s memory if not. You could also set this option to Memory
Stick, Handheld, or (on the UX series only) Internal Media memory.
 Size: This option controls the resolution of the image. If you plan to use
the image on a computer or print it, leave Size at its highest setting,
which is 640 x 480 on most models. If you’re going to be displaying the
image only on your CLIÉ, you can save memory by dropping the resolu-
tion to 320 x 480 (which is the full screen on large-screen models) or
lower.
 File Numbering: Series is the default setting. If you change the setting to
Reset, the File Number counter is reset to 1.
 Shutter Sound: Here you get a choice of three different shutter sounds.
 Shutter Sound Vol: This option lets you adjust the volume of the shutter
sound.
 Flicker Control: You can set this to 60 Hz (the default for North
America) or 50 Hz to eliminate screen flicker. In some countries, lights
are powered at 50 Hz frequencies, so your liquid crystal display (LCD)
camera screen might flicker if you take your CLIÉ with you on a trip.
Setting the CLIÉ screen to 50 Hz solves that problem.
 Brightness: You can use this option to adjust the brightness of the 
current shot.
 White Balance: This option controls how the camera handles adjusting
for different lighting types. Normally, it works fine on Auto, but if you’re
seeing whites with a bluish or greenish tone, try using one of the other
settings. Two indoor settings are available, as well as an outdoor setting.
 Effect: With this option, you can apply special effects to your image. All
CLIÉs offer B&W and Sepia (which gives an old-photo, brownish look)
settings. Some models also offer Neg. Art (which makes it look like a
photo negative) and Solarize (a vivid, surreal look). If you have a photo
editing program on your desktop system, you’re probably better off
ignoring these options and adding effects later.
After you make your settings, just tap OK to return to the Camera screen.
To get the best shots with your CLIÉ, shoot with as much light as possible.
With a couple of exceptions (the PEG-NX80V’s assist light and the PEG-NZ90’s
flash), CLIÉ cameras don’t include any type of illumination. Shots in the dark
generally turn out grainy. I recommend shooting outdoors or with your sub-
jects facing a bright light. Also, be careful of backlighting, which can flare in
the background and also cause your subjects to be dark.

121
Chapter 8: Picturing the World with Your CLIÉ
Transferring CLIÉ Photos
To move images to and from your desktop system, you need to mount your
Memory Stick as a disk drive. You can do this in two ways. The fastest is to
purchase an inexpensive Universal Serial Bus (USB) Memory Stick card
reader for your computer. Plug one of these in and pop in your Memory Stick,
and it acts just like a small hard drive. You access the files on your Memory
Stick by double-clicking the icon in My Computer, the same way you would 
if the files were on a hard drive or CD-ROM. If you don’t have a USB reader,
you can actually convert your CLIÉ into one by running the Data Import
application.
I cover Data Import and copying files in more detail in Chapter 14. In a cap-
sule, though, you simply run the Data Import application on your CLIÉ, con-
nect your CLIÉ’s data cable or cradle to your computer, and tap the Connect
icon on the Data Import screen. Your CLIÉ’s Memory Stick now appears as a
drive on your computer.
If possible, always save photos that you take with CLIÉ camera on a Memory
Stick because the CLIÉ doesn’t include software for transferring images from
handheld memory to your computer. If you do have an image in handheld
memory but no available Memory Stick, one way to transfer the image is to
send it as an attachment in CLIÉ Mail.
If you’re running an older version of Windows, you may need to manually
copy files to and from the Memory Stick drive by browsing the drive in My
Computer or by using an add-on application such as Photoshop Album 2.0.
If you’re using Windows XP, inserting the Memory Stick into the drive or
launching Data Import brings up the Removable Disk dialog window, which
gives you a number of choices. (See Figure 8-6.) You can choose the Open
Folder to View Files option if you want to manually copy the files to your
desktop system, or choose the Copy Pictures To a Folder on My Computer
option if you want to use the XP built-in Image File Transfer wizard.
To copy images from your desktop system to your CLIÉ, Sony includes an
easy-to-use application called Image Converter. This application supports all
the major graphic formats and can also convert movie files to formats that
are playable on your CLIÉ.
Copying pictures with Image Converter is a snap. Just start up the program
on your desktop system, wait for the application window to come up on
screen, and then drag and drop the pictures that you want copied to the
window. (You can also click the window’s Add to List button to call up an
Open dialog box for selecting the files that you want copied.) After you build
a list of files to convert, click the Output to Memory Stick button to copy the
files to your Memory Stick card.

If you’re working within Image Converter, and you want to visually select
images to copy — handy when your photos have helpful names like
DSC03521.jpg — click the Add to List button, and then click the View Menu
icon in the Open dialog box’s toolbar. Choose Thumbnails from the drop-
down list, and the view changes from a text list to a set of thumbnail images.
See Figure 8-7 for an illustration.
Note that you don’t need to use Image Converter. If your shots are in JPEG
format already, you can simply drag them to the DCIM folder on your Memory
Stick. The advantage of using Image Converter is that it can shrink photos for
CLIÉ display purposes, so they take up less space and load faster.

123
Chapter 8: Picturing the World with Your CLIÉ
If you choose File➪Settings from the Image Converter main menu, you see
the Settings window that’s shown in Figure 8-8. This window lets you choose
a size and quality level for your image and rotate them for proper orientation
for when you transfer them to your CLIÉ. For large-screen CLIÉs, consider set-
ting a width of 480 pixels. For square-screen units, set the width to 320 pixels
unless you want to be able to zoom in on the image.
The Rest of the Toolbox
Although the applications that I describe in this section are missing on the
newest models, some photo-related tools are included with the UX series 
and older CLIÉs, and they’re worth a look. If your CLIÉ doesn’t include
PhotoStand and Photo Editor, don’t despair. With over 20,000 Palm OS add-
on programs available, you can easily find third-party replacements that are
even more full-featured.
PhotoStand
This is a slick slideshow program that’s good for showing off sets of images
or for setting up a slideshow to run on your CLIÉ while it sits in its cradle.
1. Tap the PhotoStand icon in the Program Launcher.
The main screen of the PhotoStand application appears.
2. Tap the New button at the bottom of the PhotoStand main screen.
A group of thumbnail images appears in a new screen.

3. Tap the check boxes next to the images that you want to include in
your show, and then tap OK.
The PhotoStand Settings screen appears, as shown in Figure 8-9.
4. Enter a title for your Slideshow.
This can be anything you want, but it should be easily recognizable to
you when you’re showing off pictures a year or two down the road.
5. Choose a transition effect.
Tap the Effect drop-down menu arrow to choose whether to set a wipe
or transition between photos, or choose to overlay your images with a
clock, turning your CLIÉ into perhaps the coolest (and perhaps most
expensive) desk clock ever, as shown in Figure 8-10.
6. Set the Display Interval.
Tap the Display Interval drop-down menu arrow to choose how long you
want each image to appear on the screen.
7. Finish creating your slideshow by setting the miscellaneous options.
Below the Display Interval setting, you find the following settings, which
you can adjust to your preference:
• Loop: Check this if you want the slideshow to repeat automatically.
• Autorun: The slideshow will launch automatically when you insert
this Memory Stick into your CLIÉ.

8. Tap the Preview button to make sure that your slideshow works as
you expected, or tap the Save button to save your file and exit the
PhotoStand settings screen.
You’re returned to the main screen.
9. To view your slideshow, simply tap the slideshow name and tap the
Play button to launch the show.
Alas, I’m still waiting on Sony to release a Memory Stick that pops 
popcorn.
Photo Editor
Replacing the fancier CLIÉ Paint program, which was included on early CLIÉ
models, Photo Editor is an extremely simple image touch-up program. It fea-
tures just a few editing tools, as shown in Figure 8-11, but it’s fun for doing
goofy stuff like adding a beard to a picture of your grandfather.
For more sophisticated photo-editing operations, such as fixing red-eye,
sharpening images, and so on, you need to use a desktop editing application.
But for quick doodles and fun retouching, Photo Editor fits the bill.

 Finding fabulous flicks
I
f you thought viewing still photos on your CLIÉ was impressive, imagine
carrying a copy of The Lord of the Rings or the latest episode of The
Simpsons with you to watch next time you’re on a plane or stuck in a waiting
room. Better still, some CLIÉ models don’t just allow you to watch movies —
they let you make your own, as well.
Pocket Spielberg: Movie Recorder
Some camera-equipped CLIÉ models can shoot not only stills, but movies as
well. Would-be cinematographers can find movie capabilities in the UX series
and in the older NX series CLIÉs. Unfortunately, the TH and TJ series models
omit the Movie Recorder application, although I wouldn’t be surprised to 
see third-party alternatives available soon, such as an updated version of 
the excellent Vivid video capture program currently available for the older
PEG-NR70V from www.clievideo.com.
Although the CLIÉ can play back movies at full-screen 320 x 480 resolution,
capture is limited to a postage-stamp-sized 160 x 112 pixels. These little flicks
are fine for playback on the CLIÉ or even on your desktop system, but this
isn’t a feature that you want to use to record priceless memories with or to
create flicks for TV playback.

The Movie Recorder interface, shown in Figure 9-1, is very similar to the CLIÉ
Camera interface, which I cover in Chapter 8. The same tips apply for using
this application: Make sure that your subjects are well-lit and avoid the digi-
tal zoom feature because it makes your subjects blurry.
Unless you’re using a UX-series CLIÉ, which includes special additional
Internal Media memory that acts just like a Memory Stick (see Chapter 14 for
the full scoop on various memory types), you must have a Memory Stick in
your CLIÉ to use the Movie Recorder program. The CLIÉ can’t save movies in
the CLIÉ’s standard internal memory.
You use the Wrench to access the Preferences screen. To the right of the little
wrench is the status display, which tells you the elapsed time, whether your
movie file is being saved to Memory Stick or to the Internal Media memory
found on the UX series, and how much time is left for your recording. Pressing
the icon to the right of the status display takes you to the Movie Player —
where you can view the rushes for your blockbuster epic — and the Record
icon is there to punch when you want to begin filming.
You can also press the Capture hard button to begin recording.
The Preferences screen, shown in Figure 9-2, offers the following options:
 Save To: This option is present only on the UX series, which includes
Internal Media memory. You probably want to leave it set to PriorityMS,
which saves to Memory Stick, if one is present, or to Internal Media
memory otherwise. You can also specify Memory Stick or Internal Media
memory.

Part III: Multimedia and Entertainment 

 Bit Rate: This option lets you adjust the bit rate of your recording, which
is basically how much data is stored for each second of recording.
Setting to a lower value gives you additional recording time, but given
the general low resolution of CLIÉ video recordings, I recommend leav-
ing it set to its highest setting (V:256), if possible.
 Time Limit: You can limit the recording time to a variety of values rang-
ing from 3 seconds to 60 minutes.
 File Number: Series is the default setting. If you change the setting to
Reset, the File Number counter is reset to 1.
 Capture Sound Vol: This sets the microphone sensitivity. For most pur-
poses, you want to leave it set to High.
 Brightness: This option allows you to adjust the brightness of the cur-
rent shot. Turning it up can help brighten the footage in a dark situation,
but it causes your recording to be somewhat grainy.
 White Balance: This option controls how the camera handles adjusting
for different lighting types. Normally, it works fine on Auto, but if you’re
seeing whites with a bluish or greenish tone, try one of the other set-
tings. Two indoor settings are available, as well as an outdoor setting.
 Effect: This option applies special effects to your image. All CLIÉs offer
B&W and Sepia (which gives an old-West, brownish look) settings. Some
models also offer Neg. Art (which makes it look like a photo negative)
and Solarize (a vivid, surreal look). If you have a video editing program
on your desktop system, you’re probably better off ignoring these
options and adding effects later.
After you make your settings, just tap OK to return to the Movie Recorder
main screen.

Chapter 9: Hollywood on the Go

You can transfer movies from Memory Stick to your desktop system by using
a Universal Serial Bus (USB) Memory Stick reader or via the Data Import util-
ity. (See Chapter 14 for details.) You can find the files saved to your Memory
Stick in the \MQ_ROOT\100MQV01 folder. Although they have an MQV file exten-
sion, they’re actually QuickTime files. After you move them to your desktop
system, you can change the extension from MQV to MOV, which gives you the
ability to play the files by double-clicking them. Otherwise, you can use the
Open command in the QuickTime Player File menu to open the files.
Although a version of the QuickTime Player is included on your CLIÉ’s
Installation CD, I’d suggest visiting www.quicktime.com to download and
install the latest version. Apple frequently updates the player with new 
features and bug fixes.
In addition to recording movies, you can turn your CLIÉ into a Webcam. 
A slick new application called Vivid Webcam from the folks at www.clie
video.com lets you use your CLIÉ’s camera for video chats in conjunction
with your Windows system. See Chapter 22 for more details.
Viewing Movies on Your CLIÉ
All current CLIÉ models ship with CLIÉ Viewer, which I cover in Chapter 8.
This multimedia hub lets you select movies for playback with a single tap.
The UX series also ships with the older Movie Player application, but it dupli-
cates the same functionality that’s also found in CLIÉ Viewer.
Chapter 8 shows you how to get CLIÉ Viewer up and running. (Okay, if you
don’t want to flip back to that chapter, here’s the scoop: Tap the CLIÉ Viewer
icon in the Program Launcher, and voilà, you’re there.) To start a movie in
CLIÉ Viewer, simply find it in the display of the CLIÉ Viewer main screen, and
then tap it with your stylus or use the jog dial to scroll to the movie, and then
press it to start playback.
When viewing movies, as shown in Figure 9-3, the controls from top to
bottom are
 Play: Starts the movie.
 Stop: Stops the movie.
 Use Full Screen for Playback: This eliminates the distracting icons and
gray borders on the screen.
130
Part III: Multimedia and Entertainment 

 Stretch Movie to Fill Screen: Stretches smaller movie files so they fill
the screen instead of being surrounded by black letterbox bars.
 Volume Control: Turns the volume up and down.
 Return to Movie List: Exits the movie viewing screen and returns you to
your list of movies.
Note that the position of these controls varies depending on the screen size
and the orientation of the CLIÉ that you’re using. Also note the tiny Battery
icon to the left of the Movie List icon on some units, which is handy for
making sure that you don’t completely run down your battery while watching
The Matrix.
To convert a movie on your desktop system for playback with CLIÉ Viewer,
you use the Image Converter application, which I cover in Chapter 8. Image
Converter can convert and transfer QuickTime, AVI, and MPEG-1 format files
to CLIÉ format. (Unfortunately, it can’t convert MPEG-2 format, which is the
format used by DVDs.) Image Converter offers four quality levels for con-
verted films, ranging from Long Mode, which stores 130 minutes on a 128MB
Memory Stick, through High Quality, which stores about a half-hour in the
same space. A High Plus Quality mode is also available, but it creates huge
files, offers little noticeable improvement on the CLIÉ screen, and isn’t com-
patible with all CLIÉ units. Standard mode — 60 minutes per 128MB — is a
good choice if you have a large Memory Stick.

Add-On Movie Utilities
The CLIÉ Viewer does a great job of offering smooth playback and compact
movies. But at times, you might want to play other movie formats or convert
files from formats that aren’t supported directly by the CLIÉ. Here are some
of the top third-party utilities to consider:
 MMPlayer: This full-featured video playback program lets your CLIÉ play
files in the popular DivX and MPEG-4 file formats directly on your CLIÉ
with no conversion necessary. For more info, go to www.mmplayer.com.
 Kinoma: The most popular movie player for the Palm OS, Kinoma 
offers excellent performance, fantastic image quality, and small file 
sizes. The player is free, but you need to buy the converter to create
your own movies. The player and converter are both available at www.
kinoma.com.
 TealMovie: Although this is an older program, TealMovie offers some 
of the fastest, smoothest playback that you can get on the CLIÉ, and
numerous movies are available online in TealMovie format. TealMovie 
is available at www.tealpoint.com.
 Movie2MemCard: This movie converter supports a wider variety of for-
mats than Image Converter and offers you excellent control over the
final size of your video files. Although it’s aimed at Pocket PC users, the
DivX files that it creates can be played by MMPlayer. You can find it at
www.kvmd.com.
Sources for Movies
Okay, so your CLIÉ is a great video player. But a visit to your local video store
in search of videos to watch on a CLIÉ is going to be about as fruitful as
trying to find a copy of Spider-Man on a Betamax tape. With a little ingenuity,
though, you can use a variety of methods for getting movies onto your CLIÉ:
 Record movies yourself. Add a TV tuner card to your desktop system
and record movies right on your computer, and then convert them for
playback on your desktop system. The best package that I’ve found for
this is the SnapStream Beyond TV 3, which offers TiVo-like recording
functionality and the unique ShowSqueeze feature, which automatically
converts movies into a format and size compatible with your CLIÉ. You
can find information on Beyond TV 3 at www.snapstream.com. And if
you have a Sony computer with a video recording card, a plug-in is avail-
able on your CLIÉ Installation CD for the GigaPocket video recording
software that allows you to create files in CLIÉ–compatible format.
132
Part III: Multimedia and Entertainment 

 Download movies online. You can find movie trailers, music videos,
noncommercial films, and many other movies online. Sites to check out
include www.sonypictures.com/mobile/handheld for CLIÉ–format
movies, www.tealpoint.com/movies.htm for TealMovie flicks, and
pocketmovies.net and www.divx.com for movies that can be con-
verted with Image Converter.
 Convert home movies. If you have a digital camcorder and video-editing
software, you can take the home movies that you’ve created on your
desktop system and use Image Converter to transfer them to your CLIÉ.
 Record movies directly to Memory Stick. The Sony PEGA-VR100K,
shown in Figure 9-4, is a small, solid-state video recorder that records 
TV programs or videos directly to a Memory Stick in a CLIÉ–compatible
format. Just like a VCR, you can set it to record your favorite programs
at a particular time.

on’t tell anyone I said this, but I admit that watching a mime can actu-
ally be amusing . . . for about five minutes. However, listening to a good
band puts silent entertainment in perspective. A four-hour concert can fly by
in no time at all. Thus, it’s no great surprise that most CLIÉ models don’t rely
on their visual prowess but also pack impressive audio capabilities.
CLIÉ: The Musical Muse
As the cost of adding MP3 support to Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) has
dropped, musical capabilities have trickled down into less expensive CLIÉs.
Today, only the least expensive CLIÉ model still makes do with old-style Palm
beep-and-buzz sounds.
Figuring out whether your CLIÉ has MP3 audio support is a snap — just look
for a headphone jack like the one on the unit in Figure 10-1. If your CLIÉ has
one, roll up for the magical (musical) mystery tour. If not, well, hey, you got
your CLIÉ at a great price, right? And there’re always the eBooks that I dis-
cuss in the following chapter . . .
High-end CLIÉ models also include a digital voice recorder, and most of these
have a switch marked Voice Rec. However, because some models (such as
the UX-series models) omit this switch, the surest way to check is to look for
the Voice Rec application in the CLIÉ Program Launcher.

MP3 Mania
In case you missed the whole Napster issue and the multibillion-dollar-industry-
suing-teenagers fiasco, a quick introduction to MP3 is in order. MP3 stands for
MPEG-1 Audio Layer-3, a format that compresses music files to a size that’s on
average about a tenth of the amount of space that they occupy on an audio CD
but with little noticeable reduction in sound quality.
Why is MP3 popular? Because without it, a typical album would take up about
600MB of space, requiring you to purchase a 1GB Memory Stick just to bring
along an hour of tunes. When this book was written, a 1GB Memory Stick cost
about $400 — more than a midrange CLIÉ. MP3 compression shrinks music files
to the point where you can fit an hour of music on a 64MB Memory Stick —
which at this writing went for under $30.
Of course, another reason for the popularity — and notoriety — of MP3s is
that smaller files are feasible to download online. This had several results:
the skyrocketing popularity of online file-sharing programs like Napster and
Kazaa, hundreds of lawsuits against people sharing their music online, and

much public grumbling from aging band members who depend on the royal-
ties on their ’80s albums for their boat payments.
Although digital music has gained an outlaw reputation, it’s also a very useful
tool for legitimate music distribution and listening. Up-and-coming bands
often release sample tunes online in hopes of bringing in new fans. Services
like iTunes, Musicmatch, and the new “legit” Napster make it possible to buy
thousands of songs from the comfort of your own desk. And you can legally
rip (that is, copy and convert) your own CD collection to MP3 files, allowing
you to listen to your tunes on your CLIÉ.
Depending on your CLIÉ model, a quick check of your Program Launcher
screen shows either Sony’s homegrown Audio Player or Aerodrome Software’s
AeroPlayer. (The use of two different players is due to some differences in 
how various CLIÉs handle music.) They’re both excellent programs, although
AeroPlayer is a bit more powerful. In the following sections, I take you on a
tour of both programs.
Audio Player
Audio Player plays MP3 files, as well as tunes recorded in Sony’s proprietary
ATRAC3 format. It has the classic Sony-designed look and feel with a heavy
emphasis on icons and buttons for control, as shown in Figure 10-2.
The most-used controls are arrayed across the bottom of the screen. The 
symbols should be familiar to anyone who has used any piece of home audio
equipment manufactured in the past couple of decades. From left to right, the
buttons are Play, Stop, Previous Track, Next Track, as well as a Volume Control
slider bar. To rewind, tap and hold the Previous Track button, and to fast-
forward, tap and hold the Next Track button. You can adjust the Volume
Control slider bar by dragging the Volume slider with the stylus, tapping the
plus sign (+) or minus sign (–), or by scrolling the jog dial up and down.
Directly above the primary controls is the Progress slider bar, which shows
you the progress of the song playback. You can grab the slider with the stylus
and drag it to jump to another part of the audio file.
Above the Progress slider are three buttons. Tapping the music note gives 
you information about the current song, including the length, artist, title, and
album name. The AVLS button toggles the Automatic Volume Limiting System,
which is designed to prevent your CLIÉ from generating ear-damaging vol-
umes through headphones. Finally, tapping the BASS button cycles the Mega
Bass feature from Bass (off) to Bass 1 (low bass boost), Bass 2 (medium), and
Bass 3 (high).
137
Chapter 10: Audio Excellence: Music and Voice Recording

Moving to the top-right corner of the screen, you see MP3 followed by three
icons. Tapping the first icon brings up the Edit Playlist screen, shown in
Figure 10-3.
Simply select the songs that you want to include in your playlist. Tapping the
Select All button automatically selects all the songs, and pressing the Invert
button selects all the unselected tunes and deselects the selected tunes.
Pressing the Clear All button deselects all tunes, and pressing the Default

button moves the songs back to their original order. You can change a song’s
position in the playback order by tapping it to select it, and then using the
buttons in the top-right corner of the screen to move it up or down in the list.
After you choose your song order, tap OK to return to the main interface.
Note that Audio Player doesn’t support multiple playlists, which wasn’t a big
issue when Memory Sticks topped out at 128MB (about two hours of tunes)
but might be annoying now that 1GB cards capable of holding 16 hours of
music are available.
Note that your CLIÉ can utilize third-party MP3 player applications, such as
the AeroPlayer program, which is included with some models. If you’re seek-
ing a missing feature, such as multiple playlist support, you can always use
an add-on program instead of the built-in player.
The middle icon in the top-right corner of the Audio Player main interface
provides information on the current album (that is, all the songs on your
Memory Stick). The final button on the top row lets you choose which card
the program should look for music on. This option is available only on units
with multiple expansion areas, such as the UX, which includes special
Internal Media memory, and NX-series units, which come equipped with
CompactFlash memory cards.
Moving down to the second row of buttons (refer to Figure 10-2), the first
button switches between the normal display (which shows just the name of
the current song playing) and a song list (which shows you a list of all the
songs in your current playlist). The second button toggles through the follow-
ing play modes:
 Continue: Plays songs in the order on the Memory Stick, ignoring the
playlist.
 Shuffle: Plays songs in random order.
 Reverse: Plays songs in reverse of their order on the Memory Stick.
 Program Play: Plays songs in the order specified in the playlist.
The button to the right of the Play Mode button controls the Repeat setting:
 Rep Off: Play each song once, and then stop.
 Rep All: Play each song once, and then start again at the first song.
 Rep 1: Continuously repeat the current song.
The last button in the row, labeled A→B, lets you repeat a portion of a song
over and over. Just tap it once at the spot where you want the repeat to
begin, and then tap it again at the end of the clip. That section will play over
and over again until you tap the Stop button or tap A→B again. (This feature
is great for those times when, for example, you just have to figure out what
John is really singing in the fourth verse of “I Am the Walrus.”)
139
Chapter 10: Audio Excellence: Music and Voice Recording

By default, switching to another application shuts down the Audio Player and
ends your music, leaving you to face the task of entering your expense report
without the soothing sounds of The B-52’s to accompany the process. Luckily,
an easy fix does exist — just enable the Background Play mode, which lets you
listen to music while using other Palm OS programs. Tap the Menu soft button,
and then choose Options➪Preferences from the menu that appears. When the
Preferences screen comes up, select the Enable Background Play check box.
If you’re not planning on doing other things with your CLIÉ while listening to
music, you can significantly extend your battery life by turning off the screen
display. Just move the Hold slider on your CLIÉ to the Hold position. The
screen turns off, but the music plays on.
Overall, the Audio Player does a good job with the most common MP3 files.
If you’re an audiophile, though, you may be chagrined to discover that it
doesn’t support MP3 recordings that are made in Variable Bit Rate (VBR)
format, which allows higher-quality music without ballooning the file size.
So if you have VBR recordings in your music library, or you’re looking for
multiple playlist support or a graphic equalizer, don’t skip the following sec-
tion. You may want to purchase a copy of the standalone version of
AeroPlayer.
AeroPlayer
The PEG-TJ35 and PEG-TJ37 CLIÉs include AeroPlayer for MP3 playback
instead of Audio Player. Developed by Aerodrome software, this slick little
application offers several features that aren’t found in Audio Player, including
support for Variable Bit Rate (VBR) MP3 songs, multiple playlists, the ability
to play Ogg Vorbis–format music files, and support for playing files in multi-
ple directories on your Memory Stick.
For a peek at the default interface of the CLIÉ version of AeroPlayer, check
out Figure 10-4.
Directly below the song list is a Progress slider, which you can drag with your
stylus to jump to any point in a song. The program uses standard stereo-style
playback controls. From left to right, they represent Play, Pause, Stop, Previous
Track, and Next Track. To rewind, tap and hold the Previous Track button, and
to fast-forward, tap and hold the Next Track button. Next to the controls are
the Volume Control slider bar and the View button. Tapping View swaps the
song list between song names, filenames, and filenames showing the full direc-
tory path.
Along the bottom of the screen, you find buttons to toggle between Repeat
and Shuffle modes. The final button takes you to the Playlist screen, shown in
Figure 10-5.
140
Part III: Multimedia and Entertainment 

Here you can choose among any playlists that are stored on your Memory
Stick. Note that AeroPlayer also supports the standard M3U playlist files used
by desktop system applications. The Lemonheads playlist shown in Figure
10-5 was actually generated by the freeware Winamp 5 on a Windows com-
puter and copied along with the MP3 files to Memory Stick.
To create a new playlist, do the following:
1. Tap the New button at the bottom of the Playlists screen.

If you want to add all the songs to the list, tap the All button at the
bottom of the screen.
4. Tap the Add to Playlist button at the bottom of the screen to add the
selected songs to the playlist.
You’re then returned to the Playlist Editor screen.
5. If you want to change the song order, just tap a song to select it, and
then tap the up and down arrows in the top-right corner of the screen
to move the song up or down in the playlist.
Repeat this process for each song that you want to move until you’re
happy with the playlist.
6. Enter a name for the playlist in the Name field near the top of the
screen, and then tap Use Playlist to save the list.
You’re returned to the main screen, where you can tap the Play button
to start listening to your new musical mix.
7. To change to another playlist or edit an existing playlist, tap the
Playlist button on the main screen, and then tap the name of the
playlist of your choice.
After tapping the playlist name, you’re taken to the Edit Playlist screen

Chapter 10: Audio Excellence: Music and Voice Recording
What about the SonicStage program on the CD?
If your CLIÉ shipped with Audio Player, the
Installation CD that came with your unit has a
program called SonicStage that promises to
allow you to manage your music collection and
transfer songs in ATRAC3 format. “ATRAC3?
What’s that?” you might ask. And that question
is why I’m not delving into SonicStage in this
book. ATRAC3 is a music format that employs
Digital Rights Management to limit the copying
of music files that you create. It offers no bene-
fits to the end user (you, that is) but does create
plenty of hassles.
For instance, you have to check out a song (like
checking a book out of a library) to transfer it to
Memory Stick, and then you have to check it back
in before you can play or transfer it elsewhere.
Also, you can’t copy ATRAC3 songs to standard
purple Memory Sticks. You have to use a Memory
Stick that’s equipped with MagicGate copy-
protection technology. (See Chapter 14 for more
on the different types of Memory Sticks.) And if
you decide to replace Audio Player with a more
powerful music player, you’ll find that none of

SonicStage isn’t even a rocking music library
manager because of its rather dated interface.
Just leave it on the CD and download a free
copy of Apple’s iTunes for Windows from

lection. Follow the instructions elsewhere in this
chapter to find out how to transfer audio files
manually.

Select the Background Playback check box so that AeroPlayer can work in
the background while you’re using other programs on your CLIÉ.
If you’re not using other programs while listening to AeroPlayer, you can sig-
nificantly extend your battery life by turning off the display screen. Just move
the Hold slider on your CLIÉ to the Hold position. The screen turns off, but
AeroPlayer continues to crank out tunes.
Selecting the Start Playing on Launch check box on the Preferences screen
does just what it says. It’s useful if you typically just use one playlist or the
default song order for each Memory Stick.
Music is a personal thing, as is style. If the AeroPlayer default gray interface
doesn’t fit your metro-sensibilities, don’t despair. The program supports skins,
graphic files that can give the program a whole new interface. You can find 
a selection of free skins to download at www.aerodrome.us/aeroplayer/

tic bent. Downloadable skins range from the cool to the geeky, as illustrated in

When you’re using another application while music is playing, making a
shortcut stroke (a forward slash) in the Graffiti 2 writing area brings up the
usual shortcut window with a couple of useful additions: Play and Stop but-
tons, as well as an AE button that pops up a miniature set of playback and
volume controls.
Transferring MP3 Songs to Memory Stick
Unfortunately, the CLIÉ doesn’t include an application for automatically down-
loading MP3 audio files, so you need a little basic understanding of how to
copy files using Windows. Because this isn’t Windows For Dummies, I assume
that you’ve got the whole copying-files process down. (If I’m following the clas-
sic definition of assume here, you can find some basic help on the process by
pressing F1 when viewing your Windows desktop to bring up Windows Help,
and then searching for move files. Alternatively, buying a copy of the fine book
Windows XP For Dummies, by Andy Rathbone, published by Wiley, is always a
good option.)

AeroPlayer for everyone!
Although it’s included on only some models,
AeroPlayer actually works with all headphone-
jack-equipped Palm OS 5 CLIÉ units. You can
download a trial copy at www.aerodrome.us
and use it for a couple weeks to decide whether
you like it. The downloadable version includes
a few features not found in the built-in version,
such as the graphic equalizer shown in the fol-
lowing figure, so it may be worth checking out
even if you did get the program with your CLIÉ.
Aerodrome Software offers a discount to PEG-
TJ35 and PEG-TJ37 owners.

Part III: Multimedia and Entertainment 
Where do I get MP3s?
The best place to find MP3 songs to play on your
CLIÉ is in your own CD collection. You already
own the music, and you know you like it, so all
you have to do is get the song into MP3 format.
This is done by ripping the music, which involves
copying the digital music data from your CD to
your desktop system and then compressing it to
a smaller MP3 format file. The CLIÉ doesn’t
include an MP3 ripper application, but many free
applications can rip CDs to MP3 format.
You can’t beat the price of Apple’s iTunes for
Windows (free!), and it not only rips CDs to MP3
or AAC (used by the iPod, but not compatible
with the CLIÉ) formats, but it’s also a stellar music
manager. If you choose to use iTunes, be sure
that it’s set to rip in MP3 format. Choose
Edit➪Preferences from the main menu, and then
when the Preferences dialog box appears, go
ahead and click the Importing tab. Then select
the Import Using MP3 Encoder option. You can
also set the bit rate (the quality of the MP3 files)
here. If space is a big issue, choose 128 Kbps.
Otherwise, choosing 160 or even 192 Kbps gives
a bit clearer sound quality at the expense of
larger files. The quality gain is very noticeable if
you’re listening to Bach or Pink Floyd, but that’s
perhaps not as big a deal if Eminem or Britney
Spears is in high rotation. You can download
iTunes from www.itunes.com.
Other good choices are Musicmatch Jukebox
($19.99 to buy, but you can use it at reduced
speed for free) from www.musicmatch.com, or
for those who value pure audio quality over rip-
ping speed and ease of use, the freeware Exact
Audio Copy from www.exactaudiocopy.
org might be right up your alley.
As you’ve probably heard, you can now buy songs
online for about a buck apiece from services
such as iTunes, Musicmatch Downloads, and
the new Napster 2.0. Unfortunately, none of
these music services supports the CLIÉ. iTunes
saves songs in AAC format, and Musicmatch
Downloads and Napster 2.0 both use Microsoft’s
Windows Media format for their music. None of
the add-on CLIÉ music players support these
formats due to high licensing costs and other
restrictions. So you’re out of luck, right?
Wrong! Assuming you have a CD burner, there’s
actually a slightly convoluted way that you can
convert the songs that you’ve purchased from
one of these services into an MP3 file that you
can play with your CLIÉ. All these services allow
you to use your desktop system to copy the songs
you’ve purchased to a CD. You can them turn right
around and use your desktop system to rip that
CD, converting the songs back into MP3 format.
Presto! You now have the songs in a format that
can be played on your CLIÉ. If you don’t want to
keep a CD copy for playback on your home stereo
or in your car, just use a CD-RW (a rewriteable
disc), erase it when you’re through, and use it
again next time you buy new songs.
Although you can occasionally find free MP3s
from your favorite artists on their Web sites or
on sites run by their record labels, legal free
downloads of popular tunes are few and far
between. If you don’t mind giving up-and-
coming artists a try, you can find some great
(and a lot of not-so-great) free music at the
Internet Underground Music Archive at www.
iuma.com. Despite the underground in the
name, the site hosts everything from rock and
hip-hop to kids’ music and the blues.

147
Chapter 10: Audio Excellence: Music and Voice Recording
To copy the files, you need to place your Memory Stick in a Memory Stick
reader drive on your desktop system, or you need to connect your CLIÉ to
your desktop system and use the Data Import program to mount the Memory
Stick as a drive on your desktop system that way. To do this, tap the Data
Import icon in the Program Launcher, and then tap the Connect button at the
bottom of the screen. Your Memory Stick is given a drive letter in My
Computer on your desktop system. (For more Memory Stick usage basics,
see Chapter 14.)
When you have your Memory Stick mounted, all you have to do to transfer
your files is copy them to the \Palm\Programs\MSAudio directory, as shown
in Figure 10-9. If you’re using AeroPlayer, you can also copy M3U playlists and
folders containing MP3 files to this directory; Audio Player recognizes only
MP3 files in the main MSAUDIO directory.
When your files are copied, just put the Memory Stick back in your CLIÉ — 
if you went the Memory Stick reader route — or, if you went driveless, just
close out of the Data Import program, and you’re literally ready to rock.
Alarmingly Cool Alarms
When you were in high school, your car horn did its best impression of the
Dukes of Hazzard car, General Lee. Now your cell phone blasts “Copacabana”
whenever someone calls. Don’t you wish that you could personalize your
CLIÉ to the same degree?

Part III: Multimedia and Entertainment 
Okay, I hope neither of the first two things is true. But you can indeed person-
alize your CLIÉ’s alarms. Depending on my mood, my CLIÉ might play a nice
Bach minuet to get my attention or play Homer Simpson shouting “D’oh!” If
your CLIÉ is equipped with advanced audio, you can use a program like Sound
Converter on your desktop system to add alarms by copying MIDI music files
or short WAV digital audio files to your CLIÉ’s built-in sound database.
If your CLIÉ is equipped with enhanced audio, you can find Sound Converter 2
on the CD that accompanied the unit, typically under the heading CLIÉ Utilities.
When the program is installed on your desktop system, you can find Sound
Converter 2 listed on your Start menu. Launch the program to see the screen in
Figure 10-10.
To add files to Sound Converter, drag and drop them onto the program’s
window by using the mouse, or click the Add button to open a file requester
window and use it to locate and select files. You can add multiple files at one
time and preview them by clicking each file and then clicking the Play arrow.
Note that converted WAV files are limited to 64MB (about ten seconds, typi-
cally) in length. If you have a file that goes slightly over that in size, you can
reduce the quality a bit by clicking the Adjust Sampling rate and then choos-
ing 8 kHz. This might give you the extra few seconds that you need to get the
entire sample in.
When you’re satisfied with your new alarm selection, click the Install on Next
HotSync button, and the files are set to transfer next time you sync your
handheld.
Figure 10-10:
Sound
Converter 2

and short

files into

After you move the files over, you can check out how they sound by tapping
the Sound Utl icon in the Program Launcher to run the Sound Utility applica-
tion. This simple application, shown in Figure 10-11, allows you to play,
delete, and rename alarm sound files. Although WAV files typically transfer to
the CLIÉ unharmed, many MIDI files sound terrible after the conversion
process, so give them a listen before choosing them as alarms.
To actually use your new alarm, you need to load the Date Book application
by tapping its icon in the Program Launcher or by pressing the Date Book hard
button. Then tap the Menu soft button and choose Options➪Preferences from
the menu that appears. Tap the pop-up menu next to the words Alarm Sound,
as shown in Figure 10-12, and your new alarms appear in the list.
When you select an alarm, it plays back so you can confirm that it’s the one
you want to use. Tap OK, and you’re now set to be alerted by anything from
the opening riff from your favorite song to your kid saying, “I love you!”
If you have a microphone on your desktop system and want to create your
own alarm sounds, look for the program called Sound Recorder on your Start
menu. (Under Windows XP, it’s typically under Accessories/Entertainment.)
You can use this program to record new WAV files for conversion with Sound
Converter. After you make a recording, pull down the File menu, and select
Properties to make sure that the size is less than about 60K. If it’s larger than
60K, transferring the WAV file with Sound Converter cuts the sound off after
the 60K point.

Chapter 10: Audio Excellence: Music and Voice Recording

Its Master’s Voice: CLIÉ Voice Recorder
Many high-end CLIÉ models include a built-in digital voice recorder, which
comes in handy for recording everything from short audio notes to yourself
to interviews and speeches.
To launch Voice Recorder, tap the Voice Rec icon in the CLIÉ Program
Launcher, and then tap the on-screen Rec button to start recording. If your
CLIÉ is equipped with a Voice Rec switch, toggling it both launches Voice
Recorder and starts a recording.
The interface, shown in Figure 10-13, is fairly straightforward — it actually
looks a lot like Audio Player with the addition of a Record button. You find
typical home-stereo-style Play, Stop, Previous Track, and Next Track buttons,
as well as a Volume Control slider bar.
The A→B repeat button works during playback just as it does in Audio
Player: Press it once at the beginning of the section that you want to hear
repeated, and then press it again at the end. The section repeats over and
over until you press the A→B button again. When listening to voice record-
ings, this is very useful because you can set a hard-to-hear section to repeat
until you understand what was said. Tap the Rep button, located above the
Volume Control slider bar, so that it reads Rep 1, which makes it repeat the
entire sound continuously.

Part III: Multimedia and Entertainment 

Tapping the SP/LP button to toggle between standard-play (SP) and long-play
(LP) recording modes. LP mode reduces audio quality noticeably but triples
the available recording time. You can use the Low/High button to set record-
ing sensitivity. If the person speaking is near the microphone, set it to Low. If
the speaker is farther away (or is what Kramer from Seinfeld called a low
talker), set it to High.
At the top of the screen are three icons. The first lets you attach a voice
recording (as a WAV file) to a CLIÉ Mail message. The second lets you move
recordings between the handheld’s memory and a Memory Stick, and the last
is for deleting files.
Tapping the Wrench icon in the lower-left corner brings up the Voice
Recorder Preferences screen, as shown in Figure 10-14.
If you don’t want the program to play a confirming beep when you start and
stop recording, deselect the first check box. Selecting the Enable Continuous
Play check box causes Voice Recorder to play all recordings in succession
when you press the Play button.
The List/Rec. Media option lets you choose whether to use handheld
memory or your Memory Stick for voice recordings. If you set it to Priority
MS, the program uses the Memory Stick, if it’s present, or handheld memory
if it’s not.

Finally, you can set a maximum size for voice recordings. If you plan to use
your recordings as alarms — or you want to get over your habit of filling all
your CLIÉ’s memory with lengthy monologues — set the maximum size to
62K, which is the largest size possible for an alarm, for both the Handheld
and Card settings.
To convert a voice recording to an alarm, tap it in the Voice Recorder main
screen (refer to Figure 10-13), and then tap the Menu soft button and choose
Date➪Convert to Alarm from the menu that appears. If the recording is too
long, a window pops up, warning you that the file will be cut off after 62K.
This window actually has a little Play button that lets you hear how much of
your recording will be used for the alarm before you make a final decision.
Handy, that! Note that converting a recording to an alarm doesn’t delete the
original file.

N
ow that Frank Sinatra is playing the Big Vegas in the Sky, the Sony CLIÉ
can quite possibly lay claim to being one of the most versatile enter-

TV, movies, and music with panache. But it doesn’t stop there. The CLIÉ is
also a handheld video game system, an entertainment and education system
for the kids, a pocket-sized library, an audiobook narrator, and a portable
radio player.
The best news about all this versatility is that you can bring your CLIÉ every-
where, so you need never be bored again! Stuck in a long line at the grocery

And to think you told your spouse that you bought the CLIÉ to get better

Goodbye, Game Boy
With its brilliant graphics, superb sound support, and beefy memory capabil-
ities, the CLIÉ is an excellent game platform. Although early CLIÉ games were
fairly simple, tending to be more of the puzzles-and-cards variety, the faster
processors and larger screens of the models available today have allowed
game developers to create titles that are comparable to the games that you
were playing on your desktop system just a few years ago.

Games for the CLIÉ are available just like any other program that you might
buy — either on a CD that you buy in the store (a fairly rare animal) or more
frequently, as a download. Some downloadable games are free, but others are
commercial. Almost all the commercial games offer time-limited demo versions
that you can try and then buy if you like them. (You can find a couple of these
on your CLIÉ Installation CD.) After paying for the game at the site where you
initially downloaded it, you’ll receive an e-mail with a code to fully unlock the
game. Games are relatively inexpensive — most fall in the $5-to-$20 range.
Games of virtually all types are available for the CLIÉ. Puzzle games are the
most common — and among the best suited for playing with a stylus — but
you can also find trivia, card, action, and strategy games. Even a few DOOM-
style first-person shooters are available. Just about everyone can find a game
that they like that’s available for the CLIÉ.
For a look at some of the best games available for the CLIÉ, organized by
game type, check out the following couple sections. (And be sure to check
out the illustrations. I selflessly spent umpteen hours trying out these games
just so that I could find representative shots for this book.)
Action games
Action games are the ones that test your reflexes and reactions: 3D shooters,
arcade games, racing games, and so on. Because many CLIÉs have awkward
button designs for gaming (see the sidebar “The CLIÉ Game Controller”),
action games that are designed to be played with the stylus tend to work best.
Insaniquarium

eras and microphones and occasionally defusing bombs. The graphics are
simple, as is readily apparent in Figure 11-2, but the action is nonstop. Finish

The CLIÉ Game Controller
For the most part, Sony’s engineering of the CLIÉ
is nothing short of brilliant. But somewhere
deep within the bowels of a design lab in Japan,
there sits a very angry engineer who must
believe that games are beneath the CLIÉ’s sta-
tion in life. With each successive series, this
person designs button shapes and jog dial
placements that make action gaming more dif-
ficult. For instance, the movement of the jog dial
to the center of the new TH and TJ models pre-
vents up-and-down directional control in an
action game. And the UX series includes only
three application hard buttons, which are com-
monly used for game control.
What’s a gamer to do? Well, the good news 
is that the vast majority of today’s Palm OS
games play just fine using only a stylus, with no
need for more than one or two application hard
buttons. I recommend trying the demo version
of any game to ensure that you’re comfortable
with the control scheme on your CLIÉ.
If you have an older CLIÉ model, though, a fan-
tastic solution is available to you: Sony’s PEGA-
GC10 Game Controller, shown in the following
figure. This PlayStation-quality game pad clips
onto the bottom of NR-, T-, and SL/SJ-series
CLIÉs, interfacing via the HotSync port. It boasts
a four-way game pad, two fire buttons, and four
additional control buttons. For compatibility with
older games, the driver lets you program the
buttons to emulate the standard Palm OS appli-
cation buttons. Button feel and responsiveness
are superb. With the Game Controller, I was
able to make it to the end of Zap!2016 without
losing a single ship.
Unfortunately, the PEGA-GC10 doesn’t fit the
newest CLIÉ models, and Sony doesn’t appear to
be developing a new version for these units. 
If you have a CLIÉ that it fits and you enjoy action
games, though, it’s a must-have peripheral.
Although it’s out of production, you might still be
able to find the PEGA-GC10 at your local CLIÉ
provider; if not, you can order one from www.
sonystyle.com. They’re usually available on
eBay, as well.

Puzzle games
Puzzle games exercise the mind as much as they do the reflexes, and the CLIÉ
excels at offering them. Break out the stylus and the cerebellum and prepare
to be challenged.
Bejeweled
www.astraware.com
Warning: This is the most addictive game since Tetris. It’s also amazingly
simple. Swap adjacent jewels around the board by tapping with the stylus to get
three matching jewels in a row. But something in that simplicity makes it very,
very hard to stop playing. One of the first enhancements that the developers
made to the original version of the game was to add the optional clock and bat-
tery meter that you see at the top of Figure 11-8. (Bejeweled players tend to lose
track of both time and battery juice.) The latest version offers high-resolution
graphics and enhanced music when run on the CLIÉ. If you buy only one game
on your CLIÉ, buy this one. Your CLIÉ might have come with a demo version on
its CD, but skip that and download the latest release to be sure that you have
the newest bells and whistles. You’ll want to explore Astraware’s site anyway if
you enjoy puzzle games. The site is chock full of other fantastic puzzle titles,
such as Alchemy, Atomica, Dynomite, Cubis, and Rocket Mania.
Lemmings

Lemmings is a classic game. Your job is to save the lemmings before they
head off to the great lemming beyond. You’re given a variety of special
powers that you can bestow on lemmings to help them save their brethren.

Tetris is the Russian falling-block puzzle game shown in Figure 11-10. If
Bejeweled is addictive, Tetris should be regulated by the government. Back in

game remains disturbingly entertaining despite the fact that all you have to do
is create solid rows out of falling blocks. Although the Palm OS port features

Shown in Figure 11-11, Vexed is perhaps the best free game, oh, ever. In this
simple game, you slide tiles around the board, utilizing virtual gravity to get
them into the right spot so that they match. Match two tiles, and they disap-
pear. Get to the end of the game with any tiles left, and you lose. The original
game was so good that a team of fans enhanced it and added dozens of new
levels. Be careful, though: This game can easily nullify any added productiv-
ity that your CLIÉ might afford you by absorbing your time.
Bookworm

Bookworm to be a fantastic time-killer. The objective is to build words by

the better your score. As the game progresses, you get bonus tiles, as well as
special tiles that can help or hinder your game. Fantastic word fun.

Ah, the games that you can play with the whole family. Well, not in this case,

www.handmark.com
I’m grouping these three games together because they share common charac-
teristics: They’re true to the original games, they’re enhanced to take advan-
tage of all the CLIÉ’s features, and they all support multiple human players.
All three games can be played by passing a single CLIÉ around, and Scrabble
and Trivial Pursuit also support playing with multiple PDAs — even of differ-
ent brands — by using infrared or Bluetooth communication. (Figure 11-15
shows you what Scrabble on a CLIÉ looks like.)
Strategy games
The Strategy category covers a wide variety of games, from cerebral games
like chess to combat in Warfare Incorporated to snail artillery combat. Fess
up: When you bought your CLIÉ, you never imagined that you’d use it to drop
anvils on the heads of virtual snails, did you?

Snails
www.snailsgame.com
At first, Snails looks like your basic mortar mollusk mayhem, another case of
gory gastropod genocide. But this cartoonish snail-against-snail artillery
game, shown in Figure 11-16, is chock-full of fun, strategy, and laughs. And it’s
not just action — there’s a wacky storyline behind each mission. The game
boasts excellent audio, amusing animation, lots of levels, and tons of wacky
weapons — including an anvil that you can drop on your enemy’s head. The
game is amazingly inexpensive (under $10) given its level of quality and fun.
Warfare Incorporated
www.handmark.com/warfare
A full-blown, real-time strategy game, Warfare Incorporated sends you on a 14-
mission campaign to gather interstellar artifacts and keep them away from the

game on your desktop system are here: building, combat, multiple unit types,
and more. (See Figure 11-17.) The most recent version offers supercharged per-
formance on Palm OS 5 CLIÉ models and includes a Windows mission editor so
that you can create your own add-on missions. Numerous missions are avail-
able for download as well.
ChessGenius
www.chessgenius.com
If you want to lose a game of chess, ChessGenius is the game for you.
Optimized for the newest CLIÉs and packing startlingly good artificial intelli-
gence, this handheld chess game — shown in Figure 11-18 — gives everyone
this side of Garry Kasparov a real challenge. The good news is that the game
features 40 playing levels, so you can adjust it to offer you a real challenge
without always getting decimated. Hints and a tutor mode make ChessGenius
an excellent choice for the new player.

Kingdom
www.grogsoft.com
Kingdom, shown in Figure 11-19, is very similar to the original version of the
classic computer game Civilization. You start with a single city and build
colonists and recruit soldiers as you expand your empire. You can go all
Genghis Khan on your neighbors and try to wipe them out, or you can try to
win a science victory by outpacing them technologically. As you play, you
manage each city to make sure that it’s properly exploiting the resources
around it. Make wise choices on which units to build. Kingdom has good arti-
ficial intelligence and has the depth of play of the original Civilization. It’s a
must-have for war- and colonization-game fans.

Adventures and RPGs
Adventure and role-playing games (RPGs) are like interactive books where
you’re the main character. Adventures typically involve interacting with
other characters and solving puzzles to move on to the next chapter. RPGs
also have storylines but often focus more on combat and building up your
character’s abilities as you solve heroic quests.
Legacy
www.redshift.hu
I first tried the newly released Legacy during the writing of this book, and it
took a crowbar, a pound of butter, and a deranged squirrel to tear me away
from Legacy long enough to finish writing. This stellar role-playing game
looks like it belongs on a desktop computer, not a handheld. It includes all
the requisite features, including dungeons to crawl through, monsters to slay,
and recruiting parties of adventurers to join you in the fun, as shown in
Figure 11-20. The graphics are stunning, and the overall game is reminiscent
of computer classics like The Bard’s Tale and Might and Magic. I highly rec-
ommend Legacy for role-playing-game fans.
Kronos
www.codejedi.com
Kronos isn’t actually a game. It’s an interpreter, a program that lets you 
load and play classic Infocom text adventure games such as Zork and The
Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. If you don’t have these great old classics
around, you can pick up one of the old Infocom CD collections on eBay for a
song. Text adventures are interactive stories where you issue commands like
Figure 11-20:
Sleep? 
Who needs

Legacy is so
much better
than sleep.
168
Part III: Multimedia and Entertainment 

“go west,” “kill grue with sword,” or “grab the stupid babel fish” to interact
with the story. Text adventures are also perfect for handheld play because
you look like you’re working intently as you play them. (Figure 11-21 intro-
duces you to a CLIÉ version of The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.)
CLIÉ for Kids
Have your kids reached the age where you can feel confident handing them
a device that cost you hundreds of dollars and whose most fragile compo-
nent is a screen made out of the “you betcha I’ll shatter if you drop me on a
hard surface” variety of glass? If so, the CLIÉ makes an excellent time-killer
for the kids — and a parental sanity-saver for you when they resort to the
time-honored, parent-torture techniques of repetitive blasts of “Are we there
yet?” and “I’m bored.”
Even your everyday CLIÉ can entertain kids. They can draw with CLIÉ Memo
or Photo Editor or go nuts shooting pictures with the built-in camera. Or you
can take advantage of kids’ affinity for multimedia by buying a second
Memory Stick and filling it with their favorite songs from The Wiggles or a
recording of their favorite episode of Jay Jay the Jet Plane.
Although the amount of educational software available for the CLIÉ pales in
comparison to entertainment and productivity programs, some standout pro-
grams are designed just for kids. At palmgear.com alone, you can find about
400 programs targeted at educating grades K through 12.

If you are handing off the PDA to the kids, and they’re not in a controlled, soft
environment like a car or plane, invest in a good case. A hard case helps pre-
vent scratches, but a soft, padded case offers better drop protection. Choose
the type that best fits your needs — and the destructive tendencies of your
children.
PDA Playground
www.dataviz.com
Designed for kids ages 3 through 7, PDA Playground offers a selection of six
games aimed squarely at the little-kid market:
 Paint: Color in predrawn pictures.
 Draw: Draw uses the same interface as Paint but lets kids draw images
from scratch.
 Match: This memory game has kids find matching tile pairs. Think of the
game Concentration.
 ScratchOff: This is the weakest of the bunch. Kids can use the stylus to
scratch a pattern off a drawing and try to guess what the image is before
revealing it. It’s boring alone but fun with two or more kids to see who
can be the first to guess.
 FollowMe: Use the stylus to repeat patterns of images and sounds that
flash on the screen. Remember the classic Simon electronic game?
(Figure 11-22 gives you a peek at FollowMe.)
 PuzzlePath: Rearrange on-screen tiles to make a path so that a little girl
can safely collect fruit while avoiding turtles.

Part III: Multimedia and Entertainment 

The games are cute, but overall, they’re more entertaining than educational.
The coolest feature, though, is that it can keep the kids from deleting your
important contacts or otherwise doing scary things to your data. To prevent
such disasters, simply set it to require a password before it allows you to exit
the program.
Even better, PDA Playground can launch not only the six included games, but
also any other programs that you add to the Program Launcher. So you
could, say, also let the kids use the CLIÉ Camera and play Bejeweled and
Vexed, but lock them out of all the other applications.
Kids Pack
www.jsmart.com
For a slightly older crowd, check out Kids Pack, shown in Figure 11-23. Rated
for ages 8 and up, this four-game pack includes the following:
 Word Search: Find the hidden words in the grid of letters.
 Labyrinth: For those sweet, innocent minds that haven’t yet figured out
that life itself is merely navigating a complicated maze of decisions, this
graphical maze game is just the ticket.

 Peg Jump: Did you ever stop at the Cracker Barrel restaurant and play
that fun little wooden peg game where you try to jump the golf tees and
remove all but one from the board? With Peg Jump, your kids can play
the game without the need for a Cracker Barrel, and you’ll need to find a
new excuse to talk the spouse into stopping for a tasty plate of chicken-
fried steak.
 Simon Says: Repeat the sequence of flashing lights, just like the old
Simon game.
Note that this is merely a bargain bundle of four separate games, without the
kid-safe Program Launcher included with PDA Playground. But it’s also half
the price.
Math123 Kids Math and Count
www.palmgear.com
Looking for something a little more educational? Math123 Kids Math and
Count offers four levels of difficulty aimed at kids from preschool to elemen-
tary. At the easiest level, kids merely count the objects on the screen and tap
the on-screen number, as shown in Figure 11-24. The program works all the
way up to addition and subtraction with two more digits.
To be really attractive to kids, this program could be a little more game and a
little less drill. Still, it’s a great way for kids to practice their math skills, and
it’s very inexpensive.

Beret Study Buddy: Vocabulary
www.beret.com
Are your kids finding it frustrating to study for their vocabulary and spelling
tests? The Beret Study Buddy: Vocabulary application lets kids or parents
enter vocabulary words and definitions and then practice with them. Tech-
savvy kids can even beam their vocabulary lists to each other.
The quiz mode is configurable, but in the fun department, kids also enjoy
WordFind, Guess? (which is like Hangman), and Tic Tac Toe games for more
entertaining practice, as shown in Figure 11-25. The AnswerTrack feature lets
kids and parents see which problem words need extra drilling.
At the Beret Web site, you can also find a variety of math, reading, and civics
programs, all hosted by the friendly Herbert the Caterpillar.
Kid Zone
www.beiks.com
Kid Zone is a replacement for the CLIÉ Program Launcher that lets you desig-
nate which programs your kids can launch, as shown in Figure 11-26, and
then lets them launch only those. It locks out the hard buttons and the stan-
dard Program Launcher.
Set up all the kids’ games and education programs in Kid Zone, and then
launch the program before you hand the CLIÉ to the kids. They can swap
back and forth between programs to their hearts’ content. When you retrieve
the CLIÉ, you can enter a password to access the normal Program Launcher
and use all your usual applications.

Missile Math
www.palmgear.com
Missile Math, shown in Figure 11-27, is a math drill program that uses arcade
action to keep the kids playing. If you ever played the classic arcade game
Missile Command, the screen will look awfully familiar. The difference is that
you have to tap the number that answers the math problem presented at the
bottom of the screen to stop the missile.
Nothing like the threat of nuclear annihilation to drill home the need for
strong math skills, eh? Um, maybe that’s not an appropriate thought to share
with the kids.

MakeFaces
www.wagware.com
This one is a hoot. You start with a basic head shape and add eyes, ears,
nose, mouth, hair, and so on to create a new face, as shown in Figure 11-28.
It’s simple enough for even the littlest kids to use, yet it’s oddly entertaining.
You’ll probably find yourself “testing” it for a few minutes before you can
bring yourself to hand the CLIÉ to the kids.
eBooks for the kids
I cover eBooks in the section “Curl Up with a Good eBook,” but I want to
make sure that you know this is a great resource for kids who like to read.
Although relatively few commercial eBook titles are aimed at kids, a ton of
classic literature is available in the public domain and can be downloaded in
Palm OS format.
The best place to look for classics for the kids is www.memoware.com. There
you can find kid-friendly classics such as Mark Twain’s The Adventures of
Huckleberry Finn and A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court. You can also
find everything from Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice to Victor Appleton’s
Tom Swift and His Sky Racer, all at no charge.
Good, old-fashioned games
Hey, you don’t make them do homework 24/7, so you don’t have to limit the
kids’ CLIÉ time to math and word drills. Many of the games that adults enjoy

also appeal to the kids. Astraware’s ChromaGames features checkers, for
instance, which is a perennial kids’ favorite. Puzzle games like Bejeweled and
Vexed teach basic matching skills and prioritization, and you can’t find more
entertaining spelling and vocabulary drills than Bookworm and Link Letters.
You’re not going to find anything as egregiously inappropriate as Grand Theft
Auto on the CLIÉ, and you have to look pretty hard to find games that even
have blood in them. So don’t feel bad about letting your kids partake in a
little handheld gaming.
Curl Up with a Good eBook
eRead a good book lately? Whether you enjoy curling up with bestsellers, sci-
ence fiction, romance, or the classics, the CLIÉ is ready to deliver the eGoods.
eBooks have come a long way since the early days when people struggled to
read public domain electronic books on blocky, low-resolution screens. (Works
that are in the public domain aren’t protected by copyright law and can be
reproduced and used at will.)
My, what a difference a few years makes! Today you can purchase the latest
bestsellers, electronic versions of fiction magazines, and even short stories.
And of course, the free classics are still available as well.
Reading eBooks on the CLIÉ is a pleasant experience. Its bright, backlit screen
with a paper-white background and crisp, high-resolution text is easy on the
eyes. It’s the next best thing to paper. And eBook readers include features that
take advantage of the electronic format by offering keyword searches, multiple
bookmarks, and digital annotation.
I admit that I’d never give up my paper library for electronic books. There’s
something comforting about the feel of a paper classic in my hands. But I still
keep an eBook or two on my CLIÉ because I never know when I’m going to find
some downtime to sneak in a few pages. Not to mention the fact that it would
be considered rude and unprofessional to pop out a book in a meeting when a
coworker is on a ten-minute ramble about something that’s only peripherally
related to work. However, reading an eBook on a CLIÉ looks an awful lot like
you’re doing something productive and work-related. . . .
Where to find eBooks
An Internet account is your library card for a vast selection of electronic
books, both commercial and free. All you need to get started is a CLIÉ, 
possibly a credit card, and an eBook reader. (I fill you in on readers in the
later section “eBook readers.”) Knowing which kinds of books you’ll be read-
ing comes in handy when choosing a reader, so it pays to check out the vir-
tual bookshelves first.
176
Part III: Multimedia and Entertainment 

Palm Digital Media
www.palmdigitalmedia.com
The premiere shopping destination for eBooks, Palm Digital Media offers
thousands of fiction and nonfiction books by authors ranging from Stephen
King to Moon Unit Zappa.
Prices are much more reasonable now than they were in the early days of the
store, when new books cost as much as they did at a bookstore. Today you
can find the hottest new novels at prices that are typically about 25 percent
less than their hardcover counterparts. Paperbacks tend to run from $3 to $9,
with most coming in at just under $6. If you don’t mind an occasional commer-
cial e-mail, subscribing to the Palm Digital Media e-mail newsletter will net you
a weekly code that’s good for 10 percent off every eBook that you purchase.
Those prices are reasonable when you consider that you’re getting the exact
same content you’d get in a printed book but in an extremely portable format.
The biggest disadvantage is that you can easily pick up and read an old printed
book 20 years from now, but who knows what kind of eBook readers will be
around by then?
The Palm Digital Media eBooks are copy-protected and require an unlock code
that’s based on the credit card number that you used to purchase the book.
(Don’t worry, nobody else can read the number). This means the book is tied
to you but not specifically to your CLIÉ. Thus, you can copy the book to a
desktop or notebook system for some big-screen reading. But if you want to
share the book with a friend or family member, it has to be someone you’d
trust with your credit card number. Because of this copy protection, you must
use the company’s Palm Reader program to read its eBooks.
Palm Digital Media even lets you browse before you buy: You can read excerpts
from most of their eBooks on your desktop system before you make a purchas-
ing decision.
Fictionwise
www.fictionwise.com
Fictionwise started a few years ago as an online store selling primarily science-
fiction short stories. The company has since then significantly expanded its
selection, moving into mystery, romance, nonfiction, and other genres and
adding full-length novels to the mix. The company has over 18,000 titles 
available.
Like Palm Digital Media, Fictionwise offers eBooks in secure Palm Reader
format. However, the company also offers a number of titles in the standard,
unencrypted Doc file format, which gives you more choices in eBook reader
software.
177
Chapter 11: Games, Books, and More!

Fictionwise’s collection of short stories might be the best choice for you if
you tend to do your CLIÉ reading when you find a few minutes of free time
rather than curling up on the couch with a good PDA.
Fictionwise almost always offers a few short stories or classic texts for free
download, which is a great way to sample the eBook experience.
MemoWare
www.memoware.com
If your favorite word is free, or your tastes tend to run towards the classics,
check out MemoWare. MemoWare specializes in public-domain texts. You can
find many books and short stories old enough that their copyrights have
expired — think Mark Twain, Jane Austen, H.G. Wells, and the complete
works of Shakespeare. MemoWare also offers government-sponsored works,
reader-written texts such as The Little Book of First Aid, dictionaries, foreign-
language translators, and a ton of computer and handheld reference works.
If you’re not sure what you’re looking for, MemoWare offers an excellent
search engine that lets you look for books by keyword, author, format, reader
rating, and more.
MemoWare also offers an excellent eBook primer section with detailed infor-
mation on eBook formats, reader programs, and how to create your own
eBook texts. If you’re new to eBooks, www.memoware.com makes a good first
stop to help you get started.
Other eBook resources
The Internet hosts numerous other spots for finding eBooks. They include:
 Baen Books: This publisher of science-fiction and fantasy novels not
only offers many books in electronic format (including Mobipocket
reader format for the CLIÉ), but also actually offers many titles online
before they’re available in bookstores. For a monthly fee, you get access
to four brand new novels. Check them out at www.baen.com.
 Mobipocket: This is another good source for commercial eBooks. Your
CLIÉ might have Mobipocket Reader included, either built in or on the CD
that accompanied the unit. I’ve got one caveat: A search for Star Trek titles
also brought up a racy erotica title in the “based on what others bought,
you might also like this” segment of the results. So you might want to do
any eBook shopping for the kids yourself on this site. And Star Trek book
fans might want to get out of the house a little more. For a test run, point
your Internet browser to www.mobipocket.com.
 eBooks.com: Offering books in Palm Reader format, eBooks.com has an
extensive selection of mainstream fiction and nonfiction titles. But what
makes this site stick out is the ability to do a full-text search, fantasti-
cally helpful if you’re looking for texts that reference subjects such as
178
Part III: Multimedia and Entertainment 

Alexander the Great or the Holy Grail. eBooks.com makes its home on
the Web at (surprisingly enough) www.ebooks.com.
 PerfectBound: HarperCollins Publishers is offering is own titles online
from authors such as Michael Crichton and Neal Gaiman. Most of the titles
here can also be found at other sites, but the same titles at PerfectBound
were almost always cheaper than at Palm Digital Media. Give them a try at
www.perfectbound.com.
 Contentlink: This site offers books published by Random House
Publishing and features authors such as Laurell K. Hamilton, Dan Brown,
and Anne Rice. As with PerfectBound, many of these are available else-
where, but the prices are sometimes better. See for yourself at www.
contentlinkinc.com.
eBook readers
Okay, you’ve downloaded some eBooks. Now all you need is a reader to view
them on.
Freeware and unencrypted commercial eBooks are stored in a format called
Doc files. Despite the name, these have no relation to the DOC files saved by
Microsoft Word. Rather, they’re compressed eBooks designed for viewing on
Palm OS and Pocket PC handhelds. All Palm OS eBook readers can read Doc
files.
Encrypted commercial eBooks are specially designed to prevent copying, and
they require a reader that supports their special format. Thus, if you’re reading
a book from Palm Digital Media, you have no choice but to use Palm Reader
because it’s the only reader that supports that store’s format.
The next few sections fill you in on the most popular readers.
Mobipocket Reader
www.mobipocket.com
Mobipocket Reader, shown in Figure 11-29, isn’t as universally supported as
Palm Reader. Still, I mention it first because it’s actually included with — or
even built into — many CLIÉs. You can use it to read commercial eBooks from
the Mobipocket Web site, as well as from Baen books and a few other publish-
ers. The version bundled with the CLIÉ is full-featured with bookmarks; a
built-in dictionary; and easy-to-read, smooth-edged fonts. Mobipocket’s most
unique feature is its ability to download news from a choice of more than 500
online channels and download it to your CLIÉ when you HotSync. Mobipocket
also sells Mobipocket Reader Pro, which adds better searching, more screen
orientations for reading text, highlighting, and several other features. The
free version comes bundled with many CLIÉs and can also be downloaded
from the Web site.

Palm Reader
www.palmdigitalmedia.com
By virtue of the vast majority of commercial eBooks for handhelds being
released in Palm Reader format, Palm Reader is a must-have for anyone who
plans to buy eBooks online. The good news is that it’s an excellent program
overall, and because it supports Doc files, it’s a good choice for reading free
eBooks as well. The program features multiple screen orientations, so you can
read in landscape mode, as shown in Figure 11-30, or even flip the text upside-
down if that makes the scroll buttons easier for you to hit while reading. Palm
Reader supports multiple bookmarks, and you can make annotations in the
text. Palm Reader is free, but Palm Digital Media also offers a commercial ver-
sion that adds extra fonts, customizable colors, and a built-in dictionary.
Other readers

Quite a few other readers that support uncompressed Doc files are available
for the Palm OS. Here are a few of the standouts, all of which are available
from Palm Gear:

with no button-pressing or screen-tapping necessary.
 iSilo: The Doc format supports only plain-text files. If you want to create
your own eBooks featuring text with colors, styles, multiple sizes, and
more, iSilo is just the ticket. iSilo files are smaller than Doc files, and
you’ll find several files available online in iSilo format. iSilo reads stan-
dard Doc files, as well.
 TealDoc: This enhanced reader supports standard Doc files, PC-format
text files stored on Memory Sticks, and enhanced TealDoc files. The
TealDoc-format files can include graphics, links, multiple colors, and 
other enhancements that aren’t available in regular Doc files. It includes
TealDocMaker for the PC, a program for creating your own document files.
 WordSmith: This is actually a full-featured commercial word processor,
but the author lets you use it as a Doc-format eBook reader for free. It’s
notable for its font support. It includes easy-to-read, smoothed fonts,
and you can convert any TrueType font on your desktop system to Palm

Listened to a Good Book Lately?
Audible is to audiobooks what iTunes is to digital music. Imagine an online
store with an audiobook selection that’s 100 times what you can find at even
the largest local book superstore. That’s Audible, found at www.audible.
com, a Web site with spoken-word bestsellers ranging from Cold Mountain to
The Da Vinci Code.
Audible doesn’t stop with audiobooks. The service also offers a variety of radio
programs, including such National Public Radio standouts as Car Talk, Fresh

When you have all the software installed, and you’ve purchased a book or
radio program, you’re ready to listen. To transfer a program, use the follow-
ing steps:
1. Launch AudibleManager on your desktop system and start Audible-
Player on your CLIÉ by tapping its icon in the Program Launcher.
The screen shown in Figure 11-32 appears on your CLIÉ.
Be sure that your CLIÉ is connected to your desktop system via cradle

and dropping the program to the CLIÉ window at the bottom of the
AudibleManager window, or by clicking the file once with the mouse
and clicking the Add to Sony CLIÉ Handheld button at the top-left
corner of the screen.
You’re given the option to save files in main memory, to save the files on
a Memory Stick, or to copy the files to a Memory Stick that’s inserted
into a reader on your desktop system.
After you choose where to copy the file, the transfer starts automati-

the menu that appears, you can enable background play, allowing you to
switch to another program while listening to your Audible program. If you
want to extend your battery life while you listen, use the Hold slider to turn
off the screen.
Cars are among the most popular places to listen to audiobooks, but wearing
headphones while you’re driving isn’t safe. If your car has a cassette player,
you can buy a tape adapter at any local stereo or electronics store and plug
that into your CLIÉ. Otherwise, take a look at an FM transmitter, which plugs
into your CLIÉ’s headphone jack and transmits its audio output on an unused
FM radio frequency. I use the SF121 model from Arkon Resources, which works
very well and is relatively inexpensive. You can find information on it at www.
arkon.com.

In this part . . .
T
his is the part where I put you to work. Today’s CLIÉs
let you bring files from all the major office applications
along and even create or download new documents on the
road. In this part, I show you how to use Documents to Go
to view, edit, and create Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files.
You also find out about Picsel Viewer, which lets you view
desktop documents with all their formatting and graphics
intact, and powerOne Personal, which lets you pass on the
old calculator to the kids.
Also, you discover the best third-party productivity pro-
grams and two applications that any Microsoft Outlook
users will want to check out.

Chapter 12
Office on the Go
In This Chapter
 Using Documents To Go to create and edit Microsoft Office files
 Putting the powerful Picsel Viewer to work
 Calculating with the powerOne Personal calculator
“A
h,” you think, “my CLIÉ is great, but I still need to bring my laptop
along to get any real work done. I have a report to finish, numbers
to crunch, a presentation to go over . . . None of that is going to fit in my
pocket.”
As Ed McMahon said to Karnak the Magnificent, “You’re wrong, oh enlight-
ened one!” The Documents To Go program lets you view, edit, and even
create Microsoft Office–compatible files directly on your CLIÉ. And even
better, chances are good that your CLIÉ already includes a copy of this pow-
erful program.
Another weapon in the CLIÉ’s office arsenal is Picsel Viewer, an amazingly
fast program that lets you view (but not edit) Office files and PDF documents
with all their graphics and formatting intact.
Finally, for those quick calculations where a spreadsheet is overkill, try the
powerOne Personal calculator, a powerful little number-cruncher that’s
included on the CD that comes with every CLIÉ.
In this chapter, you get a chance to find out about these applications in
detail. Be sure to check out Chapter 13 for some third-party alternatives as
well, particularly if you’re a heavy Outlook user.
The Lowdown on Documents To Go
Think of Documents To Go as a very small clone of Microsoft Office. The
Professional Edition of the program includes handheld word processing,
spreadsheet, and presentation programs, as well as charting, image display,
and e-mail utilities. At the time this book was written, Sony was shipping the

Professional Edition of the program with all its CLIÉ models except the PEG-
UX50 line, but in the past, it bundled the less expensive Standard Edition
(which includes only the word processing and spreadsheet modules) with its
CLIÉs.
If you didn’t receive Documents To Go with your CLIÉ, or you got the
Standard Edition and want to upgrade to the full Professional Edition, you
can find upgrade and purchase information at www.dataviz.com.
Documents To Go Professional includes the following modules:
 Word To Go: This full-blown word processor can natively read Microsoft
Word DOC files and covert files from WordPerfect, Word Pro,
AppleWorks, and several other word processing formats by using the
included desktop synchronization applications.
 Sheet To Go: This powerful spreadsheet can natively read Microsoft
Excel files, and convert files from Quattro Pro, Lotus 1-2-3, and other
spreadsheets by using the desktop synchronization program.
 Slideshow To Go: This presentation program can display files created
with PowerPoint. Note that it can’t read PowerPoint files directly; you
first have to convert them during HotSync by using the desktop synchro-
nization program.
The Documents To Go program also includes a desktop program designed to
manage file synchronization. This program is available for both Windows and
Macintosh. I focus on the Windows version here, but the Mac version oper-
ates in essentially the same manner.
The desktop application
What makes Documents To Go 6.0 special is its support for native Word and
Excel files. For the first time, you can use your handheld to open documents
and spreadsheets that are saved in their original format on a Memory Stick or
received by e-mail with no translation step necessary.
However, you can likely still find use for the desktop application of Documents
To Go. This handy utility controls how files are transferred to and from your
desktop computer to your CLIÉ.
After installing Documents To Go on your desktop system, you can open 
the desktop application by choosing Start➪Programs➪Documents To Go➪
Documents To Go. The program’s interface, shown in Figure 12-1, is very easy
to use.
188
Part IV: An Office in Your Pocket 

Storing and synchronizing files
When you open the Documents To Go desktop application, you see two
areas, one labeled Handheld and the other labeled Expansion Card. If you’re
lucky enough to have a Memory Stick, you’re better off using the Expansion
Card area to hold your files, rather than the Handheld area, simply because
doing so gives you added flexibility for transferring files in native formats by
e-mail or memory card readers.
Selecting a file to synchronize with your CLIÉ is as simple as dragging and
dropping the file icon on either the Handheld or Expansion Card area. You
can also click the Add icon — the green plus sign (+) in the top-left corner of
the program window — to open a file selection window. These files are
copied to your handheld during the next HotSync, and then Documents To
Go keeps them in sync by automatically updating the CLIÉ version of the file
with any changes made to the desktop version, and vice versa.
When you drag a file into the desktop application, by default it’s set to trans-
fer in the To Go format — that is, a special format used by Documents To Go.
Files in this format are smaller and are faster to load on your CLIÉ, but they
can be loaded only by Documents To Go. Store files in native Word or Excel
format instead if you plan to e-mail them, view them with Picsel Viewer, or
access them by using other CLIÉ programs. You determine how files are
stored by changing the settings in the Details pane, as shown on the right
side of the window in Figure 12-1.
Options in the Details pane
From the top, the following options are available in the Details pane (refer to
Figure 12-1):

Chapter 12: Office on the Go

 Name: The name that will be used for the file on the CLIÉ appears in this
text box.
 Path: This shows where the file is stored on your desktop system. You
can click the path to open a window for the directory containing the file,
which is handy for quick access to a document’s directory when you
want to drag more files over to your CLIÉ.
 Desktop Format: This shows the original file format before translation
during HotSync.
 Size on Desktop: This shows the size of the original file.
 Handheld Format: Here’s where you choose which format to save the
files in. Note that files stored on expansion cards offer additional
options. If you want the smallest file, choose the native To Go format. If
you want greatest compatibility with other programs, choose the native
file format.
 Category: You can categorize files to help locate them quickly.
 Synchronize: Set this to Yes if you want changes made on the version of
the file stored on your desktop system to be sent to the handheld, and
vice versa. If you set it to No, no changes to the file are transferred.
Normally, you want to set Synchronize to Yes. If a file is changed on either
the desktop or handheld, the other version is updated during HotSync. If
you modify the file in both places, two copies are created during HotSync,
one of which reflects the changes made in each location.
 Location: Here you choose whether to copy the file to main memory or
Memory Stick. If you have multiple Memory Sticks, you see their names
listed here, and you can choose which one you want to copy the file to.
The file is transferred the next time that the correct Memory Stick is pre-
sent during a HotSync. If this option is set to Next Available Card, the file
is transferred during the next HotSync as long as any Memory Stick is
present. (Note that you can manually copy Word or Excel files to a
Memory Stick by using a card reader, but the Documents To Go desktop
application doesn’t support this transfer method.)
 Status: This tells you whether changes have been made to the file that
haven’t yet been transferred to your handheld. If this option is set to
Current, the file is up to date, but if it’s set to Needs Sync, the file is
updated during the next HotSync.
Setting preferences
Note that you can change the default formats for files that you add to
Documents To Go, as well as change the default directory where files are
saved. Choose Tools➪Preferences to get to the window shown in Figure 12-2.
190
Part IV: An Office in Your Pocket 

The settings shown in Figure 12-2 are good defaults, spelling out that you want
to store files on Memory Sticks in their native format and that files stored on
the handheld are to be in the more compact Documents To Go format. Note
that the current version of the program doesn’t support presentation files in
native PowerPoint format, so Slideshow To Go is your only option.
Even if you create all your files on the handheld, you still want to configure
the Documents To Go desktop application because you use it to control how
files are transferred from your handheld to your desktop system. Click the
Exchange tab in the Documents To Go Preferences dialog box, and you find
an option to change the directory where files created on the handheld are
stored; the default is your My Documents folder.
When your preferences are set, click OK to return to the main program. Now
you’re ready to HotSync.
Documents To Go on your CLIÉ
To start the Documents To Go program, just tap the Documents icon in the
CLIÉ Program Launcher. The File Selection screen, shown in Figure 12-3,
appears.
Figure 12-2:
Setting the
default
formats for
files that

191
Chapter 12: Office on the Go

Assuming that you’ve HotSynced some files to the CLIÉ already, you see them
listed here. The icon in the first column shows the file type — word process-
ing, spreadsheet, and so on. If you tap the icon, you access a pop-up menu
that contains options for displaying the file’s details, deleting the file, beam-
ing it to another PDA, sending it by e-mail, or moving it between a Memory
Stick and the handheld’s main memory.
The second column displays the filename; just tap this to load the file. The
third column shows the file size, and the fourth column shows HotSync
status. If the column has the red-and-blue HotSync icon in it, the file will be
synchronized with your desktop computer; if it has a dash, it won’t be trans-
ferred during HotSync. You can change the sync status for any file by tapping
in this column.
The final column shows whether a file is stored in handheld memory (no
icon) or on a Memory Stick (a small card icon). You can tap the card icon to
see what directory the file is stored in, which is handy if you plan to access it
directly from a desktop computer.
You can tap any of the column headers to change the sorting order to sort by
file type, name, size, sync status, or location. Tap the drop-down menu arrow
next to the Show option at the bottom of the screen to display only files of a
certain type.
To create a new document, tap the New button in the lower-left corner of the
screen and select the file type. For more on the kinds of file types available,
check out the next few sections.
Word To Go
Selecting either Word To Go or Microsoft Word from the New button launches
the Word To Go module. The program offers a fairly decent suite of word 
processing features, although some advanced Word capabilities (such as
Figure 12-3:
The main
Documents
To Go
screen.
192
Part IV: An Office in Your Pocket 

inserting new graphics) are absent. What makes the current version of
Documents To Go extremely useful is its ability to maintain formatting that it
doesn’t directly support. Any graphics, advanced formatting, and so on in a
file transferred from the desktop system is maintained in the final document,
even if those features can’t be added or edited on the CLIÉ.
The functions of the Word to Go button controls, shown in Figure 12-4, should
be obvious to anyone who’s used Word on the desktop.
Across the top are buttons for bold, italic, and underlined text, followed by
paragraph alignment, bullet item, and numbered item buttons. Across the
bottom, to the right of the Done button, you find font selection, paragraph
format, search/replace, and bookmark buttons. The bookmark function is
handy when you use Word To Go to read eBooks (Word To Go supports the
Palm Doc format) or for quickly jumping back and forth between sections
when working on a long document.
You find additional functions on the pull-down menus, which appear when
you tap the Menu soft button. The File menu offers a word count function as
well as a spell checker. The Insert button lets you add tables, hyperlinks, and
more, and the Format menu gives you control over indentation.
Although you can create a word processing document with Graffiti 2 or your
CLIÉ’s keyboard, consider plugging in a larger folding keyboard when creating
lengthy documents. See Chapter 17 for more details on add-on keyboards.
After you finish creating or editing a document, tap the Done button. You’re
given the opportunity to save the document in its original file, save as a new
file, or discard your changes. If you’re saving a file for the first time or saving
it as a new file, you’re given a chance to name the file, choose its format
(Word To Go, generic Palm Doc, or Microsoft Word), and whether to save it
on a Memory Stick or in main memory.
Figure 12-4:
Word To Go
in action.
193
Chapter 12: Office on the Go

You can save a file in Palm Doc format if you want to share it with other hand-
held owners who don’t have Documents To Go or if you want to create your
own eBooks. Be aware, though, that Palm Doc files contain no formatting, so
you lose all bold, italics, images, tables, and so on.
Sheet To Go
Sheet To Go looks familiar to any Windows spreadsheet user. You can have
multiple columns of text and numeric data, process ranges of data with
sophisticated formulas, and so on. The biggest limitation is that Sheet To Go
doesn’t support macros or scripting. Also, if a spreadsheet uses a formula
that’s not supported by Documents To Go, it’s loaded in a locked, read-only
mode. That way you can still reference it, but you won’t find yourself in the
unenviable position of making changes to a spreadsheet only to discover that
your results were incorrect due to an unsupported formula.
As shown in Figure 12-5, Sheet To Go can fit a lot of data on a single screen —
thanks to the teeny fonts used.
Sheet To Go offers three Zoom levels, which control font size. To adjust the
zoom, tap the Menu soft button and choose File➪Zoom from the menu that
appears. The new display shows three options. The Small option fits a ton of
data on the screen at once but uses tiny fonts that require excellent vision to
read. The Medium option is probably the best setting for most users. The
Large option provides big, easy-to-read fonts but fits a mere three rows and
nine columns on-screen at once. Select the check box next to the size of your
choice and tap the OK button to return to your spreadsheet.

194
Part IV: An Office in Your Pocket 

Below the sheet is a field where you can enter or edit the value contained in a
spreadsheet cell. Tapping the fx button brings up a list of basic numeric oper-
ators. Tap the fx button in that list to bring up a list of supported mathemati-
cal and data functions to select.
When you finish entering a value or formula, tap the green check mark to
confirm it. The spreadsheet automatically recalculates.
Use the arrows at the bottom center of the Sheet To Go screen to navigate
around the spreadsheet. Also note that you can tap any row or column head-
ing to automatically adjust its size, free a column, sort data, and so on.
Although you wouldn’t want to manage Boeing’s corporate finances on the
Sheet To Go program — it starts to slow down with large, complex spread-
sheets — it does offer a surprising amount of spreadsheet functionality for a
PDA application.
Slideshow To Go
Slideshow To Go is the weakest of the major applications because you can’t
create or edit native PowerPoint format files with it, and files that you do
create are very basic.
Although the program does support graphics, multiple colors, and other
fancy formatting features, you can bring these into the program only by con-
verting a PowerPoint presentation by using the Documents To Go desktop
program. Files created from scratch are far more basic.
You can cheat and create files with some basic generic graphics and format-
ting by creating a template file (a file that contains the background graphics
and formatting of a document without the actual data or content) with graph-
ics on your desktop system and then syncing the template file to the CLIÉ. You
can then modify the template file on your CLIÉ and save it under a new name.
The Slideshow To Go interface is extremely simple. You see three icons
across the top of the main screen, as shown in Figure 12-6. You can use these
icons to switch between Edit, Preview, and Presentation Notes modes.
 Edit mode: This mode shows your presentation as an outline. To add
items to the current slide, tap the Menu soft button and choose Insert➪
New Bullet Item from the menu that appears. To create a new slide,
choose Insert➪New Slide to start with a blank slide, or Insert➪Duplicate
Slide to create a copy of the current slide, which you can then edit.
Tap the middle icon at the top of the main Slideshow To Go screen to
switch to Preview mode, as shown in Figure 12-7.
195
Chapter 12: Office on the Go

 Preview mode: This mode lets you look at your slides in their final form
to preview and proofread them. The plus sign (+) button at the bottom
of the screen lets you zoom in to a magnified view.
 Notes mode: Tapping the third icon at the top of the screen lets you
create or view presentation notes for the current slide. The drop-down
menu arrow in the top-right corner lets you quickly jump to any slide by
tapping its title.
To view your final presentation, tap the Menu soft button and choose Slide
Show➪View Show from the menu that appears. Tap the Start Timer button —
shown at the bottom of the screen in Figure 12-8 — to start an on-screen
stopwatch, which is handy if you’re rehearsing a timed presentation.

You can move between slides by tapping the slide, by using the Up and Down
hard buttons, or by tapping the pop-up slide menu in the lower-right corner
of the screen.
You can actually use your CLIÉ to give a presentation on a projection screen
or large monitor. You need MARGI’s Presenter-to-Go Memory Stick, which
adds a VGA output to the CLIÉ. Documents To Go can convert PowerPoint
presentations directly to Presenter-to-Go format during HotSync.
Getting a Quick Look with Picsel Viewer
Most CLIÉs now include a built-in copy of Picsel Viewer. This innovative pro-
gram displays Word, Excel, PowerPoint, text, JPEG, and HTML files at blazing
speed. And unlike Documents To Go, Picsel Viewer shows Portable Document
Format ( PDF, a common format for manuals and other electronic documents)
with all graphics and formatting intact. As you scroll around a page with your
stylus, whipping the virtual paper left and right, you’ll marvel at how fast
your CLIÉ can update the screen.
When you first load Picsel Viewer, you see the introductory document, as
shown in Figure 12-9.
Place your stylus on the page and drag it around. Notice that the page not
only moves with blazing speed, but it even has inertia — it keeps moving
after you release, gradually slowing to a stop. This is mostly a gimmick, but it
does help when scrolling around very large pages.

Chapter 12: Office on the Go

The screen has just three controls: two icons in the upper-right corner that
are for zooming in and out on the page, and the Carousel icon in the lower-
right corner. Tap the Carousel icon in the lower-right corner to bring up the
Picsel Viewer interface, an innovative if highly nonstandard group of icons.
You can see what each icon does in Figure 12-10.
You can also pop up a short description of each icon by holding the stylus
down on it for a couple seconds. For more detailed help, tap the question
mark in the upper-right corner.
To open a new file in Picsel Viewer, tap the Folder View icon. The interface
will be replaced by a Memory Stick icon. (Note: Picsel Viewer can display
only files that are stored on a Memory Stick.) Tap the Memory Stick icon to
get a list of folders on your card. Your screen should look something like
Figure 12-11.
To view the contents of any folder, just tap it. A couple likely candidates for
files to view are the DCIM folder, where your digital images are stored, and
the Documents folder, where Documents To Go stores its native-format Word
and Excel files. When you find a file to view, tap its icon to display it.
A couple of methods for quickly navigating to often-used files are available.
You can set a bookmark for a file by tapping the Carousel icon to bring up the
Picsel Viewer interface and tapping the Add Bookmark icon while viewing the

Crunching Numbers with 
powerOne Personal
Like all Palm OS handhelds, your CLIÉ has a built-in calculator that’s handy
for basic number-crunching. However, Sony includes a far more powerful cal-
culator on your CLIÉ’s Installation CD: powerOne Personal. This super calcu-
lator is located on your CD under Additional Software/Personal Productivity.
Tap the Install button and follow the instructions on the screen to install the
calculator.
Note that a demo version of the even heavier-duty powerOne Finance 
calculator, which includes loan and investment functions, is located under
Additional Software/Business Utilities on the Installation CD. This is a trial
version, however, and you can use it only for a limited time.
As shown in Figure 12-12, the powerOne Personal basic interface looks just
like that of a high-end traditional calculator. But the program doesn’t stop at
division and multiplication. It includes everyday business functions, such as
calculating markup and profit margins, as well as the ability to calculate
ranges between dates. You can access these by tapping the Business and
Calendar buttons at the top of the screen.
The calculator offers Normal, Scientific, and Engineering display modes, which
you can alter by tapping the Menu soft button and choosing Preferences from
the menu that appears. Although the interface seems basic, it has more func-
tions than meet the eye. Pressing the Func key gives you access to about 20
functions spread across math, trig, and num lists. These range from logarith-
mic and trig functions to powers, roots, and percentages. A few functions are
illustrated in Figure 12-13.

Making powerOne Personal the default calculator
After you try powerOne Personal, you won’t
want to go back to the stock Palm OS calcula-
tor. So why not set it as the default calculator
that appears when you tap the Calculator soft
button next to the Graffiti area?
To set powerOne Personal as the default, tap
the Prefs icon in Program Launcher, and then
tap the drop-down menu arrow in the upper-
right corner of the screen and select Buttons.
Just tap the drop-down menu arrow to the right
of the calculator icon and select powerOne
Personal from the list, as shown in the follow-
ing figure. Now when you tap the calculator
button, you have instant access to the most
powerful calculator on your CLIÉ.

t’s the kind of twist you might expect from Hitchcock: At the end of the
film, the CLIÉ turns out to be a much better handheld for the Microsoft
Office user than PDAs based on Microsoft’s own Pocket PC operating system.
(And the butler was done in by the vicar’s daughter.) Why? Because he
rejected her. Oh, you mean the CLIE. It’s because all Pocket PCs ship with
very basic versions of Word and Excel, so programmers have little incentive
to try to reinvent the wheel.
The CLIÉ and other Palm OS PDAs, on the other hand, don’t include Word and
Excel support as part of the operating system. So that sets talented program-
mers loose to try to create better handheld office applications — competition
is a wonderful thing. Although these office applications aren’t free, they’re
much more full-featured than the freebies that are included with Pocket PCs,
so you’re not likely to mind spending a few bucks.
Best of all, you can take each of these programs for a spin before you buy
them. Just download the demo version from the Web site and try it on your
CLIÉ. If you like it, simply return to the site, pay for the program, and you’re
given an unlock code that allows the program to continue functioning after
the evaluation period ends.
In this chapter, I take a look at some of the best productivity applications
available for the CLIÉ. If you’re skipping around the book, reading it back-
ward, or reading this one first because it’s “Lucky Chapter 13,” be sure to
check out Documents To Go in Chapter 12. Documents To Go is included with
many CLIÉs and is as worthy of consideration as any of these programs, even
if you didn’t get it for free.

Quickoffice Premier
www.quickoffice.com
Quickoffice Premier is a full-featured Office suite that includes word process-
ing (Quickword), spreadsheet (Quicksheet), charting (Quickchart), and pre-
sentation support (Quickpoint). Though its feature set is similar to the
Documents To Go set, it has some differences that might make it a better
alternative for some users.
Like Documents To Go, Quickoffice supports reading Word and Excel files
stored on Memory Sticks. However, it can also read PowerPoint files in their
original format, which is something that Document To Go can’t do. This could
be really handy if you’re on the road and someone needs to send you an
updated presentation file by e-mail.
As you can see in Figure 13-1, the Quicksheet spreadsheet has an interface
similar to Excel’s with the addition of some handy features, such as a pop-up
list of math operators. Quicksheet is acknowledged as the most powerful
spreadsheet currently available for the CLIÉ. It offers over 80 functions, sup-
port for spreadsheets containing up to 996 rows and 254 columns, and the
ability to link to shared Excel files on a network.
Quickoffice includes a bundled copy of the PrintBoy printer utility. Most CLIÉ
programs can’t print — you have to transfer the files back to your desktop
system to print them out. But what if you’re on the road with just your CLIÉ?
PrintBoy lets you print directly from your CLIÉ by using infrared, Bluetooth,
Wi-Fi, or a modem connection.

Quickoffice is an excellent but not unusual application. However, the folks
behind Quickoffice sell a very interesting version that offers a truly unique
way for mobile workers to get their jobs done. Quickoffice Conference is a
multi-user office suite that lets multiple handheld users collaborate on the
same documents wirelessly.
This means that a group of wireless-equipped CLIÉ and Palm users in differ-
ent offices or even different countries can collaborate on spreadsheets or
other documents. “So, Bob, what happens if we allocate the widget budget to
research on framistats instead?” Change numbers, and everyone else sees
the same change reflected in their spreadsheets.
A free Quickoffice Conference viewer application is also available. It can be
used to let people watch the documents being altered, but the watchers can’t
make changes.
A truly innovative and new way to work, Quickoffice Conference supports
infrared, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi connections.
You can find information on Quickoffice Conference at the following URL:
www.mobl.com/software/solutions/es_conference.html
Mobile Office 2004 Professional
www.mobi-systems.com
Because Mobile Office 2004 Professional doesn’t include a spreadsheet, it’s
worth looking into only if you’re primarily interested in other office functions
besides number-crunching. Here’s a look at what you do get:
 Mobile Word 2004: This is the most what you see is what you get word
processor on the Palm. It has a full suite of text-formatting tools, and it
displays fonts, styles, images, tables, and other advanced formatting fea-
tures with aplomb. The only downside to the program is that you have
to convert Word files back and forth during HotSync — it doesn’t have
native file support on the handheld. It includes the QuickSpell spell-
checker program, which runs in the background and can work with
other applications, such as your e-mail program. Mobile Word also bun-
dles QuickWrite, a utility designed to allow you to enter words much
faster with the stylus by popping up the words that it thinks you’ve

 Mobile Access 2004: Although the name implies that this database pro-
gram interfaces with the Microsoft Access desktop database, it’s actually
designed to synchronize with Microsoft Excel. This is a good thing for
anyone who finds it easier to keep databases in Excel than in the more
complex Microsoft Access. This powerful handheld database includes a
forms designer (shown in Figure 13-2), sophisticated queries, and the
ability to filter results.
 Mobile Paint 2004: A full-featured graphics editor and paint program,
Mobile Paint includes over 25 painting tools, the ability to place text on
images, unlimited Undo functions, and more. It’s far more sophisticated
than the Photo Editor application that’s included with some CLIÉ
models. You can use it to touch up digital images or just create fun doo-
dles like the one in Figure 13-3.

 Mobile Money 2004: A budgeting and money-management program,
Mobile Money lets you track your finances directly on your handheld.
Money managers on your desktop system are great, but having the abil-
ity to enter transactions when you’re out of the house means that you’re
less likely to forget to do it. The program can synchronize date with
Quicken, Microsoft Money, and Excel.
If you’re not a spreadsheet user, Mobile Office 2004 Professional is a heck of a
deal for its relatively low price.
WordSmith
www.bluenomad.com
If the only handheld office application that you really use is a word processor,
WordSmith is the program for you. Portions of this book were created with
this miniature word processor, in fact.
Like Mobile Word 2004, WordSmith relies on the HotSync process to translate
Word files to handheld format — it can’t read Microsoft Word files directly.
Although it doesn’t create or import graphics or tables, it does support the
typical formatting that you use in everyday writing — bold, italics, centered
text, bullet lists, and so on. Note, however, that some features get lost in
translation. For instance, if you have graphics in your document, they’re
stripped out during the transfer process.
So given that other programs don’t have these limitations, why am I even
covering WordSmith? Well, if you’re just looking for a tool to write, rather
than create fancy documents, WordSmith is hard to beat. It’s extremely fast
and very easy to use. It supports a text display option called FineType that
removes the jaggy edges from the fonts that it displays, which can make long
writing sessions on the small screen much easier on your eyes. (See Figure
13-4 for an example of FineType at work.) You can convert any TrueType font
on your Windows PC to a FineType font for use on your CLIÉ.
WordSmith also has a few nice bonus features. It replaces the built-in Memo
Pad application so that you can use its more sophisticated editing tools when
creating standard Palm OS memos. With its support for the Palm Doc format
and its smooth font rendering, it makes a great reader for non-copy-protected
eBooks.

Outlook Alternatives: Beyond 
Contacts and KeySuite
www.dataviz.com
www.chapura.com
If you’re a serious user of Microsoft Outlook, you might find the CLIÉ’s built-in
information management applications limited because they support only a
subset of the fields that are available in Microsoft Outlook. Luckily, two
superb alternatives are available for Outlook users, and they bring all your
important data to the CLIÉ.
Both DataViz’s Beyond Contacts and Chapura’s KeySuite replicate all the
major functionality of Outlook right on your CLIÉ. They replace the built-in
personal information manager programs with new versions that support all
19 phone number fields and all 3 address listings supported by Outlook, as
well as Outlook-style categories and the various other fields in Outlook that
aren’t present in the CLIÉ’s Address Book, Date Book, and so on.
The biggest difference between Beyond Contacts and KeySuite is the inter-
face. As shown in Figure 13-5, Beyond Contacts offers an Outlook-style Today
screen that gives you a quick look at pending appointments, To Dos, and
unread e-mails.
KeySuite, on the other hand, offers four independent applications, each of
which replaces one of the built-in information manager programs. Figure 13-6
shows the Contacts module. Although these programs don’t share a common
front end, as do the modules in Beyond Contacts, you can still link data
between the various functions, such as associating contacts with a scheduled
meeting.

Note that both programs take over the HotSync process between your desk-
top and the handheld, so the information in the built-in Address Book, Date
Book, To Do List, and Memo Pad is no longer updated; you need to use
Beyond Contacts and KeySuite instead.
Which one should you choose? Beyond Contacts feels more like Outlook on
your desktop, and KeySuite has more of the feel of a traditional Palm OS pro-
gram. Trial versions of both are available online. You can find Beyond
Contacts at www.dataviz.com and KeySuite at www.chapura.com.

Chapter 14
All about Memory
In This Chapter
 Discovering memory basics
 Understanding file management
 Making your Memory Stick think it’s a disk drive
“You can’t have everything,” says comedian Steven Wright. “Where
would you put it?” Why, put it on Memory Sticks, of course! Every
CLIÉ includes a Memory Stick slot, which lets you add up to a whopping giga-
byte of memory. Although the built-in memory offers enough space for con-
tacts, appointments, and quite a few add-on applications, you still have plenty
of reasons to consider buying a Memory Stick for your CLIÉ:
 Music: MP3 music files can be stored only on Memory Sticks.
 Video: You can carry around full-screen videos — home movies of the
kids or your favorite TV shows. The files are huge, and they need the
space afforded by Memory Sticks.
 Room to grow: Although the CLIÉ’s built-in memory can hold a lot of
data, if you start adding third-party programs, shooting pictures with
the built-in camera, and making voice recordings, you can fill the
memory before you know it. Even an inexpensive 128MB Memory Stick
should eliminate any chances of running out of room for a long time.
 Interchangeability: If you have a camera, camcorder, or MP3 player that
uses Memory Sticks, you can pop the stick out of that device and into
your CLIÉ to access its files, view pictures, play MPEG-4 videos, or play
MP3 music.
 Security: If your battery dies or your CLIÉ has a severe crash, you can
lose the contents of your main memory. As with the Backup and Internal
Media memory found in the UX series, Memory Stick data survives dead
batteries and the worst crashes.
Whether or not you equip your CLIÉ with a Memory Stick, you still want to
take advantage of some basic memory-management tricks, such as how to
delete a freeware game that you downloaded and haven’t played since last
December.

Memory 101
You might encounter the following kinds of memory when using the CLIÉ,
depending on the model that you own:
 Handheld memory: This is built-in memory in your CLIÉ. It’s the area
where programs actually run and where your personal information man-
ager records are stored, and it’s the fastest memory for launching appli-
cations and accessing data. However, it relies on your CLIÉ’s battery to
maintain its data, and its contents can be lost in the rare event of a
severe crash.
 Memory Sticks: Sony’s design for a memory card, these cards are
slightly smaller than a pack of chewing gum and come in several vari-
eties. Memory Sticks are available not only from Sony, but from other
companies as well, such as the SanDisk card shown in Figure 14-1.
 Internal Media memory: So far, this has appeared only on the CLIÉ PEG-
UX40 and PEG-UX50 models, which have 30.2MB of Internal Media stor-
age. This memory is built in, but it acts like a Memory Stick. Programs
treat it like it’s a memory card, and it can survive power failures and
hard resets.
Figure 14-1:
Memory
Sticks are
available
from a
variety of
manufac-
turers,

214
Part V: Reaching Outside the CLIÉ Box 

 Backup memory: This is so far found only on the PEG-UX40 and PEG-
UX50 models. It provides 16MB of memory that’s used to back up the
contents of the units’ Handheld memory. For more on the UX Backup
memory, see Chapter 19.
 CompactFlash memory: The PEG-NX73V and PEG-NX80V both feature
a CompactFlash expansion slot that’s designed primarily for using the
CLIÉ Wi-Fi card. However, you can also use the slot with a CompactFlash
memory card, such as the huge 4GB card shown in Figure 14-2. Note that
many of the built-in CLIÉ applications don’t support this memory, so
you’re better off using a Memory Stick. The PEG-NX60V and PEG-NX70V
also boast CompactFlash slots, but you must purchase third-party soft-
ware to use memory cards in the slot. On these models, the slot was offi-
cially supported only by Sony for Wi-Fi use.
I focus on Handheld memory and Memory Sticks in this chapter because
every CLIÉ sports those. If your CLIÉ has Internal Media or CompactFlash
Memory, it essentially works the same way as Memory Sticks, though not all
programs will recognize it.
When buying memory, keep in mind that all Memory Sticks are not created
equal. Various Memory Sticks are available. The good news is that all work
with your CLIÉ. Still, I recommend being familiar with all the types out there
so that you don’t spend more money than necessary.

Chapter 14: All about Memory

The following list is a rundown of Memory Stick models, present and future.
Some of these designs are being phased out in favor of newer models, but
you can find the most current models at major electronics and office supply
stores.
 Memory Stick: The standard Memory Stick is purplish in color. These
are available in sizes up to 128MB and are good for basic storage. It’s the
least expensive Memory Stick model and is fine for CLIÉ use, but it’s not
the fastest type.
 MagicGate Memory Stick: These white Memory Sticks are similar to
basic Memory Sticks but with the addition of the ability to copy-protect
data that’s stored on the stick — which protects music publishers but
just makes for more potential hassles for you. They’re generally more
expensive than the purple sticks, and they offer no real advantages. The
only reason to buy a white MagicGate Memory Stick is if, for some
reason, you want to listen to songs in Sony’s ATRAC3 music format.
 Memory Stick Pro: The original Memory Sticks were limited to 128MB.
Memory Stick Pro cards eliminate this restriction and are available at
sizes up to 2GB. They’re also much faster than the original Memory
Sticks, reducing the time to copy or load files. They include MagicGate
support for copy protection without adding a price premium. Note the
MagicGate logo in Figure 14-3. All Palm OS 5-based CLIÉs can use Memory
Stick Pro cards, but some older models require a software upgrade from
Sony’s support site.
 Memory Stick Select: Designed for older CLIÉs, cameras, and other Sony
products that can’t be updated to support Memory Stick Pro cards, the
Memory Stick Select cards offer 256MB of storage by essentially cram-
ming two 128MB cards into one Memory Stick. You have to flip a physi-
cal switch to swap between the two 128MB memory banks, which is
awfully inconvenient. If your CLIÉ supports Memory Stick Pro cards,
they’re a much better option.
 Memory Stick Duo: These smaller cards — about the size of the Secure
Digital cards used by PalmOne-brand PDAs and many cameras — are
designed for very compact devices. They include an adapter, as shown
in Figure 14-4, which lets you use them in standard Memory Stick slots.
Buy one of these only if you own another device that requires them.
 Updated Memory Stick: You can tell these from the original Memory
Sticks because they’re dark blue and now feature the MagicGate logo,
signifying that Sony’s digital rights management copy protection is sup-
ported on the cards. These are replacing the old purple sticks on the
market. Along with the inclusion of MagicGate support, the new sticks
are somewhat faster.
216
Part V: Reaching Outside the CLIÉ Box 

Phew! That’s a lot of Memory Sticks! However, unless you’re worried about
sharing the stick between two devices, or you’re using an older Palm OS 4
CLIÉ, you really don’t even have to make a choice. If you’re looking for a card
supporting 32 to 128MB, buy one of the new dark blue updated Memory
Sticks. Otherwise, buy a Memory Stick Pro card.
What about capacity? Here are a few general numbers that you can use when
calculating how large a card you need:
 Music: A minute of MP3 music recorded at 128 Kbps (the most common
quality) takes about 1MB. You can fit about two hours of music on a
128MB Memory Stick if nothing else is on there.
 Video: A minute of video at the CLIÉ’s standard motion video quality fills
about 2MB, and high-quality video fills about 3.75MB per minute. If you
want to watch an entire movie stored on Memory Stick, you want to
spring for at least a 256MB card. Get a 512MB card if you plan to use
high quality.

217
Chapter 14: All about Memory

 Photos: Images shot with the VGA-resolution camera included on cur-
rent CLIÉ models are typically less than 150K in size, so even the small-
est 32MB Memory Stick holds hundreds of shots. If you also plan to use
the card in a dedicated digital camera, keep in mind that the size of the
images varies depending on the resolution of the camera. A 4-megapixel
camera generates shots that typically run about 1.5 to 2MB in size, but
an uncompressed 8-megapixel image on Sony’s high-end DSC-F828
camera can fill a whopping 16MB.
 Programs: Palm OS programs are pleasantly compact. If you’re just look-
ing for extra program storage and room to back up your CLIÉ and you
don’t plan to, say, download every game known to man, a 64MB card
should suffice.
Now that the basics are out of the way, I look at how to manage memory.
File Management
Okay, the previous section establishes what kind of memory your CLIÉ has
and demystifies the various flavors of Memory Sticks. Now I show you how to
put that memory to good use!
When you install a Palm OS program or its related data file, you’re given a
choice whether to put it in Handheld memory or on a Memory Stick. Put the
programs that you use most often in Handheld memory because they load
faster and are always available even if you remove the Memory Stick. For
more on how to install files, see Chapter 3.
So you know how to get files into your CLIÉ. But what if you want to move
them from Handheld memory to a Memory Stick? Or even delete them com-
pletely? No problem. You can perform basic file management from the
Program Launcher, and Sony includes the CLIÉ Files utility for more sophisti-
cated file-management tasks.
Deleting, copying, and moving files
At times, you might need to move files around or trash a stale old program
that’s outlived its usefulness. Doing so makes room for fresh, new programs.
The easiest and safest way to do this is by using the menu commands in the
Program Launcher. Although the menus are different in CLIÉ Launcher com-
pared to the standard Program Launcher, as illustrated in Figure 14-5, the
actual file manipulation commands are identical.
First, look at the Delete command. Tap the Menu soft button and then choose
App➪Delete. You see the window in Figure 14-6.
218
Part V: Reaching Outside the CLIÉ Box 

At the top of the screen are options that display the currently selected memory
area and how much space is currently being used. By default, the window
allows you to delete files from Handheld memory. If you want to delete from a
Memory Stick or Internal Media, just tap the drop-down menu arrow next to
the Delete From option and select the memory area that you want to work
with. (Note that Memory Sticks are identified by their card names.)
Deleting a file couldn’t be simpler. Just scroll through the list until you find
the program or data file that you want to delete, tap it to highlight it, and
finally tap the Delete button. The program asks you to confirm that you really
want to delete the file. Tap Yes.
When deleting programs, note that they might have associated data files as
well. For instance, in Figure 14-6, you see WordToGo and WordToGoFonts
listed. The second file is related to the first one, so you’d want to delete both
if you were deleting the WordToGo program.
Before deleting any file, make a backup with a backup program like MSBackup
or by HotSyncing your CLIÉ. That way, if you make a mistake, you have
another copy that you can restore. If you accidentally delete a file, you can
find it your Palm Desktop user directory, typically C:\Program Files\Palm\
yourusername\Backup. Locate the file that you accidentally deleted and
double-click it to add it to the Install queue. Note that you must do this before
you HotSync again; the file will be removed from your Backup directory during
the next sync.

You can find
the Copy
and Delete
commands

219
Chapter 14: All about Memory

You can also use the Program Launcher to move files between Handheld
memory and a Memory Stick. This is useful if you need to free up more
Handheld memory by moving files to a card or if you want to move files
to Handheld memory before removing the card.
For some reason, the CLIÉ doesn’t include an actual Move command. Rather,
you have to copy the file and then delete it manually. It’s rather annoying,
since you’re far more likely to want to move a file from one place to another
than to need it in two places. Still, moving a file is a fairly easy process: Copy
it to its new location, and then use the Delete command to zap the original.
To copy a file, tap the Menu soft button and choose App➪Copy from the
menu that appears. At the top of the Copy window, illustrated in Figure 14-7,
is a pair of drop-down menu arrows for specifying the source and destination
for the copy. Note that the Copy To option is the destination directory, where
you want the file to end up. The From option is the source directory. This
order seems reversed because most programs put the source directory at the
top, but the labels make the procedure obvious.
On typical CLIÉs with only Handheld and Memory Stick storage, you just
need to select the source to change the destination to the only possible loca-
tion. If you have a UX series unit with Internal Media memory or an NX unit
with a CompactFlash memory card, you need to make sure that you select
the proper destination location because more than one possibility exists.
After you set your source and destination directories, just tap the file that
you want to copy and tap the Copy button at the bottom of the screen. The
CLIÉ has the smarts to put the files in the right place on the Memory Stick.
Programs typically go in the /Palm/Launcher directory, and data files usu-
ally end up in the /Programs/programname directory, where programname is
the program that actually uses that data file.
Figure 14-6:
The
Program
Launcher

window in

220
Part V: Reaching Outside the CLIÉ Box 

Note that on the Copy window some files have a padlock icon next to them.
These files are system files or copy-protected commercial programs, and
they can’t be copied or moved to another directory.
After the copy is complete, you’re returned to the Copy window so that you
can copy additional files. When you finish copying files, tap Done. At this
point, you might want to return to the Delete screen and delete the originals.
This is easy enough, but what if you want to copy or delete multiple files at
once? That’s where CLIÉ Files comes in.
Advanced file management: CLIÉ Files
CLIÉ Files is a full-fledged file manager (similar to Windows Explorer on your
desktop system) that gives you full control over copying, moving, and delet-
ing files.
Be aware that with this control come more opportunities to mess up. When
you delete a program by using Program Launcher, for instance, the system is
smart enough to delete related data files, as well. CLIÉ Files gives you individ-
ual control over what you delete and where you move files. This means that
you could unintentionally delete a program and leave stray data files lying
around taking up memory. You could also accidentally move a program file to
a spot on the Memory Stick where it can’t be launched. So until you’re
absolutely certain which files you want to manipulate, stick with the Program
Launcher file-management commands.
Figure 14-7:
The
Program
Launcher

221
Chapter 14: All about Memory

Figure 14-8 gives you an overview of the various CLIÉ Files functions. At the
very top of the screen is a status line that shows you how much memory is
free. To the right of that is a drop-down menu arrow that lets you choose
which memory area to work with.
The file information line below the status line shows the current directory
(if you’re working with a Memory Stick) or the types of files being shown (if
you’re working with Handheld memory). Below this line is the File List area.
At the very bottom of the screen are icons that let you select which area of
memory to work with (the icons duplicate the functionality of the drop-down
menu arrow at top-right corner) and the File Command buttons.
To copy, move, or delete a group of files, simply tap the check boxes next to
the files to select them, and then tap the appropriate command. If you’re
copying from Handheld memory to a Memory Stick, the Directory List screen
appears.
If you’re copying a program, it should typically go in the Palm/Launcher
directory, shown in Figure 14-9. Data files normally go in subdirectories of the
Programs directory, but under normal circumstances, those should be
copied or moved by using the program that they were created in.
When working with files in Handheld memory, you can tap the file information
line of the main CLIÉ Files screen to filter which files are displayed. It defaults
to All Databases, which shows a rather cluttered list of all files in the handheld.
If you tap the line and select Application, the display changes to show only pro-
grams. If you’re trying to clean up all files related to a particular program, the
Figure 14-8:
CLIÉ Files
is an
advanced
file
manager.
222
Part V: Reaching Outside the CLIÉ Box 

Creator Group option is just the ticket. In the All Databases view, select the pro-
gram that you plan to delete or one of its data files. Then select Creator Group
from the filter list. Now only files related to that program are shown in the File
List area. (See Figure 14-10.) You can now select them for deletion or archiving
to a Memory Stick.
Using Your Memory Stick as a Disk Drive
When it comes to transferring Palm OS programs and their data to your CLIÉ,
HotSync rules the roost. It’s easy to use, and you can just tap the button and
walk away.
Figure 14-10:

files related

Figure 14-9:

223
Chapter 14: All about Memory

When it comes to large files, though, HotSync doesn’t hold up as well.
Transferring an hour’s worth of MP3 songs or a large animation file can take
forever. Well, okay, by forever, I mean more than a few minutes. But in today’s
instant-gratification world, who can stand a process that might take (gasp)
five or ten minutes?
These large files are always stored on Memory Sticks, so the solution is easy:
just copy the file directly to the Memory Stick by mounting it on your desk-
top system as a disk drive, leaving HotSync out of the process completely. 
In fact, even some of Sony’s own programs do this. Image Converter, for
instance, requires you to specify a drive letter for your Memory Stick before
you can install files.
You can go about this in two ways. The first is to insert your Memory Stick
directly into a reader connected to your computer. Some desktop systems
(particularly Sony VIAO computers) and printers have Memory Stick slots
built in. If yours doesn’t, you can purchase an inexpensive USB Memory Stick
drive such as the SanDisk ImageMate. With either of these solutions, the
Memory Stick works just like a giant floppy disk drive — plug it in, and it
appears in My Computer as a disk that you can work with just like a floppy or
hard disk.
You don’t have to use an add-on card reader, though. Your CLIÉ can do
double duty as a card reader by using the Data Import program, which lets
you mount the CLIÉ’s Memory Stick slot as a disk drive on your computer.
Before using Data Import, you must install the Data Export driver on your
desktop system. It’s located in the CLIÉ Utilities listing on the CD that came
with your handheld. Data Export runs automatically when the CLIÉ is con-
nected, so after you install it, you don’t need to manually run anything on
your desktop system to take advantage of it.
When you’re ready to copy files to or from your Memory Stick, just connect
the CLIÉ’s HotSync cable or cradle, and then tap the Data Import icon in
Program Launcher. When the program starts, tap the Connect button at the
bottom of the Data Import screen, as shown in Figure 14-11.
If you’re running Windows XP, a window pops up and offers you the chance
to copy photos, play music on the card, or to open the card folder to view
and copy files. On XP and other operating systems, the card appears as an
additional drive in My Computer.
Table 14-1 lists some of the common directories where you can find various
CLIÉ files.

hances are that you don’t live in a solitary shack in the hills of South
Dakota, cut off from everyone around you. (If you do, where on earth did
you find this book? Did you pick it up off a geek wandering in the wilder-
ness?) People thrive from connections to the outside world — and so does
your CLIÉ. Just as the Internet turned personal computers from solitary work-
stations into amazing tools that can be used for e-mail, chatting, and impor-
tant research such as tracking the color of Christina Aguilera’s hair, wireless
networking transforms the CLIÉ into an amazing tool for sharing data and on-
the-spot communications.
Even if your CLIÉ doesn’t include a wireless radio, you don’t want to skip this
chapter. Every CLIÉ includes an infrared port that’s designed to allow wire-
less beaming of data. At business conferences and even social events, beam-
ing contact information is the chic replacement for swapping business cards.
Beam Me Data, Scotty!
Sorry, but it’s a rule that every technology book has to include at least one
Star Trek reference. But your CLIÉ in many ways has already surpassed the
Tricorder technology used by Captain Kirk and company. The CLIÉ is smaller,
and even the Star Trek writers didn’t foresee a technology as useful as beam-
ing data from one device to another. Your CLIÉ includes an infrared transmit-
ter port that can both send and receive data — using invisible light! Talk
about Star Trek!

The great thing about beaming is that if you have a use for beaming data in a
certain application, that application most likely supports it. In Address Book,
you can beam a single record or an entire category. Date Book lets you beam
individual appointments. CLIÉ Camera and CLIÉ Viewer both support sending
photos. The only requirement is that the receiving handheld have a program
that can read the data being sent. That’s not an issue with the built-in infor-
mation manager applications but might be with some of the multimedia appli-
cations like CLIÉ Camera because some Palm OS PDAs might not have photo
viewers.
Many add-on applications also support beaming. You can even beam many
kinds of data to PDAs based on Microsoft’s Pocket PC operating system. Not
only was I able to successfully send a picture that I’d taken with my CLIÉ’s
camera to an iPAQ, but I was also able to beam a saved game from the superb
game Legacy (see Chapter 11) and then use that saved file in the Pocket PC
version of the game.
In most programs, you find the Beam command on the first drop-down menu.
Generally, you select the record that you want to beam, and then hit the
Menu soft button and choose Beam from the first menu that appears. (Some
programs offer menu choices for beaming individual items or entire cate-
gories.) A window pops up on-screen and lets you know that the CLIÉ is
searching for the receiving unit, as shown in Figure 15-1. Aim your CLIÉ’s
infrared emitter at the receiving PDA.
Figure 15-1:

to beam a

Part V: Reaching Outside the CLIÉ Box 

Resist the temptation to put the devices as close together as possible.
Beaming actually seems to work best when the two devices are about six
inches apart.
If you’re on the receiving end of a beam, the CLIÉ asks you to confirm
whether you want to accept the data and, when appropriate, what category
you want to place it in, as illustrated in Figure 15-2.
You can see the filename or the first few characters of the item. This confir-
mation step keeps someone from beaming wacky joke To Dos (such as, oh, 
an author running around an airport beaming a file that says “Buy Sony CLIÉ
For Dummies” to every PDA owner in sight) or unwanted programs. (“No,
honey, I don’t know how Strip Poker Deluxe got on my CLIÉ, I swear!”)
If you designate a business card in Address Book, you can beam that by hold-
ing down the Address Book hard button. For the full scoop on beaming busi-
ness cards, see Chapter 4.
You can use the infrared port for more than just beaming data. If you’re on
the road with a laptop, and you’ve forgotten your HotSync cable, for instance,
you can actually HotSync by using an infrared connection. It’s slow, but it
works just fine.

Turn your CLIÉ into a super remote
Okay, what’s the one thing in your house with an
infrared port on it that you just can’t live with-
out? If you said your CLIÉ, I’ll give you brownie
points for trying to butter me up, but an even
better answer is your TV remote. Anyone born
before 1980 now regales younger acquain-
tances with tales of the bad old days when a
person actually had to get up to change the
channel on the TV — sometimes with a pair of
pliers because something called a dial had
broken off. Today, the remote is such an indis-
pensable household tool that you probably have
a coffee table full of them. So wouldn’t it be nice
to hear that your CLIÉ can take the place of a
$300 universal remote control? Sure, you prob-
ably don’t want to leave your PDA lying around
the coffee table all day long, but it’s mighty
handy to have it double as a remote control
when your toddler has hidden the TiVo remote,
and the season finale of Law and Order: Special
Parking Violations Unit is about to come on.
With one of these programs, a CLIÉ can dupli-
cate the functionality of a dedicated program-
mable remote.
A number of Sony models, including the 
NX series and the PEG-TG50, actually include
built-in remote control software. CLIÉ Remote
Commander, shown in the following figure
below, is a basic but useful product that can
control up to four home-theater components.
More sophisticated third-party remote control
programs are available. They offer support for
more devices, better programmability, and even
interactive program guides. Perhaps the best-
looking is NoviiRemote, as you can see in the
following figure. It has a colorful, customizable
interface that’s very intuitive. NoviiRemote also
allows you to program your CLIÉ’s hard buttons
so that you can access your most-used func-
tions quickly, without having to tap the correct
spot on the liquid crystal display (LCD). Best of
all, NoviiRemote includes over 100 prepro-
grammed settings, so chances are that you can
start using it immediately, without having to train
it with your standalone remotes. For more infor-
mation on NoviiRemote, including a list of CLIÉ
models that the program is compatible with,
check out www.novii.tv.
Another remote control program worth check-
ing out is ConnectedTV. This slick application
lets you forget about channel numbers and
choose your programs by name. Every couple
weeks, you download the latest listings from the
ConnectedTV servers, complete with descrip-
tions for almost every program, as shown in this
sidebar’s last figure. The interface is very simi-
lar to the excellent TiVo program guide — down
to an option for setting up a page with 
your favorite programs so that you can find out

To set your system up to HotSync by infrared, do the following:
1. Click the blue-and-red circular HotSync icon in the lower-right corner
of your laptop’s Windows Task bar.
Assuming that your laptop has a working and enabled infrared emitter,
you see Infrared as a choice below Network on the HotSync menu that
pops up.
2. Choose Infrared.
Note that you can have both Infrared and USB selected, and the laptop
works with whichever HotSync method you’re using at the moment.
3. Tap the HotSync icon in the CLIÉ Program Launcher to start the
HotSync program.
The HotSync main screen appears.
4. Tap the drop-down menu arrow below the HotSync button on the
screen and change the setting from the Cradle/Cable option to the 
IR to a PC/Handheld option.
5. Point the CLIÉ’s infrared port at the laptop’s infrared port and tap the
HotSync button on the CLIÉ’s screen.
You should hear the usual HotSync beep and see the HotSync window
open on the laptop. From there, the HotSync proceeds normally, but at
about a quarter the usual speed.

Chapter 15: The CLIÉ Goes Wireless
when they’ll be on next. When this book was
written, it was compatible only with some CLIÉ
models, but you can find a full list on which
PDAs work with the latest version at www.
connected.tv.
Keep in mind that various CLIÉ models have dif-
ferent infrared ranges. Some work up to about
15 feet or farther from your home-entertainment
equipment with no problems, but a few are lim-
ited to a piddly 6 feet or so. Your best bet is to
download a trial version of the program and test
it with your equipment to see what kind of range
your CLIÉ has before making a purchase.
Who knows. You might be so enamored of the
versatility of these programs that you decide to
buy an older, used CLIÉ just to use as a remote.

Tune In to Wi-Fi
Wi-Fi is all the rage. Sony is building this wireless networking technology into
most of its CLIÉ models today. Wi-Fi is a short-range networking standard
that’s designed for use in offices, homes, and public spots like airports and
coffee shops. To use Wi-Fi, you must be within roughly 300 feet of a an access
point — a base station that transmits the wireless signal and connects you to
the Internet — so it’s not going to help you on the road or in the country.
But with Wi-Fi popularity growing by leaps and bounds, finding access points
is getting easier and easier. Many hotels, coffee shops, and bookstores offer
Wi-Fi access as an enticement to draw in customers. These Wi-Fi zones, some-
times free but often available at a small charge, have come to be known as
hotspots. Conferences and trade shows often offer free Wi-Fi coverage. In
major cities, you can just roam the streets and find open Wi-Fi networks to
leech onto, where individuals and businesses have left their networks unse-
cured. (It’s not very polite, though, unless the access points were left open
intentionally.) Adding Wi-Fi capabilities to your own home network costs well
under $75.
What is Wi-Fi?
Wi-Fi works just like a traditional wired network card. Its primary function is
to give wireless access to a network’s Internet connection. Wi-Fi is short for
wireless fidelity, a term that doesn’t make a whole heck of a lot of sense. (It’s a
play on the well-known audio term Hi-Fi.) You can also see Wi-Fi referred to
by the extremely unfriendly designation 802.11, which was the official desig-
nation given to the wireless standard by the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The flavor of Wi-Fi that you find on CLIÉs is the
original standard, 802.11b, which supports transmission rates of up to 11
Mbps. Now, most of the home-networking equipment that you find at your
local electronics superstore uses the new 802.11g standard, which supports
54 Mbps transmissions. The good news is that these 802.11g base stations 
are compatible with 802.11b devices, so your CLIÉ can talk to them without
problems.
Note that Wi-Fi has certain security issues. Without security features enabled,
anyone within radio range can access a Wi-Fi network. For people living in
apartment buildings, an unsecured Wi-Fi network could provide free Internet
access for all your neighbors. Worse, in an office, it could allow outsiders to
snoop your company’s files. The ubiquitous Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
security standard requires you to input a special code on all devices that
access a particular Wi-Fi network. The problem is, WEP networks can be
fairly easily cracked in just a few hours by using readily available programs.
The new Wireless Protected Access (WPA) protocol that’s found on newer
equipment is more secure but hasn’t yet found its way onto the CLIÉ. The
232
Part V: Reaching Outside the CLIÉ Box 

good news is that WEP security is adequate to keep casual snoopers and free-
loaders off your network. The even better news is that the way the CLIÉ’s 
Wi-Fi access is designed, even someone who’s broken into the network can’t
snoop around in the data stored in the unit. The worst they could do would
be to intercept e-mail and Web data you’re sending across the Internet.
Configuring your Wi-Fi connection
Okay, you have a Wi-Fi network set up at home, or you located one at work or
the local coffee shop. Now you need to get connected.
Connection is more trouble-free if you can find out the wireless network’s
Service Set Identifier (SSID). The SSID is the name given to the network
during setup. You don’t absolutely have to have the SSID, but it can save
some headaches if you’re having problems connecting. You also need to find
out whether the access point is using WEP encryption; if so, you need the
password, called a WEP key.
If you’re using an NX series CLIÉ, you need to install the drivers for your
CompactFlash Wi-Fi card before proceeding. They came on a disc with your
card, but I suggest downloading the latest drivers for the WL100/WL110 Wi-Fi
cards from Sony’s CLIÉ Support Web site at www.sony.com/clie/support. 
If you’re using a TJ-, TH-, or UX-series CLIÉ with built-in Wi-Fi, no drivers are
necessary.
Wi-Fi setup on the CLIÉ
Wi-Fi setup is handled in the Preferences application, as is manually connect-
ing to the network. Tap the Prefs icon in the Program Launcher, and then tap
the drop-down menu arrow in the top-left corner of the screen and choose
Network. You see the screen in Figure 15-3.
Figure 15-3:

233
Chapter 15: The CLIÉ Goes Wireless

Tap the Service drop-down menu arrow and choose Wireless LAN (local area
network). Now you need to tell the CLIÉ about the network that you want to
connect to.
Tap the Details button to bring up the Wireless LAN Setup screen. If you have
an NX-series CLIÉ with a CompactFlash Wi-Fi card, you see the basic setup
screen shown in Figure 15-4. If you have a UX, TJ, TH, or newer CLIÉ, you see
the more full-featured interface in Figure 15-5.
The main difference between the old interface and the new one is that the
interface for CLIÉs with CompactFlash Wi-Fi cards requires you to manually
enter an SSID for the network that you want to connect to, but the newer ver-
sion can scan for any wireless networks in range.
I show you in the following sections how to configure your CLIÉ to connect
automatically to the nearest available access point.

CLIÉs with built-in Wi-Fi
Tap the Prefs icon in the Program Launcher, tap the drop-down menu arrow
in the upper-right corner of the Preferences screen, and then choose Network.
Tap the Service drop-down menu arrow and choose Wireless LAN. Now tap
the Details button at the bottom of the Preferences screen to open the
Wireless LAN Setup screen, shown previously in Figure 15-5.
If you select Auto Connect on this screen, the Wi-Fi radio attempts to connect
to the unencrypted access point that’s the strongest and closest. This setting
should work in most situations. However, in cases where you’re within range
of more than one access point, you might want to specifically choose which
network you’re going to connect to. You also need to do some manual config-
uration if the access point that you’re using has WEP encryption active.
In this case, just tap the Scan button at the bottom of the screen. The Scan
Result screen opens and gives you a list of access points in range, as shown
in Figure 15-6.
The WEP column tells you whether an access point is using WEP encryption.
(If you see an X in that column, you need the WEP key to access this net-
work.) The Mode column reads Infra (short for infrastructure mode, the mode
that’s used by access points; the alternative is Adhoc, which lets you connect
to only one computer). The Signal column tells you how strong the signal is,
ranging from 0 to 100.
On the ScanResult screen, tap the access point that you want to configure for
use. When you’re not using your own network, you generally want to select
the strongest unencrypted signal reading. Then tap the Select button. The
Wireless LAN Setup window appears, as shown in Figure 15-7.
For access points that aren’t using WEP encryption and that can automati-
cally register devices on their network, all you need to do is tap OK, and
you’re ready to connect to the new network.

Chapter 15: The CLIÉ Goes Wireless

If your network is using WEP, you need to get the WEP key from the system
administrator — or whoever set up your wireless router, as the case may be.
When you tap the WEP drop-down menu arrow, you’re given four choices for
entering encryption keys: 40-bit characters , 40-bit Hex, 128-bit characters, or
128-bit Hex. Select the type that’s used by your access point, and then enter
the encryption key. If your network doesn’t automatically assign IP addresses
(which stands for Internet Protocol, unique numeric identifiers that every
computer connected to the Internet must possess) using a DHCP (Dynamic
Host Configuration Protocol) server, you need to manually configure the IP
address. You can get info on the access point and how to configure the IP
address from your network administrator. Tap the Advanced Setup button to
get to the screen shown in Figure 15-8. Deselect the Auto check box next to IP
Address and enter the appropriate data for your network.
Now tap OK to return to the main Wireless LAN Setup screen. (Refer to 
Figure 15-7.) Tap OK again to return to the Network Preferences screen.
Finally, tap the Connect button. If all goes well, a Connecting status window
pops up, and the Connect button changes to read Disconnect. You’re now on
the network, ready to browse the Web, process e-mail, and more.

CLIÉs with CompactFlash Wi-Fi cards
If you’re using an NX series CLIÉ with a CompactFlash Wi-Fi card, the WL100/
110 CF card drivers don’t have the ability to list available Wi-Fi access points.
However, a special trick lets you connect to unencrypted access points even
if you don’t know the network’s SSID.
On the Wireless LAN Setup screen (refer to Figure 15-5), tap the Create 
button to create a new profile. Now enter the information so that it matches
Figure 15-9. This takes advantage of a poorly documented trick with these
cards: If you set the value of the SSID to Any, WEP to None, and leave all other
settings set to their defaults, the card then attempts to connect to any unen-
crypted access point in range.
If you use WEP encryption on your home or work network, you can configure
an additional profile for that access point with the proper SSID and WEP
code, and select the Any Access Point profile when you’re roaming outside 
of the home or office environment.
Wi-Fi setup with the Mobile 
Connection Wizard
Sony has released a Windows program called the Mobile Connection Wizard
designed to run on your desktop computer and simplify Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
configuration. The program is included on the Installation CD with the newest
CLIÉs, but I recommend that you skip that copy and download the latest ver-
sion, even if it came with your unit, because Sony constantly updates it to
support new profiles. You can download the latest version from Sony’s CLIÉ
Support Web site at www.sony.com/clie/support.

Chapter 15: The CLIÉ Goes Wireless

After you first launch Mobile Connection Wizard on your desktop system,
HotSync your CLIÉ so that the program can gather information about it. (For
more on how to HotSync, see Chapter 3.) Then click the Select User Account
button on the Connection Wizard screen and choose your CLIÉ’s HotSync ID.
Finally, click New to create a new connection profile.
On the next screen, click the drop-down list, and you see just one Wi-Fi pro-
file, which is for using your wireless LAN with the T-Mobile HotSpot commer-
cial Wi-Fi service. If you do plan to use your CLIÉ with T-Mobile’s service, you
can select this option, click Next, and follow the on-screen prompts to config-
ure your CLIÉ to work with it. However, I’m going to assume that you might
use your CLIÉ with other networks, as well. Select the Show Advanced check
box to see the more advanced drop-down list shown in Figure 15-10.
Select the Your CLIÉ model Internal Wireless LAN option and click Next to
continue. The screen shown in Figure 15-11 appears and prompts you to
enter your network’s SSID. Note that some wireless networks are configured
with a blank SSID; if this is the case with yours, simply leave the Network ID
(SSID) field blank. Click the Next button when you’re done.
The next Connection Wizard screen prompts you to enter the WEP encryp-
tion for the network that you entered. If no WEP encryption is active, select
None from the drop-down list. Otherwise, choose the type of encryption
(40/64 or 104/128 bit) and the method for entering the code (text characters
or hex), as shown in Figure 15-12. You can get this information from your
system administrator or from the person who configured your wireless
router.

Part V: Reaching Outside the CLIÉ Box 

Click Next to move on to yet another Connection Wizard screen. If you chose
a WEP encryption type, you need to enter it in the Enter WEP Key field.
Unfortunately, Sony chose to obscure the entry with asterisks, as shown in
Figure 15-13. This can make code entry difficult, particularly when entering a
128-bit encryption key in hex format — that’s 26 characters!
If you’d like to verify the code rather than typing it blind, enter it in another
program, such as Word or Notepad, and check to make sure that the charac-
ters are correct. When you’re ready, highlight it, choose Edit➪Copy, and then
click in the Enter WEP Key field in the Connection Wizard and press Ctrl+V,
which is the Paste command. Your verified WEP key is pasted into the field.
Click the Next button.

Chapter 15: The CLIÉ Goes Wireless

The screen that appears asks you to tap a button to select the network type,
and your choices are Infrastructure or Adhoc. You use Infrastructure to con-
nect to network access points, and choosing Adhoc connects your CLIÉ to a
wireless network card on a single computer. I assume that you’re using an
access point here because Adhoc use is very specialized and limited in
potential usage. Select Infrastructure and click the Next button.
The next screen, shown in Figure 15-14, prompts you to enter your IP
address, which is your computer’s address on the local area network. Home
network and public access networks are typically set up to use a technology
called DHCP, which assigns an IP address automatically to a computer when
it tries to connect to the network. So chances are that you can just select the
DHCP check box and click Next to move on to the following screen. If you’re
on an office network that requires each device to have its own IP address,
you need to deselect the DHCP check box; get the information for the
Address, Mask, and DNS values from your network administrator; and enter
that information here. For reasons that defy logical explanation, for some
CLIÉ models the wizard puts IP and DNS address information on a single
screen, but on others, the wizard breaks them into two separate screens.
Next, you’re given the chance to choose whether to activate Power Save
Mode. I suggest selecting the Power Save check box to enable the feature —
at least to start with. If you find that your connection is weak or intermittent,
you can edit the connection settings and disable power savings. Click Next
after you make your choice.
Next is Auto Connect. With this active, the CLIÉ attempts to connect to the
access point on the network you’re configuring if it’s in range, even if you’ve
selected Auto Connect rather than this specific network in the Wireless LAN
Setup screen. Unless you’re using an Adhoc network, enable Auto Connect.
Click Next after you make the selection.

that you can use anything you’d like: Work LAN, Home Wi-Fi, Starbucks Setup,
and so on. Click Next after entering the name. The final wizard screen gives

Chapter 15: The CLIÉ Goes Wireless

Putting Wi-Fi to use
The previous section sets up your Wi-Fi connection. The good news is that
actually using Wi-Fi after it’s been configured requires little or no interaction
from you. If you’re using a CLIÉ with built-in Wi-Fi, after you configure the
access points that you’ll be using you can just set the Wireless LAN Setup to
Auto Connect, as shown in Figure 15-16. As long as you’ve manually set up
any networks that require a WEP key or a preset IP address, and they’re set
to be able to connect automatically, the CLIÉ should be able to find and con-
nect to your network without further intervention.
If you’re using a CLIÉ that’s equipped with CompactFlash Wi-Fi, you need to
select the profile manually when using a network that requires WEP or a
preset IP address. For normal use on unencrypted access points, leave the
configuration set to Any, as shown in Figure 15-17, and just choose the proper
profile manually when using a protected network.

Chapter 15: The CLIÉ Goes Wireless
Where to find Wi-Fi
If you have a Wi-Fi CLIÉ, you might want to set
up Wi-Fi in your home. Just imagine streaming
MP3s tunes off the Internet onto your CLIÉ as
you work out in the basement, or picture your-
self sending e-mail from the comfort of your
couch.
To install Wi-Fi at home, you need to connect a
wireless router to your home network. These
are relatively inexpensive (from $40 to $299), and
most also include a firewall feature to protect
your home network from Internet hacking. Just
connect at least one computer to the router, and
then connect your cable or DSL modem to the
router’s wide area network (WAN) port. (If
you’re using a dial-up modem, you also need to
use the Internet Connection Sharing software
built into Windows. See the Windows Help fea-
ture for details.) Almost any router works fine
with a CLIÉ Wi-Fi setup. Just be sure that the
router supports either the 802.11b or 802.11g
standard.
To liberate yourself from wired networking at
the office, talk to your network administrator to
find out the network SSID, the WEP encryption
code, and whether you need a fixed IP address.
Plug the info into your Network Preferences as
outlined in this chapter, and then you’re good 
to go.
The real versatility of a wireless CLIÉ, though,
comes from public access points. Some are
free, but others charge a small fee. Numerous
companies now offer Wi-Fi access services —
great for people who travel often and can take
advantage of them.
Some commercial Wi-Fi services allow you to
log on to your account by using a standard Web
browser. Any Wi-Fi CLIÉ can access these Wi-
Fi services. Other services require special soft-
ware to be installed on your compute or
handheld to log on to the company’s Wi-Fi 
networks, so be sure that the correct software
is available for the CLIÉ before you sign up.
Boingo’s service (www.boingo.com), for
instance, is available for Pocket PCs but not
CLIÉs. The Earthlink Wi-Fi software requires
Windows, so handheld users are completely 
out of luck. Complain to Earthlink at www.
earthlink.net.
Happily, most of the major players do support
handhelds. T-Mobile HotSpot (www.t-mobile.
com/hotspot/) offers hourly, daily, and
monthly rate plans and lets you log on with a
standard Web browser, so it works fine with the
CLIÉ. The service is available at over 3,100 loca-
tions in 34 states, including many Starbucks 
coffeehouses and Borders stores.
The other big player is Wayport (www.
wayport.com), which also works on the CLIÉ.
It primarily serves hotels (over 600 of them), 
but it also has access points in 12 airports,
including Oakland, San Jose, and Seattle-
Tacoma. And West Coast fast-food fans can
rejoice: Wayport is running trials in Bay Area
McDonalds restaurants. (“Would you like fries
with your McWi-Fi?”) Wayport offers daily and
monthly plans.
Keep in mind that plenty of legitimate, free 
Wi-Fi access points also exist. Many public
libraries, for instance, offer Wi-Fi access for
their patrons, as do a number of mom-and-pop
coffee shops. Panera Bread Company has 602
locations nationwide and offers free Wi-Fi
access at all its stores. Even a few Laundromats
have hopped on the free Wi-Fi bandwagon. If
that’s not enough, some towns now offer free
Wi-Fi access in their business districts. Boulder,
Colorado, for instance, offers free outdoor 
Wi-Fi access in its Pearl Street Mall shopping
district. Even downtown Mount Airy, North
Carolina — population 8,500 and the real-
life model for Andy Griffith’s Mayberry — 
has kicked off its own free Wi-Fi service. An
excellent resource for finding out whether a
free Wi-Fi hotspot is available in your area 
is www.wififreespot.com.

To manually connect to a network, tap Prefs in the Program Launcher, tap the
drop-down menu arrow in the upper-right corner and select Network, make
sure that Wireless LAN is selected (refer to Figure 15-3), and tap the Connect
button. If you leave the network preferences set to Wireless LAN, however,
you don’t need to connect manually. When you attempt to go online with a
Web browser, chat program, or e-mail application, the system asks you
whether you want to connect. Tap OK, and your CLIÉ connects automatically.
You can also use the Mobile Manager to swap between profiles if they were
initially created by using the Mobile Connection Wizard on your desktop
system. Just load the Mobile Manager by tapping its icon in the Program
Launcher, tap the profile that you want to use, and tap Activate.
Bluetooth: Weird Name, Great Technology
Wi-Fi has caught on like wildfire, yet its little brother, Bluetooth, is having
problems even igniting a spark. Part of this is because the technologies are
often compared, whereas in fact, they’re typically used for completely differ-
ent purposes.
Wi-Fi is designed specifically to connect your PDA wirelessly to a network or
the Internet. Bluetooth is designed to connect a PDA to anything that would
typically require a cable to make a connection (for example, cell phones,
printers, GPS receivers, and HotSync cradles).
By far the best use for Bluetooth is connecting to a Bluetooth-capable cell
phone, which lets the CLIÉ utilize the phone as a wireless modem. This isn’t
as fast as a Wi-Fi connection — it’s just a little faster than a traditional dial-up
modem — but you can use this technology anywhere that your cell phone
works. You don’t even have to hunt for access points.
My second favorite use is to connect to a Bluetooth GPS (Global Positioning
System) receiver. These wonderful mouse-size gadgets track a constellation
of orbiting GPS satellites and can locate your exact position within just a few
feet. They’re a life-saver when driving in strange cities. Particularly Munich.
Instead of having to deal with a Rube Goldberg combination of a CLIÉ, a cable
to an external GPS receiver, and chargers for both strewn around your dash-
board, you can connect the CLIÉ to a compatible GPS (such as the Navman
4460) through a wireless connection. This lets you place a tiny, pager-sized
244

GPS on your dashboard and hand the map-equipped PDA to your passenger
or mount it in a convenient spot on your dash. If you’re running on batteries,
no cables are involved at all.
Sony has released a few CLIÉs with built-in Bluetooth, including the PEG-TG50
and the PEG-UX50. Oddly, the PEG-TH55 ships with both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
in its European edition, but the American version includes only Wi-Fi.
Bluetooth-savvy CLIÉ fans have been known to pay an extra $100 to get an
imported Bluetooth-equipped model.
When you first use two Bluetooth devices together, they must be paired,
which means that you tell them it’s okay to talk to each other. (This helps
keep wily Bluetooth bandits from wirelessly snooping around your PDA or
laptop in public places.) The good news is that after you complete the initial
configuration and pairing, Bluetooth devices can connect to each other 
automatically.
Sony’s Mobile Connection Wizard makes connecting the CLIÉ to a phone via
Bluetooth super easy. If your phone and your cell phone company are both
supported, the process is point-and-click and requires none of the technical
knowledge that sometimes comes up when dealing with Wi-Fi.
Setting up a Bluetooth phone: Part 1
Setting up a supported Bluetooth phone is a snap when using the Mobile
Connection Wizard. After you first launch the Mobile Connection Wizard on
your desktop system, HotSync your CLIÉ so that the program can gather
information about it. (For more on how to HotSync, see Chapter 3.) Then
click the Select User Account button on the Connection Wizard screen and
choose your CLIÉ’s HotSync ID. Finally, click New to create a new connection
profile.
On the Setup screen, shown in Figure 15-18, you get Bluetooth setup choices
for Cingular, AT&T Wireless, and T-Mobile Wireless, the three major carriers
currently offering Bluetooth phones in the USA. Choose your cell phone
provider and click Next. (If you’re using another carrier, you need to get spe-
cialized setup instructions from the carrier.)
Next, you choose your cell phone model, as shown in Figure 15-19. If your
phone isn’t listed, try the Generic GSM Phone setting.
245
Chapter 15: The CLIÉ Goes Wireless

If your phone isn’t directly supported, and the Generic GSM setting doesn’t
work, try another phone of the same brand. Typically, the Bluetooth com-
mands are similar enough that the phones will be compatible. Also, download
the latest version of the Mobile Connection Wizard from the Sony CLIÉ
Support Web site at www.sony.com/clie/support. Your phone might have
been added to the latest version. If all else fails, contact your cell phone car-
rier or use Google (www.google.com) to search for a Web site devoted to
your phone. For instance, you can find lots of information on configuring the
relatively rare Sony-Ericsson T608 Bluetooth phone to work with the CLIÉ at
www.sprintpcsinfo.com.
Next, enter a name for this connection, as illustrated in Figure 15-20; click
Next; and enter an optional comment describing the connection.

You now have a the Bluetooth profile for your phone. Simply HotSync the
CLIÉ to transfer the profile over to the PDA.(For more on how to HotSync, see
Chapter 3.)
Setting up a Bluetooth phone: Part 2
All that’s left is to select the new profile and pair your phone to the CLIÉ.
First, make sure that your CLIÉ’s Bluetooth radio is turned on by tapping
Prefs in the Program Launcher, and then selecting Bluetooth from the drop-
down menu arrow in the top-right corner of the screen. Set Bluetooth to
Enabled, as shown in Figure 15-21.

Chapter 15: The CLIÉ Goes Wireless

Tap the Mobile Manager icon in the CLIÉ Program Launcher. (This program
was installed when you did a HotSync after you installed the Mobile
Connection Wizard on your desktop system.) You see a screen similar to the
one in Figure 15-22. Tap the name of the profile that you created in the previ-
ous section and tap the Activate button.
Next, the Mobile Manager program brings up a screen asking you to Select
Trusted Device. Before proceeding, you need to set your Bluetooth phone up
so that it’s discoverable, which means that the CLIÉ can detect it. Check your
phone’s manual for specific instructions on how to do this; the menu proce-
dures vary between phone models.
When the phone is in Discoverable mode, tap the Discover button at the
bottom of the Mobile Manager. The CLIÉ searches for Bluetooth devices and
then presents a list of the devices that it located, as shown in Figure 15-23.
Tap the one that represents your phone and then tap OK. The Mobile
Manager program asks whether you want to add the device to your Trusted
Device list. Tap Yes so that you don’t have to pair the device every time you
use it.

Next, you’re asked to enter the passkey for your Bluetooth device, as shown
in Figure 15-24. This is a secret password that each device has. The default
password should be listed in the documentation for your phone, or your
phone might have prompted you to set your own password when you were
activating its Bluetooth features. Enter the password and tap OK. Check your
phone’s screen because it might ask you to verify that you want to pair the
devices.
You can now see your phone’s name listed on the Trusted Device window.
Make sure that it’s highlighted and tap Done.
Your Bluetooth phone profile is now active. As long as you don’t switch pro-
files, all you have to do to connect to the Internet is make sure that your
phone is on, its Bluetooth feature is active, and your CLIÉ’s Bluetooth radio is
turned on. Simply going online with a Web browser, e-mail program, or chat
application causes your CLIÉ to connect with your phone wirelessly and dial
the Internet.

Chapter 15: The CLIÉ Goes Wireless
Connecting a non-Bluetooth phone
If you have a cellular phone that doesn’t support
Bluetooth, you might still be able to use it to con-
nect to the Internet by attaching it to your CLIÉ
with a cable. Your phone must use the GSM or
CDMA digital networks. (TMDA networks,
which are in the process of being phased out,
don’t support cellular data.)
You can find cables at a variety of sources, but
the chances of your locating them locally are
pretty slim. The best source is SupplyNet at
www.thesupplynet.com. The company not
only has cables for just about every CLIÉ model
(the UX series is the exception) to connect to a
wide variety of cell phones, but it also includes
step-by-step instructions for configuring your
CLIÉ and phone to work with all the major cellu-
lar carriers.

Setting up other Bluetooth devices
When it comes to setting up other Bluetooth devices, such as GPS receivers
or printers, the procedure varies by device. The basic process is to put the
device that you want to connect in Discoverable mode, and then go to the
Bluetooth section of the Preferences application, as shown previously in
Figure 15-21, and tap Trusted Devices to pair the two devices. This works the
same way as selecting Trusted Devices does in the previous sections.
From there, it’s up to the program that you’re running to connect to the
Bluetooth device. If your application supports Bluetooth, it should include
detailed instructions on how to proceed.

In This Chapter
 Discovering CLIÉ Mail
 Browsing the Web with NetFront
 Using instant messaging and other applications
S
ure, playing games or watching a video on your CLIÉ is fun when you
have a little downtime, but if you’re really busy, you might need to kill
the e-mail backlog instead of zapping aliens from Planet 13.
All current CLIÉ models are set up to handle e-mail whether or not they have
built-in wireless capabilities. (The nonwireless varieties use the HotSync
process to transfer e-mail.) Wireless CLIÉs include the added benefit of Web
browsing. Any CLIÉ can accept add-on programs that enhance e-mailing and
browsing capabilities, and some add-ons offer other online tricks, such as
instant messaging.
The Versatile CLIÉ Mail
CLIÉ Mail is a powerful e-mail program that’s included with all current CLIÉ
units, even the units without wireless capabilities. CLIÉs that lack wireless
features can still take advantage of the program by transferring e-mails when
you HotSync your CLIÉ. However, with a Wi-Fi card or Bluetooth wireless con-
nection, you can process your e-mails on the go. On many CLIÉs, CLIÉ Mail is
built in and available from the moment that you first turn on the unit. On
some CLIÉs, you must first install the handheld version of CLIÉ Mail from the
CD that came with your CLIÉ; you can find it in the CLIÉ Utilities section.

Transferring CLIÉ Mail using your 
desktop system
Transferring e-mail by using your desktop system is a relatively painless
process. First, you have to install a HotSync conduit on your desktop system.
Insert the Installation CD that came with your CLIÉ and look for CLIÉ Mail
Conduit, which can typically be found by clicking the CLIÉ Utilities tab on the
installation menu. Click Install, and the installation proceeds automatically.
Now you must activate the conduit. Here’s how:
1. Click the red-and-blue HotSync icon in the lower-right corner of your
Windows screen.
The menu shown in Figure 16-1 appears.
2. Choose Custom on the menu.
The Custom window appears.
3. Select CLIÉ Mail from the list of conduits in the Custom window, and
then click the Change button.
The CLIÉ Mail conduit settings window appears, as shown in Figure 16-2.
(You use this window to configure the conduit you just activated.)
4. In the CLIÉ Mail conduit settings window, click to choose the synchro-
nization option that you want.
You typically want to select the Synchronize the Files option. It down-
loads all new e-mails to your CLIÉ and uploads any e-mails that you’ve
written on the CLIÉ. With the e-mails uploaded to your desktop system,
you can send them by using your desktop e-mail program. If you select
the Overwrites Handheld option, new e-mails that you created on the
CLIÉ aren’t transferred, and any existing e-mail on the CLIÉ is replaced
by the e-mail currently on your desktop system. Selecting the Do Nothing
option results in nothing being transferred.
Figure 16-1:
Click the
HotSync
icon on your
Windows
screen and
choose
Custom.
252
Part V: Reaching Outside the CLIÉ Box 

5. Select the Set As Default check box.
6. Using the Mail System drop-down list, select the e-mail program that
you’re currently using.
CLIÉ Mail supports Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Express, and Eudora.
7. Click OK to close the CLIÉ Mail window, and then click Done in the
Custom window.
The Custom window closes, and you’re about set to go.
You also need to ensure that the Messaging Application Program Interface
(MAPI) feature is enabled in your desktop e-mail application. The MAPI feature
lets your e-mail program communicate with other applications. It’s enabled by
default in Outlook Express 5.0 or later and in Outlook. To enable it in Eudora,
open Eudora, choose Tools➪Options, and then click the MAPI icon in the
Options window. Select Always Available from the MAPI options that appear.
You’re almost ready to start using HotSync mail. All that’s left to do is to
choose your e-mail retrieval options on the CLIÉ. Launch the program by tap-
ping the CLIÉ Mail icon in the Program Launcher. Tap the Menu soft button
and choose Options➪HotSync Options from the menu that appears. You see
the screen illustrated in Figure 16-3.
If you leave it set to All, the default option, all messages are synchronized
between the desktop system and your CLIÉ. All new messages are down-
loaded to the CLIÉ, and any messages that you write on the CLIÉ are uploaded
to the desktop system and put in your e-mail program’s outbox. Note that
you can limit how many days’ worth of messages to transfer. You definitely
want to do this the first time you sync, and you might also want to set a low
number if you haven’t HotSynced in a while. Otherwise, I leave the number
set at 999 to ensure that I get all my new e-mail.
Figure 16-2:

253
Chapter 16: Internet on the Go

If you select Send Only, the CLIÉ sends any e-mail that you write on your CLIÉ
but doesn’t download any e-mail from your desktop system. This is useful if
you want to be able to compose quick e-mails when you find a free moment,
but you don’t want to read and respond to e-mails on your CLIÉ.
The next setting, Filter, lets you choose to download only messages contain-
ing a certain word in their headers or to ignore all messages with a particular
header word. You might use this, say, to grab all new messages from a partic-
ular sender or to ignore all messages for an e-mail list that you belong to —
choose Ignore and put the list’s address in the From line.
Finally, the Unread option uploads any e-mails that you’ve written on your
CLIÉ to your desktop system but downloads only e-mails that you haven’t yet
read on your desktop system.
Note that any e-mails you delete on your CLIÉ are also deleted on your desk-
top system. If you don’t want to do this, use the Custom settings on your
desktop system’s HotSync conduit, which I describe at the beginning of this
section, to set the conduit to the Overwrites Handheld option for the next
sync. The new e-mail is downloaded to the CLIÉ, but any deletions or new
messages that you’ve created are deleted instead of being sent to your desk-
top system.
Sending and receiving e-mail directly
If you want to grab e-mail directly without having to HotSync on your com-
puter, CLIÉ Mail is up to the task. Just be sure that you have a wireless con-
nection set up, either by Wi-Fi or a cell phone. (Chapter 15 takes you through
the wireless setup process.)

You need to set up your personal e-mail account first. Here’s how it’s done:
1. Tap the CLIÉ Mail icon in the Program Launcher.
The CLIÉ Mail application opens on-screen.
2. Tap the Menu soft button and choose Options➪Accounts from the
menu that appears.
The Accounts screen appears.
3. Tap the New button on the Accounts screen.
You need the username, password, and server information for your
Internet e-mail account to proceed.
Note that CLIÉ Mail can’t send or receive AOL e-mail. For details on
AOL’s software for the CLIÉ, see the “Instant Messaging and Other
Applications” section at the end of this chapter.
4. Enter your name on the Account Setup screen that appears, and then
tap Next.
Recipients will see this name in the From field, and because it’s for dis-
play purposes and not part of the actual address, it can be anything
you’d like. Of course, your actual name is the logical thing to put there.
5. Enter your actual e-mail address in the new screen that appears, and
then tap Next.
If the address is incorrect here, replies to your e-mails won’t get
through.
6. Enter the server addresses of the incoming mail server (called POP3)
and the outgoing mail server (called SMTP) in the new screen that
appears (see Figure 16-4), and then tap Next.
This information should be available in the signup information that you
received from your Internet service provider (ISP). If not, call your ISP or
visit its support Web site to find the proper values.
Because of the spammer abuse, most e-mail providers let you use only
their SMTP servers when you’re actually connected to their network. So
if you enter, say, your cable modem ISP’s SMTP address, you’re able to
send mail from home but not when you’re using someone else’s network.
In this case, you might need to contact the network administrator, find
out that network’s SMTP address, and change the value temporarily to
that address. Incoming POP3 e-mail servers don’t have this limitation, so
you can receive e-mail no matter what network you’re on.
255
Chapter 16: Internet on the Go

If you find that you can’t send e-mail by using CLIÉ Mail on a strange net-
work due to the SMTP problem, check and see whether your e-mail
provider offers a Web mail interface. Most do, and you can use Web mail
on any network. In that case, you can use the NetFront Web browser,
which I cover in more detail later in this chapter, to access the Web mail
interface and compose your outgoing e-mail.
7. Enter your logon information — account name and password — on
the next screen that appears, and then tap Next.
Again, this information should be included with the setup information
from your ISP — otherwise, look for it on the ISP’s support site or call
the ISP’s technical support number. Typically, the account name is the
first part of your e-mail address — everything preceding the @ sign —
but some ISPs use the entire address.
8. Tap the Finish button to close the final screen.
That’s it! You’re ready to send and receive e-mail over your network.
Note that you can repeat this process if you have more than one e-mail
account. When you have multiple accounts, you can choose which one you
want to use to send outgoing e-mail by using to the Accounts screen. To get
there, tap the Menu soft button and choose Options➪Accounts from the
menu that appears. When the Accounts screen appears, select the account
that you want to use, and then tap the Set to Outgoing Server button, as
shown in Figure 16-5.
If you don’t want to check all your e-mail accounts next time you log on, just
use the Accounts screen to deselect the accounts that you don’t want to check.

Part V: Reaching Outside the CLIÉ Box 

Composing and reading e-mail
When you first start CLIÉ Mail, you see a screen like the one in Figure 16-6.
The most important controls are all located on the icon bar at the bottom.
Tap the first icon to compose a new e-mail. You see the screen in Figure 16-7.
You can enter a recipient’s e-mail address manually or choose addresses from
your address book by tapping the word To, and then tapping the Lookup
button on the Address screen that appears. You can include multiple recipi-
ents separated by commas. The same procedure works for the CC (carbon
copy) and BCC (blind carbon copy) fields. Finally, enter a subject, and then
enter your e-mail in the text area below.
CLIÉ Mail supports attachments, but they’re limited to media files: graphics,
movies, and voice recorder files. To attach a file, tap the Insert button on the
blank e-mail screen and select the file that you want to send. You can repeat
the process to attach multiple files. A paperclip appears in the top-right
corner of the screen to indicate that an attachment is present. You can tap
the paperclip to verify or delete the attachment.
After you finish composing your e-mail, tap the Send button. A menu pops up
with two choices: Send Now and Send Later. Send Later queues your e-mails
for later sending, which is handy if you’re not currently able to connect to the
network, if you plan to send e-mails using the HotSync process, or if you want
to compose multiple e-mails before going online. Otherwise, select Send Now,
and the CLIÉ connects to the Internet and sends your e-mail. If you want to
come back to your e-mail and finish it later, tap the Draft button instead of
the Send button.

Reading an e-mail is as easy as tapping it in the E-Mail list. Sometimes, how-
ever, you might see gibberish, such as in Figure 16-8. This is because the
sender created an e-mail by using Hypertext Markup Language — HTML, the
fancy formatting used on Web pages — which CLIÉ Mail doesn’t understand.
This is a common problem with people who use Microsoft Outlook for e-mail.
Alas, the only solution is to ask senders to use standard, plain-text e-mail
when writing you, or to bug Sony’s feedback line with requests that they add
HTML support to CLIÉ Mail.
Figure 16-7:
Creating a
new e-mail
message.

If you get a lot of e-mail in HTML format, I recommend looking at an add-on
e-mail solution, such as SnapperMail, which I cover in the “Instant Messaging
and Other Applications” section later in this chapter.
By default, CLIÉ Mail doesn’t show e-mail headers. If you’re reading an e-mail,
and you really need to see the e-mail’s sender, subject, or date line, just tap
the square icon in the top-right corner of the screen to display the headers.
When you’re done reading an e-mail, use the arrows at the top of the screen
to move forward or backward through your E-Mail list. Tap OK to exit the
screen and return to your E-Mail list, tap Reply to compose a reply to the
sender, tap Move to place the e-mail in another category, or tap Delete to
delete the mail.
Categories are extremely useful if you like to keep e-mails around for refer-
ence or if you want to separate e-mails as they come in based on certain cri-
teria. To manually move letters to another category, tap the Categorize E-Mail
icon on the main screen. (Refer to Figure 16-6.) The screen in Figure 16-9
appears.

Chapter 16: Internet on the Go

You can also create filters that will automatically categorize e-mails as they’re
received. Filters can automatically separate e-mails that are received by dif-
ferent accounts into their own folder or place all e-mails relating to a particu-
lar topic in their own folder, for instance. You can even choose not to
download e-mails from a particular sender or with a particular subject line.
To set up filters, just do the following:
1. Tap the Menu soft button and choose Options➪Filters from the menu
that appears.
The Filters screen appears. Initially, the screen is empty.
2. Tap New to create a filter.
You see the screen in Figure 16-10.
3. Enter a name for the new filter in the Filter Name field.
4. Using the first drop-down menu arrow, select which field you want to
search for the trigger string of characters.
Your selections here are To, From, Subject, and CC.
5 Use the next drop-down menu arrow to apply the filter either to every
message that contains the specified text string you enter or to every
message that doesn’t have that string.
6. Use the Retrieve/Don’t Retrieve drop-down menu arrow to toggle
between receiving and not receiving the e-mails you are filtering for.
7. If you chose Retrieve in Step 6, use the Move To drop-down menu
arrow to select a category.
Any e-mail that matches the filter goes into the category that you select.
In the example in Figure 16-10, the filter looks for any message sent to
my work e-mail address, retrieves that message, and then places it in the
Work E-Mail category.
8. When you finish creating the filter, tap OK.
You return to the Filters screen, where you must select the filter name to
activate it. This ability to turn filters on and off is useful if, say, you want
to use a filter that doesn’t retrieve personal e-mail while you’re at work.
To round off this discussion of CLIÉ Mail, I want to draw your attention to the
Receive settings. These allow you to choose to receive only a portion of
downloaded e-mails and to fetch only the most recent messages. The Receive
settings are handy if you’re on a slow connection, such as an older digital cell
phone. You can access these settings by tapping the Receive Settings icon.
(Refer to Figure 16-6.) The Receive Settings screen appears.
260
Part V: Reaching Outside the CLIÉ Box 

The first setting, Retrieve Lines, defaults to All, which retrieves the entire mes-
sage. If you change the setting to Headers+Bodies by tapping the Headers+
Bodies button, you can specify how many lines of a message to retrieve by
tapping the Retrieve Number button. Setting it at 20 to 40 speeds up retrieval
dramatically. A Retrieve on Next Connection check box is added to the end of
the message. Selecting the check box means that the CLIÉ downloads the rest
of the message next time you check your e-mail.
The second Receive setting, Retrieve Number, also defaults to All, but you
can set it to retrieve up to a set number of the most recent messages. If you
haven’t checked your e-mail on your handheld for a while, but you have
checked on your desktop recently, you might want to limit the number of
messages retrieved to somewhere between 20 and 50 so that you don’t get
deluged with old messages. Also, you can choose whether or not to use fil-
ters when customizing the Receive settings.
Browsing the Web with NetFront
NetFront is a full-featured, handheld Web browser that’s optimized for the
CLIÉ’s screen and wireless capabilities.
Sony includes the NetFront Web browser with its CLIÉ models that feature
built-in wireless capabilities, as well as with the NX series units, which can
accept add-on Wi-Fi cards. Unfortunately, the company doesn’t make the pro-
gram available to CLIÉ owners as a separate purchase, so if your CLIÉ doesn’t
include it, you have to find a third-party solution.
You see the NetFront interface and function icons in Figure 16-11.

Most of the functions are similar to the functions on your desktop Web
browser. Handheld-specific functions include the following:
 Smartfit/Wrap Content: Tapping this icon toggles the screen’s word
wrap between three modes that attempt to better fit the Web site to the
CLIÉ’s small screen in an effort to avoid the need to scroll sideways. This
function is available only in NetFront 3.1, the newest version.
 Show Frame: On pages with multiple frames, you can use this to display

Instant Messaging and Other Applications
CLIÉ Mail and NetFront are the only online applications that Sony bundled
with the CLIÉ, but you don’t have to stop there. Dozens of excellent add-on
programs are capable of beefing up the CLIÉ’s Internet suite.
The most egregious omission in the CLIÉ’s online repertoire is an instant mes-
saging (IM) client. But fear not: IM addicts can keep connected on their CLIÉs
with a couple excellent applications:
 AIM for Palm OS: This is a handheld version of AOL Instant Messenger
(AIM) for America Online. It’s a basic but nice chat program, and it’s one
of the first programs for the Palm OS that actually runs in the back-
ground. You can start AIM, switch to another application to do some
work, and then re-launch AIM to catch any IMs that you missed. Alas,
although the program used to be free, AOL has started charging about
$20 for it without improving it, which makes the more powerful VeriChat
an attractive alternative. You can find the AIM software at anywhere.

 VeriChat: VeriChat is a unified IM client that supports not only AOL, but
also MSN, ICQ, and Yahoo! chat networks. As with AIM, you can stay
online while working in other applications and jump back into VeriChat
to check your messages. It’s $24.95 for the first year and $19.95 per year
after that, but it’s worth it if you depend on IM to stay in touch. This is
the best handheld chat program that I’ve tried on any platform. For
more information, check out www.pdaapps.com.
On the e-mail front, CLIÉ Mail is an excellent application, but its lack of sup-
port for HTML-formatted e-mails is becoming more and more troublesome as
those become common in online correspondence. Here are two great alterna-
tives to CLIÉ Mail:
 Eudora Internet Suite: The Eudora for Palm program included here is
fairly basic — it doesn’t support attachments or graphics. It does sup-
port multiple accounts and HTML e-mail, and it can synchronize with
your desktop e-mail program just like CLIÉ Mail. Best of all, it’s free at
www.eudora.com/internetsuite.
 SnapperMail: The king of all Palm OS e-mail programs, SnapperMail sup-
ports both POP3 (common with personal accounts) and IMAP (often
used by businesses) e-mail standards, encrypted e-mail using Secure
263
Chapter 16: Internet on the Go

Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, and HTML-formatted messages. It also
has full-blown attachment support, with the ability to attach or down-
load any file that you can save on a Memory Stick, not just multimedia
files like CLIÉ Mail. The program does lack the ability to transfer e-mail
during a HotSync, but it’s the perfect e-mail companion if you have a
wireless connection. Check it out at www.snappermail.com.
Finally, alternative Web browsers are available. If your CLIÉ came with
NetFront, you’re set for most Web sites. Unfortunately, NetFront isn’t offered
separately, so if your CLIÉ didn’t include the program, check out one of the
following alternative browsers:
 AvantGo: This superb program is actually designed to let you download
Web pages by using your desktop system so you can view them on the
go without having to connect to the Internet. However, it also works
when you’re connected to the Internet, providing basic wireless Web
browsing capabilities with full color and high-resolution support. Even if
you have NetFront, check out AvantGo for its offline browsing capabili-
ties. Visit www.avantgo.com for info.
 WebToGo Mobile Internet: This is actually a suite of Internet applica-
tions that also includes an e-mail client. It offers very fast downloads,
and it reformats pages for the screen. However, pages pass through a
proxy server in order to be reformatted, so corporate users concerned
about security won’t find it appropriate. For more information, see
www.webtogo.de.
 PocketLink: This basic Web browser doesn’t use proxies and offers
encryption on Palm OS 5.2 CLIÉs, so it’s more appropriate for accessing
corporate information. It has full support for CLIÉ high-resolution screens
and for using the jog dial to navigate pages. See www.mdevelop.com for
more information.

W
hen you see the ultimate CLIÉ travel kit and what it can do, it’s not
hard to imagine this exchange taking place. . . .
“Ah, good, you’re here, 007. I have your laptop replacement ready. The entire
kit fits in a large coat pocket, yet it offers wireless Internet access, a folding
keyboard, the ability to create and edit Office files, voice-prompted GPS navi-
gation, a week of battery life, international recharging, and a stylus that fires
tranquilizer darts.”
Except for the tranquilizer-dart stylus, you don’t need to be James Bond to
put together a powerful, pocket-sized computing toolkit. In this chapter, you
find the must-have add-ons for the savvy traveler. The products that I men-
tion here will have you ready for all but the most intensive business and per-
sonal trips alike.
I’ve gotten into the habit of packing my CLIÉ and about a pound of acces-
sories on most trips, and the laptop gets left at home. With a CLIÉ and an
add-on keyboard, I can write articles, check data in spreadsheets, process my
e-mail, get restaurant recommendations and directions, listen to MP3s or
watch videos while traveling on a plane, navigate in strange cities, and play

games when I have some down time. The only time that I feel the need to
bring along the full-sized laptop is when I know I’ll be doing a lot of Web
browsing. The CLIÉ’s small screen is fine for doing quick information lookups,
but the cramped handheld views on Web pages aren’t so good for extended
research sessions or reading message boards.
Without further ado, take a look at the essentials for the well-equipped CLIÉ
road warrior.
Folding Keyboards
The stylus and the little thumb keyboards that are built into some CLIÉs are
fine for entering short bits of data: addresses, brief e-mails, notes from a
meeting, and so on. But try to write a six-page report for your boss with
either option, and chances are your hand will hate your brain for putting it
through that.
Luckily, a few excellent keyboard solutions are available for the CLIÉ line. In
addition to the models listed here, you can find some CLIÉ-compatible
infrared keyboards from Targus, Belkin, and other companies. Don’t be
tempted by the low prices or easy availability of other models. I’ve tried them
all, and the models not listed here all have various driver, ergonomic, or
other problems, and they can’t compare to the following three excellent
choices:
 CLIÉ PEGA-KB100: Sony’s official folding keyboard works with all CLIÉs
released in the past few years except for the UX-series units, which lack
the HotSync port that the keyboard plugs into, and the PEG-NZ90, which
places its HotSync port halfway up the back of the unit. This sleek, silver
unit, shown in Figure 17-1, has an excellent feel and a superb layout. It’s
a bit small, but with a little practice, you can touch-type at full speed.
The only downside is the lack of OK, Cancel, and New function keys,
which means that you still find yourself reaching for your stylus fairly
often. It’s available at www.sonystyle.com/clie.
 Stowaway XT: The Think Outside Stowaway XT folding keyboard, mar-
keted by Fellowes, is the slimmest, most compact PDA keyboard around.
It has a fantastic feel, amazing portability, and a center fold that locks
solidly so that you can use it on your lap. The one downside is that it
lacks a number-key row, so you must use a function-shift key to enter
numerals. This slim keyboard, shown in Figure 17-2, works with all CLIÉs
except for the NZ and UX series and is a superb choice if you don’t type
a ton of numbers. It’s available at www.thinkoutside.com.

Chapter 17: CLIÉ, the Ultimate Travel Companion

 Stowaway: If you’re going to be typing on a solid, flat surface, and you
don’t mind a slightly thicker package when the keyboard is folded, con-
sider the original Stowaway. Although it doesn’t lock open, it offers a
larger typing area that’s exactly the same size as a typical laptop key-
board, complete with a standard number-key row. When folded, it’s not
much larger than your CLIÉ. For sheer typing comfort and potential
input speed, the original Stowaway, shown in Figure 17-3, is the best key-
board for the CLIÉ. It works with the same models as the Stowaway XT
and is available from www.thinkoutside.com.
 Stowaway Wireless: I saved the best for last. This versatile keyboard,
shown in Figure 17-4, looks just like the Stowaway XT — and has the
same unfortunate lack of a dedicated number-key row — but instead of
connecting to the HotSync connector, it uses an infrared (IR) transmitter
to communicate with the CLIÉ through its IR port. This means that it
works with all CLIÉ models — even the UX- and NZ-series units. Not only
that, it also works with other Palm OS and Pocket PC units. This is great
news for multi-PDA families, and it means that you can continue to use
the keyboard should you someday (gasp) switch to a non-CLIÉ PDA. It’s
available from www.thinkoutside.com.

Modems and Communications
If you have a CLIÉ with built-in Wi-Fi, or you have a digital cell phone that can
connect by cable or Bluetooth to your PDA, you’re all set to browse the Web
to your heart’s content. If you’re not so lucky — and you find e-mail more
addictive than caffeine or computer games — you probably want some way
to connect online. Here are a couple devices that can connect wireless-
challenged CLIÉs to the outside world:
 Infrared modem: If you often find yourself in hotels without wireless
access, an old-fashioned dial-up modem can be a sanity saver. Sony no
longer markets a clip-on modem for the CLIÉ line, but 3JTech has an
excellent solution: a modem that connects to your CLIÉ by using the
infrared port. You can use their Pegasus III modem, shown in Figure 17-5,
with any PDA or laptop that has an infrared port. It can work off batter-
ies or wall power and supports speeds up to 56 Kbps. An optional 
add-on Bluetooth module is available for it. You can find it at www.
pocketirmodem.com.

Chapter 17: CLIÉ, the Ultimate Travel Companion

 Bluetooth modem: Although similar to the 3JTech dial-up modem 
offering, the Socket’s Cordless 56K Modem with Bluetooth Wireless
Technology shown in Figure 17-6 uses, you guessed it, Bluetooth wire-
less technology instead of infrared to communicate with your CLIÉ. The
advantages over IR are that you can use your CLIÉ with the modem
while it’s mounted on a portable keyboard (even an IR keyboard, which
is impossible to use with the 3JTech model) and up to 30 feet away from
the modem. It’s available from www.socketcom.com.
 Wi-Fi Memory Stick: If you have a CLIÉ that lacks built-in Wi-Fi and
doesn’t have a slot for Sony’s CompactFlash Wi-Fi card, you’re not out of
luck. Hagiwara Sys-Com has released a Wi-Fi card in the form of a Memory
Stick card that works with all Palm OS 5 CLIÉ models. (See Figure 17-7.)
It includes excellent driver software that lists available Wi-Fi access
points. It’s available from www.hsc-us.com.

Chapter 17: CLIÉ, the Ultimate Travel Companion

GPS Modules
When traveling to a new city, a GPS navigator makes the best companion.
These devices utilize the constellation of Global Positioning System (GPS)
satellites that the U.S. Air Force is kind enough to share so that you can pin-
point your position within just feet on a map. If it weren’t for a PDA GPS, 
I’m convinced that my wife and I would still be lost in Munich, Germany, 
three years after our trip there started.
A couple excellent GPS solutions exist for the CLIÉ. If your CLIÉ is equipped
with Bluetooth, a Bluetooth GPS is an excellent solution because it does away
with connecting cables and lets you place the GPS receiver on your dash-
board while using the CLIÉ anywhere else in the car. Otherwise, a cabled
solution is a little more cumbersome but still beats the heck out driving
around the Mittlerer Ring in Munich 11 times.
Check out the following GPS options:
 Mapopolis Navigator: The first serious GPS navigation program for the
Palm OS has been greatly enhanced for Palm OS 5. The new version
issues spoken prompts for every turn and can automatically reroute you
if you get off the planned route. Mapopolis offers GPS receivers that plug
into your CLIÉ’s HotSync port, as well as a Bluetooth model. See www.
mapopolis.com for more info.
 Navman GPS 4460: The most advanced GPS solution available for the
CLIÉ, the Navman 4460, shown in Figure 17-8, offers all the most
advanced navigation features: on-the-fly rerouting, address-to-address
map planning, the ability to program favorite routes and destinations,
lists of attractions in the area, and voice-guided navigation. But what
makes it really cool is the 3D map perspective. This isn’t just a gimmick;
it really does help you keep track of the direction that you’re traveling
when you can afford only a quick glance at the screen while stopped at a
traffic light. The GPS connects to your CLIÉ by using Bluetooth wireless
communication. Check out www.navman.com for more details.
272
Part V: Reaching Outside the CLIÉ Box 

Other Essentials
Make sure to pack few other goodies in your travel kit:
 Charging kit and/or backup batteries: You don’t want your CLIÉ to
poop out because it ran out of power halfway through a trip. Be sure to
bring along a charger. Wall chargers are good, but battery power charg-
ers are an excellent option if you plan to use the CLIÉ while you’re away
from AC plugs. I take a look at power options in Chapter 20.
 Plug adapters: If you’re heading to a foreign country, don’t forget a plug
adapter for your CLIÉ’s charging brick. The good news is that the CLIÉ
includes a universal power supply, so you don’t need a voltage con-
verter. A basic plug adapter that costs just a few bucks will do.
 Memory Stick and Backup software: Before you hit the road, make a
backup of your CLIÉ’s contents. (See Chapter 19 for details on how.) And
keep making backups while you travel. The last thing that you want to
do is lose all your data when you’re 500 miles away from your HotSync
cable.

Chapter 17: CLIÉ, the Ultimate Travel Companion

 Protection for your CLIÉ and accessories: Pack a case to keep all your
CLIÉ materials together and to protect it in your luggage. Of course,
pack your CLIÉ in a briefcase or carry-on for easy access and for secu-
rity reasons.
 Your CLIÉ’s Installation CD and a HotSync cable: If you’re going to be
near a computer while you’re on the road, you never know whether you
might want to download and install a new program, use a full-sized com-
puter to enter some data, or so on. Pack these, and your PDA can be
friendly with strange computers.
 Headphones: If you’re going to listen to music or watch videos, chances
are that the guy in the seat next to you might not want to share the expe-
rience of your Weird Al Yankovic MP3s.

CLIÉ

In this part . . .
S
ome disasters you just can’t protect against. Such cat-
astrophes include earthquakes, flash floods, and tod-
dlers who think it’d be fun to see what a CLIÉ looks like
dipped in yogurt. However, you can do at least some
preparation for more common calamities.
In this part, I show you the CLIÉ’s security features and
how to make backups to protect your data in case of
damage or theft. You find out about solutions for keeping
your CLIÉ powered on the road and for protecting it from
bumps, scratches, and (hopefully) drops.

Chapter 18
Protect Your CLIÉ’s Data
In This Chapter
 Setting a password
 Locking your CLIÉ
 Hiding private records
 Protecting desktop data
 Using industrial-strength security
I
f you’ve taken advantage of the advice laid out in previous chapters of this
book, your CLIÉ very likely contains everything from contact information
to photos of the kids to your spending records.
This is wonderfully handy. But it also means that anyone who picks up your
CLIÉ has access to all your business contacts, your financial transactions,
and a series of pictures of you dressed as Captain Feathersword at your son’s
second birthday party . . . not to mention your To Do list, which includes the
entry Rent Gigli. This is not information that you want falling into the wrong
hands.
Luckily, the Palm OS includes security features that let you completely lock
access to your CLIÉ — no password, no access. As an added layer of security,
you can choose to hide or mask only specific records, thus keeping your
important data (and your taste in films) safe and private.
Setting Your Password
To get started, tap the Security icon in the Program Launcher. The screen
shown in Figure 18-1 appears.

The first thing that you need to do is select a password. The usual password
caveats apply here. Don’t choose something too obvious, like password, 123,
or your own name. The best passwords are composed of a series of random
characters, but because your password needs to be something that you can
remember, da5r340 might not be the way to go.
Keep in mind that you enter this password with the stylus (unless your CLIÉ
has a built-in keyboard), so you probably want to keep it fairly short. Also,
avoid difficult Graffiti characters: If you have problems drawing a k that your
handheld can consistently recognize, kooky1 isn’t a good password.
When you decide on a password, use the following steps to set up your CLIÉ’s
security feature:
1. Tap in the Password text box — where it says Unassigned.
The Password screen appears, as shown in Figure 18-2.
2. Enter your password on the appropriate line.
Below the password-entry line is a Hint field. In this field, enter a clue
that will jog your memory if you forget your password. For example, if
you choose your first pet’s name as your password, enter first kitty in
the Hint field. Your CLIÉ displays this hint when anyone enters an incor-
rect password.
3. Tap OK. The Password confirmation screen shows your hint and asks
you to confirm the password.
Just re-enter your password. The CLIÉ is making sure that you didn’t
make a typo.
On the Password confirmation screen, note the warning that alerts you
that any private records will be deleted if you select the Lost Password
option later on. Though it sounds ominous, don’t worry. You probably
haven’t yet marked any records as Private, and even if you do have to
use the Lost Password option later, you can restore the deleted records
by HotSyncing.
Figure 18-1:

application

278
Part VI: Securing and Protecting Your CLIÉ 

4. Tap OK again to return to the main Security screen. (Refer to 
Figure 18-1.)
Your password is now set, but until you select your privacy and lock 
settings, your data is still unprotected.
If you’d like to try entering your password now, tap the Lock & Turn Off
button. After you tap the Off & Lock button on the System Lockout screen
that follows, the CLIÉ powers off. The next time you turn it on, it requires the
password before you can use the device.
Any time the CLIÉ prompts you for a password, you can tap the little a icon at
the bottom of the writing area and use the on-screen keyboard to enter your
password.
Locking Your CLIÉ
The best way to keep your personal information away from prying eyes is to
set your PDA so that it’s locked at power-up, which means that the only way
to access its contents is to enter the password at startup. The only way that
someone could access the device without the password is to perform a hard
reset — which erases all its contents, keeping your data out of nefarious
hands.
To activate the power-up password, first tap the Security icon in the Program
Launcher to access the Security application. (Refer to Figure 18-1.) Be sure
that you’ve set a password. (See the previous section.) Tap the Auto Lock
Handheld text box — the default text there is Never. After entering your pass-
word, you’re taken to the Lock Handheld screen (as shown in Figure 18-3),
which offers you four options:
Figure 18-2:
Including a
hint can
help remind
you of your
password.
279
Chapter 18: Protect Your CLIÉ’s Data

 Never: This is the default setting. It lets you turn on your handheld and
start using it immediately without entering a password.
 On Power Off: Whenever you turn off your CLIÉ, or if it shuts down
automatically after a period of inactivity, it locks. You need to enter your
password every time you turn it back on.
 At a Preset Time: This setting is useful primarily if you keep your CLIÉ
with you all day but leave it on a desk at the end of the workday. You can
set the PDA to lock at a particular time of day so that, for instance,
anyone turning the device on after 5 p.m. has to enter the password.
 After a Preset Delay: This is the best compromise between safety and
convenience. You can set the handheld to lock after a set number of min-
utes or hours. You need to enter your password only if you haven’t used
the CLIÉ for a while. Set it for, say, 15 minutes, and you can turn the
device on and off to look up information without hassling with the pass-
word, but it locks soon after you stop using it. With the time set at 
15 minutes, you never have to enter the password more than three 
times in an hour.
Note that locking the CLIÉ protects only the contents of the PDA itself, not
the Memory Stick expansion card. A dastardly villain (or nosy co-worker)
could easily remove the Memory Stick from your handheld, place it in
another CLIÉ or a PC card reader, and view the contents. If you want to pro-
tect the data on your expansion card as well, be sure to check out one of the
third-party encryption programs that I discuss at the end of this chapter in
the section “Industrial-Strength Security.”

The CLIÉ

280
Part VI: Securing and Protecting Your CLIÉ 

Hiding Private Records
Rather than locking access to your entire handheld, you can use the privacy
settings to simply hide or mask the data that you don’t want others to see.
(You can lock your CLIÉ as well, doubling your protection.)
Private records are available in the standard organizer applications (Address
Book, To Do, and so on), as well as in some third-party programs.
Private records aren’t highly secure. Casual users can’t access them, but
knowledgeable hackers can get to them relatively easily. For information that
truly, vitally needs to be kept from prying eyes, such as confidential business
data, you should look into a third-party security application. I cover such
applications at the end of this chapter in the section “Industrial-Strength
Security.”
To set the privacy level, tap the Security icon in your CLIÉ’s Program
Launcher to launch the Security application. (Refer to Figure 18-1.) Near the
bottom of the screen, you see Current Privacy, with a pop-up selection menu.
Choose one of these options:
281
Chapter 18: Protect Your CLIÉ’s Data
Personalize your password screen
When the CLIÉ requests a password on power-
up, it also displays the device’s owner informa-
tion, if it’s present, as you can see in the
following figure. Entering your name, e-mail
address, and telephone number — and possi-
bly an offer of a reward, as well — gives you a
much better chance of recovering a lost CLIÉ.
To set your owner information, tap the Prefs
icon in the Program Launcher. Then choose
Owner from the menu at the top-right of the
screen. Enter your personal information on the
Owner information screen that follows. Note
that the System Lockout screen shows only the
first three lines of owner information without
scrolling, so put the important contact info
there, where it’s sure to be seen even by some-
one unfamiliar with operating a CLIÉ.

 Show Records: The default option, which shows all your data.
 Mask Records: Obscures any private records with a gray bar and places
a lock icon next to them, as shown in the top half of Figure 18-4. That
way, you know that more data is there, but you need to enter your pass-
word to actually view the records.
 Hide Records: Hides private records completely. They aren’t visible at
all until you change your security settings to show private records.
Which option should you choose? Masking is a bit more convenient because
it reminds you that some records are hidden, and you can simply tap a
masked record to bring up the password prompt and reveal the obscured
data. If you choose to hide the records completely, you could very well forget
that they’re there. To reveal hidden records, tap the Menu soft button to
access the Options menu in your application, choose Security, and change
the setting to Show Records.
If you hide a record, it doesn’t show up when you use the Find command. If
you’re, say, looking for all your contacts who live in a certain ZIP code, you
want to be sure to set security to Show Records before searching.
To flag an individual record as private in one of the built-in information man-
ager applications, edit a record, tap the Details button, and select the Private
check box in the Details settings, as shown in Figure 18-5. See Chapters 3
through 6 for more information on how to edit records in the information
manager applications..

Part VI: Securing and Protecting Your CLIÉ 

Defend Your Desktop Data
If you’ve chosen to hide or mask records on your handheld, they’re also pass-
word-protected in the Sony Palm Desktop and CLIÉ Organizer applications on
your desktop system. Note that you can change the display between Hide
Records and Mask Records without the password — this doesn’t give snoop-
ers a look at your hidden data, but it lets them know that you’re hiding 
something.
Just as you can lock access to your handheld, you can require a password to
access your desktop organizer data as well, as shown in Figure 18-6. In the
Sony Palm Desktop application on your desktop system, choose Tools➪
Options from the menu bar, and then click the Security tab. Finally, select the
Require Password to Access the Palm Desktop Data check box. This is a per-
user setting, so if someone else also HotSyncs a Palm OS handheld with your
desktop system, changing this setting doesn’t affect the other CLIÉ’s security.
In CLIÉ Organizer, you can find the check box under the Tools➪Options menu.
Note that desktop security works only if you’re HotSyncing with the Sony
Palm Desktop or CLIÉ Organizer applications. If you’re HotSyncing Microsoft
Outlook, all your private or masked records are visible on the desktop com-
puter. In this case, you want to be sure to use the Windows security and pass-
word features to ensure that prying eyes can’t access your Outlook data,
because Outlook itself doesn’t hide individual records.

Industrial-Strength Security
The CLIÉ’s built-in security is fine for casual use, but if you’re keeping truly
sensitive data, such as company financial information, a private client list, or
the location of your weapons of mass destruction on your handheld, you
want to consider using an add-on application that offers advanced security
features and industrial-level data encryption. Here are a few of the top choices.
PDA Defense
Hearing a program’s publisher brag that its product is used by all branches of
the military, by the FBI, and in the White House should give you a feeling of
security. PDA Defense offers 128-bit encryption of data files created by both
built-in and add-on applications. It protects data on expansion cards and can
even be set to make your data self-destruct if someone tries the wrong pass-
word too many times. My favorite feature is the ability to use a combination
of button presses in place of standard password entry — still secure, but
much faster. Figure 18-7 shows the Activation, Bomb, and Owner setting
options. For more information, visit www.pdadefense.com.

Part VI: Securing and Protecting Your CLIÉ 

TealLock
TealLock offers a feature set similar to that of PDA Defense, including the abil-
ity to encrypt expansion cards and to destroy data if too many attempts are
made to guess a password. Among its unique features are the ability to put an
image on the lock screen (handy as a password hint, or just another excuse
to see your baby pictures) and the ability to set guest passwords that offer
limited data access. Figure 18-8 shows the lock screen. If you’re using your
handheld in a medical environment, TealLock is compliant with United States
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy regula-
tions. For more information, visit www.tealpoint.com.
Cloak
Rather than providing security for your entire CLIÉ, the Chapura Cloak soft-
ware, shown in Figure 18-9, acts as an electronic safe where you can store
critical but private information, such as credit card numbers, personal

identification numbers (PINs), passwords, and other personal data. Cloak

Day as a Good Breakfast
In This Chapter
 Understanding the importance of backups
 Determining backup options for your CLIÉ
 Using Memory Stick Backup
 Getting to know internal backup memory
 Using third-party backup programs
Your CLIÉ has become a trusty companion — the Andy Richter to your
Conan O’Brien. And just as Sir Edmund Hillary wouldn’t want to find
himself climbing Mount Everest without the Sherpa mountaineer Tenzing
Norgay, you don’t want to find yourself far from home without the informa-
tion that’s stored in your CLIÉ.
But what if disaster strikes? A dead battery or severe system crash can wipe
your CLIÉ’s memory clean, leaving you in the lurch without any of the infor-
mation that you depend on. More horrifying still is the thought of a lost,
stolen, or broken CLIÉ. Even if you scrounge up a replacement unit on the
road, without a backup you’re left staring at an empty screen.
Memory Stick to the Rescue
In the early days of PDAs, a lost, stolen, or broken unit could be a real problem.
But every CLIÉ ships with a Memory Stick expansion slot, so CLIÉ owners can
hit the road with no worries. You can easily create regular backups of the infor-
mation contained on your handheld on a Memory Stick — shown in Figure
19-1— secure in the knowledge that your backup can be easily restored to the
unit if something goes awry. And thanks to falling Memory Stick prices, you
could even bring along an extra Memory Stick with an emergency backup in
case something irreparable happens to your CLIÉ or its Memory Stick.

As much as the technology writer in me cringes to even suggest such a stone-
knives-and-bearskins approach, the best way to truly ensure that your vital
information is available when you’re on the road is to use the Print function in
the Sony Palm Desktop software to print a copy of your schedule and your vital
contacts. In all my years of PDA usage, I’ve had to fall back on this only once —
when a battery inexplicably wouldn’t recharge — but it was a life-saver.
Your CLIÉ’s contents are backed up to your desktop system each time you
HotSync. If your CLIÉ’s memory is wiped clean after a crash or battery prob-
lem, you can simply HotSync the handheld again to restore all its contents. Of
course, this doesn’t help you when you’re in Seattle and your home desktop
system is in Baltimore, which is why we’re looking at other backup options.
Choose Your Backup Weapon
Most CLIÉ models include a built-in backup program called MS Backup, which
is shorthand for Memory Stick Backup. (The PEG-UX40 and PEG-UX50 models
use a different backup method.) This simple program lets you back up the
entire contents of your CLIÉ on a Memory Stick with just a few taps of the
stylus. Restoring the contents of your CLIÉ is just as easy. And because MS
Backup is built in, you don’t have to reinstall it to restore your data after a
crash.
Some newer CLIÉ models, such as the PEG-UX40 and PEG-UX50 (shown in
Figure 19-2), actually contain dedicated backup memory designed to protect
the contents of your PDA in case the power dies. The backup process is
engaged automatically when power gets low; you don’t have to run a pro-
gram to create a backup of your data.

288
Part VI: Securing and Protecting Your CLIÉ 

The CLIÉ is also compatible with the wide variety of third-party backup pro-
grams designed for the Palm OS. Even though your CLIÉ probably has built-in
backup software, these are still appealing because they offer advanced fea-
tures such as the ability to restore individual files, to automatically back up
your CLIÉ’s contents at a specific time of day, and to encrypt backup data in
case your Memory Stick falls into the wrong hands.
Working with MS Backup
To access the backup program, tap the Applications soft button to the left of
the Graffiti area and then choose MS Backup from the Program Launcher.
The MS Backup screen appears, as shown in Figure 19-3, with a list of existing
backups and available slots. The program can keep up to five backups on a
single Memory Stick.
You might be asking, “Why create multiple backups?” When installing new pro-
grams, you might want to try a new add-on application while you’re on the
road. However, the add-on application might not play nicely with the other
programs on your CLIÉ. If you create one backup before you install the new
Figure 19-2:

backups.
289
Chapter 19: Backups: As Vital to Your Day as a Good Breakfast

program and a second backup after installation, you can always revert your
CLIÉ to its original configuration if the program that you just installed causes
problems. Simply restore the first backup, and the problem program — and
the headaches it was causing — will be history.
Below the backup list, you find two large buttons, Backup and Restore, as
well as a smaller Delete button that’s used to eliminate older backups. MS
Backup is a simple application; no additional options exist.
Creating a backup
Follow these steps to create a backup of your CLIÉ’s contents:
1. Insert a Memory Stick into your CLIÉ’s card slot.
You must insert your Memory Stick card before launching MS Backup.
(Note that you can insert a Memory Stick with the CLIÉ turned on.) If
you launch MS Backup with no card in the slot, the program complains
that the card isn’t present and sends you back to the Applications
screen. Then you have to start up MS Backup all over again after you
insert the card.
Remember that you need enough space on your Memory Stick to con-
tain the entire contents of your CLIÉ. If you have 2MB free on a 16MB
CLIÉ, you need approximately 14MB of free space on your Memory Stick.
MS Backup displays an error message if the Memory Stick doesn’t have
enough room. To free up space, you can delete old backups or delete
application and media files that you no longer need.
Figure 19-3:
Five slots for

say, “Oops.”
290
Part VI: Securing and Protecting Your CLIÉ 

MS Backup doesn’t support CompactFlash cards. On CLIÉs that also fea-
ture CompactFlash slots, such as the PEG-NX73 and PEG-NX80 models,
you still must use the Memory Stick slot for backups that you create
with MS Backup. If you prefer to use a CompactFlash card, you need to
use a third-party backup application.
2. Tap the Applications soft button to the left of the Graffiti area, and
then choose MS Backup from the Program Launcher.
The MS Backup screen appears.
3. In the MS Backup screen, tap to select a backup slot.
The MS Backup screen always displays a list of five backup slots at the
top of the screen. Tap one of these slots to select it for the backup. A
highlight indicates the backup slot that you selected.
If you have an older backup that you no longer need, you can simply tap
its slot and overwrite it by making a new backup. If you want to create
an additional backup without deleting existing backups, select an empty
slot if one is available.
4. Tap the Backup button.
If you’re using a slot that contains an existing backup, MS Backup asks
you to confirm whether you want to overwrite it. Tap Yes unless you
really didn’t mean to overwrite an older backup.
5. The program then displays a pop-up message, shown in Figure 19-4,
giving you one last chance to change your mind. Tap OK to start the
backup or Cancel to abort it.
A progress screen appears, showing you what percentage of the backup
is complete. The backup shows up in the slot you chose. You can’t name
a backup, but the slot shows the date and time you performed the
backup.

Chapter 19: Backups: As Vital to Your Day as a Good Breakfast

Restoring a backup
Now, don’t get panicky from all this backup talk. In many years of testing a
wide variety of PDAs, I can count on one hand (well, and perhaps a couple of
extra fingers) the number of times I’ve lost my data and had to restore a
backup file. But far better to be prepared: You probably don’t regularly drive
into lamp posts, but you still buy a car with seatbelts and airbags. . . .
In a couple of special situations, you might need to restore a backup file. The
obvious case is when you lose all your data due to a power failure or system
crash. But on rare occasions, you might need to restore a backup even with-
out losing your data. Perhaps you installed a poorly written add-on program
that is causing your CLIÉ to become unstable, perhaps crashing randomly. Or
maybe you accidentally deleted your only copy of the picture you took of a
UFO landing on your back lawn.
Before restoring a backup to CLIÉ that already contains other data, do a hard
reset. (If the term hard reset doesn’t ring any bells, check out Chapter 2.) This
ensures that you don’t end up with a mixture of new and old information.
Remember, restoring a backup overwrites any existing files with the same
names, possibly with older versions, so be sure that this is really what you
want to do.
To restore a backup of your CLIÉ’s contents, follow these steps:
1. Insert the Memory Stick containing the backup files into your CLIÉ’s
card slot.
Remember, Memory Stick Backup launches only if it detects a Memory
Stick installed in your CLIÉ.
2. Tap the Applications soft button to the left of the Graffiti area, and
then choose MS Backup from the Program Launcher.
The MS Backup screen appears.
3. In the MS Backup screen, tap the backup file that you want to restore.
If you have multiple backups, note that the date is listed for each one.
The bottom backup in the list might not be the most recent one, so be
sure that you select the right backup. A highlight indicates the backup
name that you selected.
4. Tap the Restore button.
A pop-up message asks you to confirm whether you really want to
restore all files from the backup.
292
Part VI: Securing and Protecting Your CLIÉ 

5. Tap OK.
Because restoring a backup overwrites any changes that you’ve made
since the last backup, MS Backup is cautious and asks you whether you
really, really want to restore the backup with a Confirm Restore window,
shown in Figure 19-5.
6. Tap OK again to indicate that you weren’t under the influence of alien
mind control and that you do indeed want to restore the backup.
After the restoration is complete, the CLIÉ resets, and you’re sent back in
time to the point of your last backup. Actually, only your data is sent back,
but boy, wouldn’t the time-travel thing be a handy feature for future CLIÉs?
What if you just want to restore a file or two and not the entire contents
of your CLIÉ? You can use CLIÉ Files (see Chapter 14) to copy a single file
back to your CLIÉ’s main memory. Just navigate with CLIÉ Files to the
/Palm/Programs/MSBackup directory and select a backup folder. (They’re
numbered 0 through 4.) Tap the folder to see a list of files. Select the check
boxes next to the files that you wish to restore, tap the Copy button at the
bottom of the screen, and finally tap the Handheld button at the very top of
the directory list. If another version of the file already exists, you’re asked to
confirm that you want to overwrite it. Tap the Yes to All button to confirm. To
be safe, do a soft reset after restoring individual files. (Chapter 3 has more on
soft resets.)

mation.
293
Chapter 19: Backups: As Vital to Your Day as a Good Breakfast

Using the Internal Backup Function
Sony’s micro-laptop-style CLIÉ models, the UX40 and UX50, both include
16MB of specialized backup memory designed to protect your data in case
your battery dies. That’s a great feature, but unfortunately, the CLIÉ creates a
backup only when the battery is about to go. If you’re meticulous about keep-
ing your battery charged, you might find that your backup dates back to the
day you purchased your CLIÉ — that is, it’s a backup of an empty device.
However, you can cheat and manually force the CLIÉ to perform an internal
backup by using the Power Saving feature, which is actually designed to pro-
tect your data in case you put your CLIÉ in storage for a while.
The UX series CLIÉ models don’t include the MS Backup application. If you
want to create multiple backups or store a backup to Memory Stick, you need
a third-party backup program. I suggest a few such programs later in this
chapter, in the section “Backups with All the Bells and Whistles.”
Performing a manual internal backup
To force your CLIÉ to perform an internal backup, follow this procedure:
1. Tap the Applications soft button to the left of the Graffiti area and
then tap on the Prefs icon in the Program Launcher.
The Preferences screen appears.
2. Tap the menu button in the top-right corner of the screen and select
Power Saving.
The Power Saving screen appears, as shown in Figure 19-6.
3. Tap the Turn Off button on the Power Saving screen to shut down
your CLIÉ.
A pop-up message asks you whether you really want to save a backup
and turn off the system.
4. Tap Yes to start the procedure.
The existing backup is overwritten with the current contents of your
CLIÉs main memory.
You can now rest assured that your current information is safely protected in
crash-proof memory.
294
Part VI: Securing and Protecting Your CLIÉ 

Note that the 29MB Internal Media storage area built into the UX-series CLIÉ
models is actually flash memory and isn’t susceptible to loss from crashes or
dead batteries. You don’t need to worry about backing it up, but I suggest
keeping critical files on Memory Sticks instead — you can still lose the con-
tents of such flash memory if you misplace or damage your CLIÉ, and these
files aren’t saved to your desktop system during a HotSync.
Restoring an internal backup
When turning on your CLIÉ after using the Power Saving function or after per-
forming a hard reset, the CLIÉ asks you whether you want to restore your
backup data. The date and time of the backup are shown.
If you’ve done a HotSync of your CLIÉ more recently than the date of the
internal backup, you should select No when it asks you if you want to restore
your backup and restore your data by doing a HotSync instead, because your
desktop system’s backup contains the newest versions of your files. (See
Chapter 2 for more on HotSyncing.)
If you tap Yes, a bar indicates the progress of the Restore process, and your
CLIÉ resets when the procedure is complete. If you tap No, your CLIÉ
becomes a clean slate with nothing stored in its main memory.

Chapter 19: Backups: As Vital to Your Day as a Good Breakfast

Backups with All the Bells and Whistles
A variety of add-on backup programs with additional features is available,
such as automatic timed backups. These add-ons are worth checking out just
to avoid that sinking feeling after a crash when you realize that you last
remembered to back up your CLIÉ’s data three months ago. . . .
BackupBuddyVFS
BackupBuddyVFS (shown in Figure 19-7) is the granddaddy of all Palm OS
backup programs. It offers basic scheduled backup support, file encryption,
and the ability to create a backup every time you turn off the CLIÉ. Perhaps
its slickest feature is the program’s ability to back up on your Memory Stick
any files that you delete, so that you never have to worry about accidentally
deleting a file again as long as you make regular backups. For more informa-
tion, visit www.bluenomad.com.
BackupMan
Bits ’n Bolts Software’s BackupMan, shown in Figure 19-8, is as easy to use as
MS Backup, but it boasts of many advanced features despite its low price. It
allows you to schedule daily — or even hourly — backups and to trigger a
backup each time you HotSync. It even supports restoring individual files. For
more information, visit www.bitsnbolts.com.

FlyBackUp
FlyBackUp, shown in Figure 19-9, can protect your backup data from prying
eyes by password-encrypting it. FlyBackUp means no more worries about evil
agents in black helicopters stealing your Memory Stick and restoring your
data to their own CLIÉs to see what you’ve been up to. The program also
compresses your information as it copies to the Memory Stick, which has the
double benefit of speeding up your backup and taking up less space on the
card. It also offers the usual frills, such as scheduled backups. The downside
is that it doesn’t let you restore individual files. For more information, visit
www.fly-zip.com.

In This Chapter
 Understanding battery basics
 Maximizing battery life
 Charging anywhere
W
hether your personal CLIÉ is a basic organizer or is loaded to the gills
with options like MP3 players and built-in cameras, one particular
component trumps all the others in importance: the battery. Without a bat-
tery charge, your CLIÉ is nothing more than a stylish Japanese paperweight
that cost you hundreds of dollars.
Though I’m not so bold as to deny that a market for stylish $300 Japanese
paperweights exists, I’m guessing that you probably value the CLIÉ’s func-
tionality above all else. And to keep it functional, you need to keep your bat-
tery charged. On CLIÉ models with virtual Graffiti screens, you can tap the
battery icon on the command bar at the bottom of the screen to see how
much juice remains. (See Figure 20-1.)

Battery Basics
Your first question is probably “What’s the proper procedure for charging my
battery?” Should you drop the handheld back in its cradle immediately after
use or let the battery run down first? Battery technologies have evolved dra-
matically since the first PDAs were introduced, so some of the advice that
you might have received a few years back for maximizing battery life is no
longer valid.
The good news is that today you can recharge whenever it’s convenient. With
modern batteries, charge retention and battery longevity aren’t affected by
how often you recharge. The lithium-based batteries used in CLIÉs aren’t
affected by the memory issues found in older rechargeable batteries — older
rechargeable batteries would lose the ability to hold a full charge if you didn’t
drain them completely before recharging. Your CLIÉ’s batteries perform
equally well whether they’re charged after just a few minutes’ use or after
they’re almost completely drained.
Figure 20-1:
This CLIÉ is
charged
and ready to
hit the road.
300
Part VI: Securing and Protecting Your CLIÉ

The lithium polymer batteries that Sony uses are designed for three to five
years of overall use. For the most part, you can’t alter your usage habits to
extend that longevity, though extreme heat can reduce battery capacity over
time. (In other words, don’t leave your PDA on a car’s dashboard or take it
with you on your next vacation to the planet Venus.)
What happens if the battery does stop holding its charge after a few years? 
If your CLIÉ is a PEG-NZ90 (shown in Figure 20-2), you can just buy a new bat-
tery, but at the time that this book was written, that was the only CLIÉ with a
user-removable battery. If you own any other model, you either need to send
the CLIÉ back to Sony and pay to have a replacement battery installed or use
battery death as a convenient excuse to upgrade to the latest and greatest
new model.
If you’re the adventurous techie type, you can replace the battery yourself.
(Although the warranty should no longer be any use by the time the battery
dies, keep in mind that CLIÉs aren’t designed to be opened by the users, 
and a botched self-repair might give you an excuse to upgrade after all.)
GetHighTech (www.gethightech.com), for instance, sells a variety of CLIÉ
replacement parts, including batteries for a variety of models. The batteries
cost around $40 to $50.

Chapter 20: Power Struggle: Getting the Most from Your CLIÉ’s Battery

Maximizing Battery Life
Although laptop computers typically offer general guidelines on how long
their batteries last, such ratings aren’t available for your CLIÉ. That’s because
battery consumption varies dramatically, depending on how you use your
PDA. A CLIÉ might last seven or eight hours in light usage, such as looking up
addresses or reading eBooks, but might support only three or four hours of
playing games or listening to MP3 tunes.
On a day of normal usage, you probably drop the CLIÉ in its cradle after a few
hours of use, and battery life typically isn’t an issue. But if you’re going to be
away from your cradle for a while — say, on a long plane flight or an extended
business trip — you might want to squeeze a little extra juice out of the bat-
tery. Here are a few tips for extending your battery life:
 Turn down the screen brightness. Reducing your CLIÉ’s brightness level
to about 30 percent almost halves the battery drain during basic opera-
tions. The screen remains very readable; you’re not likely to even notice
the difference after a few minutes.
Just tap the little star icon below the Menu soft button in the writing
area to bring up the Adjust Brightness slider, shown in Figure 20-3. See
Chapter 2 for full details on how to adjust screen settings.
Figure 20-3:

302
Part VI: Securing and Protecting Your CLIÉ

 Adjust the Auto-Off After setting, shown in Figure 20-4, from the standard
two minutes down to one minute, or even 30 seconds. If you tend to turn
on your CLIÉ several times during the day rather than use it for extended
sessions, this can do wonders for extending battery life. (You access this
setting by tapping the Applications soft button to the left of the Graffiti
area, choosing the Prefs icon from the Program Launcher, tapping the
menu button at the top-right corner of the screen, and then selecting
General Settings.)
 Also in the Prefs➪General settings are a few other adjustments that can
give you a little more usage on a charge. Turning sound off when it’s not
needed helps a little. If you don’t expect people to be beaming you busi-
ness cards and other data via your CLIÉ’s infrared (IR) port, turn off the
Beam Receive setting. (Don’t forget that you turned it off, though, because
you might be in for a huge headache the next time someone tries to beam
data to you and you can’t figure out why your CLIÉ is just sitting there,
twiddling its virtual thumbs.)
 On MP3-equipped CLIÉs, you can turn off the screen to reduce power
when you’re just listening to music. Find the Hold slider on the side of
your CLIÉ and slide it toward the top of the unit. The screen turns off,
but the music continues to play.
A few CLIÉ models, such as the PEG-UX40/50 and PEG-TH55, use a smart
custom Sony processor chip that slows itself down during light usage in
order to save power. If you’re using an older CLIÉ with a Dragonball proces-
sor or a CLIÉ that uses an Intel ARM processor, you can use add-on programs

303
Chapter 20: Power Struggle: Getting the Most from Your CLIÉ’s Battery

to adjust the processor speed. These are typically designed to speed up your
handheld, a process called overclocking, but they can also slow it down to
increase battery life. If you have an older Dragonball processor-based CLIÉ
that runs Palm OS 4, look for Afterburner 3.2. Newer ARM-based CLIÉs can
use a program called PXA Clocker, shown in Figure 20-5. Both Afterburner
and PXA Clocker can be found at www.palmgear.com. Note that adjusting
your PDA’s clock speed can cause crashes or even overheating, and these
programs should be used by only the most tech-savvy users.

It’s dead, Jim. Or is It?
If your CLIÉ appears to be dead and unrespon-
sive, the Hold slider is the first thing you can
check. An anonymous relative — who may or
may not be known as mom — called me to tell
me that her CLIÉ PEG-NR70V wouldn’t power on
even after a full charge. If she hit the power
switch or dropped it in the cradle, the screen
would flash for a second and then go black.
Thinking the worst, our first thought was that
we’d have to replace a failed battery. Then she
just moved the Hold slider down to the inactive
position, and her CLIÉ was as good as new!
If your battery is completely drained, I hope that
you either made a backup (see Chapter 19) or
HotSynced your CLIÉ recently, because a data
drain means that any newly added data has likely
been lost. Before you panic, though, drop your
CLIÉ in its cradle for a few minutes and then turn
it on. The CLIÉ is smart enough to reserve some
power to keep the contents of its memory intact
when the battery gets very low. When your bat-
tery is so drained that the PDA can’t even turn on,
you typically have a day or so to get it to a
charger before data is irrevocably lost.

Charge Anywhere
What can you do when you’re far from your cradle, and your charge is running
low? Fear not — a wide variety of charging solutions can handle just about any
situation. The most flexible is Sony’s PEGA-BC10 battery adapter, shown in
Figure 20-6. This little gadget holds four AA batteries, which can be used to
recharge your CLIÉ literally anywhere. It plugs into the HotSync cradle port,
which means it works with all models except for the UX series. If you exhaust
your CLIÉ’s battery, you can even run the device off the PEGA-BC10 while it
recharges your handheld. This is a must-have gadget for the frequent traveler.
If you’re on the road with your laptop — or you’re visiting a location where 
you know that a computer is available — one of the least expensive and most
portable charging solutions is a USB sync-and-charge cable. These cables use
the voltage that’s normally used to power USB peripherals (such as mouses
and Webcams) to top off your CLIÉ’s battery. Note that the USB cables included
with some CLIÉ models are simply synchronization cables and don’t charge 
the unit unless you have the power brick plugged in as well. A number of 
third-party companies offer dual-purpose cables. Incipio Technologies (www.
incipiodirect.com), for instance, offers USB Sync-n-Charge cables for a wide
variety of handheld models.
A couple of caveats apply to USB charging. First, some notebook computers
have a particularly wimpy voltage level on their USB ports, making for
extremely long charge times. This situation is getting better — it’s not a prob-
lem with newer laptops — but you should be sure to try a charge before hit-
ting the road. Even USB ports that supply optimal voltage don’t charge your
handheld as quickly as your cradle does.

BC10 can

305
Chapter 20: Power Struggle: Getting the Most from Your CLIÉ’s Battery

USB charging cables can be made even more versatile with the addition of
USB-to-AC or -DC adapters. Cables Unlimited (www.ziplinq.com), for exam-
ple, sells adapters that let you plug a USB charging cable into an AC wall plug
or a DC cigarette-lighter socket.
If you typically travel with a notebook computer, your CLIÉ, and a cell phone,
iGo (www.igo.com) has the ultimate charging solution. A little device they call
the Juice replaces your notebook’s power brick and lets you plug in to wall
sockets, as well as car and airplane charging ports. What makes the Juice
power brick truly unique is its Peripheral Powering System (PPS) — a second
port that allows you to simultaneously recharge two devices. (PPS cables are
available for most major handhelds and phones for about $20 each.) Instead
of hauling a laptop charger and a pair of power bricks for your CLIÉ and cell
phone, simply bring along the Juice and the appropriate PPS cables in the
handy included travel case.
Laptops for Less (www.pdainternalbattery.com) sells replacements for
built-in handheld batteries, as well as innovative external solutions. The PDA
External battery is a rechargeable external battery about the size and shape
of a stick of butter. It’s available for a variety of handhelds, but for the CLIÉ,
you want the PR2-CLIÉ model. It offers 3500mAh of external battery power,
which is more than triple the capacity of most built-in PDA batteries.
If you have patience (and you don’t live in Seattle or a similarly gloomy
place), you can even get a solar charger for your CLIÉ. The Aurora Solar
(www.aurorasolar.com) POCKET-PAL Solar Charger ($49.95 for the charger
plus $4 for PDA adapter) can recharge both PDAs and cell phones. Note that
you need a sunny day and plenty of time — a typical handheld requires most
of a day to fully recharge. For extended camping trips or safaris, though, this
might be just the ticket.
Finally, INSTANT POWER (www.instant-power.com) offers an unusual but
popular emergency charger that uses disposable zinc-air batteries that can
recharge a typical CLIÉ approximately three times. (See Figure 20-7.) After you
buy a full kit that includes the SmartCord adapter for your handheld, you can
easily purchase replacement cartridges at a nearby Radio Shack. The company
also offers the 2in1 kit, which charges by using the zinc-air battery, car ciga-
rette lighter, or your desktop computer’s USB port. If you just can’t get enough
of charging, check out the 3in1 kit, which adds a wall charger to the 2in1 mix.

Part VI: Securing and Protecting Your CLIÉ

Chapter 21
Caring for Your CLIÉ
In This Chapter
 Caring for your CLIÉ’s screen
 Choosing a protective case
 Understanding the warranty and repairs
 Fixing problems yourself
You spend $400 bucks on a nice piece of jewelry for your spouse. When
it’s not being worn, it’s safely locked away in the jewelry box. You blow a
couple hundred dollars on a top-quality, progressive-scan DVD player and set
it up on a high shelf where the kids can’t get near it. Your CLIÉ is probably jeal-
ous of this treatment. Here it is, a fancy, stylish, high-end piece of consumer
electronics, and it’s tossed on your desk among piles of papers, thrown into
briefcases and purses, and even made to suffer the indignity of being carried
around in your pants pocket.
Treat your CLIÉ like the faithful companion that it is by keeping its screen and
case clean and safe, and it will continue to serve you well. And beware of the
toddlers. I don’t ever again want to hear a story about a toddler who thought
it would be cool to fill a PDA’s HotSync port with cake icing. . . .
For the times when something does go awry, I show you the places to get
help at the end of this chapter.
Want to see some really scary stories about what can happen to your PDA if
you’re not careful? Visit the Palm Graveyard at www.palminfocenter.com/
graveyard.asp, where you can read such frightening tales as “On Palms and
Skateboarding,” “Flushed at 30,000 Feet,” and the gut-wrenching “5-Wood
Meets CLIÉ.” (Figure 21-1 highlights another spine-tingling tale.)

Screen Savers
When I say screen saver, I’m not talking about the rotating cubes and star fields
that you see on your desktop system monitor, but products designed for keep-
ing your CLIÉ’s screen safe from damage. A tiny little scratch might not affect
your ability to see what’s happening on the screen, but it could affect your abil-
ity to tap a particular spot on the screen — which can be annoying in some
instances and a serious problem if that scratch happens to be in the writing
area.
Besides the obvious advice — be careful when using your stylus, and use
only a stylus designed for PDA use — you can do other things to protect your
screen. Creating screen protectors (clear film covers for handhelds) is actually
quite an industry. You can see a typical screen protector in Figure 21-2.
When buying a screen protector, be sure to get one that’s designed for your
particular handheld model rather than a generic screen protector. Screen
protectors work best and are most unobtrusive when they’re exactly the
same size as your screen, with no gaps at the edges or problem fits caused by
trimming them.

Part VI: Securing and Protecting Your CLIÉ 

Screen protectors are designed to be transparent and inconspicuous in regu-
lar use, but some people see a slight reduction in screen clarity with the extra
layer of plastic. If this particular problem plagues you, and you have a hand-
held with a silk-screen text entry area (Chapter 2 covers the silk-screen area),
you can always trim the protector so that it covers just the Graffiti area and
not the liquid crystal display (LCD) screen. You’ll have a little less protection,
but the Graffiti area tends to see the most stylus action and is most crucial to
protect.
You can find screen protectors at many stores that sell CLIÉs, but because of
the slight differences in screen sizes among models, finding one with a perfect
fit can sometimes be hard. In some cases, the screens on various models are
identical in size — such as the CLIÉ NR-, NX-, and NZ-series handhelds. When
in doubt, check with the vendor. One of the best deals around can be found at
www.freescreenprotectors.com. Incipio Technologies offers 12-packs of
screen protectors (they do wear out after a while) for just $5 even though the
retail value is $19.95. But as you might guess from the name, you can enter the
coupon code FREESP and get the box of screen protectors for just the cost of
shipping. The deal sounds too good to be true, but the folks at Incipio have
been around for quite a while and have many satisfied customers.
If you want to save a few bucks, and you don’t mind a somewhat less elegant
solution, you can substitute Scotch Magic Removable Tape 811, which is a
clear tape that’s designed to be removed and repositioned. I wouldn’t want to
cover the entire screen with it (the multiple strips would have annoying seams
between them), but the 3⁄4-inch-wide version of the tape is just right for covering
the writing area. Be sure to get the 811 tape that you see in Figure 21-3 — stan-
dard Scotch tape leaves a nasty glue residue when you remove it from your
PDA screen.
What if your CLIÉ’s screen is already scratched? If the gouge is deep or
annoying enough, you unfortunately need to look at sending your PDA back
to Sony for repair. But if the scratch is simply light and annoying, you might
be able to polish it out yourself. After trying a wide variety of products, the
polish that I’ve found works best is a silica-based polish that’s designed for
cleaning ceramic-topped stoves. Used with a very soft cotton cloth and light
pressure, you can polish out many minor scratches. Of course, any process
like this risks doing more damage, so I don’t suggest trying polish out a
scratch unless it’s bad enough that the alternative is sending the PDA in for
repair.

Part VI: Securing and Protecting Your CLIÉ 

On the Case
Choosing a case is a matter of how you plan to carry your CLIÉ. Do you plan
to toss it in a briefcase? Carry it in your pocket? Snap it onto your belt? Is
protection your number-one concern, or style?
You have plenty of choices — many CLIÉs have over a dozen cases available
from a variety of third-party manufacturers. Go for classy leather, sleek alu-
minum, or even a bask-in-my-individualism leopard print.
Do you even need a case at all? If your CLIÉ has solid metal or plastic screen
protection (found on the UX and NX series, the PEG-TG50, and the PEG-TH55),
you can get by without one because the screen is protected when the cover is
closed. You still might want to consider a case, though, to keep the outer shell
from getting scratched up or just to add a little additional personalization.
The following are a few things to consider when buying a case:
 Custom case: What holds the CLIÉ in the case? Beware of generic case
designs that use Velcro to hold your PDA in place. Do you really want to
attach an ugly, fuzzy Velcro sticker to the back of your CLIÉ? Look for a
custom-fit case that uses straps or a molded design to grip the PDA.
 Protection: Are you just looking to protect the CLIÉ from scratches, or
do you want basic drop protection as well? For maximum protection,
look for a hard case with a soft inner lining.
 Useful slots: Some cases have slots for storing Memory Sticks, pens,
business cards, etc. If you like to carry extra storage or an additional
backup, look for one of these.
 Travel-readiness: How do you plan to carry it? If it’s going in your pocket,
you want the thinnest case possible. (Aluminum cases are a good choice.)
If you want to carry it on your belt, a belt loop or clip is a must. If you
want to do both, look for a case with a removable belt-clip post.
 Accessibility: Does the case give easy access to the HotSync port, head-
phone jack, jog dial, and all the buttons? You don’t want to have to
remove your CLIÉ from the case just to look up a phone number.
Dozens of cases are available for the various CLIÉ models. Here are a few of
my favorites:
 Covertec (www.covertec.com) makes my favorite leather cases. Classy
and available in a variety of styles and colors, these cases feature
cutouts in all the right places, and they’re Velcro-free. (Check out Figure
21-4 for a taste of their offerings.)
 Krusell (www.krusell.se) sells quality leather cases with a unique
Multidapt attachment system that lets you connect a belt clip, strap,
vehicle holder, or other carrying attachment to the case.
313
Chapter 21: Caring for Your CLIÉ

 Proporta (www.proporta.com) offers a wide variety of cases, including
slick, thin aluminum cases that boast openings for all the requisite ports
and controls. They also sell leather and soft neoprene cases made from
the same soft, synthetic rubber used for diving suits. The company even
offers a slick, business-card-sized aluminum case for carrying extra
Memory Sticks.

Part VI: Securing and Protecting Your CLIÉ 
For techies only: Fix it yourself
If you’re comfortable digging around inside del-
icate electronics, you can actually buy the parts
to fix obvious problems and repair the unit your-
self. I recommend doing this only if your CLIÉ is
out of warranty, because if it’s not, it will be as
soon as you crack open the case. One little bit of
static electricity can fry the CLIÉ’s delicate
innards, so home surgery should be performed
only if you’re willing to accept the chance that
you could lose the patient.
If that doesn’t scare you, head over to www.
pdaparts.com. There you can find replace-
ment batteries, screen glass, jog dials, and
other key parts — and most parts are priced at
well under $50. The site even offers online
guides and videos covering topics such as
screen removal and battery replacement.

When Bad Things Happen
CLIÉs are like kids. No matter how hard you try to protect them, if you let
them out of the house, there’s always a chance that they’ll fall down and get a
nasty scrape or break their glasses. Well, their glass, at any rate.
315
Chapter 21: Caring for Your CLIÉ
CLIÉ care do’s and don’ts
Some of these do’s and don’ts might seem obvi-
ous, but I’ve caught myself making a few of these
mistakes when I was in a hurry or distracted.
 Do: When using a combination stylus/pen,
be sure that you have it set to Stylus mode
before writing on the screen. At best, the
pen tip will only get ink on your screen; at
worst, it’ll ink the screen and scratch it.
 Do: When carrying your CLIÉ in a belt case,
double-check the snap on the cover before
leaning over. I was happy to find out that a
CLIÉ NX70V can sometimes survive a three-
foot fall onto a concrete garage floor, but I’d
prefer never to have to perform that kind of
torture-testing again.
 Do: Taking your CLIÉ camping or canoeing?
Place it in a Ziploc baggie. This protects it
from water and dirt, and you can press but-
tons and use the stylus without removing
the PDA!
 Do: When your screen gets gunky, clean it
with special wipes such as the Companion-
Link Screen Cleaners, available from 
www.freescreenprotectors.com. In
a pinch, you can use a soft cotton T-shirt to
wipe your PDA’s screen clean. Don’t use
paper towels — they’re too abrasive and
can scratch the screen.
 Do: When carrying the CLIÉ in a briefcase or
purse, remove small metal objects like paper
clips — they could potentially slide into the
HotSync connector and cause a short.
 Do: If you’re putting your CLIÉ in your pocket
without a case, carry only the CLIÉ models
that are equipped with a hard plastic or
metal screen. The soft fabric flip covers
included on some models don’t protect the
screen from loose objects in your pocket.
 Don’t: Don’t use a voltage transformer when
charging your CLIÉ in countries other than
the United States. The charging transformer
brick included with North American CLIÉ
models is a universal power supply that
works on 110/220 v and 50/60 Hz electrical
systems, so all you need is a simple plug
adapter, available at any travel store or online
at sites such as www.laptoptravel.com.
The cheap travel transformers that are sold
for use with hair dryers aren’t designed for
use with sensitive electronics, and they’re
not necessary when using the Sony charging
brick.
 Don’t: Speaking of loose objects, never put
your CLIÉ in your pocket with change, paper
clips, or (gasp!) your car keys. You’re just
begging for a scratched case or screen if
you do.
 Don’t: Never put your CLIÉ in your back
pocket. If you get distracted and forget it’s
there before you sit down, you could hear a
sound far more disturbing than a whoopee
cushion — the crunch of a smushed CLIÉ.

The cost of the repair depends on whether your warranty is still valid and
whether the problem was caused by a technical failure or accident/negli-
gence. A battery that doesn’t charge is covered by warranty, but break out
your credit card if you drop the CLIÉ and damage the screen.
Here are the ways to find technical support and repair services for your CLIÉ:
 Phone support: Call (877) 760-7669.
 Web: Visit www.sony.com/clie and click the Support tab.
 E-Mail: Send missives to handheld.service@am.sony.com.
 User support: You can often get the fastest answers by running your
problems past experienced CLIÉ users in the discussion forums at www.
cliesource.com.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
op ten lists are a staple of humor and attempted humor.
An organization once passed an amendment to its con-
stitution so that I’d stop doing top ten lists at the beginning
of meetings. So I introduced the weekly top nine list.
Unencumbered by ww here, you get the full top ten — four
times! You find out about ten of the best third-party pro-
grams for the CLIÉ and ten of the top accessories. The
book wraps up with the top ten tips for troubleshooting
CLIÉ problems — and for just getting a laugh from some
fun secrets hidden in your CLIÉ — as well as a way-more-
than-top-ten list of handy Web sites devoted to things
CLIÉ.

Ten Great Third-Party Programs
In This Chapter
 Organizing your life
 Managing your files
 Adding functionality to your CLIÉ
F
rom the moment you take it out of the box, the CLIÉ is an amazing
device, but with over 20,000 third-party programs available, the possibil-
ities for personalizing your CLIÉ are endless. Which of those 20,000 programs
do you start with? Start right here with this top-ten list of the very best pro-
grams that are available for the CLIÉ.
Note that my Must Have list also includes programs like Bejeweled, Snapper
Mail, and Documents To Go, all of which I cover elsewhere in this book. This
list is here to introduce you to gems that I don’t cover elsewhere.
Agendus
Agendus integrates all your personal information manager applications into
one souped-up program. It’s an idea similar to the CLIÉ Organizer that’s
included with the PEG-TH55, but the Agendus focuses more on accessibility
than on flash and dazzle. That’s not to say it doesn’t have flash — customiz-
able backgrounds, icons for appointments and contacts, and selectable font
sizes all make configuring Agendus fun. All sorts of provisions exist for link-
ing your data between modules, and the Pocket PC–style Today screen puts
your upcoming appointments and To Dos in one spot. Agendus is available
from www.iambic.com.

Contacts 5
Contacts 5 is a sleek Address Book replacement application that offers sev-
eral different quick lookup techniques that make finding addresses and
phone numbers easier than ever. You can customize its look with download-
able graphic skins and even connect to the Mapopolis mapping program to
bring up a map of your contact’s address. You can even dial your Bluetooth
phone directly from Contacts 5. It’s not as feature-laden as Agendus or
DateBk5, but Contacts 5 has one of the easiest-to-use — and most attractive —
interfaces out there. It’s available from www.pdaperformance.com.
DateBk5
Similar to Agendus in concept, DateBk5 combines the data from the built-in
personal information manager applications into one integrated program. A
wide variety of views let you customize how you view your data to match
your personal work style. Enhanced alarms help ensure you make your
appointments, and templates help you automate the entry of commonly
repeated events. It offers over a hundred other features, and the best part is
that all profits from the program go to support a wildlife habitat for gorillas in
Georgia. You can discover more about DateBk5 and find a link to Gorilla
Haven at www.datebk5.com.
FileZ
FileZ is an extremely powerful file manager for finding, copying, moving,
deleting, and beaming files in both Handheld and Memory Stick memory. 
t’s fast, easy to use, and (best of all) free! FileZ is available from nosleep
software.sourceforge.net.
Lightspeed and PXA Clocker
Okay, this one’s a tie because they’re both excellent programs, so I suggest
trying them both and going with the one that best fits your needs. Lightspeed
and PXA Clocker are overclocking programs for your CLIÉ. The idea is that
you can get extra speed by running your CLIÉ’s processor faster than its
rated speed, which can be useful for games and video applications. I don’t
actually suggest doing this, though — it’s extremely rare, but overclocking
320
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

could damage your CLIÉ. However, both programs can also underclock your
CLIÉ. When you’re doing something that doesn’t need much speed, such as
reading an eBook or listening to MP3 tunes, underclocking can dramatically
extend your battery life. PXA Clocker can be found at www.palmgear.com
and Lightspeed at www.clievideo.com.
RepliGo
RepliGo is one of the most flexible file viewers available for the CLIÉ. The pro-
gram can convert output from virtually any Windows program that features a
Print command to a full-color file that can be viewed on your CLIÉ. This means
that you can carry along anything from Word documents to Web sites to
Quicken reports. Best of all, it offers a free viewer, so you can create RepliGo
documents to distribute to others. It’s available from www.cerience.com.
SplashWallet Suite
SplashWallet Suite is a bundle of four useful programs:
 SplashPhoto: A super-fast photo-viewing program that’s more flexible
than the built-in CLIÉ Viewer.
 SplashShopper: A handy list-keeping program.
 SplashMoney: A personal finance manager.
 SplashID: Safely stores personal information such as passwords and
credit card numbers.
By themselves, these are all excellent programs. Bundled together at a 
low price, they’re a terrific bargain. The suite is available from www.splash
data.com.
SwitchSync
Do you need to synchronize your CLIÉ with both Palm Desktop and Outlook?
SwitchSync does the trick. You also need to purchase Chapura’s PocketMirror
Outlook sync program — SwitchSync doesn’t work with the IntelliSync Lite
application that comes bundled with CLIÉs — but that’s a small price to pay
321
Chapter 22: Ten Great Third-Party Programs

if you need your personal information manager data to be in two places at
once. SwitchSynch is available from www.livepim.com, and you can get
PocketMirror at www.chapura.com.
Vivid Webcam
Now this is a great idea. This program turns your CLIÉ’s camera into a full-
featured Webcam for your desktop system. It works with any program that
supports standard Universal Serial Bus (USB) Webcams, including MSN
Messenger and AOL Instant Messenger. It also includes a Web server that lets
anyone with a Java-enabled Web browser view your camera. Why spend $100
on a good Webcam when you can use your CLIÉ? Vivid Webcam is available
from www.clievideo.com.
ZLauncher
This program is a highly enhanced replacement for the built-in Program
Launcher and can be customized to suit your needs and personality.
ZLauncher features customizable themes, allowing you to display a back-
ground image behind your Launcher screen and even swap images and
colors as your mood changes. It lets you arrange your programs in tabbed
folders, making it a snap to group similar programs together. A group of cus-
tomizable icons lets you drag and drop files to beam them, delete them, get
info on them, and more. With full support of CLIÉ high-resolution screens,
this is the most powerful and attractive Launcher available for Sony CLIÉs.
It’s available from www.zztechs.com.

Ten Great CLIÉ Add-Ons
In This Chapter
 Juicing up your battery
 Improving your listening experience
 Cradling your CLIÉ
H
ere are just some of the accessories that can make your CLIÉ life even
more productive and fun. Extend your CLIÉ’s battery life, print out the
pictures from its camera, listen to MP3s anywhere — your already impressive
CLIÉ shines even brighter with these add-ons. Be sure to also check out the
must-have travel accessories that I cover in Chapter 17!
Battery Adapter
The PEGA-BC10 battery adapter plugs into all CLIÉ models except the UX
series and lets you power or recharge your CLIÉ by using four AA batteries. 
If you have this device, you’ll never find yourself running out of juice on a
long flight again. It’s available at www.sonystyle.com.
Cyber-shot DSC-V1
Your CLIÉ’s built-in camera is great for snapshots, but what about those times
when you’re shooting something for which quality really matters? The Cyber-
shot DSC-V1 makes a great high-end photo companion for your CLIÉ. Shoot
pictures with its 5-megapixel resolution and 4X optical zoom, and then pop
out the Memory Stick and place it in your CLIÉ to view the images on the
CLIÉ’s liquid crystal display (LCD) screen. The Cyber-shot DSC-V1 is available
at www.sonystyle.com.

Digital Photo Printer
Sony’s DPP-EX50 Digital Photo Printer prints top-quality 3.5-x-4-inch and 4-x-6-
inch dye-sublimation photos directly from a Memory Stick. You can pop the
card out of your camera-equipped CLIÉ, place it in the printer, press a button
or two, and a minute later you have a lab-quality print. You can also connect
the printer to your television set to do basic editing work on your CLIÉ
photos and even display a slideshow of your photos on the TV. The printer
works whether it’s by itself, connected to a TV, or plugged into your desktop
system. If offers both Memory Stick and CompactFlash slots, so it works with
a variety of digital cameras. Check it out at www.sonystyle.com.
Extended Battery
Designed for the PEG-UX40 and PEG-UX50 units, the PEGA-EB40 Extended
Battery is a Lithium Ion battery pack that snaps on to the bottom of your
CLIÉ. It offers double the capacity of the built-in UX battery, giving you three
times the overall battery life. It’s excellent for long sessions of listening to
music, watching videos on the road, or heavy Wi-Fi radio use. You can find it
at www.sonystyle.com.
Noise-Canceling Headphones
Noise-canceling headphones actively compensate for background sounds like
air conditioners and the ambient noise in an aircraft cabin so that you can
hear your music without having to crank the volume to 11. Sennheiser’s PXC
250 headphones offer excellent audio quality, effective noise cancellation,
and a comfortable design. They’re perfect accompaniment for your CLIÉ
when you’re listening to music or audiobooks on the plane. The PXC 250
headphones are available from www.sennheiser.com.
Pen/Stylus Combo
If you use the stylus for frequent data entry, I recommend purchasing a com-
bination pen/stylus. Your fingers will thank you. The tiny, thin styluses that
come with CLIÉs are fine for quick data entry, but they force your hand into
324
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

an atypical position that can quickly become uncomfortable. The combo 
styluses are like multicolor pens except that they include a pen in place of
the second color. (Always be sure to switch the pen to stylus mode before
writing on your CLIÉ’s screen!) Models are available from a wide variety of
manufacturers. My personal favorite is the Fisher Space Pen. You can find
dozens of choices at www.styluscentral.com.
SanDisk Memory Stick PRO
This third-party Memory Stick is fully compatible with Sony’s cards, but it
has a slightly flashier casing — bling bling fans, take note. What makes the
SanDisk cards really special is the price — they’re typically dramatically less
expensive than Sony’s. You can get more info at www.sandisk.com.
SoundFeeder SF250
The perfect accessory if you want to listen to MP3 or audiobook files on your
car or home stereo. The SF250 plugs into your CLIÉ’s headphone jack and
transmits on eight different FM frequencies. What makes it better than some
other solutions is its digital tuning — you don’t have to worry about jarring a
tuning dial and knocking the transmitter off-frequency while you’re driving.
It’s available from www.arkon.com.
SyncDicator Cable
Sony’s own HotSync cable requires you to lug along your power brick if you
plan to charge on the road. If you’re bringing a laptop along anyway, check
out Brando WorkShop’s SyncDicator cable, which not only HotSyncs your
CLIÉ, but also recharges it by using power from your computer’s Universal
Serial Bus (USB) port. A dual-color LED glows read for battery charging and
blue for data synchronization. The cable includes a HotSync button, perhaps
the most annoying omission from Sony’s model. The SyncDicator cable is
available at shop.brando.com.hk.
325
Chapter 23: Ten Great CLIÉ Add-Ons

USB Cradle
Sony is now shipping all its CLIÉs with a USB cable instead of a cradle. The
cable is great for travel use but a bit awkward for desktop usage because the
charger and USB cables come out of the small adapter, which you have to
fumble with to connect to your CLIÉ. With the cable, you also have to load
the HotSync application to synchronize. Sony’s PEGA-UC55 cradle works with
all current CLIÉs except for the UX series. It sits on your desk, where you can
simply drop in your CLIÉ to charge and sync it. A HotSync button right on the
cradle means no fumbling for the stylus every time you want to sync. It’s
available at www.sonystyle.com.

Ten Top Tips and Secrets
In This Chapter
 Troubleshooting your CLIÉ
 Getting more out of your memory
 Hunting for Easter eggs
 Finding hidden secrets
H
aving problems? Want to get the most out of your CLIÉ? Or just looking
for a little fun? Here you can find the ten top tips for solving problems
and getting a little extra out of your favorite handheld.
HotSync Hassles
Having trouble HotSyncing? First, make sure HotSync Manager is running —
you should see the icon in the lower-right corner of your desktop system’s
screen. If it is, try both rebooting your desktop system and doing a soft reset
on the CLIÉ. That fixes the problem 90 percent of the time. If that still doesn’t
help, try unplugging your HotSync cradle or cable and plugging it into a dif-
ferent Universal Serial Bus (USB) port on your computer, which forces
Windows to reinstall the sync driver. If all else fails, reinstall the Palm
Desktop software and see whether that helps.
Power Problems
Your CLIÉ won’t turn on? Make sure the Hold slider isn’t in the active posi-
tion. If it’s not active, plug the CLIÉ into its charging cable and see whether it
turns on then. If it still doesn’t turn on, try a soft reset.

Oooh, the Colors, Man!
Think the CLIÉ’s color scheme is just too staid and businesslike? On units
running Palm OS 5.2 or higher, you can change the color scheme to anything
from a cool blue to a garish mix that would make artist Jackson Pollock
cringe. Open the Prefs application from the Program Launcher. Select General
from the drop-down menu arrow in the upper-right corner, and then tap the
Colors pop-up menu and select your scheme. Even if orange text isn’t your
thing, try the Basic scheme, which is similar to the standard colors but
spruces up the buttons with a gray background. And if you ever owned an
early monochrome Palm or CLIÉ, be sure to try the Nostalgia scheme.
Reset 101
You can reset your CLIÉ in the following three ways when it stops responding:
 Soft reset: Just press the Reset button with your stylus tip or with the
Reset tool (a small pin) hidden in the styluses that came with older CLIÉ
models where the stylus tip doesn’t fit in the Reset hole. This type of
reset works almost all the time and keeps your memory intact.
 Warm reset: Press the Reset button while holding the Up (or Left, in the
case of center-mounted jog dials) button. This resets the CLIÉ while dis-
abling any programs and operating system libraries that automatically
run on startup. The goal of a warm reset is to find and delete the offend-
ing program and then do a soft reset.
 Hard reset: This is the reset of last resort because it clears your CLIÉ’s
memory. Hold down the Power button, press the Reset button, and then
release the Power button when the logo appears on the screen.
Need to reset your CLIÉ but can’t find your stylus? Just unfold a paper clip
and carefully push the tip into your CLIÉ’s Reset hole.
This One Will Have You Beaming
Having trouble receiving beamed data? Launch Prefs from the Program
Launcher, select General from the drop-down menu arrow in the top-right
corner, and make sure that Beam Receive is turned on by tapping the pop-up
menu next to Beam Receive and choosing On. If that doesn’t help, try moving
the CLIÉs to a shadier spot — very bright lights can interfere with the infrared
transmission. And make sure that the two units are at least six inches apart.

Unleash Hidden Memory
Really short on memory? Check out JackFlash from Brayder (www.brayder.
com), which can take advantage of unused Flash memory inside your CLIÉ to
store additional programs, data, and more. Some CLIÉ models have a couple
of megabytes available, perfect for squeezing in a couple of your most-used
programs without having to put them on a Memory Stick. Best of all, this
memory will survive dead batteries and hard resets.
Keeping up to Date
Savvy users make it a habit to periodically check www.sony.com/clie/
support to see whether any improved programs or bug fixes are available 
for their CLIÉs. Now Sony has made the process of finding and downloading
patches completely automatic for most CLIÉ models. Just visit Sony’s sup-
port site at www.sony.com/clie/support and download the latest version
of the CLIÉ Update Wizard. This program can automatically find, download,
and install all the latest updates and patches for Palm OS 5 CLIÉ models.
Power to the CLIÉ People
If your battery life isn’t what it seems like it should be, try turning down the
brightness on your screen by tapping the small sun icon just below the Menu
soft button. Also, remember that Bluetooth and Wi-Fi radios love to eat up
power, so turn them off when you’re not using them.
A Real Easter Egg
This secret is a fun one. You might have heard of Easter eggs, the surprises
that programmers sometimes hide in software. Well, the CLIÉ has a true, lit-
eral Easter egg — in full color! Tap the Prefs icon in the Program Launcher,
and then tap the drop-down menu arrow in the upper-right corner of the
screen and select General.
Now, draw a small circle, counterclockwise, in the lower-right corner of the
Prefs screen, just above the Calculator soft button. An Easter egg appears.
See the following section for what you can do with your egg.

Chapter 24: Ten Top Tips and Secrets

Taxi!
The fun doesn’t stop at creating the Easter egg. This one’s a little tricky and
takes some trial and error. After you activate the egg, hold the Down rocker
(or the button to the right of the jog dial on units with center-mounted jog
dials) and draw a line in the Graffiti area from just above the numeric keypad
1 icon all the way to the left side of the screen between the Home and Menu
soft buttons. If you do this right, you see a taxi bounce across the screen! It
keeps popping up in the Program Launcher and even in some applications to
surprise you. To make it stop appearing, just tap the Easter egg. The egg dis-
appears, and the taxi drives off into the sunset.

Way More Than Ten Useful
Internet Resources
In This Chapter
 Finding CLIÉ information
 Downloading programs and files
 Going directly to great CLIÉ–related sources
N
ow that you’ve unleashed the power of your CLIÉ, you might want to
check out these great Web sites. You can chat with fellow CLIÉ fans,
read the latest CLIÉ–related news, and find the coolest add-on programs and
products.
News, Discussion, and Support
 ClieSource: It’s a huge Web site that’s all CLIÉ, all the time. ClieSource
offers daily news on the hottest new programs and add-ons, as well as
helpful and informative discussion groups for every CLIÉ model. If you
visit one CLIÉ Web site, this should be the one. (www.cliesource.com)
 PalmInfoCenter: Despite the Palm in its name, this site covers all PDAs
that use the Palm OS, including the CLIÉ. It’s a good source for news and
discussion. (www.palminfocenter.com)
 PDA 24/7: As you might guess from the name, this site prides itself 
on providing PDA-related news day and night. For sheer volume of infor-
mation related to the CLIÉ and other PDAs, you can’t beat it. (www.pda
247.com)
 PDArcade: This site is devoted to the latest and greatest games for
PDAs. It has a very active Palm OS section with lots of discussion and
reviews of CLIÉ games. (www.pdarcade.com)

 Sony Support: On this site, you can find the latest patches and updated
software applications for your CLIÉ, as well as a technical support data-
base and frequently asked questions list. (www.ita.sel.sony.com/
support)
Downloads
 Fictionwise: You can find an impressive collection of eBooks and short
stories here. (www.fictionwise.com)
 FreewarePalm: Want to download some new programs for your CLIÉ but
don’t want to spend any money? Browse this site for some great — and
some goofy — CLIÉ applications. (www.freewarepalm.com)
 Handango: Handango is a multiplatform download site, but despite that,
its Palm OS library rivals PalmGear’s. Browsing the site will make you
feel like a kid in a candy store. Or a geek in an electronics superstore.
(www.handango.com)
 Palm Digital Media: This giant virtual bookstore is packed with eBooks.
(www.palmdigitalmedia.com)
 PalmGear: PalmGear.com is devoted 100 percent to Palm OS programs,
eBooks, and other products. At last check, the site had over 22,000 free-
ware and shareware downloads available. The available choices are
mind-boggling. (www.palmgear.com)
 PocketMovies: The short films, movie trailers, and other eye candy at
this site are designed for playback on the Pocket PC, but they work just
fine on the CLIÉ. (www.pocketmovies.net)
CLIÉ–Related Manufacturers
and Publishers
 Astraware: If you’re a gamer, check out this purveyor of disturbingly
addictive puzzle games such as Bejeweled and Text Twist. Caution: Don’t
visit here when you have a deadline approaching. (www.astraware.com)
 Brando WorkShop: Yes, it’s in Hong Kong, but it has probably the widest
variety of CLIÉ accessories of any shop on the planet, and overseas ship-
ping is cheap and reliable. (shop.brando.com.hk)
 DataViz: DataViz is the creator of Documents To Go and Beyond Contacts,
the Outlook equivalent for CLIÉs. (www.dataviz.com)
332
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

 Handmark: This company has a large library of dependably good Palm
OS software, consisting of both games and productivity applications.
(www.handmark.com)
 Mark/Space: This company offers The Missing Sync, the program to have
if you want to sync your CLIÉ with a Macintosh. (www.markspace.com)
 MobilePlanet: This online store has so much PDA stuff that it’s scary. It
offers tons of accessories, even for older CLIÉ models. This site is espe-
cially handy when you’re looking for a case or an accessory for an out-
of-production CLIÉ. MobilePlanet offers the newest toys, too. (www.
mobileplanet.com)
 PDAparts.com: If you want to fix your CLIÉ yourself, you can probably
find the repair parts here. (www.pdaparts.com)
