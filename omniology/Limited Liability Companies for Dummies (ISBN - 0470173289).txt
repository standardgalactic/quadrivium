Dedication
To my family for their never-ending support; to Martin, who inspires me to no
end; to Bobbi for keeping me laughing, even when I’m buried with work; and
last but definitely not least, to Doug Ansell, the greatest friend and business
partner a girl can have! I am truly blessed.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I’d like to thank Michael Lewis for taking a chance on me and Natalie Harris
and Vicki Adang for supporting me through this process — their editing has
vastly improved my writing, and I have learned a lot in the meantime.
My sincere thanks to my agent, Andy Barzvi, at ICM, whose time and effort
have made this opportunity possible. Whoever said agents aren’t likeable has
obviously never met Andy. Also, I’d like to thank Chris Von Goetz at ICM for
being my champion.
A million thanks to Doug Ansell — without him, Incorp and MyLLC.com
wouldn’t be the amazing companies they are today. I couldn’t ask for a better
partner, and I can’t wait to see what our next adventures are and where our
futures take us.
A final acknowledgment goes to attorney David G. LeGrand with the firm
Fennemore Craig (fclaw.com). His knowledge on LLCs, taxation, and asset
protection is unparalleled, and I was incredibly lucky to have him there to
check my facts and offer those valuable pieces of advice that help make 
this book the best on the market. If you’re looking for a great attorney, he’s
your man!

Introduction
I
ndividuals are now, more than ever, realizing the power of the limited lia-
bility company (LLC). If you’re like many people, you probably understand
that LLCs are right for you in one way or another; you just don’t know the
next steps to take. Maybe you’ve just purchased a piece of real estate and
know that it should be protected in some way; you just don’t know how to
form the LLC and do the transfer. Or, on a whim, you created an LLC for your
current business and can’t get any answers on what to do now. How do you
transfer assets? What do you do at tax time? How can you take on a partner?
You now hold in your hands the key to some of the most powerful strategies
of the rich. This book was written to make your life easier and eliminate the
guesswork on forming and owning an LLC. After all, your LLC should work for
you, not the other way around.
After I get into the basics on LLCs in this book, I go into some more-complex
strategies. This info sets this book apart from all the others. The rich have
used a lot of these strategies for decades to operate their businesses, protect
their assets, and pass on their estates. Now, I’m putting the power in your
hands. When you find a strategy that may work for you, sit down with your
team (your attorney, accountant, and/or corporate consultant) and figure out
how to build on it and how to customize it to your specific situation. Use this
book as your starting point. Your possibilities are endless, and your asset
protection and tax strategies should grow along with you.
Now get going on your journey to success and don’t look back!
About This Book
Although this book was written in an easy-to-understand, concise manner, 
I didn’t limit this book to the basics. You’ll find that a lot of other books on
LLCs just skim over things, filling their pages with forms (like the ones we
have on the accompanying CD-ROM) and legal statutes that you can easily
access online. They often just cover the basics of filing your articles and cre-
ating your operating agreement without delving into the more powerful uses
of LLCs or the strategies that LLCs can be integrated with.

Even though this is a For Dummies book, you’re no idiot. You don’t want to be
put to sleep while reading a jargon-laden book on complex strategies that
even most attorneys can’t understand. You want something that dives deep
but keeps it simple, and that’s what I strive to give you — well-organized,
easy-to-read, and fluff-free information.
Now, even though this book gives you in-depth knowledge on the power of
LLCs, it’s no substitute for good professional advice. When dealing with this
stuff, you’ll face some complex legal and tax issues that are unique to your
situation. Your attorney, accountant, and corporate consultant should be just
a phone call away. Think of this book as a source of knowledge that can lead
you to a whole new level of conversations with your team of professionals.
Conventions Used in This Book
I use a few conventions in this book. They’re pretty intuitive and easy to
understand, but here’s the rundown anyway:
 Any industry terminology that may be new to you will appear in italics.
Some of these terms are also included in the Glossary.
 I boldface the action parts of numbered steps and keywords or the main
points in bulleted items.
 Sidebars, which are the gray boxes of text, contain fun stories, examples,
or other pieces of information that are great to know but not necessary
to read if you’re in a time crunch.
 Nine times out of ten I won’t spell out “limited liability company” but will
instead use the abbreviation “LLC.” I can’t help it — it’s just too easy!
 When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to
break across two lines of text. If that happened, rest assured that I
haven’t put in any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the
break. So, when using one of these Web addresses, just type in exactly
what you see in this book, pretending as though the line break doesn’t
exist.
What You’re Not to Read
I know, I know — you’re busy! You operate on a need-to-know basis and the
rest is just gibberish. Therefore, to speed things up a little, feel free to ignore
anything with a Technical Stuff icon next to it. The information in those 
2
Limited Liability Companies For Dummies 

paragraphs isn’t really necessary to understand the topic. Also, the sidebars
are fun, but they’re sort of a bonus for those who aren’t time-impaired. Feel
free to skip those too.
Foolish Assumptions
In order for this book to cater to a broad audience, I needed to make some
foolish assumptions about you, the reader, and your skill level. After all, it’s
not Limited Liability Companies For Attorneys or Limited Liability Companies
For Real Estate Investors. It’s Limited Liability Companies For Dummies (in
other words, “everyone”). Let’s see if any of these shoes fit:
 You’re a budding (or experienced) entrepreneur, looking for the next 
leg up.
 You have a business, and you want to finally get legit and form an entity
to protect yourself.
 You’re a real estate investor looking to save some dough and keep your
butt out of the courtroom.
 You’re an inventor who wants to protect his patents from a random 
lawsuit that may be just around the corner.
 You have intellectual property, and you want to keep it right where it 
is — in your name.
 You’re old, or young, and are planning your estate.
 You want to raise money for a project and want a vehicle that can keep
things in order and sweeten the pot for your investors.
 You were born on a day that ends in the letter y.
If any of the above assumptions fits your profile, then this book was written
especially for you!
How This Book Is Organized
Limited Liability Companies For Dummies, like all For Dummies books, is
divided into parts and chapters so you can skip around and easily find what
you need. I have organized the text into five parts, each with three to five
chapters that are commonly related. Here’s a breakdown of the parts you’ll
find.
3
Introduction

Part I: LLCs 101
Part I gives you a complete introduction to LLCs. It goes into the basics of
LLCs, including how LLCs came into existence, what they are mainly used for,
and some of the terminology that you’ll see throughout the book. It also
looks at the pros and cons of LLCs and compares them to other entities.
In this part, I help you decide whether an LLC is right for your situation.
When setting up and running an LLC, you’ll most likely want to have profes-
sionals on hand, so I show you how to find the right people and create a
working team environment.
Part II: First Things First: 
Forming Your LLC
Part II covers everything you need to know when forming your LLC. In this
part, I go over the preliminary decisions that you need to make, including
choosing your members, managers, and registered agent. I also include infor-
mation on choosing your company name and making sure it’s available for
use. I then talk about choosing the state that you’ll form your LLC in and the
pros and cons of forming outside of your home state.
At this point, you should have all the preliminary stuff out of the way, so I
show you how to create your articles of organization and file them with your
state office. In case you’re operating as a different entity type, I also cover
how to convert your current entity into an LLC. And last but not least, I
address state and local licensing issues that your LLC will have to deal with.
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC
Part III is for anyone who currently owns an LLC and wants to know what 
the heck to do with it. In this part, I explain how to create your operating
agreement — which, in my opinion, is the most vital chapter in this book. 
I also cover membership shares: what they are, how to issue them, how to
transfer them, and how to sell them to raise capital.
I also go into record keeping. I discuss common precautions and steps you
should take to make sure that your contracts are airtight. And you can read
about the procedures you need to follow to stay out of court. At the end of
Part III, I discuss the dissolution process and what to do when you’re ready
to call it quits.

Part IV: Making Cents of Taxes 
and Protecting Your Assets
Part IV contains some of the more advanced strategies. A lot of books don’t
cover these, but if the wealthy have been using them for generations, why
shouldn’t you? I start off by going into the basics of LLC taxation. Here, you
obtain a good overview of how LLCs are taxed, what IRS filings you need to
make, and which forms you need to issue to members.
Then, I dive into asset protection — by far my favorite section of the book. 
I show you the importance of having an asset protection strategy and how
LLCs can be a cheap way for you to gain a pretty powerful defense against
creditors and lawsuits. Next up is real estate, the LLC’s favorite pastime. Here
I show you how LLCs and real estate go hand in hand, and how to properly
structure your properties in an LLC (or two or three). Last but not least is
estate planning. I go into the current estate tax laws and how LLCs can help
save your heirs a fortune when you pass away.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Part V is for all you type-A personalities out there. It gives you the lowdown
on important information, with each mini-chapter segmented into ten bite-
size sections. First, I go into how to keep your LLC intact so it isn’t disre-
garded by the courts. Next up is the scary chapter. Here I list ten things that
you should absolutely avoid while running your LLC. Then I jump back onto a
more positive note with “Ten Good Reasons to Form an LLC.” The chapter
title speaks for itself, and — I have to say — it was one of the easiest chapters
to write. After all, I could have written “Twenty good reasons . . .” or even
“Thirty good reasons . . .,” but my editors wouldn’t let me. Grrr.
Part V also includes the Glossary. If you’re reading and come across a term
that you aren’t familiar with, you can turn to the Glossary, instead of flipping
through the book for an hour searching for the definition. It should cover all
of the legal jargon that goes hand in hand with limited liability companies.
Appendix A is one of the reasons why, if you are flipping through this book at
the bookstore, you need to take it to the register immediately. Here I give all
of the information that you need to form your entity — for every state! This
will cut your research time in half and allow you the extra time to read that
fiction book you’ve been eyeing.

Introduction

The CD-ROM
Forms, forms, and more forms! That’s what you can expect on the CD-ROM
that accompanies this book. Forget about drafting stuff by hand — just down-
load the forms from the CD, fill in your info, and submit the papers to the
state. Or, for a more finished look, you can copy and paste the text into your
own document, add your name and other customized info, hit “Print,” and
you’re done! Your partners won’t believe how productive you were!
Icons Used in This Book
In this book, I use little pictures, called icons, to highlight important informa-
tion. When you see these, make sure to pay close attention — otherwise, you
may miss some really good info!
This icon flags helpful tips, tidbits, and secrets that may give you an upper
hand on your road to success.
If I mention a topic more than once and/or use this icon, then you should
make an effort to remember the information. These concepts are often the
most important.
Whenever I use this icon, you should watch out! Obtain advice that is specific
to your situation from a professional. Otherwise, legal or financial snares can
ensue.
I use this icon to flag some technical stuff that may be a little advanced and
difficult to understand for the LLC novices out there. When you encounter
one of these icons, don’t worry — just ignore the information or ask a compe-
tent professional for advice.
When you see this icon, know that I’ve got you covered. Any of the forms or
documents that are flagged with this icon are on the CD-ROM that accompa-
nies this book.

Where to Go from Here
One of the many great things about a For Dummies book is that you don’t
have to read it from cover to cover to get to what you need to know. This
book was designed to be jumped into, with each chapter standing on its own.
Find a topic that interests you and start there! After all, why waste time read-
ing mundane topics that you already know when you can immediately get to
the good stuff?
If you’re a complete novice and are just dipping your toes into the whole LLC
concept, you may want to read Chapters 1 and 2, and then skip to whatever
topic interests you most. If you have already formed your LLC and are look-
ing for the next step, you may want to skip to Chapter 9 to find out what you
should do next. Only interested in the use of LLCs for estate planning? Skip to
Chapter 16. Ready to dissolve your LLC? Feel free to flip to Chapter 12.

In this part . . .
I
f you’re currently reading this page, it’s a good bet that
you’ve heard somewhere that an LLC may be right for
you and your business, but you don’t know enough to go
out and form one. Well, you’ve come to the right place! 
In this part, I give you a good overview of what LLCs are,
what they’re used for, and how they compare to other types
of business structures. After reading Chapters 1 and 2,
you’ll have a basic knowledge of LLCs and will know how
to apply them to your situation.
In Chapter 3, I show you how to build your team of profes-
sionals, such as your corporate consultant (what I do for a
living), your accountant, and your attorney. I give you sug-
gestions on finding them, evaluating them, and working
with them after you’ve decided to take them on.

Chapter 1
What Is an LLC, Really?
In This Chapter
 Understanding LLC basics
 Deciding how to use your LLC
 Creating your plan
L
imited liability companies have been generating a lot of buzz in the news
lately — and for good reason. It’s almost as if the corporate gods have
smiled upon us and decided to improve upon the corporation and give us the
LLC (the acronym for limited liability company). Where the corporation fails,
the LLC prevails.
Think of the LLC as a merger of the partnership and the corporation, except
it has the best of both worlds — all the good qualities of each and none of the
bad. It offers full limited-liability protection to all the owners (like the corpo-
ration), yet has a pass-through tax status (like the partnership). In addition,
the LLC has a second layer of liability protection that shields the business
from any personal lawsuits that may befall you. And it doesn’t stop there! The
list of benefits goes on and on. In this chapter, I introduce you to those bene-
fits and steer you toward the other chapters in the book where you can gain
even more details.
Understanding How LLCs Work
LLCs are a relatively new entity — they are a hybrid between a corporation
and a partnership. Therefore, they aren’t so easy for some folks to under-
stand at first. Even if you’re familiar with corporations — or partnerships, for
that matter — you still need to understand some new concepts and a few
new terms.

The best and most basic way to understand an LLC is to think of it as a regu-
lar partnership, but all of the partners have full limited-liability protection.
This means that the partners (the members) aren’t personally responsible for
the actions or debts of the company. This is huge! LLCs are more official than
regular partnerships in that you have to form them with the state, and you
can raise financing by selling off pieces of the company (the membership
interests). But when all is said and done, LLCs were made to be easy. They
are easy to understand and easy to run. Not to mention, if you make a mis-
take, the consequences aren’t as dire as they would be with a corporation.
LLCs, like most entities, are subject to state oversight. The problem with this
is that not all states are on the same page. So in addition to reading this book,
you’ll need to do a little bit of research so that you can make sure you are
complying with the laws of the states you are transacting business in. This
won’t be too difficult, however, because I have provided each state’s informa-
tion on LLCs in Appendix A to point you in the right direction.
Although in most states, more LLCs are being formed now than corporations,
they are still a very new entity. Compared to corporations, which have hun-
dreds of years of case law backing them up, courts still have a lot to decide
about LLCs. When operating an LLC, know that some things are based upon
assumptions rather than actual legal precedents, and this creates gray 
areas — and potential problems. After all, you don’t want to be the unlucky
guy who is stuck in the courtroom when everything you thought you knew
about LLCs is overturned. The best way to avoid this is to have a great regis-
tered agent or accountant who stays abreast of LLC laws for you. Should any
monumental shifts occur in how LLCs are treated, your advisor can fill you in
so you can plan accordingly.
Owners: You gotta have ‘em
Although LLCs are separate from their owners in a lot of ways, they still need
to have them. An LLC without an owner is like a child without parents. It just
doesn’t happen. In other words, there are no immaculate conceptions when it
comes to LLCs.
The owners (see Chapter 10) not only own the entire enterprise and all of its
assets, but they generally have the last say. Although they may not manage
the business, they choose the managers. They vote on important issues and
ultimately control the company’s fate.
The owners in the LLC are called members. They have units of ownership
called membership interests that show what percentage of the company they
own and how much influence they have when voting on important company
matters. Membership interests in an LLC are comparable to stock in a 
12
Part I: LLCs 101 

corporation. However, unlike the S corporation (which is often compared to
the LLC), LLCs can have unlimited members and any type of members.
Members can be citizens of other countries or even entities such as corpora-
tions, partnerships, or trusts (see Chapter 10).
The actual term for the members of the LLC and their membership interests
varies from one state to another. For instance, in some states, the member-
ship interest is called ownership interest or limited liability company interest.
Just keep in mind that, no matter what they’re called, the concepts are still
the same.
As you see in Chapter 10, LLCs can have different types of memberships.
These are called classes, and you can make up whatever rules you want for
each class. For instance, one class can have priority on the distributions,
while the other class is second in line. Or one class can have a say in manag-
ing the company, while the other class must remain silent.
If your LLC has only one member, it’s called a single-member LLC. Single-
member LLCs are treated as sole proprietorships by the IRS for tax purposes.
Your state laws, if they even allow single-member LLCs (some don’t), may
also treat them differently. For the most part, single-member LLCs still offer
the liability protection that multiple-member LLCs offer; they just don’t have
the benefit of partnership taxation and aren’t guaranteed the charging order
protections, which protect the LLC from lawsuits that may be filed against you
personally (I discuss this concept in depth in Chapter 11).
Contributions: Where the 
money comes from
When you buy a share of stock on the stock market, the money you pay is
what you are contributing (or investing) in return for a percentage of the com-
pany’s ownership. Well, LLCs are no different. In exchange for their member-
ship interest (see the previous section), members must contribute something
to the company. This can be in the form of cash or valuable assets, such as
equipment, real estate, services, or even promissory notes (which are allowed
in some states). See Chapter 10 for more details on contribution types.
When a member makes a contribution, the other members need to determine
the value of that contribution in relation to everyone else’s. They then dis-
tribute the membership interests proportionally. This is really easy to do
when cash is involved. For instance, if Joe, Steve, and Mary each contribute
$100,000 in cash, then they each are issued one-third of the company. All of
the contributions made by each of the members and their corresponding
membership interest are listed in the operating agreement.
13
Chapter 1: What Is an LLC, Really?

Most LLCs issue share certificates that, like stock certificates in a corpora-
tion, are evidence of the amount of ownership a member has in the company
(see Chapter 10). The share certificate displays the member’s name and the
number of shares the person owns. To determine the member’s percentage of
ownership in the company, you divide the number of shares she owns by the
total number of shares issued in the company. For instance, if a total of
10,000 shares is issued to all members of the company, and you own 100
shares, then you own 1 percent of the company. If 35,000 shares are issued to
all the members, and your share certificate says you have 5,000 shares, then
you own around 14 percent of the company. If the company doesn’t issue
share certificates, then the number of shares you own should be listed in the
operating agreement next to your contribution amount. (In Chapter 9, I dis-
cuss operating agreements at length and show you how to list your members,
their contributions, and membership interests properly.)
Distributions: Getting what you’re due
After the company starts turning a profit, the members will no doubt want to
benefit. After all, they didn’t invest their hard-earned money into the com-
pany for nothing — they want to see a return! At certain points in time —
usually at the end of the year, but sometimes at the end of each quarter —
the company profit is calculated and doled out to each member in proportion
to her percentage of ownership. These are called distributions and are gener-
ally in the form of cash (see Chapters 10 and 13).
LLCs don’t have to distribute profits in proportion to the members’ percent-
age of ownership. The members can decide to vary the distributions however
they want. The IRS will generally allow this, as long as you pass their tests
(mainly to prove that you aren’t varying the distributions to avoid taxes).
Speak to your accountant if you are interested in doing this.
Distributions also occur if your LLC goes out of business. In this case, the 
distributions are handled differently. The LLC’s assets are liquidated, the
creditors are paid back (including any members to whom the business owes
money), and then the remaining amount is distributed to the members
according to their specific ownership percentages (see Chapter 10). When
these final distributions are made, you can’t choose how the money is 
distributed — it must be doled out according to how much of the company
each member has. For instance, if you own 50 percent of the company, you
can rest assured that you will receive 50 percent of the remaining cash.

Popular Uses for LLCs
What are LLCs used for? I think the better question is “what aren’t LLCs used
for?” They are the most flexible business structure around by far. With an
LLC, you can choose
 How you want to be taxed
 How you want to distribute your profits
15
Chapter 1: What Is an LLC, Really?
The birth of the LLC
The LLC didn’t come out of nowhere. Business
entities with the same characteristics as LLCs
have been around for many years. The origin 
of LLCs can be traced back to the Germans. In
1892, German law enacted what was called 
the Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung
(GmbH) — a modern-day variation of the English
private limited company.
After Germany established the GmbH, the con-
cept soon spread throughout Europe and Central
and South America. By the 1940s, in France
especially, the concept of the limited liability
company was becoming more popular than the
traditional corporation.
Not that Germany can take all of the credit. 
In 1874, Pennsylvania authorized the use of a
Limited Partnership Association. By 1875,
Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, and Virginia 
had enacted similar legislation after seeing 
how the entity type was gaining popularity in
Pennsylvania. Unfortunately, the laws of the 
time required that the company headquarters
remain in one of those five states. Because those
states weren’t huge epicenters of American
commerce, the new legislation began to lose
popularity.
In 1977, Wyoming decided to spearhead an effort
to build upon the antiquated Limited Partnership
Association and enacted the first true LLC act.
The legislature modeled the act after the German
GmbH and the successful Panama version of 
the LLC. Because of Wyoming, the modern-day
LLC protects all partners from the liability of the
business and has a double layer of liability 
protection that protects the business from your
personal creditors.
After Wyoming, Florida followed suit in 1982.
However, LLCs weren’t popular entities. Because
they were hybrid entities — between a cor-
poration and a partnership — the IRS had yet 
to decide how it was going to tax the LLC. After 
all, would you really want to form an entity 
without knowing what sort of tax structure 
would be imposed on you?
Finally, in 1988, the IRS ruling came: LLCs would
be taxed as partnerships. The business’s profits
and losses would flow though to the owners, 
and the LLC wouldn’t be recognized as a sepa-
rate entity for tax purposes. After this ruling
occurred, states began to form their own ver-
sions of LLC law.
After a while, the public became more familiar
with LLCs and began to form more of them. As
they were more commonly used, case law built
up, which gave members a more solid idea of
what the LLC’s legal limitations are.

 How you want to manage your LLC
 Who you want to manage it
You can even create your own laws, pretty much disregarding those of the
state. When you form your LLC, you will create an operating agreement,
which I go over in detail in Chapter 9. In this agreement, you dictate exactly
how you want to structure your business and how it should be run.
If you are looking to your next business venture, real estate transaction, or
are planning your estate, this sort of flexibility probably appeals to you. And
when you couple the flexibility with some of the most comprehensive asset
protection around, you can see why LLCs are beating out corporations as the
entity of choice as the years go on. If you structure your LLC properly, you
can also take advantage of the benefits of a corporation, such as corporate
taxation and decentralized management.
LLCs are so powerful and are used for so many things that lots of different
offshoots are springing up, such as series LLCs and limited liability partner-
ships (a version of the professional limited liability company). All have vari-
ous added benefits that strive to take the LLC even further than it has gone
already.
LLCs have many more uses that I don’t discuss in this chapter. These range
from protecting personal assets to raising capital for a project. As you find
out more about LLCs, I hope you begin to understand the power of LLCs and
think of the various ways that they can protect you and all that you have
worked for.
Running a small business
Tens of millions of Americans operate small businesses. These range from
small, home-based businesses on the side to fully operational companies
with many employees. For the most part, these individuals are operating
without protection. Granted, they may not take what they do too seriously.
They may consider themselves independent contractors or consultants, but
in today’s litigious society, it’s a bad move to operate without even a basic
level of liability protection.
As sole proprietors (the legal term for how these folks are doing business cur-
rently — see Chapter 2), they are used to a specific way of being taxed and
the informality of not having to keep any records or officially document any
of their decisions. Unless they are a full-fledged operation, this is okay.
Spending a lot of time and money on this stuff is overkill for the simple, at-
home Web page designer, plumber, or dog breeder. I understand.
16
Part I: LLCs 101 

For these people (and maybe you), a corporation probably isn’t the best
choice. Corporations require a lot of paperwork, and the accounting can be
tough to keep up with. However, you have another option. You can form a
single-member LLC (where there is only one owner — see Chapters 4 and 10),
which is very similar to the sole proprietorship you’re already running. The
IRS even considers single-member LLCs (SLLCs) to be sole proprietorships,
so you’ll see few differences when filing your taxes. Also, formal record keep-
ing isn’t required. It’s a good idea for you to have a record of any unorthodox
business decisions, but other than that, you can just go about your business
as if you weren’t organized as an LLC in the first place.
Not to mention, forming an LLC is inexpensive. My company forms LLCs for
as little as $99, and the state fees are generally pretty low. I wouldn’t expect
to pay more than $500 total for your single-member LLC, no matter which
state you form it in.
Although LLCs and sole proprietorships operate similarly, they have one
major difference: asset protection. If you’re ever sued by one of your clients
or if your business takes on a creditor, you can rest assured that everything
you have worked so hard for in life — your house, your car, your bank
account, your investments — is safe. In short, for a small-business owner, an
LLC is the cheapest, yet most powerful, insurance policy that you can get.
17
Chapter 1: What Is an LLC, Really?
Professional LLCs protect you 
from your partner’s mistakes
If you are a licensed professional, such as an
attorney, accountant, doctor, or engineer, you
are probably working with a partner. After all,
partnerships can take you much further than
you could ever go on your own. Unfortunately,
most partnerships are operating with only an
agreement and no actual liability protection. If
this is the case, you could face some serious
trouble.
Partnerships are like chains and are only as
strong as their weakest link. An error on your
partner’s part, whether purposeful or not, could
cost you everything. If he does something in the
business that causes a lawsuit or results in an
angry creditor, then your personal assets are on
the block to settle the lawsuit. Even if you have
malpractice insurance, the results can be just
as catastrophic.
Most states allow you to form a professional
LLC. This not only keeps both your and your
partner’s assets safe from any lawsuits or cred-
itors of the business, but it keeps your malprac-
tice claims separate. For instance, if your
partner accidentally slips and cuts someone’s
ear off during surgery (not too likely if you are a
dentist, but you get the picture), then that claim
will be isolated to his malpractice insurance,
and you won’t be liable in any way.

What if you decide that you want to grow by taking on investors? If you’re
operating as a sole proprietor, what are you going to give the folks in
exchange for their investment? Sole proprietorships aren’t entities — they
have no legal separation from yourself. You can’t necessarily distribute
pieces of yourself, now, can you? LLCs, on the other hand, have membership
shares (units of ownership that you give to investors in exchange for the
money and other contributions that they give to the business). These owner-
ship units allow them to own a piece of the action — they get rights to vote
on important events, receive a percentage of the profits, and even get a
chunk of what’s left if the business goes under.
Maximizing real estate investments
With all of the characteristics of LLCs, it’s almost as if they were made for
real estate. Not only does the double layer of limited liability ensure that your
assets are protected, but the pass-through taxation that comes with LLCs
keeps your tax bill low. You see, if you were to place a piece of rental prop-
erty into a corporation, you would not only get killed with taxes when you
take out the rental income each year, but you would also have some serious
tax consequences when you sell the property. Why? Because corporations
have what is called double taxation. You first pay corporate taxation on the
profits, and then the owners are subject to long- or short-term capital gains
taxes on those same profits when the money hits their hands. Ouch! It kills
me just thinking about it! Even so, I devote a whole chapter (Chapter 15) to
the real estate issue.
Real estate investors previously used S corporations (see Chapter 2) to get
around the double-taxation issues. S corporations are just like regular corpo-
rations but have a pass-through tax status that is similar to the LLC. The
problem with S corporations, though, is that the ownership of the entity is
severely limited.
LLCs are much more suitable for obtaining your real estate goals. Not only
can you transfer the property into the LLC as an initial investment without
creating a taxable event, but you can also distribute the profits of the LLC
however you want. If you only own 10 percent of the company but want 90
percent of the profits (and the other members are okay with that), then it’s
doable. This isn’t possible for the LLC’s corporate brothers. By the way, if
you are lucky enough to find partners that are okay with this arrangement,
then please send ‘em my way!
Not to mention the asset protection. I know, I know, I keep yapping on and on
about asset protection, but trust me — it’s important. After you realize how
much you need to protect your assets, it’s already too late. There is some-
thing I am going to say that is so important I am going to give it its own line
on the page:

Part I: LLCs 101 

There is nothing worse you can do than hold investment property in your
own name.
Please read that again and again until it is like a mantra that keeps repeating
in your head. Of course, this statement is not 100 percent factual. There are
technically some worse things you can do, such as: looking down a mortar
tube after lighting a firework to see why it didn’t go off, professing to the IRS
that income taxes are not legal and you don’t have to pay them, pointing a
gun at the police. . . . Yes, there are a few worse things you can do than hold
your property in your own name — but only a few, so please read the above
line again. You see, if your tenant slips on the front porch, not only will your
property be dust, but also your savings, your other properties, and even your
kid’s college fund (and possibly even your dog, if he is valuable enough!). If
they know you have assets, attorneys and claimants can be vicious beyond
belief.
If you are operating as a corporation — regardless of your hideous tax bill —
it’s a good start, but your protection only goes so far. If you are sued person-
ally, your stock in the corporation is considered a capital asset and can be
seized by your personal creditors. So if you run into someone’s car while
backing out of your driveway, your property can be taken from you. An LLC,
on the other hand, has what is called a charging order protection. This is a
second layer of liability protection that protects your properties from your
own personal creditors. Corporations don’t have this.
Because the LLC’s losses are passed on to the owners, if you own multiple
real estate properties, each within its own LLC, and one of the properties
encounters a hefty loss, you can deduct that loss at tax time against the
income from your other properties. Typically, this sort of loss is only
deductible against passive income, such as real estate. However, if you work
with your accountant or corporate consultant and structure it correctly, you
may be able to deduct the loss against active income (such as dividends). You
can do this by becoming an active real estate investor who spends a certain
amount of time each year handling the day-to-day management of the 
properties.
Planning your estate
Note: If you are immortal, you may skip this section.
LLCs are becoming more and more popular in estate planning (Chapter 16
has the details). Trusts are still king, but now they are generally used in con-
junction with LLCs so that your assets are protected while you’re still alive.
Trusts usually don’t provide any asset protection whatsoever, whereas an
LLC provides two layers of asset protection (which I discuss at length in
Chapter 14).

Chapter 1: What Is an LLC, Really?

With estate taxes as they are, if you have a large estate — more than $1 
million — you may want to start gifting your assets to your heirs while you
are alive. LLCs are especially useful for this because they allow you to gift
small portions of large assets (such as real estate) by gifting the membership
shares. They also allow you to maintain control of the assets while you are
alive, even if your heir is the majority owner of the LLC. You do this by
making yourself a manager of the LLC until your death, at which point your
heir will take over.
When you actively plan your estate using trusts and LLCs (and a great estate
attorney), you have much more control over what happens to your assets
after your passing. An LLC keeps your estate out of probate and avoids the
accompanying (astronomical) probate fees. (If you aren’t sure what probate
is, let me just say that if the Spanish Inquisitors had been just a little bit more
vicious, they probably would have just subjected their victims to the bureau-
cratic nightmare that is probate.) In probate, you leave the major decisions
up to a judge, and you never know how things could turn out. With an LLC,
you can ensure that your assets go to the right people and don’t get dwindled
away with legal fees until they turn into dust.

Part I: LLCs 101 
Within every family looms the perfect LLC
Dan and Denise Sager have two children,
Michael, 17, and Mary, 16. One night at the
dinner table, Michael has one of his crazy busi-
ness ideas, but this time it’s actually a good one!
He suggests they all go into business together
with a company that seeks to improve the sales
and service of local and national banks. They
would sell their program locally and then
branch out from there. Their background: Dan
is a retired banker with dozens of industry con-
nections; Denise is a retired accountant; Mary
could sell ice to Eskimos; and Michael is a jack-
of-all-trades with the passion and excitement to
keep the project moving.
For this highly motivated, entrepreneurial family,
an LLC most certainly works best — but not just
any LLC. They know that LLCs are extremely
flexible in their organization and operation, so
the Sager family discusses each partner’s role
to decide how to structure their new entity.
The company will be divided into four equal
parts, with each family member owning an
equal percentage (they’re all members) and
also handling different aspects of the business.
Dan will design the service/sales curriculum
that improves each bank’s production, while
Denise will take care of the accounting. Mary
will be a sales associate, and Michael will
design and manage the Web site. Because of
their children’s age, Denise and Dan don’t want
to empower their kids with a lot of management
decisions until they turn 18. So Ma and Pa
create a manager-managed LLC in which they
are the sole managers and the kids are hired as
employees. This way, the kids still get their profit
distributions, but they can still be fired (should
their grades drop).

Creating Your Own LLC — 
How Hard Is It, Really?
It baffles me why so many people go about doing business and owning real
estate without the protection of a limited liability company or other entity.
They are risking everything! I can only guess that they must be intimidated
by the entire process of forming an LLC and think that it’s much more compli-
cated than it really is.
It’s true that LLCs don’t just think themselves into existence. Someone has to
create them; but LLCs aren’t complicated at all. Some professionals use them
in complicated situations, but when it comes to normal, everyday business
activities or asset protection strategies, you’ll be fine. As you flip through this
book, the concepts may seem overwhelming at first, but after getting familiar
with a little bit of industry terminology, you should have enough of a basic
understanding of LLCs to get started on your own. And, worst-case scenario,
if you have a question that isn’t answered in this book, feel free to call my
office and I will make sure that you get the correct answer.
To create an LLC, you have to draft a short document and file it with your
state. This is pretty simple to do and, for the most part, won’t require an
attorney’s help. First, though, you need to do some research so you under-
stand some other elements of LLCs, and then make some decisions on how
you want to structure your company.
Educating yourself
First things first, you’ll want to gain a little bit of an education about LLCs. I
know you’re busy, so this doesn’t have to be too extensive. You just need to
know the basics, and the best way to start is by reading this book. Needless
to say, you’re on the right track!
You can always use professionals to do the work for you. And that’s okay.
Hey, I’m all for delegation! Just make sure that you have a good basic knowl-
edge so you can have productive and educated conversations with the
people whom you hire. Not to mention, you’ll want to have an idea of
whether they really know their stuff.
After you understand the basics, call your attorney or accountant and ask
about things that pertain to your situation. You may also want to do some
research online and set up some free consultations with corporate consult-
ing companies. Also, I have put a lot of in-depth information online at
www.myllc.com, where you can read my syndicated articles.
21
Chapter 1: What Is an LLC, Really?

I didn’t go in-depth on some advanced topics, like taxes, in this book. For
business contracts, I highly recommend Business Contracts Kit For Dummies
by Richard D. Harroch (Wiley). Also, Estate Planning For Dummies (Wiley) by
N. Brian Caverly and Jordan S. Simon is really good if you are interested in
finding out more about estate planning.
Surveying your assets and making a plan
If you have been working hard all your life, you’ve probably accumulated
some valuable assets. Even if you aren’t operating a business, creating an
estate plan, or investing in real estate, you likely have some things you want
to protect from creditors and lawsuits. Some of these things may include
 Rental real estate
 Vacant land
 Businesses
 Intellectual property
 Expensive equipment (business or personal)
 Vehicles
 Savings accounts, money market funds, and CDs
 Stocks and bonds
 Any appreciating assets
Anything that is of value to you, you should consider protecting in an LLC.
Lawsuits and personal creditors abound in today’s society, and by leaving
anything in your name, you are virtually handing it over to any attorney who
wants it.
When using LLCs, consider forming more than one. After all, you never want
to put all your eggs in one basket. A good example of this is that if you have
multiple rental properties in one LLC and a tenant has an accident on one of
your properties, then all the properties will be up for grabs because they are
in the same LLC. However, if you were to separate those properties into mul-
tiple LLCs (or a series LLC, which I discuss in Chapter 15), then only that one
property that was sued can be taken.
If you are a procrastinator, watch out. Wasting too much time to put together
your plan and act on it could cost you. Lawsuits come out of nowhere, and
Murphy’s Law states that you will get sued at the worst possible time. After
you are faced with a lawsuit or have a creditor after you, your hands are tied.
Any attempt to protect your assets at that point is illegal. Not only will you
still lose your assets, but you could also end up with some hefty fines or,
even worse, jail time.
22
Part I: LLCs 101 

Deciding who manages
There are two types of LLCs:
 Member-managed, where the LLC is managed jointly by all of its 
members
 Manager-managed, where the LLC is managed by a separate manager
(who can also be a member)
If you are forming a smaller LLC with only a few partners, and each partner
will have a say in managing the company, then you may want to choose
member-managed. However, if you decide to take on a silent partner and that
person will not be managing the business, then your LLC will have to be 
manager-managed. The original partners will still be listed as members; 
however, because not all members will be managing, you have to be 
manager-managed.
In most states, you have to list how the LLC is managed in the organizing 
document that is filed with the state (called the articles of organization — 
see Chapter 6). If your management structure changes, the organizing docu-
ment may have to be amended. This will involve fees, so you may want to be
as forward-thinking as possible before you do your initial filings and begin
operations.
Choosing your registered agent
Before you can file your articles of organization, you need to choose a regis-
tered agent (sometimes called a “resident agent,” “statutory agent,” or “RA”).
A registered agent is a person or company that is always available during
business hours, every single day, to accept any formal legal documents for
your company in the unfortunate instance that you are sued.
Most registered agents allow you to use their office address for all of your
mail and other correspondence. A good registered agent should also stay on
top of your state filings for you and make sure that you remain in good stand-
ing in the state (or states) that you are registered to transact business in. If
you are registered in many states, this can be an onerous task and one that is
better left to the professional service companies, or a more expensive option
is to use an attorney. See Chapter 5 for more on this.
23
Chapter 1: What Is an LLC, Really?

If your state does allow you to serve as your own registered agent, I don’t rec-
ommend it. Unless you plan on being at your office during business hours
every single day, with no exceptions, and you also have a good grasp of all of
the state filings that need to be done, I would leave it to the pros. Another
consideration is that in the event that you are sued, would you really want a
sheriff or process server serving you a lawsuit in front of your customers?
Eek! Not me!
Bringing your LLC into existence
Your LLC needs to be registered and receive approval from the state that it 
is to live in (see Chapter 8). LLCs don’t need to reside in the same state as
you — they should reside wherever their headquarters is going to be. In the
case of companies that don’t have headquarters (like Internet-based compa-
nies), they should reside wherever the tax laws are most favorable.
Because LLCs are not necessarily perpetual entities (they don’t live forever),
when creating your LLC, you may have to specify what the dissolution date is
to be. Don’t worry! You don’t actually have to dissolve on this date (as I
explain in Chapter 12) — it is mainly just one of those many erroneous proce-
dural things that the state makes you do.
You create your LLC by drawing up a short document called the articles of
organization. Your articles contain such basic information as the name of the
company, how long the company will exist, the initial members or managers,
and the name and address of the company’s registered agent. In Chapter 6, I
show you how to put together your articles of organization. After you are sat-
isfied with your articles, you file them with your local Secretary of State’s
office (or comparable state agency).
Operating Your LLC
Now that you’ve formed your LLC, you’re ready to start business operations,
right? Well, not exactly. You still have to create your operating agreement and
make some very important decisions.
Operating your LLC is meant to be easy. For the most part, if you forget some-
thing or fail to document something in writing, the courts will be easy on you.
LLCs aren’t like corporations where a single misstep can cost you your limited-
liability protection. Although this paperwork isn’t required, you can save
yourself a lot of time, hassle, and potential legal battles by getting it out of
the way and making your agreements as tight as a drum.
24
Part I: LLCs 101 

Creating your operating agreement
Think of your operating agreement as a sort of partnership agreement, except
with much more power. Your operating agreement is the blueprint for your
company. In it, you state your company’s policies on important matters
including
 How the company will be managed and by whom
 How important decisions are to be made
 How profits are to be distributed among the owners
 The titles and positions of managers and officers of the company
 The membership information including who is a member, what that
person contributed, and what membership interest they have been
assigned
Creating an operating agreement is not easy by any means, but it’s vital. With
the wealth of information and provisions that I provide you in Chapter 9, it
shouldn’t take you too long to draft the thing. However, it may take you a
while to decide what you and your partners want to put in it. After all, you
are creating an infrastructure that needs to serve you for many, many years
to come.
After you create your operating agreement, make sure that all of the mem-
bers and managers of the LLC sign it. Distribute a copy to everyone for their
records, and put the original in your company records kit (which brings me
to the next point).
Keeping books and records
All companies need to have a records kit. A company records kit normally
looks like a big, leather binder with the company name emblazoned on the
side. The kit can be cheap and low quality — looking like it came from the
office supply isle of your local supermarket — or it can be made from the
finest leather with real gold plating. No matter how simple or extravagant,
every kit serves the same purpose: to house your important company
records, such as your filed articles of organization and company charter,
your operating agreement, resolutions and minutes from any meetings or
voting that took place, your membership roll, and your unissued membership
certificates. Of course, if you plan on raising financing or selling your com-
pany one day, it may be more impressive to turn over a nice, leather binder!
Chapter 11 has more details on records kits.
25
Chapter 1: What Is an LLC, Really?

When you order your records kit, make sure it comes with a company seal.
Think of the company seal as your LLC’s signature. You will use this to make
your company documents and share certificates official.
Paying taxes
The IRS doesn’t consider LLCs to be separate from their owners like corpora-
tions are. Because of this, LLCs are normally subject to partnership taxation
(unless they elect another type of taxation), where the business’s profits and
losses get passed on to the owners who report their share on their personal
tax returns. These portions of profits and losses that get passed on to the
members are called allocations. This type of taxation is commonly referred to
as pass-through taxation, which I go over in great detail in Chapter 13.
Because the LLC doesn’t actually have to pay taxes itself, the IRS only
requires you to file an information statement (IRS Form 1065) that states 
how the company’s profits and losses are allocated among the members.
Additionally, the company issues each member an IRS form called a Schedule
K-1 that shows the information they need to determine how much tax they
must pay on the company’s profits.
LLCs aren’t required to distribute any cash to the members. However, the
members are required to pay taxes on these profits. When the company 
doesn’t distribute the profits to the members, but the members still have to
pay taxes on the profit out of their own pockets, this is called phantom
income.

an LLC Is Right for You
In This Chapter

 Comparing LLCs to other business entities
F
or small businesses that want complete limited-liability protection for all
of the owners but don’t want to pay extra in taxes each year or deal with
complex corporate issues, a limited liability company is the perfect entity.
But the best part about LLCs is that they don’t just shield the owners from
lawsuits and creditors; they also offer much more leeway in the business’s
ownership, management, and tax structure than corporations, limited part-
nerships, and even sole proprietorships do.
LLCs aren’t only an important tool against lawsuits — and in today’s lawsuit-
crazy society, they are vital to protecting your family’s future — but they also
offer a variety of tax benefits. Not only that, but they come with the least
ownership restrictions, and their maintenance is simple and straightforward.
You will find no complex paperwork that will leave you baffled and confused.
Whew!
Although LLCs are a powerful tool to lower taxes and protect yourself and
your business from lawsuits and creditors, they aren’t for everyone. In this
chapter, I address the advantages and disadvantages of using an LLC so you
can judge for yourself whether an LLC is the right entity for you. I also
explain some other types of business structures, such as sole proprietor-
ships, general partnerships, limited partnerships, and corporations. If you
are currently in business, this can help you understand the benefits of con-
verting to an LLC.

Reasons to Love LLCs
Everyone seems to be going crazy over LLCs lately, and for good reason.
They are one of the most flexible entities — you can choose how to distribute
the profits, who manages the business’s day-to-day affairs, and how the prof-
its are to be taxed. They also offer a lot in terms of liability protection (hence
the name limited liability company).
Overall advantages of the LLC include
 Personal liability protection: Any creditors who come knocking or law-
suits filed against your business can’t affect you personally. You can rest
assured that no matter what happens in the business, your family’s
assets are safe.
 Business liability protection: An LLC is one of the only entities that pre-
vents personal lawsuits and creditors from liquidating your business.
 No separate tax returns: With a standard LLC, the business’s profits and
losses are reported on your personal tax returns.
 No double taxation: Unlike some business structures, LLCs can have
pass-through taxation. This means that the profits won’t be taxed at the
company level and then taxed as dividends at the individual level.
 No ownership restrictions: You can have as many owners as you need.
Even other entities can be owners!
 No management restrictions: Owners can manage and managers can
own — you decide.
 Flexible tax status: You can choose from a multitude of ways to be
taxed, depending on what works best for your situation.
 Flexible profit distribution: You decide what percentage of the profits to
give to whom — no matter how much of the company the person actu-
ally owns.
In the following sections, I provide you with a more detailed overview of each
of these advantages that LLCs offer.
Personal liability protection: Keeping 
your personal assets safe
An LLC protects you from the liabilities that you inevitably come across
during the normal, everyday course of business. Should your business get
sued or go bankrupt, your personal assets (home, car, investments, and so
28
Part I: LLCs 101 

on) and other businesses (if they are in different LLCs) cannot be taken away.
Only the assets included in the LLC that got sued are at risk. Because LLCs
protect your personal assets, I think everyone who is in business or real
estate should use one.
Too many victims of frivolous lawsuits have shown up at my office wondering
what they can do to get out of them — asking how they can save their home
and bank accounts that are about to be taken away. Unfortunately, at this
point, it’s always too late. If only they had spent some time planning, working
with advisors like me, they could have saved everything.
Business liability protection: Keeping your
business safe if you face legal headaches
Normally, when you have shares in a corporation or other entity, those
shares are considered personal assets and can be taken away from you if you
face a personal lawsuit (one not related to your business) or if a creditor
turns up seeking payment. However, LLCs are unique because they offer
double protection against lawsuits. LLCs offer business liability protection —
protection for the business from your personal lawsuits or creditors — not
just personal liability protection (as described in the previous section). So if
you are sued, your business or asset(s) in the LLC can’t be taken away from
you. (Chapter 14 has more details about asset protection.) This extra level of
protection is also called dual protection.
When formed and maintained properly, LLCs will always hold up in court.
When a creditor sees that you have shielded your assets with an LLC, he very
rarely goes through the hassle of taking you to court. And everyone knows
that avoiding a lawsuit is always better than winning one.
Because the LLC offers a double layer of protection that corporations don’t, 
I often advise my clients to form a holding LLC for their personal use. That
holding LLC contains any stock the client may have in other corporations
and other personal assets. That way, in the event she is sued, her assets are
protected.
No more double taxation: Putting a stop 
to Uncle Sam’s double-dipping
One of the key differences between an LLC and a corporation is the way that
the entities are taxed. Corporations pay taxes separate from their owners,
while with LLCs, the business’s profits and losses can go directly on the
29
Chapter 2: Determining Whether an LLC Is Right for You

owners’ individual tax returns. This is called pass-through taxation — the
income and expenses pass through to the tax returns of the owners.
Although LLCs can elect corporate tax status, the typical LLC chooses pass-
through tax status. Using this tax status avoids one of the biggest downfalls
that corporations are faced with: double taxation. Double taxation occurs
when the corporation and the individual both pay taxes on the same profits
as they are distributed. This additional layer of taxation can make a world of
difference to a small business. LLCs are great because they avoid double tax-
ation completely. (Chapter 13 covers LLCs and taxes in depth.)
Pass-through taxation makes LLCs perfect for holding real estate and other
appreciating assets. Can you imagine paying the capital gains tax twice? Also,
don’t forget — filing taxes as an LLC is simple. You don’t have to file separate
tax returns. You just include the Schedule K information in your personal tax
return and you’re done!
LLCs that opt for a pass-through tax status are still required to pay self-
employment tax. The self-employment tax rate for 2007 is 15.3 percent of the
first $97,500 of income and 2.9 percent for all income greater than $97,500.
Avoiding ownership restrictions: Divvying
up the pie however you want
Some business structures, such as S corporations (as described later in this
chapter), have severe ownership limitations. Often, you’re limited in the
number and types of owners, be it other companies or non-U.S. citizens. LLCs
have no such problem. You can issue as many shares as you want to any indi-
vidual (no, your pets don’t count!) or any company, no matter what entity
type it is. In Chapter 10, I show you how to issue, transfer, and cancel mem-
bership shares.
This freedom of ownerships has made LLCs the entity of choice for raising
money for your business from angel investors or private equity firms. Often,
you will want to develop a new product or grow into a new market. With
LLCs, you have the flexibility (remember — no ownership restrictions) to
issue membership shares in exchange for investment.
30
Part I: LLCs 101 

No management restrictions: Choosing
who gets a say in the operations
When it comes to the management of the business, an LLC can be 
managed by
 Its members: When you select member management for your LLC, all of
the business’s members have an equal say in the day-to-day operations.
For the most part, they all have the right to sign contracts and enter into
debts on behalf of the business. If you don’t want one of your members
to have this sort of power, then member-management is definitely not
for you.
 Separate managers: These folks may or may not hold a stake in the com-
pany. Most companies that are larger than two or three operating part-
ners will choose manager management. When you elect manager
management, you can have as many of your members be managers as
you want; however, not all of them have to be if you don’t want them to.
For instance, if you have a silent investor who is only in it for the return
and doesn’t want to be hassled with business affairs, you may elect all
the members but him to be managers.
Say that you are raising money for your new enterprise, and you want
your investors to profit from the business’s success, but you don’t want
them to have a say in the day-to-day operations. In this case, I would
advise you to form a manager-managed LLC, in which you would 
place yourself as the manager, and the investors would solely remain
members.
The fact that you can specify separate managers is a trademark quality of
LLCs that helps separate them from sole proprietorships and general part-
nerships. In general partnerships, all members are owners and all are equally
(and personally!) liable for the business. In limited partnerships, you can
have members who also manage the business; however, they don’t have any
sort of limited-liability protection. I get into the specifics of these business
types later in the chapter.
Normally when setting up the LLC — in the articles of organization, as a
matter of fact — you designate your new company as being either member-
managed or manager-managed. I go into further detail on these two types of
setups in Chapter 6.
31
Chapter 2: Determining Whether an LLC Is Right for You

The management aspect is one reason why LLCs work well in estate planning.
You can place your assets in an LLC with the kids as the full owners (“mem-
bers”) and yourself as the manager. This way, you still control the company,
while your kids can receive profit distributions. Upon your death, the assets
will still be in their name, and a new manager will be elected.
Flexible tax status: Minimizing 
how much you send to the IRS
As the owner of an LLC, you have the unique ability to choose how you want
to pay taxes on your business. LLCs can be taxed as partnerships (with 
pass-through taxation) or as sole proprietorships (if the LLC has only one
member); or they can even choose to be taxed as S corporations (which I
explain in further detail later in the chapter). Although you can’t necessarily
flip back and forth from one type of taxation to another very easily, this sort
of flexibility is unique to LLCs. For instance, corporations can’t choose to be
taxed like partnerships. Sole proprietorships can only be taxed like sole pro-
prietorships. LLCs have a choice, and in the business world, flexibility and
choices can determine success or failure.
Corporate taxation works for growing companies that want to reinvest their
profits to help build the company. This is because the corporate tax rate is
lower than the personal income tax rate that the members have to pay when
pass-through taxation is elected. As long as you don’t intend on paying your-
self the profits (in which case you will be faced with double taxation), then a
corporate tax status is probably your best bet. If you do need to take out
some extra money for yourself one year, you can always opt to raise your
salary slightly or have your LLC loan you the money. Chapter 13 has more
information on partnership and corporate tax structures.
For example, say you have just started your business, and you don’t foresee
taking any profits from the business for the next five or so years. You can be
taxed like a corporation during that time and then switch to an LLC tax status
when you start earning more profits. That way, after you are making more
profits, you can take them for yourself without having to worry about double
taxation.
To change your LLC’s tax status to corporate, you must file IRS Form 8832,
Entity Classification Election. You can refer to Chapter 13 for more informa-
tion on how to file this form.
After you elect corporate taxation, you can’t change back to pass-through
taxation for five years. This makes sense if you want to retain all of the profit
for building your business, but you should still be cautious.
32
Part I: LLCs 101 

Flexible profit distribution: Deciding 
who gets how much moolah
With most entities, if a shareholder owns 10 percent of the company, he can
only receive 10 percent of the profits that are distributed, no more and no
less. With an LLC, you have freedom to choose! You don’t have to split the
profits in accordance with the percentage of ownership. If all the members
agree, you can give 40 percent of the profits to someone who owns 20 percent
of the business, or give 10 percent to someone who owns 50 percent.
Say you and John decide to partner together to create a Web design com-
pany. You have chosen to partner fifty-fifty, and you are putting in the initial
$20,000 needed to get the venture started. You’ll both be sharing the work-
load. But, is it fair to split the profits fifty-fifty when you put in the initial
investment? You think not!
Being the smart cookie that you are, you decide to form an LLC. You distrib-
ute 50 percent of the company to John and 50 percent to yourself. In your
operating agreement, you state that you’ll take 10 percent interest on your
initial investment ($2,000), and then split the profits fifty-fifty.
Drawbacks to LLCs
Unfortunately, all roses have thorns, and this holds true with LLCs. Although
they’re great for many things, LLCs aren’t the perfect fit for everyone. For
one, LLCs are relatively new entities with very few precedents, so people
often are uncomfortable using them. LLCs are also still restricted by a lot of
partnership laws, such as transferring ownership and a limit to the life span
of the business.
The main disadvantages I cover here are
 The new kid on the block: LLCs are new entities and not very well
understood, and there aren’t a lot of precedents in LLC law to validate
them.
 Limits on transferring ownership: You can’t just transfer your owner-
ship to another person when you want out of the business. Certain for-
malities must be followed.
 Limited life span: By law, LLCs can’t live forever. You have to choose a

Chapter 2: Determining Whether an LLC Is Right for You

 Partners are preferred: I know, I know — I said earlier in the chapter
that LLC don’t have any ownership restrictions. Well, in a few states, this
isn’t exactly the case — you may actually have to have a minimum of
two members because single-member LLCs are not allowed. In Appendix
A, I tell you whether your state allows single-member LLCs.
 Extra costs: When compared to doing business as a sole proprietor or
general partnership, any cost is an additional cost because very few fees
are associated with those two business structures. However, while LLCs
are imposed with some extra filing fees (and in some states, taxes), just
think of it as the best insurance policy you can find for the money.
Chapter 8 covers some of the fees LLCs face.
 Self-employment taxes: Unless specific criteria are met, all members of
the LLC must pay self-employment taxes at the current rate of 15.3 per-
cent. This rate is imposed on all of the business’s profits and can some-
times even be higher than the double taxation that corporations face,
depending on the amount of profit the LLC has. (Chapter 13 goes into
taxes and how you can minimize them.)
In the following sections, I delve into some of the disadvantages of using an
LLC in more detail. This way, you can easily determine whether an LLC is the
right entity for you.
Still working out the kinks
The LLC is a very recent development, and the laws that support it are
changing constantly. When something such as an entity type exists for a long
time in the United States, it develops a large amount of case law that sup-
ports its existence and upholds it structure. Case law is the history of 
decisions made by judges in regard to the entity. For instance, if a judge 
disregards your LLC because certain formalities haven’t been followed, then
judges in future lawsuits can do the same thing, based on the previous
judge’s decision.
In the case of the LLC, very little history and case law exists to substantiate
its existence. Therefore, you run the risk that, should you go to court, 
some of your assumptions about LLCs may be overturned by the judge.
Without any case law for guidance, a lot of elements of the LLC are left for
speculation.
This isn’t all. Because LLCs are newer entities and not entirely understood by
everyone, some more conservative investors may be turned off by the idea of
investing in an LLC and may decide to invest in a more traditional business
structure, such as a corporation.
34
Part I: LLCs 101 

Difficulty in transferring ownership
It is common for LLCs to restrict the transfer of ownership. Although this
used to be a requirement of LLCs, it is now more customary than anything
else. Basically, if a member wants to sell or transfer his shares, he can only
assign the membership interest, not actually transfer the ownership. So the
person purchasing the membership only has rights to the profits that are dis-
tributed; he has no voting rights and no control over the business operations.
However, don’t fret too much — this can be more of a positive than anything
else! An assignee (the person or company purchasing the membership) can
become a full member upon the approval of the majority of the other mem-
bers. All it takes is a quick vote. But keep in mind that to fully transfer your
membership shares, you must be sure that the other members will approve
the transfer; otherwise, the assignee may end up as a silent partner with no
voting rights or control! (See Chapter 10 for more on transferring ownership.)
If you intend on taking your company public, bear in mind that you probably
won’t be able to do it with an LLC. Ownership is not freely transferable in an
LLC, and this prohibits the free exchange of ownership. This may also pre-
vent your business from being acquired by a public company in exchange for
its stock because it creates a taxable event. This isn’t really a dire problem
though. You can always change from an LLC to a corporation.
Limited life spans: Setting an end date
before you get started
The IRS doesn’t allow LLCs to live forever — they must have limited life spans.
Normally when you form an LLC, you must state the date of dissolution — the
date that the partners will wrap up the business’s affairs and close it down.
Don’t worry! This isn’t as ominous as it sounds.
During the dissolution, the partners can always vote to continue the business
instead of dissolving it. If the entire idea of forced dissolution sounds point-
less to you, you’re in good company. The only reason why the IRS has
enforced this law is to legally separate LLCs from corporations, which live
forever. Otherwise, nothing would really differentiate them. Because the
members can always just decide to continue the business operations, the dis-
solution date required when forming the LLC is just used to please the IRS.
You can find more on dissolutions in Chapter 12.
35
Chapter 2: Determining Whether an LLC Is Right for You

Check your state’s laws regarding the maximum allowed life span (also called
duration) of the LLC. It is common for LLCs to be limited to a life span of 30
years (which the members can vote to prolong at the end of the term). Some
states allow you to choose a perpetual duration, which means you never have
to dissolve. If you choose a perpetual duration, then you may be able to
avoid the dissolution problem entirely!
Understanding Other Business Structures
Not all business structures are created alike. In fact, the differences can be
vast, and the choice you make can spell life or death for your business. LLCs
aren’t right for every situation, so in this section, I explain the other major
entity types so that you have a good understanding of the options that are
out there and can consider whether one of these entity types might work
best for your situation.
Because every situation is unique, you should only use this chapter as a
starting point. Contact an attorney or corporate consulting firm for advice on
what entity is right for your business now and for your future goals.
Going it alone: Sole proprietorships
Your kid’s school bake sale, your stall at the local flea market, the consulting
job you did where you weren’t on the payroll — all perfect examples of sole
proprietorships. A sole proprietorship (or “SP” for short) automatically exists
whenever you are engaging in business by and for yourself, without the pro-
tection of an LLC, corporation, or limited partnership. Although it sounds
fancy and complicated, forming an SP is easy. In some states, you only need a
business license to get up and running.
Even though the sole proprietorship is simple to set up, it has many disad-
vantages. When you are operating as an SP, your personal assets are com-
pletely at risk from being seized by a lawsuit gone bad or an angry creditor.
There is an old saying, “You aren’t in business until you’ve been sued,” and as
an SP, you are handing over all of your hard-earned assets (your home, your
car, everything) on a silver platter. So, if you’re out selling cookies and some-
body chokes on the oatmeal specials, you may be cashing out your kids’ col-
lege fund sooner than you think.
Unlike LLCs, which have membership interests, sole proprietorships don’t
have interests or any other form of ownership in the company. Your business
is you. You can’t sell little pieces of yourself, now, can you?
36
Part I: LLCs 101 

Adding a partner: General partnerships
When a sole proprietorship brings on its first partner, a general partnership is
formed. Occasionally, partners will create a general partnership agreement,
but often no other paperwork is completed and no filings need to be made.
When it comes to lawsuits and creditors, a general partnership (“GP” for
short) is even more dangerous than a sole proprietorship. When operating as
a GP, each partner is equally responsible for all of the business’s judgments,
taxes, and debts. This means that not only are you personally responsible for
the business’s debts and obligations, but you are also personally responsible
for your partner’s wrongdoing or debts! So if your partner at your bakery is
delivering cookies and hits someone, that person can sue your partnership
and take away your house, car, and other assets, as well as your partner’s.
Unlike LLCs, which have membership interests, general partnerships don’t
have interests or any other form of ownership in the company. Remember, in
a GP, your business is you and your partner. So, unless you can cut yourself
up into little pieces and place them for sale, an LLC is definitely the way 
to go.
Throwing in a little legal protection:
Limited partnerships
Think of a limited partnership (“LP” for short) as a general partnership with a
little bit of protection against lawsuits thrown in. Whereas a general partner-
ship doesn’t protect any of the owners against the business’s lawsuits and
creditors, an LP protects the investors, or silent partners (also called the 
limited partners). Limited partners can receive profit from the company, but
they don’t manage the business’s day-to-day operations. If the business goes
south, the limited partners only risk losing the money they have invested in
the company, while the managers (called general partners) still put all of their
personal assets at risk.
I’m often asked why anyone bothers to use a limited partnership, especially
considering that they’re somewhat complicated to set up and they lack basic
liability protection for the general partners. These reasons alone make the
limited partnership a bad choice for business owners; however, because of
their limitations on the decision-making power of the limited partners, LPs
are still great for use in estate planning (for example, the kids can receive
money from, but not manage, the assets of the limited partnership).
37
Chapter 2: Determining Whether an LLC Is Right for You

Separating yourself from your business:
Corporations
Unlike LLCs, corporations are completely separate from the owners (think of
them as a separate person or entity). Because of this, corporations pay taxes
at a special corporate tax rate. Corporations only pay taxes on the profit that
is left in the company at the end of the year. For this reason, corporations 
can be useful for a newer business that wants to reinvest its profits in the
business.
The downside to corporations is that the profits are subject to double 
taxation, meaning the profits that get distributed to the shareholders (the
owners) are taxed twice — first as corporate taxes, then again as income to
the shareholder. To avoid this, many upstarts are now operating as LLCs.
A corporation also protects its owners from lawsuits and creditors; however,
unlike an LLC, it doesn’t protect the business from the liabilities of the
owners. So if the owner of a corporation is sued for personal reasons, her
ownership of the corporation is considered to be a personal asset of hers,
and the creditor can take her business away. This dual protection an LLC 
provides is a key reason to operate as an LLC.
Because of their complete flexibility of ownership and management struc-
tures and their lengthy history of case law, corporations are an ideal choice
for business owners intent on taking their company public.
Easing the tax burden: S corporations
An S corporation is structured exactly the same as a regular corporation (you
even form it as a regular corporation!); however, it’s taxed like an LLC, with
pass-through tax status, instead of like a corporation. This avoids the double
taxation that corporations are disliked for. Designating a corporation as an 
S corporation is easy. You just have to file Form 2553, Election by a Small
Business Corporation, within three months of formation.
S corporations and LLCs have two major differences, one good and one bad:
 Fewer self-employment taxes: Unlike LLCs, S corporations can hire their
owners as employees, which means the owners are paying average,
everyday payroll taxes that any employee would pay. With LLCs, the
managing members aren’t considered employees and are therefore
required to pay a pretty hefty self-employment tax.
38
Part I: LLCs 101 

 No free contributions: When you transfer an asset into an LLC in
exchange for membership interests, no taxable event occurs. Not so
with S corporations. Contributions (and distributions of assets) aren’t
tax free!
S corporations have severe ownership limitations. Non-U.S. citizens and
other entities can’t own shares in an S corporation, and the number of share-
holders is limited to 100. Also, all shares are equal, meaning that the officers
of the company can’t create special classes of shares (which allow some
members to vote while others don’t, or some members to get priority on
profits while others take the back seat, and so on) like they can in an LLC.
Newly emerging entity types
After LLCs became popular, a lot of states lobbied for other types of similar
entities to be created under the U.S. Corporation Law. This resulted in the
limited liability partnership (LLP), the limited liability limited partnership
(LLLP), and the Series LLC. It is impossible to cover all of the intricacies of
each one, and not all of these company types are available in every state;
therefore, I just give you a brief overview of each one.
To find out if these entity types are available in your state, call your Secretary
of State’s office (flip to Appendix A for contact info). Just be careful — these
entities are pretty new and aren’t well understood by the courts.
Limited liability partnership (LLP)
The limited liability partnership (LLP) is a cross between a limited partnership
and a corporation. In a way, it offers the best of both worlds. The LLP is
exactly like a limited partnership (see the earlier section) in that it has both
general partners and limited partners and pass-through tax status (the owners
pay the company’s taxes on their personal tax returns).
The LLP differs from a limited partnership in that, like a corporation, it offers
all business partners protection from lawsuits filed against the company and
creditors seeking payment from the company, not just the limited partners.
However, in exchange for this added protection, the limited partners have full
management rights in the company. They are no longer resigned to their role
as silent partners.
Limited liability limited partnership (LLLP)
The limited liability limited partnership (LLLP) is another modification of the
limited partnership. The LLLP has general partners who operate the business
and limited partners who own the business but aren’t allowed to deal in day-
to-day management activities, just like a limited partnership does.
39
Chapter 2: Determining Whether an LLC Is Right for You

The difference is that an LLLP can only be created when there is more than
one general partner and more than one limited partner. But an LLLP is a great
entity — it protects all partners in the business from lawsuits and creditors,
not just the limited partners. So far, only Colorado, Delaware, Florida,
Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Nevada, and Texas allow LLLPs. Currently, they
are normally created by forming a standard limited partnership, and then
applying for LLLP status with the state.
Series LLC
I’m a big believer in forming a different entity for each of your assets (real
estate, intellectual property, and so on) so you can separate each asset from
the lawsuits and creditors that your business may face during its normal
operations. This is a very good business practice, and it has become so pop-
ular over the last couple of years that states have started enacting series
LLCs, which streamline the entire process of protecting several assets.
Instead of having multiple LLCs to file, manage, and pay taxes on, a business
owner or real estate investor can form a series LLC — one entity that has mul-
tiple cells. Think of a cell as a protective barrier around the asset — nothing
can touch it. It’s as if the asset is within its own LLC. Additionally, you only
file one tax return and are only required to deal with the upkeep of one entity,
not multiple ones. This definitely helps solve a lot of the paperwork
headaches associated with managing multiple entities!
Say you are a real estate investor and own three houses that you rent out.
You can form a series LLC and place each house into one cell of that series
LLC. After your assets are placed in the series LLC, if a renter sues you, only
the one property that is involved in the lawsuit can be seized, not the other
two. And because all the houses are under a series LLC, you reduce the
amount of paperwork you have to handle.
As of the publishing of this book, series LLCs are currently available in the
following states: Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, Nevada,
Tennessee, and Utah.

Chapter 3
Getting the Help You 
Need for Your LLC
In This Chapter
 Knowing which professionals you need
 Adding the right experts to your team
 Minimizing how much you pay in fees
B
uilding a business is a journey, and the best time to prepare for the
future is now, when you’re just beginning. Over the next couple of years,
situations will arise where you need immediate help — be it taxes, lawsuits,
human resources, or administrative stuff — and you need a team of profes-
sionals ready and waiting to jump in at a moment’s notice.
No matter what, you need professionals to handle certain matters as you run
your business. For example, you need an accountant to handle tax issues; a
bookkeeper to maintain your accounts; a good small-business attorney to
handle legal issues; a corporate strategist, a financial planner, a real estate
broker, a banker . . . the list goes on and on.
You can figure out how to do all of this yourself, but the question is, do you
really want to? Although you should have a good, basic knowledge of all
aspects of your business, you should spend your time working on the parts
of your business that you do best and entrust tedious, time-consuming tasks
outside your area of expertise to the professionals. And when it comes to tax
issues, you don’t want to make mistakes that could (very literally) cost you!
This chapter gives you tips on finding the professionals you need and how to
let them know exactly what you want from them. Do you really need to hire
an attorney, accountant, or professional incorporating company to form your
LLC? Not necessarily. I personally believe that you only need to consult an
expert when you are dealing with multiple companies, a lot of money or
assets, or anything else out of the ordinary. For example, you may only need

to talk to an attorney when you’re dealing with multiple LLCs or have a large
amount of assets that need to be transferred. Even then, in the interest of
saving money, you should have the attorney review your structure and only
write out the more complex agreements that you can’t do yourself or can’t
find in this book. With that in mind, this chapter also tells you what you can
do to save money while working with these often pricey pros.
Picking Out the Right Professionals
Every great leader knows that the people who surround him make all the dif-
ference in success or failure. These people can make or break your business,
so you need to choose them well and choose them now. After all, the last
thing you want to do when faced with a catastrophe is to hastily try to find an
attorney, accountant, or banker who will back you up.
Sometimes it’s difficult to find someone whom you can trust with some of the
most important elements of your business. Where do you even begin to look?
Well, put the Yellow Pages away because that’s a headache waiting to
happen. The following sections give you tips for finding the best of the three
types of professionals you really need for your business:
 Attorneys
 Accountants or CPAs
 Incorporating companies
I can’t stress enough the importance of building your team early and foster-
ing these relationships. Facing a lawsuit or a tax audit isn’t the best time to
start interviewing professionals. Under these circumstances, you’ll most
likely make hasty decisions and choose someone with a reputation that is
unknown to you. You may end up paying too much or find yourself in a worse
situation than you started in because of their lack of expertise. Build your
team now — although it may cost you a little bit of time and maybe some
money, it will serve you well in the coming years. I promise.
You need to find professionals who not only have great reputations, but also
share your principles and ideals. Are you risk-averse? Or do you prefer more
aggressive strategies? These are the sort of perspectives that you and the
professionals you work with must agree on from the get-go. Also, don’t under-
estimate the rapport you should develop with your advisors. You want to
have long, trusting relationships with these people — that’s hard to do when
you don’t really like them.
42
Part I: LLCs 101 

Hiring a good attorney
Most of you won’t need an attorney to form your LLC, but you’ll need one
waiting in the wings when the occasional legal issue crops up. What’s that old
adage? “You aren’t in business until you’ve been sued.” Lawsuits abound, and
after the public smells your first sign of success, there will be people looking
for any reason possible to sue you. Trust me — after you’ve been served,
you’ll be so glad that you took the time to find the perfect attorney to lead
the way.
Sometimes you must consult with an attorney, especially if you’re forming a
nonstandard LLC, creating multiple LLCs that are to work together, or con-
verting your existing business to an LLC and it has assets that need to be
transferred. (See more about these types of LLCs in Chapter 2.) You should
also consult a securities attorney if you will be selling a large quantity of own-
ership shares of your LLC to raise capital.
Forget about hiring a fancy-pants corporate attorney who charges an arm and
a leg. It doesn’t matter whether your lawyer’s office has Italian marble floor-
ing or shag carpeting, as long as he knows what he’s talking about. If his
clients are Fortune 500 companies, chances are you can’t afford him. Plus, 
he wouldn’t be dealing with small-business issues on a day-to-day basis
anyway — you want someone with the right experience.
Getting referrals
Finding a great attorney isn’t always an easy task! Often people suggest con-
tacting your local bar association for a referral. This is normally pointless
because the person you speak with hasn’t had any personal experience with
the attorney, and she does little to assist you. Usually, she just provides the
names of attorneys who have paid the bar association to do so. Some bar
associations even charge you for the referral!
The best way, by far, to find the perfect lawyer is to ask around. Talk to every-
one you know who has a small business — especially those who have formed
LLCs — and ask them about their lawyer. Get them to speak candidly with
you — find out what they truly think of the person’s legal expertise and work.
Don’t have a lot of entrepreneur friends? Join the SBA (U.S. Small Business
Administration, www.sba.gov) and go to their meetings or small-business
networking events. You may also be able to get some good referrals from
your other business contacts, such as your banker, real estate broker,
accountant, investment advisor, and incorporating company. After exhaust-
ing these various sources, you should be able to come up with at least three
good attorneys to contact.
43
Chapter 3: Getting the Help You Need for Your LLC

Researching attorneys
Before you call the attorneys to set up an appointment for a consultation, do
your homework and find out a little bit about them. Sites that offer good
attorney background information include:
 LawyerDex.com, www.lawyerdex.com: My personal favorite, this site
not only offers detailed information about attorneys, such as schools
and biographies, but also allows users to comment on their experiences
with attorneys, so you can gain firsthand knowledge of clients’ 
experiences.
 FindLaw.com, www.findlaw.com: This site supplies lengthy firm 
profiles and extensive background information on each attorney.
 Martindale.com, www.martindale.com: At this site, you get a firm 
profile and some background information on each attorney.
When you are looking at individual lawyers’ profiles, I would recommend that
you focus on attorneys whose area of expertise is limited to small-business
issues. If an attorney practices in a wide range of areas, such as business for-
mation and personal injury, I would count her out. You want an attorney who
is dealing with issues similar to yours on a day-to-day basis, not someone
who is scouring the hospitals looking for her next client. Also, read as much
information as you can about the attorney’s history and background; does it
sound like someone who has focused her career on working with businesses
such as yours?
Choosing an attorney
When calling prospective attorneys, let them know right off the bat what
you’re looking for: a good small-business attorney who can help you help
yourself. You are looking for a long-term business relationship. If it’s obvious
that the attorney isn’t for you, disqualify them now — not during a face-to-
face meeting where you may not only be wasting your time, but you may also
be paying them for the pleasure.
When screening attorneys, evaluate them on two aspects:
 A personal basis: Do you like this person? What do your instincts tell
you? Can you trust her? How would you feel working with her for a
decade or longer?
These are tough questions, but also the most pertinent. You’re looking
to establish rapport and a long-term relationship with this person — it’s
a waste of time even trying to do that if you don’t even like her.
 Her level of aggressiveness: It should match yours. If she is extremely
conservative and risk-averse in her strategies, and you are the adventur-
ous type and like to live on the edge of the law, then the relationship
44
Part I: LLCs 101 

should probably end after the phone call. If, however, you’re in agree-
ment about how aggressive one should be when using entities to lower
taxes and avoid lawsuits, then you should set the appointment.
After you have found one or two lawyers whom you like, set up an appoint-
ment for a one-hour consultation. (See the “Bringing the Pros On Board” sec-
tion for advice on your initial meeting.) You may be charged for this time, but
if you come in prepared and full of questions, it will be well worth the money.
Getting a great CPA or accountant
Do you need a tax professional to assist you in creating your LLC? Not usu-
ally. When using multiple entities, you definitely want a tax specialist to
review your strategy to ensure that no tax traps are looming. But unless
that’s the case, you don’t need a fancy tax advisor or CPA (Certified Public
Accountant) to help you create the LLC. Down the road, however, you will
need a more experienced eye for the difficult stuff that comes about after you
form the LLC: choosing your accounting year, setting up your books, creating
a bookkeeping system, creating financial reports, setting up payroll and with-
holding, calculating IRS payments, and filing end-of-the-year tax returns. So
it’s a really good idea to find a tax specialist now.
Already have a tax advisor whom you want to use? Believe it or not, that
person may not be qualified! LLCs are a newer entity and not well understood
by most people. Therefore, your personal tax advisor — or the tax advisor
for another business you own — may not be the most suitable person to
advise you on issues regarding your LLC. You need someone who has been
around the block a couple of times — someone who is knowledgeable about
federal and state LLC tax laws.
Doing a little homework
Before seeking out a tax professional, I encourage you to understand as much
as you can about LLC tax law — on a federal and state level. When you have a
basic understanding of tax law, you can not only have an intelligent conversa-
tion with the advisor you choose, but you also can accurately evaluate his
level of expertise. (Reading this book is a good step in that direction!)
If you don’t know where to look for information on LLC tax laws, flip to
Appendix A, where I list Web sites that have information about state statutes
regarding LLCs. This gives you a starting point. After you’re familiar with the
information there, you can find more information at www.corpfiling.com.
You can do the research anytime you want from the comfort of your own
home.
45
Chapter 3: Getting the Help You Need for Your LLC

When you’re ready to start shopping around for a tax specialist to add to
your team, ask other small-business owners, particularly those who have
LLCs, who they use and whether they recommend them. If you don’t know
anyone who can give you a referral, try going to networking events and SBA
meetings. You can also ask your banker or real estate broker for suggestions.
Choosing a tax specialist
There are many types of tax specialists, so which do you use?
 An accountant, who may or may not have a degree in accounting, is
someone who captures the financial information of a company and mon-
itors those results. She creates and distributes financial statements to
the company’s managers for them to use in their planning.
 A CPA, which stands for “Certified Public Accountant,” is a regular
accountant. However, they are certified by the state as experienced and
educated in the field. In states where accountants aren’t regulated,
hiring someone with this designation can help you make sure that the
person who is working for you actually knows what he’s talking about.
 A bookkeeper is commonly someone without any advanced degrees in
accounting who sets up accounting systems for companies and handles
their books (such as accounts payable, accounts receivable, and 
payroll).
Plan on having a reputable accountant or CPA on hand for the more compli-
cated issues that may arise. Eventually, you’ll need his expertise. If you have
any tax questions regarding the formation of your LLC, you can consult this
person.
CPAs can get expensive! That’s why I don’t recommend using them for the
everyday accounting needed to run your business, such as bookkeeping,
profit and loss statements, accounts payable and receivable, and financial
reports. However, you should still delegate these duties to someone who is
experienced in this area, such as an everyday accountant or bookkeeper.
Normally, unless you are scouting out a pricey CPA, accountants won’t charge
you for a consultation. Still, go to the meeting prepared (see “Bringing the
Pros On Board” later in this chapter). You can use the consultation to absorb
all the knowledge that this person has to offer. Go to the meeting loaded with
questions!
You and your tax advisor need to agree on how aggressive you plan to be
when it comes to tax matters because tax issues and laws are mostly based
on interpretation. Some people see tax benefits that can be passed on to their
clients where others don’t. For example, does your CPA shy away from risk
when you would rather pay less tax now and risk the chance of penalties
later? Consider how your advisor’s approach will fit with yours. (See the
chapters in Part IV for more on taxes.)
46
Part I: LLCs 101 

I don’t recommend entrusting the tax elements of your LLC to your attorney,
unless he is specifically a tax attorney. When using multiple LLCs, or even
corporations, in a tax strategy, I always advise running your plan by an expe-
rienced accountant first to make sure that all the pieces fit.
Considering incorporating companies
Don’t know what an incorporating company is exactly? Sure you do!
Remember those ads offering to form your LLC for $300 or $400? Normally,
those ads are placed by incorporating companies — companies whose sole
business is forming corporations and LLCs.
When I started in this business in 2002, there was very little competition.
Now, it seems, companies are popping up everywhere, ready to take your
money for doing relatively little work. The truth is that a lot of newer incorpo-
rating companies are doing exactly what this book tells you to do — they
even use the state forms as opposed to their own customized articles of orga-
nization (see Chapter 6)!
Using an incorporating company to form your LLC makes sense when you
 Want to save time: For the most part, incorporating companies normally
don’t do anything more for you than you can do for yourself, but they
have the process down pat and can handle the paperwork for you. Their
much lower fees sometimes makes it worth it! They can save you days of
tedious research and bureaucratic hassles.
 Want to customize your company’s articles and operating agreements:
You may want these documents to reflect specifically what you’re trying
to achieve. If you want to make changes to the standard operating agree-
ment included on the CD that came with this book, but don’t know how,
an incorporating company can help you.
 Are forming multiple LLCs and want an expert to look over your
structure: Some brick-and-mortar incorporating companies (the ones
that operate outside of the online realm) have consultants who can
review your strategy with a skilled eye and set you up in the proper busi-
ness structure.
 Are forming an LLC in a different state than you live: Different states
come with different laws, and a good incorporating company in all 50

Good incorporating companies also normally assign you a knowledgeable
consultant who will get to know the ins and outs of your business. The com-
pany will also have small-business attorneys and accountants on staff who
can work with you and your consultant on a continual basis. These folks can
delve into complex, multi-entity, and estate-planning strategies. They can also
look at the asset protection and tax aspects of your business so you don’t
wind up with different, sometimes conflicting, opinions from different
experts. For instance, the tax-reduction plan that your accountant sets out
for you may conflict with the lawsuit-proof plan that your attorney has con-
structed. Good incorporating companies avoid this by having all experts
work together.
Online incorporating companies have their place — they save precious time
by preparing the documentation for you. However, you must do your
research to make sure the company you’re using is reputable. Most just fill
out the same forms, or some version thereof, that are included on the CD that
accompanies this book. See! By using this book, you’ve already saved your-
self hundreds of dollars in needless fees.
If you decide to use an incorporating company, use these questions to find a
quality firm:
 Do you have an attorney and accountant on staff to advise me on legal
and tax issues?
 Will you assign a consultant to work with me on an ongoing basis?
 Are you located in all 50 states? If not, are you able to help me form an
LLC in my state?
 Will you customize the company to my needs?
 Will you customize the articles of organization or just use state forms?
Bringing the Pros On Board
Whether before or after you have formed your entity, you need to meet with
the professionals you want to add to your business team. These profession-
als need to know the ins and outs of your business — especially if they are
working on a particular case or project.
It’s your job as the head honcho to make sure that you choose people you
can work with for the long term and that the lines of communication are con-
stantly open. You’re the leader, and it’s your responsibility to make sure that
your team members always act in line with your vision — and your ethics.

Gathering information for the meeting
I’m going to specify what to do before meeting with your attorney, but these
steps are applicable to every member of your team. Before your big meeting,
make sure to do the following:
 Create a file for your attorney. You’ll place copies of all pertinent docu-
ments and information in a folder that you can take to your meeting.
Staple your business card or write your contact information on the front.
 Send an e-mail to the attorney and ask if there is anything in particu-
lar she wants you to bring to the meeting. Most of the items included in
this list will be sufficient, but you never want to make assumptions, so
always ask.
 Make copies of all your corporate paperwork. This includes your arti-
cles of organization, your operating agreement, your minutes, and so on.
If you don’t have all of these things, don’t fret. Just make copies of what
you do have and put them in the file.
 Think about any immediate projects that you need her to work on.
Write down or gather any important facts or documentation. Make
copies and put them in the file.
 Write down the names, phone numbers, and addresses of all operat-
ing officers, directors, and/or pertinent shareholders. Also, if the attor-
ney will be corresponding with any key employees or if she will need to
be in touch with any important business contacts, be sure to include
their information as well. Make a copy and place it in the file.
 Make copies of all paperwork relevant to those issues that your attor-
ney will be handling. You may need to include leases, contracts, court
notices, correspondence, filings, and so on. Place the copies in your
attorney’s file.
 Prepare a list of questions that you want answered. After doing your
research and educating yourself, you’ll definitely have gray areas that
need more explanation (the next section can help you get started). Write
these questions down and put them in your own file so you don’t forget
to ask them. Make sure to leave enough space on the page to jot down
the answers!
I can’t overstate the importance of being knowledgeable before meeting with
your professionals. Not only will you have a much more fulfilling conversa-
tion, but you’ll also be a lot more productive. You’ll also save money! After
all, the more prepared you are and the more information you provide, the
fewer billable hours the attorney or accountant has to spend digging up
details!

Chapter 3: Getting the Help You Need for Your LLC

The Glossary contains some common terms relating to LLCs, corporations,
and real estate that you should know. Refer to the Glossary as often as neces-
sary to get comfortable with the lingo, especially when you need to talk shop
with pros!
When it comes to working with your team of professionals, communication is
key. Without open lines of communication, everyone won’t be on the same
page, and your team can hurt your business more than help it. Plus, you
often pay a lot of money to work with these folks. Why not make the most of
your cash by being prepared and speaking directly?
Preparing questions to ask the pros
Below are some questions that you can ask when you interview a profes-
sional who you may want to add to your business team. Use his answers to
decide whether he is qualified to entrust with your business.
 What size of businesses do you normally work with? Unless you’re
starting out as a billion-dollar enterprise (very unlikely), you need some-
one who deals with businesses like yours on a regular basis.
 Do you handle litigation? If you are sued and go to court, you need
someone who has experience speaking in front of a judge and jury.
 What is your fee structure? You need to make sure that the fees are in
your budget range. See more on this in the next section.
 What work will you handle personally? Often, attorneys and accoun-
tants hand work off to junior staff, including paralegals and less-
experienced accountants. What work will that be? If the work that the
professional plans to hand off isn’t pertinent in your opinion, then find
out whether the rate will be discounted.
 Do you work with LLCs often? Do you recommend them to your
clients? This is a new field, and you want someone who has experience
in it. If the person never recommends LLCs to any of her clients, chances
are she is unfamiliar with the entity and shouldn’t be your front-runner if
you’re intent on using an LLC.
Conducting the meeting
You’ve screened the attorney or accountant through an initial phone call, and
you’ve prepared all of your paperwork and questions. Now you’re ready to
meet face to face with the person whom you’re considering hiring.
50
Part I: LLCs 101 

At the beginning of the meeting, give a quick background of yourself and your
company. Hand the professional the folder containing your records (make
sure they are all copies!), and then let him know what you’re looking for and
the budget that you have to work with. Be open and honest. If you don’t have
a lot of money, say so. Perhaps he can help you find a solution.
The meeting should be professional and relaxed. If you’ve done some
research, you should be knowledgeable enough to have an intelligent conver-
sation with the person and be able to evaluate whether he is qualified. Use
the questions from the previous section to steer the conversation and to get
a sense of whether this person is a good match for your needs.
Friendliness is important when fostering relationships, but overfriendliness
can cost you — literally! Whenever you chitchat about the weather, the clock
keeps ticking, and the money runs out the door. So keep small talk to a mini-
mum and immediately get to the business at hand.
Just as you’ll be evaluating the attorney or accountant, he’ll be evaluating
you. Put your best foot forward. Let him know that you value open communi-
cation and are looking for a great, long-term working relationship. Tell him
that you pay fairly and on time — and make sure that you stick to your word!
Establishing a working relationship
After you’ve decided on a professional, let him know. If the person is an attor-
ney and insists on a retainer, and you are okay with it, pay him the money
(but first see the upcoming “How to Keep Professional Fees Low” section).
Most companies will never make you sign a contract, so be wary of one that
requests you do. This is a new relationship and deserves a trial period. If, at
any time, you feel that you don’t mesh with the person, or you decide that he
is unqualified for the type of work that you want him to do, then don’t hesi-
tate to terminate the relationship and go with your second choice. The
sooner, the better.
However, if the relationship seems to be going smoothly, make sure to keep in
contact with the person on a regular basis. When nothing is going on, you
don’t have to hassle him, but if your attorney or accountant doesn’t know
who you are when you call, you should probably make it a point to keep in
touch more often.

Chapter 3: Getting the Help You Need for Your LLC

How to Keep Professional Fees Low
When you’re trying to build your business — and watching every penny that
you have — being inundated with legal and professional fees can be over-
whelming. Part of being a prudent entrepreneur or real estate investor is
watching your money. After all, as Benjamin Franklin said, “A penny saved is
a penny earned.”
You can do a couple of things to keep a lid on the ever-growing pile of bills. 
I cover these topics in the following sections:
 Do a lot of the research yourself.
 Don’t choose lawyers and CPAs who mostly deal with Fortune 500 com-
panies (unless you are one).
 Negotiate all fees and fee structures upfront.
 Stay away from retainers.
 Use services that are experts at document preparation for routine 
paperwork.
With any sort of tax professional, your rule of thumb should always be that
they save you more money in taxes than the amount you pay them.
Do your own research
Although most law is open to interpretation, a lot of the practical stuff that
you need to know to form and manage your LLC properly is just bland, fac-
tual stuff. The only difficult part is trying to stay awake long enough to
absorb the information.
Now, thanks to the Internet, you have access to the same information that
your attorney has. For the most part, attorneys don’t do a lot of research
anyway — their paralegals do it. And if they can do it, you can do it. After 
all, it’s your business. Being knowledgeable about certain LLC laws can only
benefit you.
You will want to research information including:
 Federal laws (U.S. corporation code and partnership law): Most LLC
law is governed by the state. However, the federal government has laid
out a lot of guidelines that are important to know. These are sort of
“default laws” that will come into effect if your state is silent on a partic-
ular issue.
52
Part I: LLCs 101 

 IRS regulations: These are federal tax laws and incredibly important for
you to know.
 State statutes: LLCs have different rules and regulations from state to
state, especially when it comes to paperwork and reporting require-
ments. You must know your state’s LLC laws before forming and running
your LLC.
 Civil codes: This is the area of private law (as opposed to criminal law).
If someone were to sue you, they would do so under the civil codes.
 Securities laws: These are federal and state laws that govern the sale of
securities (stock, investments, and so on) to protect investors from
fraudulent investments.
 Labor law: Labor law encapsulates all laws relating to employees,
including topics such as hours, pay, safety, and discrimination.
53
Chapter 3: Getting the Help You Need for Your LLC
Where to find LLC laws and regulations
If you have decided to go it alone and don’t have
a professional on hand with ready knowledge
about basic laws, then you’ll definitely need to
spend some time in the library or on the Internet.
Knowledge is important, and you won’t be able
to move forward with confidence unless you
know your legal limitations and requirements,
such as tax laws and your state’s formation
laws. When researching laws, you only have to
look at a few sites to find the information you
need:
 Secretary of State: In Appendix A, I provide
you with the Web site address of your
state’s Secretary of State’s office. In most
states, you file your articles of organization
with the Secretary of State, thereby creat-
ing your new LLC. This is the first stop in
your journey.
 The Internal Revenue Service, www.IRS.
gov: Here you can find all federal tax infor-
mation for LLCs. Start by doing a search for
Publication 
3402, 
“Limited 
Liability
Companies Overview,” and Publication 334,
“Tax Guide for Small Businesses.”
 The U.S. Department of Labor, www.DOL.
gov: After you begin to hire employees, this
site will be invaluable to you. It offers infor-
mation about wages, benefits and health-
care, unemployment insurance, and other
human resources issues.
 The Securities and Exchange Commission,
www.SEC.gov: Thinking about taking
your company public in the future? Looking
to raise money by selling membership
shares? The SEC regulates all securities
(the sale of stock and membership shares)
in the United States. In addition to visiting
this site, you may want to research your
state’s securities regulations, because both
will be applicable.

In Appendix A, I list where each state’s statutes can be found. The LLC infor-
mation that you can’t find in this book you can find on the Internet. You have
no excuse!
When doing your own research, be careful not to get ahead of yourself and
jump into things, such as complex asset protection strategies, that are
beyond your knowledge. This can be dangerous. If you’re not sure about
something, a ten-minute phone call to your attorney should clear everything
up. You may have to pay for the attorney’s time while he’s on the phone with
you, but you’ll still be saving money in the long run by doing most of the 
legwork.
Use the “legal coach” approach
With all of the lawsuits nowadays and pages and pages of laws, codes, and
case law to interpret, attorneys are a necessary evil. Unfortunately, most
people can’t afford an expensive attorney who handles all of their legal
issues. The bills would bury you. So, what’s the solution?
After you have found an attorney who you are interested in working with, see
how she feels about being more of a mentor, or a “legal coach,” so to speak.
Instead of handling all of your company’s issues and legal filings, she would
assist you and check your work. She will work with you, not just for you. In
essence, she helps you help yourself. It’s hard to tell upfront which attorney
will go for this type of arrangement, so the best thing you can do is just ask.
This is a newer approach that’s gaining popularity because of the skyrocket-
ing legal fees that small businesses face, but as you can guess, a lot of attor-
neys don’t like it. It means less money for them. An attorney may also decline
to be your mentor by saying the relationship would create a malpractice 
risk — although this isn’t the most valid excuse. Let her know that you will
pay fairly and on time. If she isn’t up for it, thank her for her time and move
on. Don’t begin the attorney-client relationship and assume that you can
develop a mentor relationship. Announce your intentions in advance. Being
straightforward will save you a lot of time and headaches later.
When it comes to larger lawsuits and litigation, I always recommend letting
your attorney handle everything 100 percent. When your business is at stake,
you don’t want to argue your case by yourself. Keep a small sum in reserve
that can cover your legal fees should a lawsuit or criminal case arise.
54
Part I: LLCs 101 

Negotiate upfront
Many clients don’t realize that they can negotiate attorney fees, especially
flat fees. If you don’t feel comfortable bargaining, then you should only evalu-
ate firms that have lower fees, such as small firms. At larger firms, don’t be
lured by the rookies who charge lower hourly rates — they may take four
times as long to do the work. You don’t want to be charged for the associate’s
on-the-job training.
Attorneys can bill you in several ways, so it’s important to find out upfront
what your attorney’s policy is. Some popular fee structures are:
 Flat fee: For common issues that normally take a set amount of time to
complete, such as forming your LLC, attorneys normally charge a flat
fee. However, if a surprise arises and extra work needs to be done, you’ll
be billed for it.
 Hourly rate: This is the most common form of legal fees. Generally, this
fee ranges in the hundreds ($100 to $600 per hour). Often, attorneys
request that you put down a deposit (called a retainer) that they can
deduct fees from. Retainers can range from $500 to $50,000 (although
the amount is closer to $1,000 to $5,000 for most small-business attor-
neys), depending on the work that is required.
 Contingency: When you sue someone, this payment is normally a per-
centage of whatever amount you win in the case. If the attorney loses
the case, you don’t have to pay him; however, you’ll still have to put up
money to cover his expenses.
Before you can negotiate a lower fee with your attorney, you need to know
exactly how and how much you will be billed. How much will a particular job
cost? If your attorney bills hourly, get an estimate. Also, find out how he bills
phone calls. Does he bill in 20-minute increments or round it up to the next
hour? Knowing as many specifics as possible helps save you moolah.
Negotiating can be tough for some people to swallow. But don’t worry; this
isn’t a flea market where you have to haggle until you’re blue in the face. You
just have to let the attorney know that his price is a little out of your budget.
Ask him whether he would be willing to work at a slightly reduced rate until
your business is off the ground and you have more money to pay. If he says
no, then you need to consider whether you can actually afford him. If you
can’t, walk away and find someone who you can afford.
55
Chapter 3: Getting the Help You Need for Your LLC

In most states, you aren’t legally required to have your fee arrangements
(such as the hourly rate, the retainer, if any, or the flat fee) in writing if the
amount is under $1,000. However, regardless of the amount, you should
always request that your arrangement be put in writing. This helps curb any
surprises that may come your way later.
With specific projects, try to negotiate flat fees instead of hourly fees. Flat
fees, although they sound like a lot in the beginning, are normally much less
in the long run.
Stay away from retainers
Some attorneys demand retainers (a fee you pay ahead of time that keeps the
attorney on your team for when you eventually need him). Try to negotiate
your way out of paying a retainer. Let him know that you will pay on time. If
you don’t, then he can impose a retainer. If he still insists that you put money
down, find someone else. Otherwise, you may write a check for $10,000 (or
more!) — money that you can use to build your business. In the meantime,
the attorney will most likely be charging your account with reckless abandon,
and before you know it, you’ll need to refresh your account and write another
$10,000 check.
Not only are retainers expensive, but if you don’t like the attorney’s work,
you’ll have a hard time getting your money back. Thousands of dollars is a lot
to lose when testing out an attorney.
Use other types of professionals
Most legal and tax work is pretty mundane. Small-business attorneys often
deal less with complex legal theory and more with administrative paperwork
and filings. Their experience can speed up the process and make sure that it
gets done right, but they’re not the only ones who can help you.
Often, you can hire paralegal services or incorporating companies to handle
a lot of the mundane tasks, such as minute meetings, corporate compliance,
and so on. They don’t provide you with detailed information or legal advice,
but they’re great at document preparation. It beats paying an attorney four to
ten times the amount for doing the same thing. Just keep in mind that you
should still have an attorney review your business structure if it’s somewhat
complex.

n this part, you’ll find out about the preliminary stuff
you need to know to form your LLC, such as what state
is best for your LLC and what decisions you and your
partners need to make before creating your articles of
organization.
Then, in Chapter 6, I show you how to create your articles
of organization so they’re unique to your company. After
all, each company is different, so why shouldn’t its LLC 
be also? And of course, after your articles are created, 
you have to file them, and I show you how to do that in
Chapter 8.
If you aren’t forming a new company — meaning your
company is already operating with the public — I show
you in Chapter 7 how to transfer your assets and business
operations over to your newly formed LLC.

Making the Big Decisions:
Choosing Members, Managers,
and a Name
In This Chapter
 Figuring out who to bring on board
 Choosing who will run the day-to-day operations
 Capturing your business’s essence with the perfect name
A
s Benjamin Franklin once said, “Those who fail to prepare, prepare to
fail.” In this case, setting up your plan of action is not only practical, it’s
necessary. You need to decide all sorts of things before preparing and filing
your articles of organization (see Chapters 6 and 8) and making your LLC offi-
cial. Don’t overlook this chapter! Taking a wrong step today could end up
landing you in a world of filing fees — or even lawsuits! — tomorrow.
In this chapter, I cover some of the basic things that you need to know or do
before you prepare and file your articles of organization — such as choosing
your members, setting up the management of your company, and determin-
ing whether the name you want for your LLC is available for use.
Choosing Your Members
LLCs are like children — they need parents! No matter what, your LLC must
have at least one owner, preferably two or more. The owners of the LLC are
called the members. One of the best characteristics of LLCs is that anyone or
anything can be a member. In other words, any person or entity— an individ-
ual, other LLCs, corporations, trusts, limited partnerships, and so on — can

be a member. Also, assuming you haven’t elected to be taxed like an S corpo-
ration (which I cover in further detail in Chapter 13), you aren’t restricted in
how many members you can have — you can have 1,000 members if you like!
Or more! This is one of the main reasons why LLCs are becoming so popular
for raising capital.
The amount of the business you own is called your membership interest.
Normally, your membership interest is represented on a piece of paper called
a share certificate or membership certificate. The percentage of your member-
ship interest in relation to all of the membership interests that the company
has issued is called your membership percentage or ownership percentage.
If you want more information on the ins and outs of membership shares, I rec-
ommend that you read Chapter 10 before preparing and filing your articles of
organization.
Selecting your partners
Who you select as your partner (or partners!) in the company will probably
be the number-one determining factor of whether your business venture suc-
ceeds. Although partnerships can increase productivity tenfold and give you
an edge over your competitors, they can also be quickly torn apart, taking
everything that you have worked for down with them. I’m not saying you
shouldn’t take the plunge and tie yourself up with a long-term business part-
ner, but I will tell you this: You must make sure that everyone is on the same
page from the get-go and that there are procedures in place for when 
disagreements occur.
Generally, most partnerships have what is called a partnership agreement.
With LLCs, you normally create this in your operating agreement. Although
this doesn’t need to be completed until after your articles of organization
have been filed, you should still sit down with your partners and negotiate
the majority of it. Why? Because the process of doing so is a great way to see
how well you fit with a potential partner and whether your visions of the
company are in line. This discovery process is an important step to take
before jumping in.
In the next section, I go over how to determine ownership percentages (how
much of the company each member gets). Although this is important, it’s not
the only thing that you should address before filing your articles of organiza-
tion. You need to go over a few other points, such as
60
Part II: First Things First: Forming Your LLC 

 How will you make decisions? Can any one partner unilaterally make a
decision on her own? What happens in the event of a disagreement? A
common practice with fifty-fifty partners is to include a trusted associ-
ate and give her 1 percent of the partnership so her decision can settle a
disagreement.
 If a member wants out, and the other members want to buy her shares,
how is the value of those shares determined? You can seek a third party
to appraise the value of the shares, such as a qualified accountant, or
you can create a formula. Additionally, must the money be paid upfront,
or will a payment plan suffice?
 If a partner leaves the LLC, is a noncompete agreement in place to pre-
vent that person from competing with the business? Does anything pre-
vent him from taking the business’s clients or trade secrets?
 When are you and your partner planning to retire? If this is relatively
imminent, then you should put a clause in your agreement that allows —
or forces — a partner to retire at a certain age and sell his membership
shares to the other members. Will you allow partial retirement?
You may want to have your small-business attorney work with you and your
partner(s) to draft the agreement. They can offer valuable suggestions, assist
in the negotiations, and keep everyone from getting deadlocked on certain
issues.
Divvying up the pie
Now, before you officially form your LLC, is the best time to get together with
your partners and/or investors and decide what and how much each person is
going to contribute. Contributions can come in many varieties — money,
equipment, real estate, services, promises for the future (we’ve all heard that
before!), or any combination of these things. In return for contributing to the
business, everyone gets a percentage of the business. Because the value of the
contributions isn’t set in stone, the actual percentage that each partner
receives is entirely up for argument. (I recommend reading Stress Management
For Dummies by Allen Elkin [Wiley] when dealing with the aftermath.) For
instance, if you’re responsible for 30 percent of the total initial investment in
the company (from all the members), you will most likely receive 30 percent
of the company.
The percentage that you or your partners own of the company matters — it
matters more than titles or other positions. Your membership interest allows
you to vote on important matters such as who manages the company and
how your partners can transfer their shares. It also determines what percent-
age of the profit you receive when your company is sold or dissolved.
61
Chapter 4: Choosing Members, Managers, and a Name

LLCs normally don’t allow shares to be transferred freely like corporations
do. This means that after you are invested in the company, you may have a
hard time selling your interest or even transferring it to a family member.
This is one of the reasons why you should choose your partners carefully —
you could be stuck with them longer than you think!
Getting the skinny on single-member LLCs
LLCs that have only one member are called single-member LLCs, or “SLLCs”
for short. If you’re planning on operating as an SLLC, you may have a hard
road ahead of you. Sorry, but it’s true.
First and foremost, it is common for LLCs with only one member to not be
treated as LLCs at all. Under federal law, an LLC with a single owner is consid-
ered a proprietorship or disregarded entity. The IRS doesn’t consider the
single-member LLC to be separate from its owners, as are corporations and
other LLCs. This causes problems because, legally, nothing separates the
single-member LLC from a sole proprietorship (the default form of business
that I discuss in Chapter 2).
Why is this so bad? Sole proprietorships don’t offer any personal protection
from the company’s lawsuits and creditors. Therefore, if you are legally con-
sidered a proprietorship, you might as well not form any entity in the first
place. After all, isn’t safeguarding your assets and minimizing personal risk
the name of the game?
62
Part II: First Things First: Forming Your LLC 
Double liability protection doesn’t fly 
for single-member LLCs
For many years, professionals and consultants
argued about whether single-member LLCs
were allowed the same double liability protec-
tion (as discussed in Chapter 2) as multiple-
member LLCs. Finally, in 2003, a case came 
up (In re: Albright, No. 01-11367, Colorado
Bankruptcy Court, April 4, 2003), and the court
decided that this double protection (also called
charging order protection [see Chapter 11])
doesn’t apply to single-member LLCs because
there are no innocent partners to protect (the
reason why the charging order exists in the first
place).
Up until this time, many attorneys and financial
planners were setting their clients up in single-
member LLCs under the assumption that 
the business liability protections would apply.
Needless to say, they’re lucky they weren’t the
debtor in the case in Colorado!

If you are set on pursuing your entrepreneurial endeavors on your own, don’t
fret. There are solutions! In Chapter 10, I go into ways that you can avoid
some of the headaches inherent in operating as a single-member LLC.
The Power Source: Deciding 
Who Manages the LLC
Businesses don’t operate themselves — someone needs to manage them!
Often, you don’t have to immediately decide exactly who will manage and
what their specific roles will be, but most states require that you give a basic
idea of how your company will be managed in the articles of organization. If
your state doesn’t require this, then you will most likely have to state it in
your operating agreement. So why delay in figuring out how you want to
structure your LLC’s management? Start now!
An LLC can be managed two ways:
 Member-managed: This is where the LLC’s members (the owners) also
deal in the business’s day-to-day operations. If this is selected, all mem-
bers are also managers — you can’t prevent one member from getting
involved while allowing the rest. But if you have confidence in your part-
ners’ business plans, then by all means, why not include everyone in the
decision-making process?
 Manager-managed: This is where a separate manager (or two or three . . .)
handles the business’s day-to-day operations. This is a good choice if
only one member wants to manage and/or an outside person would be a
good manager. Some benefits of manager management include alleviat-
ing confusion and breaking up the workload.
Just as there’s no limit to the number of members an LLC can have, there’s no
limit to the number of managers that an LLC can have, but I would choose
wisely if I were you. Managers have absolute authority to obligate the busi-
ness to contracts, loans, debts, and so on. It only takes one manager to do
this — even if it is without the knowledge of the others. Therefore, all of the
members must absolutely trust whoever is chosen as a manager.
When the members manage
Member management is the most common choice for smaller businesses.
When an LLC is managed by the owners (also called the members), all owners
are equally responsible for the LLC’s management. However, you shouldn’t
63
Chapter 4: Choosing Members, Managers, and a Name

worry that one of your partners will mismanage the company and land you in
the poorhouse, because all managers of the LLC are exempt from being
legally responsible for the debts of the LLC. For instance, if the LLC is sued,
the managers can’t be held personally liable for the business’s actions. They
can rest comfortably — anything that they didn’t invest in the LLC (like a car,
house, or wedding ring) is untouchable by outside sources.
A lot of small businesses choose this method of operation because they nor-
mally don’t have any outside investors, and the business owners also want to
have a full say in how the business operates.
If you are a larger company with a lot of members, then you may want to
think twice about choosing member management. Think about it — if each
member has a say in the day-to-day operations of the business and you have
25 members — it will be a total mess! That’s like having 25 CEOs! Not only is
it unrealistic, but it will also lack credibility if you are ever taken to court.
If you choose member management, you can lose your double-liability 
protection — the biggest benefit to operating as an LLC in the first place. You
see, if a creditor gets a charging order against your membership interests and
those interests come with management rights, he can use his management
powers to distribute a good portion of the profits to himself to pay off the
claim. See Chapter 11 for more information on charging order protections.
In Minnesota and North Dakota, the managers are called governors.
When separate managers manage
When you select manager management, you must choose at least one 
manager — even if he or she is also a member. Also, the manager doesn’t
even have to be a he or a she! You can select an entity (an LLC, corporation,
limited partnership, and so on) to manage the LLC. Of course, whoever 
manages that entity will be the true manager of the LLC!
Why would you have separate managers manage? Maybe one of the members
wants to remain a silent partner. He’s willing to risk his money but doesn’t
want to be bothered with the everyday business decisions that the managers
are confronted with. Or, say that none of the members has time to actually
manage the business, so they want to hire an outside CEO who can do a
better job than they ever could. There are a million reasons why you may
want separate managers!
64
Part II: First Things First: Forming Your LLC 

All managers in the LLC have an equal right (also called legal authority) to
bind the entity to the terms of a contract or to the sale or purchase of goods.
The government can intervene at times when a foolish manager goes out and
does something that obviously is not in the company’s best interest, but is in
his best interest. But, ultimately, it’s hard to prove. The best word of advice I
can give someone going into their first partnership is to choose your part-
ners carefully. If you think your future partner is capable of fanatically indebt-
ing your entire business — make sure to run away as fast as you can!
Manager-managed LLCs are commonly used in estate planning. You can give
membership shares in the LLC to your children every year, while still being
the only manager of the LLC. While you’re alive, your children can’t make
management decisions regarding the money but can receive profits from it
(Finally, a true gift that keeps on giving!). Then, when you pass away, they are
elected as the new managers and have full rights and use over the LLC’s
assets. (For more on LLCs and estate planning, see Chapter 16.)
When you have a manager-managed LLC, the Securities Exchange Commission
or your state securities division may determine that you are involved in the
sale of securities if your members are investing in an LLC that they have no
say in managing. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Just be sure to speak with
someone qualified before disallowing any of your investors decision-making
power in the company’s operations.

Chapter 4: Choosing Members, Managers, and a Name
Managing her LLC means she can 
have her cake and eat it too
Jill’s family and friends have been pressuring
her to start a bakery for years now, and Jill
finally relents. She is looking forward to the
challenge and has even taken business classes
to learn how to run the company. She puts
together a business plan so she can look for
financing. Her credit isn’t great, so that leaves
her with the option of going to an investor.
Jill’s cousin is a very successful lawyer and
offers to loan her the money. He trusts Jill’s
expertise and is willing to be a silent partner. He
lives on the other coast, so he can’t be active in
the business’s day-to-day operations anyway.
Considering this, Jill sets up an LLC. She issues
50 percent of the membership interests to her-
self and 50 percent to her cousin in exchange
for the startup capital. Jill then designates the
LLC as being manager-managed with herself as
the only manager.

Establishing the Best Name for Your LLC
Naming your company can be one of the most agonizing and time-consuming
parts of starting your business. Not only do you want to be creative, but you
also want to be original — in fact, so original that no one else is currently
using a similar name. This isn’t something that can be put off, either. The
name of your LLC must be on your articles of organization. So before your
company is even formed, you and your partners must decide on the name.
Playing — and winning — 
the name game
Your name is your calling card. It’s what you want to imprint into the minds
and hearts of your customers. A good name will make potential customers
want to get to know you. A bad name will be forgotten in the blink of an eye.
Sit down and think long and hard about your product or service and what
you’re trying to achieve. Look at your competition and see what names
they’re using. Try to find a way to separate yourself from the competition.
Look at your market and determine the best way to present your company to
your potential customers.
So many factors come into play when selecting a name that your head will
spin! You need to keep in mind a few things.
 Don’t restrain yourself! Don’t be afraid to release those genius market-
ing skills you’ve been hiding all these years.
 Be careful about using a specific location, product, or service in your
business name. The world is changing at a spectacular pace, and busi-
nesses are constantly evolving. You don’t want your name to hold you
back or become antiquated as your business moves forward.
 Make sure your name is easy to pronounce. You don’t want people to
avoid saying your name because they’re afraid of mispronouncing it.
Remember — if a first-grader can’t read it, ditch it.
 If you’re looking to expand internationally, make sure that the name
you choose doesn’t have any negative connotations in the countries
you are hoping to operate in. Otherwise, you could end up with a very
funny, yet very expensive, story to tell.
66
Part II: First Things First: Forming Your LLC 

Nowadays, most words seem to be already in use or trademarked. If this is
the case for you, then try to create new words. Coin a word or a group of
words that emits a feeling and is catchy and memorable. Yahoo! and Google
weren’t words found in the dictionary, yet that hasn’t stopped their immense
success.
Let the ideas fly!
After you have all of this in your mind, it’s time to hold a brainstorming ses-
sion, better referred to as a “namestorming session”! Lock yourself away in a
quiet room with a pad of paper and write down every name you can think of.
Try to come up with 50 names! 100! Don’t leave your namestorming session
until you’re completely depleted and can’t come up with another single
name.
After you’ve finished your namestorming session, cross out the names that
you don’t like and rewrite the list of the names you do like. Put them in order
of importance, with the ones you absolutely love at the top of the list. Now
you’re ready to see what’s available for use.
Checking out your potential domain
Start with the domain name, which is usually the dominant part of the
address for your Web site. For example, in www.yourllcname.com, 
“yourllcname” is the domain. The Internet is the core of business nowadays
and is only getting bigger. It should be a huge priority on your part to make
sure that your name is marketable in the online realm as well. Consider the 
following:
 Does the name you want translate easily into a domain name?
 If the name is long, can you register its acronym?
 Is the name you want memorable?
 Is the name easy to spell and pronounce?
Go down your list of names until you find one that translates into a domain
name. To check whether a domain is available, go to www.godaddy.com
and do a domain search. Cross out the ones that don’t have exact or similar
domain names available — that way, you won’t have to deal with the problem
later on when you grow and decide to build a Web site.
After you have a list of names that you want to proceed with, you need to
check whether that name is available in your state and whether it has already
been trademarked by someone. If the name has been trademarked, that
person or company has the exclusive right to use that name, and you’d
better choose an alternative. Trademark infringement is not a road you want
to travel.
67
Chapter 4: Choosing Members, Managers, and a Name

Determining whether the name 
is trademarked
When a company wants to protect its name from being used by other compa-
nies in similar industries, it obtains a state or federal trademark. A state trade-
mark gives the trademark holder exclusive rights to use the name in that
particular state. A federal trademark, filed at the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office, gives exclusive rights to use the name throughout the entire nation.
This means that, for the most part, the company with that name or set of
words trademarked is the only one that has the right to use those words in
the business sectors in which it is trademarked.
Because the federal trademark is usually easy and inexpensive to do, I recom-
mend that you skip the state trademark and focus on the federal one.
Before ever entering into business and committing to a business name, it’s
imperative that you do a comprehensive trademark search for the name that
you want to use. Either you or an experienced law firm or trademarking com-
pany can do this. If the name you’re interested in is available, I recommend
registering it as a trademark immediately, so you have the exclusive right to
use the name. Better safe than sorry.
If you fail to find out when you’re just starting your LLC whether the name
you’ve selected has been trademarked by another individual, then you may
have to change to another name down the road. This could seriously hurt
your business — especially if sums of money have already been dumped into
marketing. Worse than this, you can be sued for trademark infringement, and
you may be forced to pay damages on any losses the other company may
have incurred because you used its name. These damages are, more often
than not, ill-founded but can still amount to a huge amount of money.
Conducting a name search in your state
If the name you’ve chosen conflicts with a name already in use in your state,
your articles of organization will be rejected when you file them with the
Secretary of State’s office. What constitutes “conflicting”? It depends on the
judgment of the person at the Secretary of State’s office who reviews your
articles. But you can still get a relatively good idea of the names trademarked
in your state by conducting a name search in your state.
68
Part II: First Things First: Forming Your LLC 

You can perform a name search by going to your Secretary of State’s Web site
(see Appendix A for a list of state Web sites). Normally, you can search the
state’s listing of entities (LLCs, corporations, limited partnerships, and so on)
that are filed in that state. Enter the name you want to use — leaving off all
identifiers, such as “LLC” or “limited company” — and click search. If there
are names that are very similar to yours, you may have to choose a new
name.
If your state doesn’t allow the online search of records, you can call the
Secretary of State’s office at the phone number provided in Appendix A.
If you see a conflicting name, but the company is in a revoked status (mean-
ing the company is officially “dead” in the eyes of the state), you should be
able to use the name.
If you are still unsure about the availability of the name you want to use, con-
tact an incorporating company for assistance. You can go to www.myllc.com
for a free name search. All you have to do is enter the name into the search
box. Then you’ll be asked to select the states you want to do the name search
in (yes, you can search more than one at once!). Your results will be e-mailed
to you within a few hours.
69
Chapter 4: Choosing Members, Managers, and a Name
Searching national trademarks
You can conduct a trademark search online 
at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s Web
site by searching its TESS (Trademark Electronic
Search System) database. Go to www.uspto.
gov and do a search for Trademarks.
Some results should be displayed. If you 
find some words that are similar to yours, you
may still be okay. Check the International
Classification (IC) code by clicking on the result
that’s similar to what you want to use. The IC is
located next to the Goods and Services and
looks like this: IC 032.
If you’ll be doing business in that particular
industry, then there is a conflicting trademark
and you should consider using another name.
To see the list of IC codes and industries, go to
www.myllc.com/dummies.
For more information on conducting trade-
mark searches, read Patents, Copyrights &
Trademarks For Dummies by Henri Charmasson
(Wiley). You should also consider speaking with
an attorney or service company that specializes
in trademarking.

When selecting the states that you want to conduct your name search in,
remember to include states that you will be transacting business in.
Otherwise, you could be stuck trying to register in those states but not able
to use your own name!
If your name is available in your state to form your LLC, that doesn’t neces-
sarily mean it’s free to use. Make sure that there are no state or national
trademarks for the same name in your classification of goods and services.
Reserving your name
Imagine . . . you go through the painstaking process of selecting a name,
checking to see if it’s available, and filing a trademark. Then, after you pre-
pare your articles and submit them, you realize that the name you want isn’t
available. Someone took it in those few weeks between checking the name
and submitting your filing. Now, you’ve wasted precious time and money and
have to start the process all over again.
If you want to avoid this, you should reserve your name as soon as you know
it’s available and decide that you want to use it. Each state has its own laws
as to what needs to be in your company name. Before reserving your name,
you should double-check to make sure that you are in compliance with all of
your state’s laws. Otherwise, your articles of organization or name reserva-
tion may be rejected, and that could be costly.
Before reserving your name, your name should meet the following criteria
(and any others that are particular to your state):
 Make sure your name designates that the company is an LLC. You can
typically use such designators as “Limited Liability Company,” “LLC,”
“L.L.C.,” “Limited Company,” and so on. Check your state’s requirements
for a more specific list of identifiers that can be used in your state. This
designator should be placed at the end of your company name, not any-
where else.
 Make sure your name doesn’t include any restricted words. Each state
has its own set of words, such as “bank,” “securities,” “financial,” “insur-
ance,” and so on, that are restricted from general use. To include one of
these words in your name, you usually must get approval from a particu-
lar state department, such as the department of securities.
 Make sure your name doesn’t conflict with other names on file in your
state. See the “Conducting a name search in your state” section for more
on this.
70
Part II: First Things First: Forming Your LLC 

 Make sure there are no other trademarked names that are similar to
yours. See the “Determining whether the name is trademarked” section
for more specifics.
 Make sure you have determined who will be filing your articles of
organization for you. The person or organization filing the articles must
be the same person who is on the name reservation; otherwise, you
could have a problem getting the Secretary of State to release the name.
For instance, if the name reservation is in your name, but your incorpo-
rating company is filing the articles, the articles probably will be
rejected until you sign off on the use of the name.
When you’re ready to reserve the name, you can normally do so by going to
your Secretary of State’s Web site (see Appendix A for contact info) and
downloading the form. Fill in the form and mail it to the Secretary of State. 
(If you don’t want to do this yourself, ask your registered agent to do it for
you.) Some states allow you to do the name reservation online but may
charge more for the convenience. You can usually reserve your name for 60
days (or more in some states). The process and fees for name reservations
vary from state to state.
Unless you have a very popular name or you’ll be waiting for some time
before filing your articles, you may not need a name reservation. If you’ll be
filing your articles within a week of the name reservation and you have an
obscure name, you should consider whether it’s worth the hassle.
Want to do business under more than one name? First, figure out what name
you want to call your LLC, then, after your LLC is formed, you can file a 
fictitious firm name application (also called a “DBA”) at your local clerk’s
office.

Choosing the Best State 
for Your LLC
In This Chapter
 Deciding between your home state and another state
 Understanding what a registered agent can do for you
 Expanding your LLC to multiple states
L
et’s say that you’ve lived in California, maybe even the same city, your
entire life, and now you’d like to create an LLC all the way across the
country in Florida. Why Florida? Well, this is where you believe your retire-
ment community real estate project will have its greatest chance to flourish.
Too bad you don’t live in Miami where your LLC should be established! Not
to fret . . . .
It’s a common myth that you need to form your LLC in the state that you live
in. LLCs are completely separate from their owners — they’re like their own
individual person that you have full control over. They can live wherever they
want to live, wherever is best for them. When your LLC does business in a
particular state, it must be registered with that state, but where your LLC is
actually formed is entirely up to you. The state where your LLC is formed is
called its domicile.
In this chapter, I give you an overview of some of your options when it comes
to deciding where to form your LLC. I help clear up some of the confusion
that comes with the term “tax haven,” and also point all of you multistate moguls
in the right direction when it comes to registering to transact business in
multiple states.

74
Part II: First Things First: Forming Your LLC 
Your State or Not Your State, 
That Is the Question
When choosing a state to live in, your LLC cares little about the weather and
even less about the school districts. Your LLC is pretty easy to please . . . give
it favorable laws and low taxes and you’ll have one happy camper! You can
choose any state (or even country!) that you want for your LLC — the world
is your oyster! But this leads us to the main problem that you’re facing — all
states are not created equal. Some states are better than others. So, how do
you choose?
Before you can answer the question of which state to form your LLC in, you
must first answer this question: What business do you want to do? You must
have a clear picture of what sort of business you’ll be transacting and where.
You need to know what your future plans are — do you want to go public or
stay small? Is your business ingrained in your community or does it exist in
the Internet realm and have no real territory? What are your priorities?
Would you rather save taxes or avoid extra paperwork?
LLCs bring with them fantastically flexible options that make them suitable
for any industry, for any location, for any dream. If you’ve read this far, you
probably already know that an LLC is right for you. But which LLC? Each
state makes its own laws regarding LLCs and because of this, LLCs tend to
look, feel, and act differently depending on where they are formed.
The laws surrounding LLCs vary from state to state — not a lot, but enough
to warrant this little warning. To assist most states in coming up with some
standard LLC statutes, the federal government enacted the Revised Uniform
Limited Liability Company Act (RULLCA) — a set of laws regarding the LLC
that the various states could pick and choose from as they saw fit. Although
most states just copied the entire act directly, some states decided they
wanted to be rebels and strayed from the format the federal government laid
out. Some of these states were well intentioned and offer more protection and
flexibility, while others decided to offer less. I try to give advice that can be
used for forming LLCs anywhere in the U.S., but because of these rogue oper-
ators, it’s always a good idea to look at the specific laws for the state that you
choose to form your LLC in.
Forming an LLC in your home state
If you’re opening up a bricks-and-mortar business that is only operating in
one state — for example, a local shop that deals heavily in the community —
you should just make it easy on yourself and form your LLC in that state.

Sometimes a business is only a good business because of its close proximity
to interested customers, resources, and land. Running this type of company
means that you’ll have to register to transact business in that particular state
and will also be subject to its laws, so you might as well save on filing fees
and paperwork hassles by keeping everything in your home state.
And of course, if you’re lucky enough to live in a state that has a really low
tax structure, then why form out-of-state at all? In Appendix A, I list the busi-
ness taxes imposed on LLCs in all 50 states. There, you can compare your
state’s tax structure with the tax structures of other states. Just keep in mind
that I only list the taxes imposed on LLCs with partnership taxation (the most
common type), so if you have elected to be taxed as a corporation, then you
should definitely speak with your accountant and/or a multistate registered
agent who should be familiar with the tax structures of all 50 states.
If you have a bricks-and-mortar operation in more than just your home state,
then you will be required to register to transact business in those other
states. This is called foreign filing. When you have foreign filed, you are now
required to comply with all of the laws and the paperwork of that state.
Looking for LLCs out-of-state
If you don’t have a bricks-and-mortar business — maybe you’re running an
Internet company or a consulting or service business that isn’t restricted to a
particular state — and you live in a high tax state, then I urge you to consider
forming your LLC in another state. After all, some states have worked very
hard to structure their tax and LLC laws to make it desirable to domicile com-
panies there. Would you really want to let them down? I know, I know . . . the
entire idea of forming your LLC in a faraway place can be somewhat daunting
at first, but don’t let the idea overwhelm you.
75
Chapter 5: Choosing the Best State for Your LLC
All LLCs were not created equal
Wherever you decide to form your LLC, you
must abide by that state’s LLC and tax laws.
Some states have laws that are more favorable
than others. Some things to keep in mind:
 Some states have lower taxes than others.
 Some states have fewer fees than others.
 Some states have better laws regarding
LLCs that better protect the managers and
members.
 Some states allow the members to remain
completely anonymous.
 Some states encourage new business by
offering tax breaks and other incentives.

Right now, go to Appendix A and compare the tax structure of the state that
you live in to those of the other states. If it looks like you can do much better
(for instance, you live in California!), then you should definitely consider
domiciling your LLC in another state. But which state? Well, Nevada and
Delaware stand out among the rest. They are actively trying to lure busi-
nesses by keeping their taxes low (or having none at all!) and making sure
they provide the proper legal support for small businesses (such as
Delaware’s Chancery Court).
For very little money, you can go to a multi-state registered agent or corporate
consulting company that specializes in working in all 50 states and have them
tell you what needs to be filed and even file the documents for you! These
companies specialize in taking the headache out of operating out of different
states. They can save you from spending your valuable time doing research,
preparing paperwork, and standing in line at the government offices.
Nevada: The small business tax haven
Nevada is notorious for being the ultimate state for small businesses. 
When Nevada wrote its LLC laws, it decided to allow one person to be all
positions, which means that even though the LLC is considered a partnership,
by law there needn’t be two members. I don’t condone single-member LLCs
(see Chapter 4 for more details), but this is just one representation of the
flexibility that Nevada offers.
But, wait! That’s not all! That number-one reason every entrepreneur and real
estate mogul out there goes on and on about the benefit of Nevada is that
there are no taxes. Yes, you read correctly. No taxes. Zero. Zilch. Nada. And 
I mean nada . . . no franchise taxes, no corporate taxes, no personal income
taxes . . . I guess all of that gambling has paid off! So the next time your best
friend loses $200 at the craps table, make sure to thank him.
So no taxes is pretty cool. Okay, very cool. But there’s more! In Nevada, the
members are not on the public records. This means that you can own an LLC
and no one will even know about it. The managers are listed, so this only
works if you are manager-managed (see Chapter 4), but this is pretty power-
ful, nonetheless. Why? Well, if a lawyer doesn’t know you own anything, she’ll
most likely not want to sue you!
Some benefits of forming in Nevada are
 One person can be all positions
 Single-member LLCs are allowed
 No personal income taxes
 No corporate taxes
 No franchise fees
 Members are not public record
76
Part II: First Things First: Forming Your LLC 

 Nominee managers are legal (see Chapter 14 for more information)
 Non-U.S. citizens can be managers and/or members
 Low filing fees
Wyoming is also a great state to form your LLC in and even beats Nevada in
some ways. Wyoming is a notoriously pro-business state, and it’s where LLCs
were first pioneered in the United States! It offers a lot of the same benefits as
Nevada, but it’s a lot more under the radar — it doesn’t have that “tax haven”
stigma that Nevada has. Also, the fees are about 75 percent less. However,
Wyoming has its drawbacks, such as not allowing single-member LLCs.
Delaware: The heavy hitter with the Chancery Court
Great expectations? Designing an LLC that needs room to grow? Then
Delaware is the state for you! Delaware is perfect if you intend to grow really
large and do business in several different states.
Most public companies want to be in Delaware because of its Chancery Court
and its long history of case law. The state is so great, in fact, that the majority
of public companies listed on the stock exchange are domiciled in Delaware.
That’s a pretty big reputation for such a little state!
Considering it’s so great, I should probably be a little bit more specific about
what the Chancery Court actually is. Although it sounds like something out of
the game of Monopoly, the Chancery Court is a special court the makes decisions
on business matters. Delaware is the only state with such a court. Most states’
courts are very backlogged, and it can take years for a judge to hear and decide
on your lawsuit. Delaware can get things resolved in weeks instead of years.
That alone should be good enough, but the Chancery Court goes a step fur-
ther. When you go to court in other states, you never know how much your
judge actually knows about business. (“You mean to tell me that his honor
was just promoted from traffic court?” You get the picture.) In Delaware,
though, all judges in the Chancery Court are experts in matters of business
and are renowned for their fair and educated decision making. After all, don’t
you want to feel comfortable that the person deciding the fate of your com-
pany will be more fluent in the laws of LLCs than petty larceny?
Some of Delaware’s benefits include:
 The ever-famous Chancery Court
 300 years of business case law to lead the way
 Delaware allows series LLCs (see Chapter 2)
 Fees are relatively low
 No state tax on LLCs that are formed in Delaware but don’t operate there
77
Chapter 5: Choosing the Best State for Your LLC

Working with a State-Required
Agent for Your LLC
“Where should we send your lawsuit?” If this question were posed to most
business owners, they’d probably give the wrong address, if any at all. For
this reason, states now require a business to have what is called a registered
agent (which is interchangeable with the term resident agent). In the state in
which you form your LLC and in every state that you’re doing business, you
must have a registered agent.
A registered agent’s primary duty is to be open during business hours in the
event that your company is sued and paperwork needs to be served. Fun job,
huh? This person also accepts government documents, such as correspon-
dence from the Secretary of State’s office, the clerk’s office, and the state tax
bureaus, on behalf of your company and then forwards them on to you. The
agent’s office can also serve as your corporate headquarters in the state your
LLC was formed in if you don’t have an office there.
Why you need a registered agent
In some states, you can serve as your own registered agent (provided you
have an office address in the state). However, there are multitudes of reasons
why this isn’t a good idea:
 Someone must be at the registered agent’s office address during all busi-
ness hours and must agree to sign for government papers. If the court
service comes to drop off legal documents and you’re not around, you
could lose the lawsuit by default!
 If lawsuits are filed at your business address, imagine what your customers
and employees will think.
 You lose some of your privacy. By using your registered agent’s address
on all of your state filings, you have an additional level of privacy.
What your agent should do for you
Due to the sad truth that a registered agent’s primary function is to sit and
wait for a lawsuit to arrive, most registered agents now provide extra services.
After all, you’re a well-behaved citizen and are most likely not getting sued
very often, so what’s a registered agent to do all day?
They try to busy themselves and warrant their fees by taking on such important
tasks as keeping your LLC in compliance with all of the state-required filings,

Part II: First Things First: Forming Your LLC 

forwarding your mail, and protecting your identity. Because of these extra
tasks, registered agents have gone from being a legal irritant to becoming one
of the most important members of your team. Their responsibilities include
 Having a separate business location and being open during normal business
hours to accept lawsuits and filing documents, which they forward imme-
diately to you
 Protecting your address by allowing you to use their address as your
corporate headquarters
 Forwarding your mail and government notices each business day
 Reminding you of any filings that are due in the state and making sure
you stay in compliance
 Filing your documents (if necessary) with the requisite state and local
bureaus
 Assisting you in finding state-specific tax and legal professionals
Finding and working with an agent
Finding a registered agent shouldn’t be too difficult. The best way to find 
an agent is by calling up your Secretary of State’s office and asking if they 
can recommend anyone. Some state offices will do this; others try to remain
impartial. You can also find an agent by doing a Google search or by going to
www.registered-agent-information.com. This Web site doesn’t list
agents for every state, but if you e-mail them, they can point you in the right
direction. This Web site includes information on all of the registered agents in
a particular state, their pricing, and customer reviews.
First and foremost, when interviewing a potential agent, get a feel for her
policies on dealing with lawsuits. You and your registered agent must agree that
any legal paperwork she receives on your behalf will be brought to your
attention immediately. Perhaps you decide that she will call you and summarize
a document’s contents and then have it delivered to you overnight. Or maybe
she’ll e-mail you a copy of the documents and then send the originals to you.
Just be sure both of you are clear on what procedure will be followed. The same
method should be used for state documents and various tax notices as well.
Whatever the delivery method you and your agent agree on, make sure you
can track your package.
One characteristic to look for when choosing a registered agent is how long
that person or company has been working with the Secretary of State’s office.
If your registered agent has close relationships with the administrators at the
Secretary of State’s office, then there’s a good chance your filings will be com-
pleted much faster and issues can be resolved easily. Also, it’s a good sign of
79
Chapter 5: Choosing the Best State for Your LLC

legitimacy. If the administrators at the Secretary of State’s office have never
heard of your registered agent, then there’s a good chance that person or
company isn’t doing a lot of work there.
If you’ll be doing business in multiple states, your registered agent should
also be located in those states. That way, your filings, your invoices, and your
records can be consolidated, and you have one firm that knows the ins and
outs of your business and can handle you in multiple jurisdictions. You
should also make sure that the agent can collect, complete, and file your
state and local business licenses and permits for you. (See Chapter 8 for
more on business licenses and permit filings.)
Although registered agents don’t come free, their services are minimal in
price, usually only costing a few hundred dollars per year (a pretty fair price
for everything they do!). Most fees are billed annually and at the time your
LLC was initially created. If your agent requests that you sign a contract with
her for a number of years, I would think twice. There are a lot of really legiti-
mate agents out there who don’t require contracts — why lock yourself in if
you don’t have to?
Make sure your agent always has your current contact information. If your
agent can’t find you, she’ll have trouble forwarding Uncle Sam’s letters to
you. I have had numerous clients who used my company as their agent to
maintain their privacy, and they were so private that they wouldn’t even
share their correct contact information with me! Needless to say, tracking
them down to forward their legal paperwork wasn’t always the easiest task!
80
Part II: First Things First: Forming Your LLC 
Summons served. Or was it?
You formed an LLC for your restaurant and even
found ways to keep customers coming back for
more. The company is thriving, and your bank
account is growing faster than you can plate the
next meal. Life is good. Then one day you find out
that last spring a customer got food poisoning
from your shellfish, you were sued, the case
went to trial, and worst of all . . . you lost! By
“default judgment!”
Whoa, whoa, whoa! How does something like
this happen? As your kitchen equipment is
hauled away for auction, you curse at your
cousin Bob. Why? Because he was on file as
your registered agent, and he never notified you
of the summons to appear in court! You weren’t
even there to defend the restaurant against
claims that you suspect weren’t even true.
Maybe it wasn’t the shellfish (after all, you tried
it yourself!), but something else the customer
ate earlier that day.
Of course, this is a nightmare scenario, but it
does demonstrate the importance of selecting
a reliable registered agent. This also can
happen if the summons is misplaced at your
busy establishment or simply ignored by an
ignorant employee. So how do you defend your-
self from such a nightmare? Choose a qualified
registered agent and keep communication lines
open. It may save your business from going
under one day.

I would suggest choosing an individual within your LLC to maintain regular con-
tact with your registered agent. This helps avoid any unnecessary confusion
about who the agent is supposed to contact in the face of a lawsuit. With that
said, all members should feel comfortable contacting the agent at any time.
Attorneys will try to place themselves as your registered agent. Although
they are qualified to be your agent, be aware that they tend to be much more
expensive than commercial registered agents. Not only that, but if they aren’t
the most qualified attorney to handle a particular legal battle, you have to go
through the fun of explaining to them that you don’t want to use their ser-
vices on a lawsuit that was served to them.
Registering Your LLC in Multiple States
Say you have a restaurant in Florida, your home state, but want to expand to
Georgia and North Carolina. After you open your locations in those states,
you are doing business there. By law, if you’re doing business in other states,
you must register in those states (this is called foreign filing). The foreign-
filing process is similar to the actual formation process, but it’s always in
addition to the initial formation. Your domicile (the state where your LLC is
formed) won’t change; you’ll just be allowed to transact business in the other
states you’ve registered in.
Not foreign filed anywhere? Doing business only in the state where your LLC
is formed? Then you’re simply called a domestic LLC.
What “doing business” really means
The term doing business is important in LLC law because it creates the guide-
lines under which you may or may not be required to foreign file. Of course,
you’ll want to foreign file in as few states as necessary. With each additional
state come additional laws to learn and red tape to follow, as well as some
pretty hefty fees. Unfortunately, as you find out in the next section, foreign
filing is sometimes necessary.
It’s hard to determine whether you’re actually “doing business” in another state.
What if you shipped your product across the country to a single customer, yet
most of your business is accomplished in your LLC’s home state? Which state’s
laws must you follow? Remember, each state’s laws are different. Here are a
few questions to point you in the right direction:
 Does your LLC operate out of a physical office or retail store in the state?
 Are you physically there, meeting with customers (instead of just speaking
with them over the phone or by e-mail)?
81
Chapter 5: Choosing the Best State for Your LLC

 Does a large portion of your LLC’s revenue come from that state?
 Do any of your employees physically work in the state? Do you pay state
payroll taxes?
If you answered yes to any of these questions, then there’s a good chance
that you are doing business in the state and are required to foreign file your
LLC there.
Even though you may be making money from customers in a particular state,
it doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re transacting business there, as far as
the law is concerned.
Doing business in multiple states? You
must foreign file!
Yes, it’s a necessary evil, but with the help of your registered agent and perhaps
a good advisor, foreign filing can be a breeze. Just be aware that if you’re
planning on doing business in numerous states, the filing fees can get pretty
hefty, especially considering that a lot of states charge more for filing foreign
LLCs than they do for domestic ones. Unfortunately, you can’t get out of the
fees, but at least you can try to incorporate this cost into your budget.
82
Part II: First Things First: Forming Your LLC 
Tsk, tsk, tsk . . . Haven’t foreign filed?
So, you’ve been doing business in a state and
haven’t registered there . . . what do you do?
First, call your attorney. Second, drive immedi-
ately to the police station and turn yourself in.
Don’t worry — just kidding!
The reality is that nothing major will happen to
you. If your LLC is sued, you can still defend it in
the local courts. However, if you decide that you
want to sue someone in that state, you definitely
need to register there first.
As for penalties, some states are harder than
others. You may have to pay the fees that should
have been paid, plus possible fines and interest.
However, most states are just happy to have the
business and will waive the fines and fees just to
get you in compliance. In other words, it’s not such
a big deal. Just make sure you register ASAP!

Preparing and filing the paperwork
Registering (also called qualifying) your business in another state is remark-
ably similar to the formation process. This stuff should almost be second
nature after creating your original LLC (I cover those steps in Chapter 6).
Registering is relatively easy, and generally, foreign entities have less paperwork
to deal with in terms of certain licenses and permits after the registration is
completed. Whew . . . something to look forward to!
When you register, you submit an application for a certificate of authority.
You can normally download the basic form off the Web site for the Secretary
of State in the state you are attempting to register in, or you can have your
incorporating company create the application for you.
83
Chapter 5: Choosing the Best State for Your LLC
Knowing you are not doing business in a state
The Revised Model Business Corporation Act
(RMBCA) gives criteria for when an entity is not
transacting business in a state. Although it was
written for corporations, the act also applies to
LLCs.
Not sure if you are technically “doing business”
in a particular state? If you are doing any of the
things listed below, then you should double-
check with a corporate consultant in that state
because you will likely have to foreign file.
 Maintaining, defending, or settling any pro-
ceeding (that is, being involved in a lawsuit)
 Holding meetings of the board of directors
or shareholders or carrying on other activi-
ties concerning internal corporate affairs
 Maintaining bank accounts
 Maintaining offices or agencies for the
transfer, exchange, and registration of the
corporation’s own securities or maintaining
trustees or depositaries with respect to
those securities
 Selling through independent contractors
 Soliciting or obtaining orders, whether by
mail or through employees or agents or oth-
erwise, if the orders require acceptance out-
side this state before they become contracts
 Creating or acquiring debts, mortgages, and
security interests in real or personal property
 Securing or collecting debts or enforcing
mortgages and security interests in prop-
erty securing the debts
 Owning real or personal property
 Conducting an isolated transaction that is
completed within 30 days and that is not
one in the course of repeated transactions
of a like nature
 Transacting business in interstate commerce
If you’re doing one or two of the above things,
then chances are, you aren’t required to foreign
file in that state. If you’re doing a lot of the above
things, then you may want to contact your attor-
ney for his advice on the issue.

When filling out the application, you’ll most likely have to provide the following:
 The name of your foreign LLC: List the name as it appears on the articles
of organization in your home state.
 The name of your foreign LLC in the state you are registering in: If
your name isn’t available in the state you’re registering your LLC in, you
may have to select an alternate name to do business under.
 Entity domicile: This means the date and state that the LLC was formed in.
 Resident agent name and address: Give the name and address of your
LLC’s resident agent in the state you are registering to do business in.
 Your principle office address: It’s common to put your resident agent’s
address here as your principle office in the state. However, you can also
list your corporate office address, if you have one.
 Name and address of each manager and/or member: The information
that is required here varies from state to state. Contact your incorporating
company if you have any questions.
 Signature of a manager or member: One manager or member’s signature
is required to file the registration.
 Signature of resident agent: Your resident agent is required to sign the
application stating that he has agreed to be your resident agent.
Before your application can be approved by your Secretary of State, it must
be signed by your resident agent in that state. If you’re registering to transact
business in multiple states, you may have a hard time keeping everything in
order and staying on top of your filing dates. Trust me, running a company is
hard enough without all the tedious paperwork involved in maintaining your
LLC’s compliance in a zillion jurisdictions.
For a nominal fee, you can have a multi-state resident agent company serve
as your resident agent in all of the states in which you’re doing business. The
company can assist you with the filings, stay on top of your paperwork, and
even let you know when your filings are due!
In some states, before you can file your application, you must show a proof of
good standing in the state your LLC was formed in. This is often called a cer-
tificate of good standing or certificate of existence. The certificate shows the
state that you are foreign filing with that your LLC is in good standing in the
state that it was formed in. To make it even more difficult, some states
require that you provide a certified copy of your articles of organization. You
can contact the Secretary of State’s office in your home state to obtain these
documents, or you can have your incorporating company do it for you. After
you have obtained your certificate of good standing (and your certified copy
of your articles, if required), you should send it in with your application.
84
Part II: First Things First: Forming Your LLC 

Maintaining your multi-state LLC
Although it may sound sexy to say you’re a nationwide company, every state
you register in to transact business brings a pile of paperwork and loads of
fees. Some of your annual or biannual filings may include
 Annual report of members and managers
 Annual publication in a local newspaper
 Franchise tax reports
 Income tax reports
 Business licenses
This is just a short list — there could be many others. It really depends on the
state. Because of the multitude of filings that are required for every state you
are transacting business in, you may want to consider hiring an incorporating
company to handle everything for you. That way, you maintain compliance and
can spend your time running your business rather than struggling with strange
filings for states you aren’t familiar with. Many companies offer services
tailored to each state. For instance, IncorpServices.com is one of the four
multi-state registered agent companies in the United States and offers a
Company Compliance & Resident Agent Service that tracks your filings, filing
dates, mail forwarding, and so on. It also has an online system where you can
view all of your filing dates, your filings, your corporate documents, and so on.

Chapter 5: Choosing the Best State for Your LLC
Want to change your home state?
When Bart opened Bart’s Bikes, he was a differ-
ent man. He lived on Venice Beach and was a
California boy at heart. But as the company grew,
so did he. Soon, he was doing business in Oregon
too, and little did he know that Oregon was a bike
lover’s paradise. Within months, Bart’s Bikes took
off. Bart, getting older and wanting to trade in his
surf board for some hiking boots, decided that a
move to Oregon was in order.
Within a year, all of Bart’s business was in
Oregon, and he decided to close up shop in
Venice Beach, leaving that life behind for good.
Now Bart faced a predicament. Bart’s Bikes,
LLC was formed in California and foreign filed in
Oregon. Bart wanted to change his company’s
domicile to Oregon. After all, why should
anyone put up with California’s high taxes and
exorbitant fees if he doesn’t have to?
Bart heard about a process called domestica-
tion, where he could file some forms with the
new state’s Secretary of State’s office and make
that state the LLC’s new domicile. Unfortunately,
Bart discovered that Oregon is one of the states
that does not provide for domestication. In this
case, he had his attorney assist him in with-
drawing and dissolving his California-based LLC
and transferring the assets to a new, Oregon-
based LLC.

This organization system is a huge help because your filing dates vary from state
to state, and it helps you avoid paying hefty late fees for missed filings. The
other multi-state registered agent companies are CSC, CT, and NRAI.
Withdrawing from a state
What happens when you’re no longer doing business in a particular state and
don’t want to keep up with the paperwork of being registered there? It’s very
simple to withdraw (or cancel) your LLC — you just file a certificate of cancella-
tion with the Secretary of State’s office in the state you want to withdraw from.
The certificate of cancellation is a pretty standard form and contains some
basic information, such as
 The name of the LLC as stated on its articles of organization
 The name of the LLC as it is doing business in that state, if different
 The effective date of the cancellation, if different from the filing date
 Any other information that the manager or member filing the certificate
of cancellation feels is relevant
You can normally just download this form off the Secretary of State’s Web site
and mail it in with the filing fee. You don’t really need an attorney to file the
certificate of cancellation. However, you should seek legal advice if the entity
you are withdrawing has assets or physical locations in that state.

Chapter 6
Creating Your Articles
of Organization
In This Chapter
 Knowing what you need to include
 Picking out provisions
 Creating a polished document
T
he articles of organization is your LLC’s most important document. Why?
Because you can’t even be an LLC until you create and file your articles
of organization with your Secretary of State’s office. After this is done, your
LLC is formed.
With so many uses for LLCs and all of their flexibility, why on earth would
you want your LLC to look and act the same way as someone else’s? If you
are raising money for a multimillion-dollar real-estate venture and your Uncle
Joe is running a paper route, do you really want both companies operating
under carbon-copy LLCs? Heck no! You need something that is customized to
your specific needs.
Because LLC law is so vague, you easily can customize your LLC by choosing
the right rules and operational guidelines to include in your articles of organi-
zation (which this chapter covers) and your operating agreement (see
Chapter 9). Think of writing your articles of organization for your LLC as
drawing up plans for your dream house — why own prefab when you can
have custom built?
You need to be careful when filing your articles of organization. Although
most of the designing and customizing of your entity is done in your operat-
ing agreement, some states may require you to include certain provisions (a
fancy name for the sections of your articles of organization) in your articles.
It can be sort of tricky — all states differ slightly in their requirements, so if
you are creating and filing your articles yourself, you definitely need to look
up your state’s rules. I provide Web addresses in Appendix A where you can
find the LLC laws for each state you are filing in.

88
Part II: First Things First: Forming Your LLC 
What You Need to Know 
Before You Begin
Before creating your articles of organization, you need to establish some
pretty important things:
 What is the name of your LLC? Is the name available for use? (See
Chapter 4.) Any particular name may be available for your LLC, but is it
available for use in your state? Has it already been trademarked by
another company? Trademark infringement can be a time-consuming
and costly experience. Even if you have no evil marketing intentions of
making money off someone else’s name, the courts won’t be lenient. Just
as with a speeding ticket, ignorance is not a defense (and we’ve all tried
that one before!).
 What is the purpose of your LLC? This is an easy one. Before going into
business, you need to know what sort of business you are in! This can 
be as specific or broad as you like. However, I recommend that you keep
your company’s purpose broad so you aren’t limited by what you put 
in your articles of organization. (See “The Purpose & Powers of the LLC”
later in this chapter.)
 Is your LLC going to be member-managed or manager-managed? (See
Chapter 4.) Are all investors going to have a say in the day-to-day busi-
ness decisions, or will a select few handle everything? Do you want to
manage your own LLC, or would you rather step back and let someone
else handle it?
 Who will be the initial members? (See Chapter 9.) In some states, you’re
required to list your initial members on your articles of organization —
especially if you are member-managed. Therefore, you should have an
idea of who the initial members of the company will be before forming.
You can always change this later; however, it can be time consuming,
depending on the process that you lay out in your operating agreement.
 In which state(s) are you going to form your LLC? (See Chapter 5.) LLC
and tax laws vary from state to state — some states have no taxes, others
have less paperwork, and others less disclosure — and you should take
this into consideration when determining where to form your LLC. Also,
Chapter 5 helps you figure out whether you are doing enough business
in a particular state to be required to register there.
 Who is going to act as your registered agent? (See Chapter 5 again.)
Every LLC needs to have a registered agent acting on its behalf in every
state in which it is doing business. Have you chosen your registered
agent for each state you are registering in? Bear in mind that you must
rely on this business if your LLC is ever served with a lawsuit.

Preparing for What the States Require
As LLCs started to become popular, the federal government worried that
there were too many differences between states’ laws. Some differences are
okay, but you can imagine the confusion if every state had its own idea of
what an LLC was and how it was supposed to operate. It would be mayhem!
To avoid this problem, the federal government came up with a nifty set of
guidelines called the Uniform Limited Liability Company Act (ULLCA, for
short). This act laid out what the government believed were ideal laws for the
creation and management of LLCs in each state.
The ULLCA offers plenty of guidelines on how states should recognize and
regulate LLCs, including
 Limitations in the name of the LLC — there must be a designator, such
as LLC
 Provisions that allow for name reservations
 Requirements on designating a registered agent (Please refer to Chapter
5 for more information on working with a registered agent.)
 The nature of business that the LLC can state in its articles of organization
 The designation of an LLC as a separate legal entity
 The process of filing the articles of organization with the state
 The process of amending the articles of organization
 The process of filing an annual report
 Provisions limiting the liability of the managers and members
 Laws regarding membership shares
 Dissolutions of LLCs
 Foreign registrations and withdrawals of LLCs
I recommend reading over the ULLCA. You can view the entire act at
www.myllc.com/dummies. However, keep in mind that each state can pick
and choose what it wants to take out of the act. Many states have come up
with their own sets of laws that vary slightly from other states’ guidelines. In
Appendix A, I provide you with a list of the Web address and phone number
for the Secretary of State’s office (where you will file your documents) in each
state, as well as the LLC statutes in each state’s laws.
All states have basic layouts of articles of organization, based on the state’s
LLC laws, that you can adopt. Even if you aren’t setting up a complex business
structure or doing anything too fancy with your LLC, you should add some
provisions specific to your LLC to the state-provided articles of organization.
89
Chapter 6: Creating Your Articles of Organization

If your state allows it (most states do), you should retype the articles into
your own document so it looks more professional. A lot of important people
likely will be looking at these articles — bankers determining your eligibility
for a business loan, investors looking to buy in, and so on. You want to
demonstrate that you take pride in your company documents. I show you
how a formal articles of organization should look at the end of this chapter.
In the end, your LLC’s documents should fit your business like a freshly tailored
suit. The articles of organization and the operating agreement (discussed in
Chapter 9) together should outline all the voting rules and restrictions, as
well as the management structure.
Throughout the book, I give examples of provisions you can include, and I
even supply you with a CD full of the state articles of organization forms. But
wait! If I don’t recommend going with generic formation documents, why am I
only supplying you with generic forms?
First, it would be impossible to include all of the possible variations of the
articles of organization for every state in this book. Instead, I give you the
barebones articles that each state requires (although you should still check
your state’s tax laws) and then give you extra provisions that you can add to
customize the LLC to your needs.
When it comes to customizing your LLC, you get into a lot more specifics in the
operating agreement (see Chapter 9) than you do in the articles of organization.
If you don’t see an important provision here, it’s probably because I felt it
best to include it in the operating agreement instead. I like putting most of
the provisions in the operating agreement because the operating agreement
isn’t on public record like the articles of organization is. Privacy is important,
especially when it comes to protecting yourself against lawsuits. And if you
change the articles, you have to refile them with the state, and that costs
money. You don’t have to pay a dime to change your operating agreement.
Choosing Provisions for Your 
Articles of Organization
The articles of organization are made up of provisions, which are just parts.
Some provisions are legally required to be in your articles, but you can pick
and choose other ones to customize your LLC to your specific needs. Choosing
the best provisions for your articles of organization can mean the difference
between just getting by in your business and being more successful than you
ever thought possible!
90
Part II: First Things First: Forming Your LLC 

The articles of organization are public record, which means that anyone can
view them. If there is anything you don’t want the world to know, you should
instead put it in your operating agreement, which is normally kept in the private
company files.
All states have their own forms that you can use for your articles of organiza-
tion. You can fill out basic information and file them with the Secretary of
State’s office. This is definitely the easiest way to go; however, you must be
aware that what the state provides is just the bare bones and isn’t tailored to
your specific needs and/or line of business.
Provisions that the articles 
must(must!) have
Most states’ articles of organization are pretty similar. Here is a list of provi-
sions that are normally required in each state, along with an example so you
can get an idea of the provision’s content and wording. You can find the
actual language of the provision on your state’s generic articles of organiza-
tion, which I have provided on the accompanying CD.
The LLC Name
Your company name must separate your LLC from other companies so you
avoid trademark infringement. The name also should be easy to pronounce;
it’s also a good idea to confirm that the name translates well in other lan-
guages in case you eventually do business overseas. Refer to Chapter 4 for
more specifics on naming your LLC.
An example provision:
Article I. Name.
The name of the Limited Liability Company is _______________ 
(hereinafter referred to as the “Company”).
Company Address
Some states require that you put your company address in the articles of
organization. I always recommend using your registered agent’s address. Just
make sure your agent has okayed this in advance and can forward your mail
every day. Also be aware that, often, the state won’t let you use a P.O. Box.
91
Chapter 6: Creating Your Articles of Organization

An example provision:
Article II. Principle Place of Business
The address of the Company’s principal place of business in this state is:
______________________________.
The Purpose & Powers of the LLC
Here you designate what sort of business you’ll be engaging in. Although
some states require you to be more detailed, most states allow you to be
really broad and say that the LLC isn’t limited in its purpose and has the
power to engage in any activity it wants. I always feel that the broader you
make this statement, the less you are limited in the future should you decide
to venture into other business areas. Sometimes envisioning where your busi-
ness will be at its ten-year mark can be an impossible feat, so to be safe,
always stick with the idea that “broader is better!”
An example of a broadly stated provision:
Article III. Purpose & Powers
The purpose for which this Company is organized is to transact any or all
lawful business for which Limited Liability Companies may be organized for,
including, but not limited to:
a. Carrying on any business or any other legal or lawful activity allowed
by law.
b. Acquiring, owning, using, conveying, and otherwise disposing of any
interest of real and/or personal property.
c. Manufacturing, buying, selling, and distributing goods, wares, and
merchandise of every class and description, both real and personal
and tangible.
d. Engaging in any services — with the exception of services deemed
“professional” by the laws of the state — which include but are not
limited to: consulting, brokering, and dealing.
e. To have and exercise all rights and powers that are legally available
to a Limited Liability Company, now and in the future.
The foregoing purposes and powers thereof shall not be held to limit or
restrict in any manner.
Duration of the Company
One tricky thing about LLCs — by law, they can’t live forever (also called a
perpetual duration). This is one of the things that legally separates LLCs from
corporations.
92
Part II: First Things First: Forming Your LLC 

Even though some states allow you to state “perpetual duration” on your arti-
cles of organization, this may open you up to avoidable liability in the future.
To be safe, I would put 30 years, which is a fairly standard duration. This
doesn’t mean that in 30 years you’ll be required to dissolve — you can always
renew your LLC when the time comes.
A sample provision:
Article IV. Duration
In accordance with all state statutes, the duration of the company shall be
thirty (30) years. However, the Company may still have the option of dis-
solving during this term.
The Company may, in its Operating Agreement and amendments thereof,
confer additional powers upon its managers and members, so as they are
not in conflict with the law.
Registered Agent
Your registered agent can be your greatest asset — especially if you are orga-
nized in a state other than the one you live in (see Chapter 5). First of all, it’s
the law to have a registered agent, and secondly, a registered agent can handle
much of the paperwork involved in maintaining compliance in your state(s).
A sample provision:
Article V. Name & Address of Registered Agent
The Name of the Company’s initial Registered Agent is:
______________________________
The Address of the Company’s initial Registered Agent is:
______________________________
______________________________
In the event of a lawsuit, your registered agent is of the greatest importance;
therefore, you must have someone who is experienced in this area take on this
role. This address is where all legal papers will be sent, along with state or fed-
eral notices and other tax-related documents. It’s better to have everything
forwarded to you from your registered agent than to worry about losing some-
thing critical at your place of business. This address provides a sanctuary for
vital legal and government papers to reside and can work to protect you.
Member-Managed or Manager-Managed
Whether your LLC will be managed by its members or separate managers is
something that you need to decide before creating your articles of organiza-
tion. In Chapter 4, I discuss the benefits and drawbacks of both types of man-
agement structures.
93
Chapter 6: Creating Your Articles of Organization

A sample provision:
Article VI. Management
The Company shall be managed by (choose one: its members / separate
managers).
Names and Addresses of Managers and/or Members
Most states require that you state the names and addresses of the managers
and/or members in the articles. Because the articles of organization are
public record, try to state as little as is legally allowed. If you are manager-
managed and have the option of stating either your managers or your mem-
bers, always opt to disclose your managers.
Other states only require the names to be stated on the Initial List of Managers
and Members (the exact name of this filing varies from state to state), which
is a completely separate filing. Again, if you want to keep your privacy, see if
the registered agent will allow you to use his address as each member’s
address.
A sample provision (when stating managers):
Article VII. Managers
The names and addresses of the persons who will be serving as managers:
(Recognize that this list may be tailored during the Company’s first and subse-
quent annual meetings if new members are voted upon by managing partners.)
_______________
_______________
_______________
_______________
_______________
_______________
If you are in a state where the members must be disclosed in the articles of
organization, yet you still want privacy in order to protect your assets, you
should talk to an attorney about getting a revocable living trust to serve as a
member. This protects your identity (the name of the trust will be on record),
but as a beneficiary of the trust, you will still own the membership shares.
Some states require that you state the amount of each member’s initial con-
tribution (money, services, equipment, whatever) and the percentage of prof-
its that each member gets. If you don’t yet know this information, you can do
one of two things:
 State what you do know, and then amend the articles later (which can be
a hassle — not to mention costly!).
 Domicile your LLC in another state that doesn’t require this disclosure,
and then foreign file in the state that you’re operating in.
94
Part II: First Things First: Forming Your LLC 

Organizer
In most states, an organizer must sign the articles of organization (for more
details, see the “Choosing who signs” section later in this chapter). This pro-
vision states who the organizer is and her place of business. The purpose is
to verify that the information contained in the articles is factual. However, the
organizer has no true legal responsibility or further obligation to the LLC.
This provision should always come last in the articles of organization.
An example provision:
Article VIII. Organizer
The name and address of the Organizer of the Company is:
______________________________
______________________________
______________________________
Additional provisions you can include
If the provisions provided in the generic state forms were adequate for every-
one, there wouldn’t be too many customized LLCs. Quite a few provisions can
be included that most LLC novices (and some professionals!) don’t know
about and states aren’t legally required to provide you with. I give you the
most common ones here. Because you can customize your LLC in so many
different ways, your attorney can assist you in drafting other provisions that
will meet your specific needs, if necessary.
Indemnification of Managers and Members under State Law
When you are indemnified, you can’t be held personally responsible for the
acts of the company or even for your acts on behalf of the company. This is
normally provided in state law, but it’s always good to publicly state in your
articles of organization that each member is permitted the maximum indem-
nification available to them.
A sample provision:
Article IX: Indemnification of Managers and Members
A. Under the current law, including any amendments hereafter, each manager
shall be entitled to the fullest indemnification available to them.
B. Each manager shall be liable to the Company for the following actions:
1. The breach of the manager’s or member’s loyalty to the Company, or
its members.
95
Chapter 6: Creating Your Articles of Organization

2. To be liable hereunder the manager in question must have acted in a
malicious or grossly negligent manner, as defined by law.
3. A transaction in which the manager benefits to the detriment of the
Company or its members.
4. An action for which there is no indemnification provided by law.
C. This indemnification shall not deter or cancel out other rights to which the
manager or member is entitled.
Voting Rights
Voting rights are usually dispersed among members in one of two ways:
 All members get one vote. A member who owns 2 percent of the com-
pany has the same voting power as a member who owns 98 percent of
the company.
 Each percentage of membership interest gets one vote. A member with
a 2 percent share of the company gets two votes, while the member with
the 98 percent share gets 98 votes.
The voting rights in one state vary from those in another. However, this is
one of the rare cases where you don’t have to follow the law! You can create
your own rules — all you have to do is state your preference in your articles
of organization. If you want each member to have a percentage of votes equal
to her percentage of ownership, then be sure to include this provision in your
articles of organization.
A sample provision:
Article X. Voting Rights
In regards to the voting rights, each member will be entitled a single vote for
each percentage of membership the member has in the company.
Provisions for professional LLCs
In most states, if you are a licensed professional you must have a special pro-
vision in your articles of organization designating you as a professional LLC
(or PLLC, for short). A PLLC is very similar to a standard LLC; however, pro-
fessionals can’t be exempt from malpractice, so they have less liability pro-
tection. The PLLC’s formation is the same, but the articles are slightly
different, and the filing fee may be slightly higher, depending on the state.
96
Part II: First Things First: Forming Your LLC 

Not sure whether you’re considered a professional? If you are in a profession
requiring a license, then you most likely need to form a PLLC. These profes-
sions are typically
 Doctors
 Chiropractors
 Dentists
 Architects
 Engineers
 Accountants
 Lawyers
If you are still unsure about whether you are required to form a PLLC, contact
your local Secretary of State’s office or an incorporating company.
California currently doesn’t allow professionals to operate under LLCs. If you
are a professional operating in this state, you should consider forming a pro-
fessional corporation instead.
When creating your articles of organization for a professional limited liability
company, keep in mind the following points:
 Typically, there are name restrictions. You must add the word “Professional”
or the letter “P” to the designator. In some states, the name of the LLC
must contain the professional’s name. For instance, if you are a doctor
and your name is Jane Goodman, then your professional limited liability
company can be called “Jane Goodman, MD, P.L.L.C.”
 You can’t state a broad purpose; it must be specific to the service you
are providing. Replace the Purpose provision that I provide earlier in the
chapter with this one:
Article III: Purpose & Powers
The Company is a Professional Limited Liability Company.
The purpose for which the Company is organized is to engage in the profes-
sional service of: ______________________________.
 Most states restrict PLLC members to those professionals who are oper-
ating in the business. This can be a problem if you want to have silent
investors who own membership shares. Check your state statutes to
find out the specific regulations for your state.
 In some states, you may need to have your licensing board approve your
articles of organization and sign them before the Secretary of State will
97
Chapter 6: Creating Your Articles of Organization

accept them for filing. Contact the Secretary of State’s office to see if this
is required. If it is, you may need a good dose of patience — these things
can take time!
 The fees may be slightly higher when forming a professional LLC. Also, if
you are using the generic, state-provided articles of organization, you
must check to see if you need to use a different one for PLLCs.
It’s a Wrap! Putting It All Together
After you figure out what provisions you’re going to include in your articles
of organization, you need to wrap everything up into a professional-looking
document. One option is to just amend the state’s generic form with your
extra provisions, but do you really want to walk into a bank, ask for a million-
dollar business loan, and then hand them articles that look like a patchwork
quilt of legalese? Not likely.
Different states require different formats, and you should probably contact
your Secretary of State’s office to make sure that it doesn’t have any special
requirements as to how the articles of organization are laid out. However, most
states have the basics in common, and with that in mind, here are a few tips:
 Always print your articles of organization on regular 81/2-x-11-inch white
paper. Use black ink and only print on one side of the paper (no double-
sided copies). Make sure that the articles are clean and legible.
 Spell your company name exactly as you want it to look on your checks,
letterhead, and other official documents.
 Structure the document into articles, sections, and subsections. This
makes referencing different provisions a breeze. For example, Article A,
Section 4, or Article II, Section B, Subsection 4. To better understand
what I mean by structure, see the sample articles of organization in the
“Examining your completed articles” section later in this chapter.
Articles of organization are pretty simple, and for the most part, you can
draft them yourself. If you don’t feel like researching laws and typing out pro-
visions, consider going to an incorporating company. They are generally well
versed on creating articles of organization (after all, they do it every day!)
and will charge a heck of a lot less than an attorney will.
Choosing who signs
So you’ve put all this work into forming your articles of organization and now
you need to sign it, right? Not exactly. Believe it or not, in most states, a man-
ager or member doesn’t even need to sign the articles before filing them!
98
Part II: First Things First: Forming Your LLC 

Most states assume that when an LLC is organized, it hasn’t had its first
member meeting. At that meeting, managers are traditionally elected. If the
LLC doesn’t have any managers, they can’t exactly sign the articles, now, can
they? Most states also assume that you are forming your LLC through an
attorney or incorporating service, and to make it easy for everyone, states
allow someone at the law firm or incorporating company to sign the articles
instead of the client. That is why most states allow an organizer to sign and
file the articles of organization.
The organizer doesn’t have to be associated with your company, and she
isn’t a manager or member (unless you want her to be). She is simply the
person who creates the LLC. After the LLC is formed and the managers and
members are assigned, the organizer fades away — she has no future posi-
tion of power in the company.
Although most states allow an organizer to sign the articles of organization,
some states require a manager and/or member to sign. Some states even
require the articles to be notarized! A quick way to determine who must sign
the articles of organization in your state is to look at the filing form for your
state (which is included on the CD).
While this all sounds simple, there’s a catch. In most states, the LLC’s regis-
tered agent is required to sign the articles of organization before it can be
filed. The agent normally signs an Acceptance of Appointment document that
is appended to the articles. This can be a little bit of a headache for most
people, especially if you live in a different state than the one you’re filing in.
In that case, I recommend that you make sure that the company filing your
articles and the registered agent for your entity are one and the same.
Examining your completed articles
Voilà! Finis! You’ve created your articles of organization. If you are creating an
LLC for a standard business, the finished product should look something
like this:

Business into an LLC

hances are, if you’re considering forming an LLC, you’re starting from
somewhere. LLCs are relatively new entities, and if you’ve been in busi-
ness for a long time, you’re probably operating your business or maintaining
your assets as a sole proprietor, partnership, or corporation. You likely know
the benefits of operating under an LLC, but how do you convert your existing
business into one? Forming the LLC is the first step, which I cover in Chapters
4 and 6, but then you need to get your assets into the new entity and begin
operations. This isn’t always easy.
When you’re in the throes of a bustling business, the last thing you want to
do is cause any more chaos by changing your infrastructure and switching
to a completely different entity type. In most cases, you have to navigate a
tax minefield and spend a lot of time changing contracts, business loans, and
even marketing materials over to your new name. Although it can be hairy, the
conversion to an LLC is normally well worth it in the long run — I promise!
Throughout this chapter, I show you how to convert your current business
structure into an LLC, no matter the entity type that you are currently using. I
also show you how to avoid most of the fees and taxes that pop up and how
to avoid unknowingly falling into a tax trap that you can’t get out of. Although
this process may seem complicated on the surface, the situation isn’t as dire
as it first appears. With proper planning and some of my tax-saving tips, you
can be operating under your new LLC in no time!

104
Part II: First Things First: Forming Your LLC
When to Consider Converting to an LLC
Life is good. Your business is flourishing, and you have just decided to take it
to the next level. As you operate more and more with the public, your chances
of being sued increase tenfold. You know that you need the liability protection
and the reassurance that an LLC brings. And if you’re operating as a sole
proprietorship or general partnership, you are probably thinking that you
may want to acquire loans and investors as you grow. For all of these things,
you need a powerful and flexible entity, and as you’re aware, the LLC is your
best bet.
In Chapter 2, I compare LLCs to all of the major forms of doing business —
sole proprietorships, partnerships, corporations. If you haven’t read that
chapter yet, I suggest that you stop here and backtrack to discover the bene-
fits and drawbacks of an LLC in comparison with the entity structure you are
currently operating under. After you understand the pros and cons of your
entity versus an LLC, call your attorney or corporate consultant to discuss
what is right for your specific situation. If you don’t have anyone who knows
the different entity types and can advise you, call 888-88-MYLLC
(888-886-9552) and speak with a consultant there. Get the information any
way you can, because at the end of the day, the details of your business
determine whether an LLC is right for you. The glove doesn’t fit everybody.
When I use the term conversion, I’m not only talking about converting a cor-
poration, limited partnership, or other incorporated entity (an entity that
needs to be filed with the state to exist); I’m including any form of business
that you are operating — sole proprietorships and general partnerships are
included too. After all, converting a business from your own name to an LLC
can be a complicated transaction.
Here are a few reasons why you may want to convert to an LLC:
 You’re operating as a sole proprietorship or general partnership and are
afraid of being sued by a customer or employee.
 Your company — which is currently a corporation — is becoming more
and more profitable, and your corporate tax is up to almost 35 percent.
You realize that your tax burden would be less if you were to operate as
an LLC instead.
 You just purchased real estate in your own name, and you want to pro-
tect the property from lawsuits, but you also want an entity that you can
transfer assets in and out of without causing a taxable event.
 You are currently operating as a sole proprietorship or general partnership
and have decided that you want to raise financing to get the business off
the ground.

Now, these aren’t all the reasons you might want to convert your business to
an LLC; I couldn’t possibly list them all here. However, this list gives you a
taste of why converting your entity into an LLC could be an incredibly power-
ful step on your path to success.
The Drawbacks of Conversion
Unfortunately, converting to an LLC is easier said than done. If you have an
operational business, you can’t just tack the words “LLC” or “Limited
Liability Company” at the end of your name and be done with it. You have to
go through the painstaking process of transferring your assets, one by one,
from the old entity to the new. You also have to change your contracts over,
which can be a huge financial burden if there are fees or if you have to rene-
gotiate them. You can also trigger taxes, fees, and penalties, which can cost
you up the wazoo!
A few pitfalls that you should be aware of include:
 You may have to find a partner if you are operating on your own and
your state doesn’t allow single-member LLCs.
 If you have a partner, you may not be able to change ownership percent-
ages without being subject to some pretty hefty taxes.
 If you have a corporation, you may be subject to being taxed twice on
everything that you own before you can contribute it to your new LLC.
That can be a huge tax burden.
 If you are transferring real estate, you may have to pay a transfer tax
and/or other taxes. You may also have to negotiate with your mortgage
company to allow you to transfer the title without having to first pay off
your mortgage.
 You may have to transfer some contracts over to the new entity. If the
contract doesn’t allow a transfer, you may have to renegotiate it and/or
buy it out.
You can take some steps to lessen the burden; however, before you jump into
a conversion, it’s a good idea to sit down and come up with a plan. Not to
mention, you’ll need to add up these costs and make sure you can afford it!
Navigating the tax minefield
When deciding to convert your business into an LLC, first and foremost you
need to look at what sort of tax burdens the conversion will entail. During the
conversion, you need to transfer each and every asset from the old entity to
105
Chapter 7: Converting Your Current Business into an LLC

the owners, then from the owners to the new LLC. Needless to say, in one of
these steps, you can be hit with a ton of taxes — sales tax, use tax, transfer
tax, and so on. And if the transfer isn’t done properly, the business can even
get socked with unnecessary capital gains taxes. Some of these taxes are fed-
eral and some are state, but the one thing they have in common is that they
can be pretty hefty if you don’t watch out.
Taxes can be especially burdensome if your old business owns real estate.
Regardless of whether the property is already in your name and contribu-
tions to the LLC are tax free, most states still impose transfer taxes. You
should have your attorney and accountant assist you through this process
because they know the specific laws for your state and can guide you.
The CD that accompanies this book contains a number of IRS and tax forms
that you’ll find useful.
Getting around the contractual stuff
So, you’ve managed to sort out the tax stuff and arrange your conversion 
so that you don’t have to dish out too much dough. You do the conversion
and . . . . ouch! You get served with a lawsuit from one of your vendors stating
that you voided your contractual obligation and owe them a lot of money.
And guess what? They’re right.
If you look at the fine print on the contracts that your company has signed
over the years, some of them say that the contracts can’t be assigned or that
that they’ll be terminated upon the termination of the company that entered
into the contract. This means that after you convert and terminate your old
business structure, you may have some problems with the people or compa-
nies you were contractually obligated to.
Some common contracts that may be affected are
 Lease agreements for office space
 Equipment lease agreements
 Bank loans
 Personal loans
 Contracts with vendors
 Employee agreements
In some cases, you’ll need to renegotiate the contract or buy your way out of
it — which can cost you a lot of money. It’s a good idea to speak with an 
106
Part II: First Things First: Forming Your LLC

attorney before starting any negotiations. I’ve found that the money spent on
attorneys in these cases is money well spent.
If you can’t get out of the contract, you may want to consider just leaving
your old company active so the contract doesn’t have to be terminated.
Whether this can be done really depends on the contract, the type of busi-
ness entity you are currently using, and your attorney’s opinion on the
matter. You can also consider merging your old company and your new one,
with your new company being the surviving entity. I discuss this in the
“Looking at ways to minimize taxes” section later in the chapter.
Knowing How to Convert 
from Each Entity Type
After you’ve decided to take the plunge and convert your business to an LLC,
how do you get started? How can you possibly transfer everything over to a
brand-new entity? I understand your hesitation. You can’t jump into a conver-
sion without proper planning. Without forethought, the entire process can be
incredibly troublesome and costly — especially if you have quite a few assets
or lots of contracts. However, conversion shouldn’t be put off either. After all,
you’ll need to do it eventually, and what better time than the present? Say
you were to postpone the process for two years . . . your business (and your
conversion problems!) will have probably quadrupled!
Conversions aren’t necessarily hard to do, but the process varies greatly
depending on how your business is currently structured. For instance, the time,
money, and paperwork will normally be a lot more extensive when converting
your corporation to an LLC than when you are converting your general part-
nership. The process for transferring assets will be different when transferring
from a sole proprietorship to a new LLC than from a limited partnership.
There are four different business structures that most commonly convert to
LLCs (for the basics of each of these structures, check out Chapter 2). They are
 Sole proprietorships
 General partnerships
 Limited partnerships
 Corporations (including S corporations)
I have divided this section according to these categories so you only have to
read about your entity type to get the information you need as you start plan-
ning your conversion strategy.
107
Chapter 7: Converting Your Current Business into an LLC

If your business is laden with assets and contracts, I definitely recommend that
you work closely with your accountant and attorney during the conversion
process.
Converting from a sole proprietorship
Considering that the most common, albeit dangerous, method of operating a
business is as a sole proprietorship, I’m going to bet that you’re running a
sole proprietorship as we speak. Although sole proprietorships are easy and
cheap to start, they offer zero liability protection, and they give your cus-
tomers and employees little confidence in your business acumen. Plus, you’ll
never be able to even think about raising capital or finding investors.
If you’re currently operating as a sole proprietorship, you must form an LLC
immediately. Luckily, converting from a sole proprietorship to an LLC is a
pretty effortless, tax-free process. Your business assets should currently be
in your name, so transferring them is easy. You won’t need to file any conver-
sion paperwork with the Secretary of State’s office — just create an LLC as
you normally would (see Chapters 6 and 8 for more information on creating
and filing your articles of organization), and then use your current business
capital as your initial investment in the new LLC.
If you are currently operating as a sole proprietor, it’s imperative that you
check to see whether your state allows single-member LLCs. Otherwise,
before you can convert, you’ll need to find a partner. Look in Appendix A to
see whether your state allows single-member LLCs. Regardless, because LLCs
are structured to be partnerships, it’s probably a good idea for you to find a
partner anyway. Even if you only give him a small percentage of the company,
the peace of mind that you’ll get will be well worth it. I go into more detail
about this in Chapters 5 and 10.
If you want to convert your sole proprietorship to an LLC, here are the steps
you need to take:
1. Make a list of all the assets that your business currently owns (espe-
cially real estate) and all contracts, insurance policies, leases, and
loans that your business is liable for.
2. Take this list to your attorney for his advice or contact the other par-
ties with whom you’re doing business to determine whether you can
transfer the agreement as is to the new entity.
Often creditors will simply want you to remain as a personal guarantor
and won’t mind transferring the contract to the LLC. Others, such as
leasing companies or vendors who may have an interest in getting you
to renegotiate the contract, may feel differently, however.
108
Part II: First Things First: Forming Your LLC

3. Create and file your articles of organization with the Secretary of
State’s office.
You can find detailed information on how to do this in Chapters 6 and 8.
Make sure to file all required licenses and permit applications as out-
lined in Chapter 8.
4. Acquire a tax identification number (also called an EIN, which stands
for Employer Identification Number) for your new business.
This can be done on the IRS Web site at https://sa2.www4.irs.
gov/sa_vign/newFormSS4.do.
5. Open a new bank account that is for your business only.
You need new checks, an endorsement stamp, deposit slips, and a new
debit card in your LLC’s name. After the account is set up, you can trans-
fer the funds from your existing business to the new LLC by writing a
check from your personal account to your LLC account.
6. If you have any contracts with your clients, redraft them so the con-
tracts are with your LLC and not with yourself.
7. Update your company name and logo to include “LLC” or “Limited
Liability Company.”
Make sure to change your letterhead and business cards. Not only does
this make you sound more official, but it’s also legally required in most
states.
8. Create an operating agreement for your LLC (see Chapter 9) and
update your company business plan to include any formalities that
you want to take place (for example, holding annual meetings).
9. Transfer your assets into the new LLC by “contributing” them to your
LLC in exchange for an ownership percentage.
I talk more about this in the “Transferring your assets” section near the
end of the chapter.
After you are up and running under your new LLC, you must be careful not to
revert to your old ways. You should include “LLC” after your company’s
name and should always sign documents as a representative of the company.
The biggest danger you have to look out for is mixing your personal and busi-
ness funds. That was okay when you were a sole proprietorship, but now that
you are an LLC, it’s a big no-no.
When bringing on a partner, there is a good chance you will be hit with some
taxes, especially if the partner is only contributing services or if he is coming
in at a time when the company has substantial business loans or other liabili-
ties. I go over the details of these sorts of tax snags in Chapter 13.

Chapter 7: Converting Your Current Business into an LLC

Converting from a general partnership
Converting from a general partnership to an LLC is even easier than convert-
ing from a sole proprietorship. Why? Because you already have a partner!
LLCs are set up to be partnerships, so it’s always easier when they are oper-
ated that way.
By the way, that reminds me . . . before you can convert your general partnership
operation to an LLC, all of the partners must unanimously agree to the
decision. No, you can’t convert without them knowing it! They will most likely
have to sign off on it anyway.
After you have everyone on board, you can then go through the process of
forming your LLC and transferring your assets. Although it isn’t the most
exciting pastime, the conversion process isn’t as bad as you think because
the IRS considers general partnerships and LLCs as “partnerships” with no
difference between the two. So, very few changes need to take place as far as
the IRS is concerned. Your partnership can have the same tax year-end (there
is no interruption), and it can continue to be taxed as a partnership with the
same year-end filings due as before.
Now, in most cases, a conversion from a general partnership to an LLC is a
nontaxable event, so you won’t get hit with a big tax bill at year’s end. All you
have to do is contribute the assets of your current business to the new LLC in
exchange for membership shares. To avoid tax penalties, you must not
change the ownership amounts in the new LLC. So if you have four partners
in your general partnership who each owns 25 percent, then your LLC must
have the same four partners with each owning 25 percent and being distrib-
uted 25 percent of the profits and losses. I go over this in detail in Chapter 10,
but for now, just keep in mind that you can’t change things up.
Keeping the ownership and distribution percentages the same is the only way
to avoid a taxable event when changing an existing partnership into an LLC.
Converting from a limited partnership
If you are currently operating as a limited partnership, in most cases it would
make perfect sense to convert to an LLC. Limited partnerships and LLCs are
very similar except for the fact that the partners in an LLC are all shielded
from any personal liability. In a limited partnership, only certain partners —
the limited partners — are exempt from any personal liability.
Because the limited partnership and the LLC are such similar entities — they
are both considered partnerships in the eyes of the law — a conversion is
simple. The IRS has made it so that a conversion from one partnership entity
110
Part II: First Things First: Forming Your LLC

(say, a limited partnership) to another partnership entity (say, an LLC) is a
nontaxable event. You can transfer the assets from one entity to another with-
out having to worry about getting a huge tax bill at the end of the year.
You and your partner will both need to decide to convert the partnership to
an LLC. Unless you want an irate business partner pounding on your door,
you probably shouldn’t act unilaterally. If there are more than two members,
check your partnership agreement to see what percentage of members needs
to agree to the conversion. If your partnership agreement remains silent on
the issue, then you should play it safe and make sure that all members agree.
If you want to change the ownership percentages among partners, then you
or one of your partners may be hit with a pretty hefty tax bill. You should def-
initely speak with your tax advisor so she can assist you in structuring the
deal while avoiding any impending taxes.
As far as the IRS goes, you need to file for a new tax identification number.
Because your LLC’s profits and losses can be reported on your personal tax
returns, just like in a limited partnership, you can maintain your same tax year.
Some states actually have a state filing that facilitates the conversion. This is
normally called a certificate of conversion or articles of conversion. I go over
this in the “When your state does allow statutory conversions” section later
in the chapter.
If your state doesn’t facilitate a conversion — for instance, it doesn’t let you
file a certificate of conversion — you’ll need to do the conversion yourself.
The easiest way to do this is to form a new LLC and have the partners
exchange their membership interests in the limited partnership for the same
amount of membership interests in the new LLC. Now, the only owner of the
limited partnership is the LLC. Because the limited partnership needs to have
more than one owner, it must be liquidated and dissolved. The assets then go
directly to the single owner — the LLC.
Now, you will still be required to transfer all of your contracts, loans, leases,
and other agreements to your new LLC. This is probably the trickiest aspect
of converting your entity. However, because limited partnerships and LLCs
are so closely related, most creditors, individuals, and companies that you
have contracts with should be pretty understanding. Before doing the con-
version, sit down with your attorney and go over any contracts, mortgages,
or leases that may look like a problem.
Converting from a corporation
LLCs are a relatively new entity, so if you’ve been in business for a while, you
are probably operating as a corporation. Corporations are often ideal entities
for running a business. However, if you are looking for pass-through taxation
111
Chapter 7: Converting Your Current Business into an LLC

without having all of the different restrictions associated with being an S cor-
poration (see Chapter 2 for information on S corporations), then an LLC is
the right entity for you!
Before you begin the conversion process, or any major process for that
matter, you must have a shareholders’ meeting and make sure that you have
a quorum and the required vote of the shareholders before proceeding.
When you convert your corporation to an LLC, you need to amend your com-
pany’s business plan to account for the company’s new structure. Keep in
mind that the requirements to maintain an LLC are less than those of a corpo-
ration. All of the corporate formalities you have to go through with corpora-
tions, such as annual meetings, aren’t required for LLCs.
Considering the tax impact
Unfortunately, converting from a corporation to an LLC can be problematic.
Assuming that your state doesn’t allow a statutory conversion (a document
that you file with your Secretary of State’s office), you’ll need to liquidate and
dissolve your entire company in the process. (I go into more detail about this
in the “Navigating Through the Conversion” section.) This can lead to a
pretty huge tax burden.
You see, corporations are taxed at two levels — the corporate level and the
shareholder level. You’ll often hear this referred to as double taxation.
Because of the two levels of taxes, when you liquidate the company, first your
corporation will be forced to pay corporate taxes, then, as the money is dis-
tributed to the shareholders, the shareholders will be required to pay capital
gains tax — on both federal and state levels.
After the shareholders have the assets in their hands, they can invest the
money and/or the assets into the LLC in exchange for membership shares.
But by this time, I’d be surprised if they had half of their assets left after all
the double taxation headaches!
Looking at ways to minimize taxes
The first way that you may be able to save taxes when converting a corpora-
tion to an LLC is by forming a brand-new LLC and doing a standard merger. A
merger is when you combine two existing entities into one surviving one. All
states have laws regarding mergers, so you’ll have to research whether the
laws of your state allow two different entity types (a corporation and an LLC)
to merge into one with the LLC being the surviving entity. Some states pro-
vide no guidance at all, and in this case, your attorney is the best person to
direct you through the proper procedures. Merging your corporation into an
LLC is a great way to avoid sales and transfer taxes that are associated with
moving assets from one entity to another.
If you don’t want to go through the hassles of a merger, you may want to con-
sider keeping just your assets in your corporation. I am a firm believer in 
112
Part II: First Things First: Forming Your LLC

separating your company assets from your operating business anyway. That
way, if your operating business (in this case, your LLC) were to get sued, your
assets would be protected in a completely different entity.
For example, if you own a local pizza company and you want to convert your
corporation into an LLC, you would set up your new LLC, transfer your con-
tracts, and convert your business operations over to it. However, you would
leave your stoves and other equipment in the corporation. At the end of the
day, your corporation would become a leasing company and lease the equip-
ment to your operating LLC. This way, if one of your customers gets food poi-
soning and sues your company, your assets are protected in your old
corporation.
If your corporation is in a tax-free state, such as Nevada or Wyoming, you
may want to lease the assets to your operating LLC at a standard lease rate.
This way, that profit won’t be distributed to you at the end of the year and
subject to your personal income and self-employment taxes; it will be safely
sitting in a corporate bank account free from hefty state corporate taxes and
franchise fees. What a great way to save up to buy more assets and equipment!
Navigating Through the Conversion
So you’ve decided that converting your current entity to an LLC is the right
thing to do, and you’re ready to get started! The details of the conversion
differ slightly depending on which type of entity you’re converting from, but
for the most part you still have to do the same thing — form the LLC, create a
plan, and transfer the assets and contracts. I cover two conversion processes
in this section:
 The “liquidate and form” process: You have to liquidate your current
company, transfer the assets to the owners (if you are currently a limited
partnership or a corporation), then dissolve the old entity, form a brand-
new LLC, and transfer the assets from the owners into the new LLC.
 The statutory conversion: If this conversion is allowed in your state, I
recommend you go this route. With a statutory conversion, you can just
file a short document with your Secretary of State’s office that automati-
cally converts your current limited partnership or corporation into an
LLC. This option is not available for sole proprietorships and general
partnerships.
You know that old adage, “Don’t change horses midstream”? Remember it if
you’re considering changing your accounting methods. Upon the conversion,
keep your accounting method the same. For instance, if you are on a cash-
based system, don’t switch to an accrual-based system. In the IRS’s eyes, this
could “accelerate the income,” which means taxes, taxes, and more taxes! If
113
Chapter 7: Converting Your Current Business into an LLC

you really want to change your accounting method, wait until the conversion
has been completed, and then have your tax advisor assist you.
When your state doesn’t allow 
statutory conversions
You can find out whether your state allows statutory conversions by calling
your local Secretary of State’s office. I provide this information for you in
Appendix A. If your state doesn’t allow statutory conversions, you have to
take these steps:
 Form a brand new LLC. When you form your LLC, you need to do it just
as I describe in Chapters 6 and 8. Nothing fancy required.
 Check all of your loans for a “due on sale” clause that may become
effective upon the conversion. If you see this clause, you may be
required to pay your entire loan if you transfer it. This could force you to
refinance, and if the interest rates aren’t good, this can cost you a lot of
money in the long run. You can normally work with your bank to avoid
this scenario.
 Revise any contracts that your current entity is party to so the con-
tracts reflect your new entity name. In this case, you may want to work
with your attorney, because some of the people you are in contractual
arrangements with may see this as an opportunity to get you to renegoti-
ate the contract before transferring it.
 If you are currently operating as a sole proprietorship or general part-
nership, check whether your business name is available for use. If it’s
taken, you may have to form your LLC under another name and then file
a fictitious firm name statement (or DBA, which stands for “doing business
as”) at your county clerk’s office.
 If you have any current fictitious firm names, transfer them to your
new entity. The same goes for other intellectual property, such as trade-
marks, copyrights, and patents.
 Check to see if your insurance carrier requires a new premium after
the conversion takes place. Often, insurance isn’t transferable from one
entity to another, so you may run into some snags if you don’t find out
ahead of time.
 Check to see whether you must publish a notice of dissolution or con-
version in the local newspaper. Some states require that you give
notice to the public when you are doing a conversion. You can contact
your Secretary of State’s office or your registered agent to find out
whether this is required in your state.
114
Part II: First Things First: Forming Your LLC

If you have a sizeable amount of contracts and/or agreements (such as mort-
gages, employment contracts, lease agreements, loan documents, and license
agreements) that your business is a party to, you should collect all of them
and take them to your attorney. She can review each document and deter-
mine whether there are any dire consequences to a conversion. She can also
renegotiate any contracts that need to be replaced with your new entity. (A
word of caution: This may be a relatively costly process.)
When your state does allow 
statutory conversions
If you have a corporation or limited partnership, then you may be able to save
yourself a little bit of hassle and file a certificate of conversion at your Secretary
of State’s office (a process called statutory conversion). In most states, this cer-
tificate of conversion doesn’t do too much. It simply tells the world that your
business has converted. However, the assets, contracts, loans, and leases don’t
automatically transfer over. Unfortunately, you still need to do a lot of the dirty
work! The upside is that you have a valid reason for transferring your contracts
and loan documents to a new name and entity type.
To find out whether your state allows statutory conversions, simply call your
Secretary of State’s office and ask whether there is a filing you can do to con-
vert your limited partnership or corporation into an LLC (statutory conver-
sions don’t apply to sole proprietorships and general partnerships). If so, you
can either have your registered agent do the required work for you, or you
can normally download the forms off of the Secretary of State’s Web site (I
provide Web addresses for you in Appendix A).
Even when you are doing a statutory conversion, you’ll need to form your
LLC from scratch. In Chapters 6 and 8, I go into detail on how to create and
file your articles of organization. After those are filed, you have to do a
couple of things to complete the conversion.
In most states, such as Nevada, you file three things to convert your business
from a limited partnership or corporation to an LLC:
 Plan of conversion: You have to create this document because it lays
out exactly how everything will be moved from one entity to another,
what the new articles of organization are going to say, how the new
entity is going to be structured, and so on; however, only some states
require it to be submitted to the Secretary of State’s office. I recommend
that you involve your attorney in the process of creating your plan of
conversion.
115
Chapter 7: Converting Your Current Business into an LLC

 Articles of conversion: Normally, this is just one or two pages with
some basic information, such as the name and entity type of the old and
new entities, the updated company addresses, and the date that the con-
version is to be effective.
 Articles of organization: These are the articles that create your new
LLC. In Chapters 6 and 8, I go into detail on how to create and file these
articles. Go through the same process as you would for a regular LLC
and just include the articles of conversion and the plan of conversion.
All of these filings are relatively simple and intuitive. The most difficult docu-
ment is probably your plan of conversion because of the amount of detail
involved. The plan of conversion is not only legally required in most states
when doing a statutory conversion, but it’s also a good idea for you to have
one for the sake of having a blueprint to go by. As I’m sure you know, things
can get chaotic in business, and balls can be dropped. A plan of conversion
keeps everything on track so the conversion runs smoothly and without a
glitch, or even worse — a day of missed work!
These filings shouldn’t be too expensive. I suggest figuring in the cost of filing
the articles of organization (which is listed by state in Appendix A) plus a
couple hundred dollars.
When you are going through the conversion process, you must be diligent to
document everything. You can’t let anything slip through the cracks. Just con-
sider what would happen if you are sued and audited — are you comfortable
with how organized and thorough your records are?
What to Do After the Conversion
It’s official. Your business is a limited liability company. Congrats! So now
what happens? First, you must amend all your official documents — your
licenses, permits, and registrations — with your new name and entity type.
Even if you are using the same name as before, you must be careful never to
refer to your company without having “LLC,” “L.L.C.,” or “Limited Liability
Company” after the name. Most states legally require this anyway; however, if
you’re ever taken to court, you’ll be able to prove that you were operating as
an LLC when transacting business.
Some of the common licenses and permits that you’ll need to update or refile are:
 Your tax identification number
 Your state business registration/license
 Your sales tax permit
116
Part II: First Things First: Forming Your LLC

 Your DBA (fictitious firm name) filings
 Your city and/or county business license
 Any professional licenses or permits
After your official documents are amended, you must prepare a brand-new
operating agreement for your LLC. Don’t assume that you can use your cor-
porate bylaws or your current partnership agreement as your operating
agreement — you shouldn’t. Your new operating agreement can be adapted
from these agreements; however, you need a document that is specifically tai-
lored to your brand-new LLC. Go through the steps in Chapter 9 to create
your custom operating agreement.
Transferring your assets
After the LLC is set up, you must begin transferring the assets. As I describe
in the section “The Drawbacks of Conversion” earlier in this chapter, this can
be an expensive proposition in some cases — especially if you’re transferring
assets from a corporation where you may have to pay some pretty hefty
taxes on them once you take them into your possession. This entire process
can be taxing (literally!). Earlier in the chapter, under the “Looking at ways to
minimize taxes” section, I go into some ways that you can alleviate the tax
burden.
After the assets are out of the old company and in your hands personally, you
can invest those assets into the new LLC in exchange for membership shares.
LLCs make this process pretty easy. Contributing assets to an LLC is a tax-
free event, so you don’t have to worry about that. However, you should still
work with an accountant or attorney to help make sure the process goes
smoothly from beginning to end.
While you are going through the process of transferring assets and moving
operations from one entity to another, you should work closely with your tax
advisor and small-business attorney. Although you may find the suggestions
in this book useful, you need to coordinate the actual execution of the con-
version with a professional who knows your business.
Dissolving your old entity
After your new LLC is set up and all of the assets and contracts have been
transferred, you can begin winding up the affairs and dissolving your old
business structure.
In some states, before a partnership can be terminated, it must publish a notice
of termination in a local newspaper. This public notice may even be required
before the conversion can be effective. To find out whether this is the case in
your state, call your Secretary of State’s office. I put a list of contact information
for every state in Appendix A.
117
Chapter 7: Converting Your Current Business into an LLC

If your old entity was a limited partnership or corporation, then you must file
a certificate of dissolution (also called a certificate of cancellation) with the
Secretary of State’s office. This terminates your old entity in the eyes of the
state and keeps old ghosts, such as company creditors, from haunting you.
An officer, director, or member of the company must sign off on it, and it can
only be filed after all of the company’s owners approve. To make sure the dis-
solution is legal and thorough, you should be sure to hold a meeting, docu-
ment the meeting minutes, and have all owners sign the company resolution
to dissolve. In Chapter 11, I show you how to properly hold meetings and pre-
pare meeting minutes.
Before you can file a dissolution with the state, you must make sure that the
company is in good standing with the Secretary of State’s office and that no
fees are due. You must also make sure that the company has paid its taxes. If
the entity isn’t in good standing, it’s likely that the certificate of dissolution
will be rejected.
If your previous business structure was a sole proprietorship or general
partnership, then you don’t need to complete any special filings. You just
need to make sure that you don’t accidentally revert to your old ways and put
contracts, notes, correspondence, and debts in your own name.

Chapter 8
Making Your LLC Official: Filing
with the State
In This Chapter
 Filing your articles of organization with the state
 Applying for your state and local business licenses
 Obtaining permits for your business
F
iling your articles of organization with the Secretary of State can be an
exciting process. After you receive your file-stamped articles, that’s it,
you’re in business! You’ll most likely start thinking about all the things you
need to do to get your business up and running: marketing your business,
hiring employees, renting office space.
I know this time can be chaotic, but you need to take a couple of days and
make sure you start off on the right foot with the federal, state, and local gov-
ernments. You need to complete other applications and filings for things like
business licenses before you can begin operations. That’s what I discuss in
this chapter.
When it comes to filing your articles of organization (which I show you how
to do in the next couple of pages) and your applications for your various
licenses, the task may seem overwhelming at times — especially if you are in
a heavily regulated industry. But keep your chin up. If you stay organized and
use the last sections of this chapter to figure out what licenses you need, you
should be able to get all of your applications submitted within a couple of
days. After you submit everything correctly, you can sit back and wait for
your approvals to start rolling in.
Filing Your Articles
If you’re interested in the how-to’s of filing, then you’ve probably created
your articles of organization by now. Therefore, why wait? Let’s get ‘em filed!

120
Part II: First Things First: Forming Your LLC 
After all, your LLC can’t come into existence until it’s been approved by the
Secretary of State. Just think of the date that your articles of organization are
stamped with as your company’s official birth date. If you’re ever asked what
your date of organization is, you’ll refer to this date (called the formation
date) — not the date that you draft the articles, nor the date that you
received the filed articles in the mail. Along with your filed articles, you
should receive a company charter that shows the date of formation.
In the following sections, I go over the step-by-step process of filing your
articles of organization.
Until your articles of organization are actually filed at the Secretary of State’s
office and the formation date has been set, you and your partners are fully
liable for any business debts that arise before this time. It’s as if you are oper-
ating as a general partnership (see Chapter 2). If you get sued in this time and
lose, nothing stops the winner of the lawsuit from taking your home and emp-
tying your personal bank accounts.
Submitting the filing
So you have your prepared articles of organization in hand (see Chapter 6),
and now you’re ready to file them. Please, please take the time to do a bit of
research to make sure you file your articles properly. When you follow the
filing steps to the letter, you save yourself a lot of time and headaches later
because your filing won’t be rejected. From my personal experiences of work-
ing with Secretary of State’s offices, I can’t tell you how often they get filings
and have to reject them for silly reasons — the fee amount is incorrect or the
organizer only sent in one copy . . . . The list goes on and on.
To file your articles, the first thing you need to do is to go on your Secretary
of State’s Web site (I’ve provided the Web addresses for each state in
Appendix A) and determine a few things, such as
 What fees are required?
 Whom do you make the check out to?
 Can you pay with a credit card?
 Are you allowed to fax the copies in?
 How many copies are required?
 Where do you mail the documents to?
 Are any cover sheets required to be submitted with the articles?
After you’ve answered these questions and double-checked your filing
against the state’s filing procedures, you should make a copy of the articles

(for your own files), put a copy of the articles and anything else the state
requires in an envelope (Don’t forget to include the fee to the state! You can
view the filing fees in your particular state in Appendix A.), and mail them. I
always recommend sending your filing packet by a service that requires the
recipient to sign for the package.
Waiting (and waiting and waiting) 
on the approval process
You’re eager to put your business plan into action. Your first official day of
work with your new company is planned out in your head. And of course, the
one thing holding you up is the government.
After you’ve sent in your articles and payment, the Secretary of State’s office
can generally take as long as it wants to file your articles of organization.
Don’t be alarmed if six weeks later you still haven’t heard back. Some states,
such as California, can take up to three months if you file by mail.
In some cases, you can file the articles of organization in person and get
moved much further ahead in line. If you can’t file personally because you’re
in a different state, you can always have your registered agent do it for you.
(See Chapter 5 for details about registered agents.) For other ways to speed
up the approval process, see the next section.
After the Secretary of State’s office has approved your articles, you’ll receive
your file-stamped articles back in the mail. Attached to your filed articles, you’ll
normally receive a company charter. This one-page document shows the all-
important date of formation. The charter and the file-stamped articles of organi-
zation are your proof that your business is formed as an LLC in your state.
When you don’t want to hurry up and
wait: Fast-forwarding your filing
Some states will actually put your filing at the top of the pile! Depending on
the state, you may be able to expedite the processing of your articles of orga-
nization. Some states give you the option of getting your articles back within
48 hours, 24 hours, or even the same day!
When submitting expedited articles, you should label the outside of the enve-
lope with “Expedited Handling Required.” It’s also a good idea to put a sticky
note on your document that says the same thing.
121
Chapter 8: Making Your LLC Official: Filing with the State

Although this seems like a perfect scenario, beware that the fee for this quick
turnaround can range from an extra $10 to hundreds of dollars — call your
Secretary of State’s office or visit its Web site (listed in Appendix A) to find
out the exact cost. Also, keep in mind that if your articles of organization
aren’t perfect and are rejected as a result, you’re still required to pay the
expedited processing fee.
Dealing with a rejected filing
When you receive a large envelope from the Secretary of State’s office and you
open it, expecting to see your filed articles, but instead see a rejection-of-filing
notice, your heart will sink. It’s a bummer when your articles are rejected —
especially when you can’t wait to get your business up and rolling.
Although this can be a setback, don’t get too down about it. Nothing bad will
happen. You just need to fix the problem and resubmit your documents. The
rejection notice should tell you what the problem is. If the notice isn’t spe-
cific enough, call the number listed on the form for your Secretary of State’s
office and ask them for more information.
The worst part of a rejection is that a small error can be time consuming to
fix because you may need to wait at the end of the line. For instance, if your
documents took three weeks to be reviewed by a clerk the first time, then
after you resubmit them, they may go to the bottom of the pile, and you’ll
have to wait another three weeks to get them looked at. (Of course, you can
always take the expedited route if your state offers it. See the previous sec-
tion for the skinny on this.)
The Secretary of State may reject a filing for any number of reasons. Here are
a few mistakes applicants make and how you can avoid them:
 The name you want to use conflicts with another LLC (or other entity)
that is formed in that state, or a name that has been reserved. In this
case, you just need to choose a new name. If you don’t want to do that,
you can contact the competing firm and try to get a letter from them
giving you permission to use their name, but this is usually a long shot.
 The name is considered misleading. The name may have forbidden
words, such as “banking,” “financial,” and so on. You can do two things
in this situation:
• You can go to the department in your state that regulates that
industry and get approval for the wording from them. (You’ll prob-
ably have to jump through a lot of hoops.)
• You can change your company’s name.
122
Part II: First Things First: Forming Your LLC 

 Your filing fees could be incorrect. In this case, just write a check for the
additional filing fees and resubmit your documents. Or, if the state returned
your old check to you, void it and send a new one for the correct amount.
 You may not have specified a registered agent. This is a common error.
Often when individuals form an LLC, they don’t know what a registered
agent is or does, so they leave this section blank. But you won’t have
this problem because you can read Chapter 5 for more information on
these folks and then fill in the appropriate section on the form.
 A provision is missing. In this case, you most likely prepared the docu-
ments yourself, and you missed a provision (a section of the document
that deals with a particular topic) that is legally required to be in the
articles of organization. In this case, just add the provision to your arti-
cles (you can create a fresh draft so they look nice) and resubmit them.
 You are missing a cover sheet. Some states require cover sheets to be
submitted with the articles. In this case, obtain the cover sheet from the
Secretary of State’s Web site, fill it out, and resubmit your articles with
the cover sheet.
Filing Your Initial Report and 
Other Legal Requirements
So, you thought that you’d just file your articles of organization and you’d be
finished, right? Not so fast. You aren’t quite in the clear yet. After you file
your articles, you have to do a couple of things to make sure you remain in
compliance with the Secretary of State’s office. I give you the rundown in the
following sections.
Although this may seem like a trivial thing, if you don’t file your initial report,
your LLC could go into a revoked status relatively quickly. Often, the state doesn’t
even tell you that your company has been revoked; you may not even find out
until you’ve been sued and realize that you don’t have the LLC protection that
you thought you had!
Starting with your initial report
In addition to filing your articles of organization, most states require you to file
an initial report, also called an “initial list of managers or members” or an
“information statement.” Depending on the state, the initial report lists
information such as
123
Chapter 8: Making Your LLC Official: Filing with the State

 The names of your managers and their addresses
 The name of your registered agent and your registered office address
 The members who own the LLC
Keep in mind that whatever you include on your initial report is public record,
which means that anyone in the world can see it.
You’ll most likely have to file this report annually or biannually, depending on
the state. These subsequent reports are normally called annual reports.
The fees for the initial reports can be hefty — sometimes as much as the fee
for filing the articles of organization. Also, unlike the articles of organization,
where there can be a separate organizer (a person who files your articles but
otherwise has nothing else to do with your company), a manager or member
of the LLC needs to sign the initial report.
124

Filing public announcements 
in Arizona and New York
Two states — Arizona and New York — require
you to file a public announcement of your arti-
cles of organization in a newspaper or other
daily or weekly publication.
If you’re setting up an LLC in Arizona, follow
these steps to file the public announcement:
1. After filing your articles of organization
with the Arizona Corporation Commission,
you must publish the entire text of your arti-
cles in a newspaper of your choice (as long
as the periodical is published at least
weekly and has at least 5,000 or so sub-
scribers) for three consecutive days within
60 days of your filing date.
2. File your affidavit of publication, given to
you by the newspaper, with the commis-
sion within 60 days.
The affidavit of publication tells the state
that you submitted your articles for print.
3. Your LLC goes into effect only after the affi-
davit of publication has been filed.
If you’re setting up an LLC in New York, follow
these steps for the public announcement:
1. After filing your articles of organization
with the New York Department of State,
your articles must be published in two sep-
arate newspapers once per week for six
consecutive weeks.
Your county clerk’s office will choose the
newspapers that your articles will be
published in.
2. After publication, the newspapers will give
you a signed affidavit of publication.
3. File the affidavit with the department of
state within 120 days of the LLC’s filing date.

So, do you need to file an updated report and pay a filing fee whenever the
information changes? Not really. In most states, you’re only required to file
the report on its due date (normally on the anniversary of the LLC’s filing
date). Not only does this save fees, but it’s also a good way for LLCs to pro-
tect their owners’ privacy. You see, if an LLC lists certain members during the
time that the annual report is filed, it can add or change the original members
of the company after the report has been filed (see Chapter 10 to learn how
to transfer membership interests). No other report needs to be filed until the
next annual or biannual due date. For more information on annual reports,
see Chapter 11.
Business licenses: A necessary evil
Most states require that all businesses apply for a standard business license.
This is the “letter of approval,” so to speak, that you need to legally conduct
business within the state. The state tax board uses the licenses to keep track
of all enterprises that are responsible for paying state and sales or use taxes.
Believe it or not, in addition to the state license, you may also be required to
file for a city and/or county license, depending on where you live. If your busi-
ness is located within city limits, you need to obtain a license from the city; if
outside, you must obtain your license from the county. Depending on where
you live, you should contact your county clerk’s office or the city’s business
license department and ask which local licenses and permits you need to
obtain. Keep in mind that you’ll most likely be required to pay an annual fee.
When it comes to business licenses, each state is somewhat different as far
as what details it wants. Normally, you can expect a business license to
request such information as
 Business name
 Business address
 Type of ownership
 Kind of business
 Formation date
 Federal tax identification number (see the section by the same name
later in this chapter)
 Business activities
 Expected income
 Names and addresses of managers/members
125
Chapter 8: Making Your LLC Official: Filing with the State

To find out where to obtain the business license application and where your
application must be filed, check the Secretary of State’s Web site for the state
you filed in.
If the ownership of your business changes, most states require that the new
owners apply for a new business license under their name, even if the busi-
ness name stays the same. Moving your business to a new address also usu-
ally requires a new business license application. Essentially, you just refile
the form with the updated information. If a change doesn’t significantly alter
the structure of the business (such as adding or dropping a member who
only owns a small percentage of the LLC), you normally don’t have to file a
new application. However, some states require you to submit a letter to the
business license department describing the change that took place. The
department uses the information to update your business license.
Applying for a sales and use tax permit
If you’re selling tangible items, then you’re required to collect sales tax from
your customers and then pay the government. What is a tangible good?
Although the definition may vary slightly between states, you can pretty
much classify a tangible good as being any item that may be seen, weighed,
measured, felt, or touched, or is in any other manner perceptible to the
senses. Real estate is excluded.
What if you aren’t selling tangible goods? What if you run a dry-cleaning ser-
vice or a dog-grooming facility? Aren’t you in the clear? Well, in some states,
you are. Unfortunately, in many states, you are still most likely required to go
through the process of obtaining a sales and use tax permit.
The board of equalization directs pretty much all small businesses to apply
for a sales and use tax permit. You see, state governments prefer that individ-
uals aren’t the ones deciding whether they are liable for paying sales and use
tax. The government prefers that a seasoned tax collector take over the job.
Most states call the department that collects the state taxes the board of
equalization. (I have no idea what that means or why they decided to use
such a dumb name — I suspect they decided that “the board of tax collec-
tors” didn’t sound so friendly. All I know is that a lot of people pay this
department a hefty chunk of dough every quarter.)
To collect sales tax on the products you sell to your customers, you need a
sales and use tax permit. What’s the difference between sales tax and use
tax? I’ll explain.
 Sales tax is imposed on all retailers (anyone who sells tangible goods —
not services — in the state). Retailers are required to pay and report sales
126
Part II: First Things First: Forming Your LLC 

taxes to the board of equalization, and they have the option of collecting
sales tax reimbursement from their customers at the time of the sale.
 Use tax is imposed on you when you purchase something from out-of-
state vendors and use, consume, or store the item in the state. Use tax
also applies if you lease the item. Ha! And you thought you were avoiding
tax when you bought that fancy TV off of eBay.
You are normally imposed a statewide sales tax and a local sales tax that dif-
fers from city to city. If your business isn’t located in an incorporated city,
then you’ll be required to pay the county at its local tax rate. By combining
the state and local tax rates, you come up with the amount of sales tax you
can charge your customers.
Although applying for the state sales and use tax permit can seem like a
hassle, especially if you’re a service-based organization, I urge you not to fall
short on your obligation. Apply once, and then file your annual sales and use
tax reports right and file on time. If you can’t do it, pay your accountant or
incorporating company to do it. Just make sure it gets done.
Trust me, you don’t want to go through the harrowing experience of having a
state tax auditor set up shop in your office for two weeks so he can pore over
each and every income and expenditure record, tallying up use tax on sticky
notes you bought online and sales tax on small thank-you items you shipped
to your clients. Not only will the auditor pull every single penny of unpaid
taxes out of the woodwork, but the state will impose hefty fines on top of it
all. Needless to say, not fun.
Special licensing requirements
If you are one of the lucky ones who decided to set up shop in a heavily regu-
lated industry, such as health care, gambling, auto repair, or the law, then
you’re probably going to be required to obtain special licensing. If you own
your own building, you have to comply with building codes and obtain spe-
cial permits. If you deal with any sort of food products, then health-code reg-
ulations come into play. Now that I think about it . . . if you’re in business at
all, you should read this section. I’m sure you’ll find one thing or another that
applies to you!
In the following pages, I go over some common special licenses that you may
have to obtain. All states are different, though, and I can’t possibly list every
single license required in every single state! Before starting business operations,
you should give your state’s licensing bureau a call. They should be able to
point you in the right direction!
127
Chapter 8: Making Your LLC Official: Filing with the State

In most states, because you’ll be filing so many documents with so many
different state and local agencies, you’ll be assigned a nine-digit UBI (Universal
Business Identifier) number upon filing your state business license. This is so all
state and local agencies can easily identify you. You use this number on all of
your state and local filings. A UBI number is sometimes called a “tax registration
number,” a “business registration number,” or a “business license number.”
State-issued licenses
In addition to the basic licenses required for most businesses, you may be
required to file for other licenses, depending on your state. Here are a few
that you may be required to apply for:
 Licenses based on type of product sold: Most states require you to
obtain a license if you’re selling certain products, such as liquor,
tobacco, lottery tickets, gasoline, and firearms. These licenses can be
hard to obtain and are often heavily regulated.
 Professional/occupational licenses: If you (and/or your employees) will
be offering services in a specialized area that requires certain skills or
training, then you, personally, and each of your employees performing
that service will be required to obtain a specific license before opening
shop. Some occupations that often require licensing are
• Medical care — doctors, dentists, and so on
• Auto repair
• Real estate sales
• Contractors
• Cosmetology
• Tax services
• Legal representation/attorneys
 Licenses for other regulated businesses: Every state has industries they
like to control. These vary widely from state to state, which is one
reason for you to do your research. Some industries that may require
additional licensing include: jewelry manufacturing and sales, furniture
sales, automobile repairs, carnival operators, tree trimmers, motorcycle
sales, auto towing, dating services, swimming pool services, janitorial
services, taxicabs, movie and television productions, dance clubs, and
adult entertainment-related businesses.
Locally issued permits
Some licenses aren’t regulated by the state, but instead are issued by the
local government, such as your city or your county. Here are a few licenses to
be on the lookout for:
128
Part II: First Things First: Forming Your LLC 

 Fire department permits: For those businesses that attract a large
number of customers, such as nightclubs, bars, and restaurants, the fire
department must conclude that the location is clear of any fire and
safety hazards.
 Health department permits: These permits are most often required for
businesses that prepare and/or sell food, or any other business where
the health of the general public is a primary concern.
 Property use permits: If you start a business that involves manufactur-
ing, or if you decide to operate a retail-type business out of your home,
depending on your location, you may need to obtain a land-use permit
from your city or county’s zoning department that says you can use the
land for something other than residential purposes.
 Building permits: If you’re constructing a new building or expanding or
renovating an existing building, you will need to obtain a building permit
from the city or county. Getting a building permit can take years, and you
probably will have to submit a detailed set of plans to the department and
work with your builder to gain approval.
 Zoning permit: Some cities require that all new businesses get a zoning
compliance permit before they open. This proves that you aren’t operat-
ing a business out of a location that is zoned for residential use only.
Some locales are even more complicated. For instance, you may only
operate a retail store out of a property that is zoned specifically for retail.
 Home occupation permit: If your business is home-based, you may be
required to obtain this permit when you file for your business license. It
allows the state to keep track of which employees are working in what
type of environment and whether your family members are involved in
the business.
 Use and occupancy permit: In most states, when you apply for your
business license, you must also apply for a use and occupancy permit
from the building department (or equivalent in your state). This nor-
mally results in the building inspector (and possibly the fire inspector)
visiting your business location to get an idea of what sort of conditions
employees will be working under. This person looks out for the interests
of the people working at the location and checks for things such as fire
hazards, life safety issues, code compliance, building permits, zoning
issues, and so on.
Federally issued licenses
If you are in a heavily regulated industry, then a federal license in your area of
expertise may be required. This lets the public know that not only do you
know your stuff, but you are also a reputable company operating under the
watchful eye of the government. Here are some industries that are required
to operate under special federal-issued licenses:
129
Chapter 8: Making Your LLC Official: Filing with the State

 Selling securities or providing investment advice: You are required to
be licensed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (www.sec.
gov). If you are only selling securities (your membership shares in
exchange for capital investment) and are looking for a small number of
investors, you may be exempt. See Chapter 10 for more information on
registration exemptions.
 Interstate trucking or any other form of interstate transportation: You
are required to be licensed by the U.S. Department of Transportation
(www.dot.gov).
 Preparation of meat products or other food stuffs: You are required to
be licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (www.fda.gov).
 Manufacturing of tobacco, alcohol, or firearms, or the selling of
firearms: You are required to be licensed by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, and Firearms (www.atf.gov).
 Radio or television broadcasting: You are required to be licensed by the
Federal Communications Commission (www.fcc.gov).
 Manufacturing, testing, and/or selling of drugs: You are required to be
licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (www.fda.gov).
If you require federal licensing before being allowed to open your business,
consider having your small-business attorney guide you through the applica-
tion process. The applications can often be lengthy, and you’ll want to make
sure you do everything correctly because whether you are approved or not
can make or break your business.
Other pertinent requirements
Ha! And you thought you were finished! You’re dealing with the government
here, remember? Between the federal, state, city, and country requirements,
the paperwork is never-ending. Regardless, there are two more things that all
businesses must handle. The first is your federal tax identification number —
you won’t get very far without it! Second is your workers’ compensation
insurance — don’t even think about hiring employees until this is taken care of.
Federal tax identification number
All businesses must obtain an employer identification number (“EIN” for short,
but also called a “tax identification number,” or “tax ID” for short) from the
Internal Revenue Service. The IRS uses this number to identify your LLC when
it pays its taxes. Over the years, the EIN has become an important number for
the government, financial institutions, and other businesses to identify different
entities. After all, an LLC in Georgia can have the same name as your LLC in
California — how would Uncle Sam be able to tell them apart? Think of it as a
sort of Social Security number for your enterprise.
130
Part II: First Things First: Forming Your LLC 

Some attorneys, accountants, and incorporating companies may charge you
an arm and a leg to obtain this number for you, but you’re smarter than that.
Forget paying anyone! You can obtain an EIN immediately online at www.irs.
gov. Do it now! It will be virtually impossible to obtain credit, pay taxes, or
even open a bank account without one.
Workers’ compensation insurance
Workers’ compensation insurance is required of any business that has employees.
Workers’ compensation insurance protects employees in the event that they
get injured on the job and can’t work or have medical expenses that need to be
paid. This insurance is provided by private insurance companies but is required
by law for each employee who works for you.
Filings for LLCs Operating 
in Multiple States
When you’re operating in multiple states, you’ll probably be required to go
through the same filing process for each and every state you are doing busi-
ness in. If you don’t have a physical location in that state, some filings may
not be required, such as building permits; however, others, such as initial
reports and business licenses, are still necessary. If you aren’t sure about the
requirements of transacting business in multiple states, read Chapter 5.
Because all of these filings can be extremely time consuming when you’re
operating in multiple jurisdictions that you aren’t familiar with, I recommend
that you have your registered agent in those states handle these filings for
you. (For more about registered agents, see Chapter 5.)
Submitting several initial reports
In all states in which you foreign file (registering to do business in states
besides the one in which your LLC was formed), you need to file an initial
report. You need to make sure that the information you submit in one state
on your initial report is the same information that you submit in another
state. When you’re doing so many filings in other states, sometimes it is hard
to remember that your LLC is still only one entity with one set of members
and one federal tax identification number.
131
Chapter 8: Making Your LLC Official: Filing with the State

Obtaining multiple business licenses
If you are foreign filed in multiple states, you need to apply for your state and
local business licenses. Determine what your local jurisdiction is (your city or
county) by whatever your corporate office address is in that state. If you’re
using your registered agent’s address as your corporate office address, then
you’ll use that zip code to find what local agency you’ll need to register with.
Your registered agent should have this information for you.
If you’re selling tangible goods and will be paying sales tax, you definitely
need to open up a separate bank account for that state. Keep your sales
receipts for each state separate so you know which state to pay sales tax to.

Part III
Running Your
Brand-New LLC

In this part . . .
A
fter your entity is formed, you get into the real 
meat-and-potatoes stuff — namely, how to run your
LLC. First and foremost, you’ll have to create an operating
agreement, which I show you how to do in Chapter 9. Your
operating agreement is the backbone of your business, so
it’s important not to skip this chapter.
Then, in Chapter 10, you’ll discover everything you need
to know about the ownership of your company — called
membership. Before you know it, you’ll be printing off mem-
bership certificates, raising capital for business operations,
and arranging hostile takeovers. Whoa! Hold your horses,
Warren Buffett — I was just kidding about that last one!
In Chapter 11, I get into how to keep your company
records so your LLC stays in good standing with your
members, the government, and your customers. Then, in
Chapter 12, I address the sad eventuality that nothing
gold stays and explain what to do when you gotta close up
shop and dissolve your LLC.

Chapter 9
ABCs of Setting Up Your 
Operating Agreement
In This Chapter
 Knowing the ins and outs of the operating agreement
 Customizing your operating agreement
 Creating the finished product
Y
our operating agreement is the backbone of your business. It governs
how you decide your company’s important issues and how you manage
your business’s internal affairs. Should a cataclysmic event happen, such as
the passing of one of your partners, you (and the courts!) will look to your
operating agreement for guidance.
Like partnership agreements or corporate bylaws, your operating agreement
is your organization’s blueprint. Just think of your business as a house, and
your operating agreement as the framing. It is a governing constitution, of
sorts, for your LLC. It puts all of the managers and members on the same
page in regard to how the company is to operate. The document itself doesn’t
have to be too long or drawn out — it simply delineates the relationships
between the LLC and its members, managers, and the public (its customers).
You can easily customize your operating agreement by choosing different
provisions that fit your business and wrap them all up in the format that I
provide for you in this chapter.
What is an Operating Agreement?
Ever want to make up your own laws? Just disregard the ones that the gov-
ernment imposes on you and decide how you want to behave? I know it
sounds too good to be true, but believe it or not, LLCs make that a possibility.
You may never have gone to law school, but now you can single-handedly
operate as the legislative branch of your own LLC. You see, LLCs are often

136
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 
allowed to use their operating agreement to “replace” state LLC law. For the
most part, if you place something in your operating agreement that contradicts
your state’s LLC statutes, your operating agreement will almost always win in
the event of a lawsuit or disagreement among members.
Although the articles of organization can be created pretty easily on your
own (see Chapter 6), I encourage you to involve your small-business attorney
in the process of creating your operating agreement. I provide most of the
provisions (various sections of the agreement that deal with specific topics)
in this chapter and even show you how to put your operating agreement
together, but you may need some legal guidance regarding which provisions
to include and how to structure your LLC. If anything, an attorney can pro-
vide a sounding board in your negotiations with your partners and, with his
opinion, may make the process easier and less argumentative. Just make sure
that your attorney is well versed in LLC state and case law, and that he does-
n’t make the document so complicated and dense that you and your partners
can’t easily understand it.
LLC operating agreements aren’t required by most states, but if you ask me,
you’d be a fool not to have one. After all, would you really want all of your
partners, managers, and employees making up their own rules as they go
along, without any preapproved structure and rules to abide by? See “Why
have an operating agreement?” later in this chapter.
Examining what the operating 
agreement governs
Operating agreements generally don’t get into specific issues such as minor
employment matters and the day-to-day business operations (with the excep-
tion of major decisions and/or purchases). You won’t look at your operating
agreement to see what sort of commission structure you should impose on
your new sales reps. Nor should you look at your operating agreement to tell
you what credit terms or payment plans you can give to your clients.
Your operating agreement covers the bigger issues, such as large purchases,
the decisions to take on debt, profit and loss distributions, selling membership
shares, and assignment of duties. It paints the big picture as to how your entity
is to operate. If you are a small business, creating an operating agreement may
seem like overkill now, but it’s necessary. As you grow, you’ll need guidance,
and you should be able to turn to your operating agreement. If you and your
partners negotiate and decide on everything in the beginning, then you’ll most
likely experience less chaos and fewer disagreements when your company
hangs in the balance.

Assigning manager titles and duties
Regardless of whether your LLC is manager-managed or member-managed,
some managers will still need guidance. Forming your operating agreement is
the perfect time for you and your partners to sit down and delineate all of the
specific roles and titles that each manager will take on. For instance, one
manager may be great at numbers and will take on the role of chief financial
officer, while another manager may have a solid vision of the company and is
the person to lead the others on the path to success — this person can be
named president or chief executive officer.
Keep in mind that while managers are legally called “managers” by the state,
they can have whatever titles they want. So don’t think you’re missing out on
the title of president or CEO if you’re forming an LLC!
Outlining members’ rights
After you have laid down the law as far as managers are concerned, what about
the members? Members have responsibilities also, and your operating
agreement needs to specify their roles in the company. With LLCs, you can
create your own rules, and, if you choose, you can limit or expand your members’
powers.
LLCs can have different classes of membership, so all members don’t have to
be treated the same. Some members can get voting rights, while other members
have to remain silent on all issues. Some members can also be managers and
take charge of the company’s day-to-day issues, while others can only watch
from afar.
Also, don’t forget that members have certain powers that are inherent to
owning the company, such as deciding who manages the LLC and whether to
accept new members. You can also make the issuance of membership shares
to a certain member contingent upon the member fulfilling his duties.
Why have an operating agreement?
Although an operating agreement is optional and not required by law, you
should never run your company without one. With all of the paperwork you
already have to deal with, I know it’s tempting to write this off, but don’t. If
you ever go to court, all of your documentation will be revealed, and the
judge will likely look to your company’s operating agreement for guidance in
the event of a dispute. If you don’t have an operating agreement, you leave
yourself open to being judged by your state’s statutes — which you have no
control over — and you probably won’t like the outcome. You want your LLC
to be governed by your rules, not those created by a state legislator who has
no interest in your business or, most likely, business in general.
137
Chapter 9: ABCs of Setting Up Your Operating Agreement

The easiest way for me to convince you of the necessity of an operating
agreement is to describe what it would be like without one. Here are a couple
of scenarios of what could happen if you face problems in your business sans
The Agreement:
 One of your members passes away, and his family wants to step in and
take control of your business. Without an operating agreement with a
provision protecting the surviving partners, you could end up losing
everything that you have worked so hard for to a partner’s relative who
knows nothing about your industry.
 You and your partner, each owning half of the company, decide to give
your partner’s assistant 2 percent of the company for her loyalty and
service. One day you come back from vacation to find that the company
has been liquidated and dissolved in your absence. When you go to your
attorney to see what can be done, you find out that because your LLC
had no operating agreement that stated that all members need to agree
for dissolution to occur, state law prevailed. Unfortunately for you, your
state law says that a company can be dissolved with only a majority of
the members agreeing. Your partner and his assistant outvoted you
while you were away.
Although oral agreements may hold up in most states, I wouldn’t rely on them
in lieu of a written operating agreement. Oral agreements are not only subject
to different interpretations by the members, but are often taken with a grain of
salt by the court system. In other words, if two members disagree, the so-
called “agreement” can be completely disregarded in the event of a lawsuit.
Operating agreements for 
single-member LLCs
Is your LLC a single-member LLC that is owned only by you? Although it may
go against common logic that you need an operating agreement — after all,
why would you need to create your own rules just for yourself? — it’s even
more imperative that you, the single-member LLC owner, have one. If you are
ever taken to court, your operating agreement will ensure that your personal
veil of limited liability (see Chapter 11 for more on the veil of limited liability)
remains intact.
You see, a one-person LLC looks a lot like a sole proprietorship; therefore, any-
thing you can do to look and act like an LLC (or even a corporation, for that
matter) will prevent the courts from deciding that you are liable for the lawsuit
as a sole proprietor would be. In other words, you want every piece of proof
you can get that establishes your LLC as being a completely separate entity.
138
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

Establishing Your Provisions
You pretty much have all the freedom in the world when creating your LLC;
you just have to state what you want in the operating agreement. Your oper-
ating agreement is composed of different parts, which are called provisions.
Each provision deals with a different topic relating to your company, such as
how it is managed or how new members are admitted.
Unfortunately, people are often intimidated by all of the legalese, so they don’t
create the agreement for fear of saying something wrong or using incorrect
terminology. If you feel this way, just remember that something is better than
nothing. The agreement doesn’t have to be perfect — just do your best. And,
don’t forget, you can always ask your small-business attorney for guidance.
To make things easy for you, this section includes some provisions that you
can use when creating your operating agreement. For the most part, you can
pick and choose which ones you want. First, I give you a good outline for the
operating agreement, and then I follow with sections containing some details
about parts of the outline. Again, you can pick and choose (as well as change!)
the provisions in the document so they apply to your business. Here’s your
outline:
139
Chapter 9: ABCs of Setting Up Your Operating Agreement
Making up the rules as you go can be bad
Imagine a game of Monopoly where all of the
players played by their own rules. It wouldn’t
take long before chaos would ensue. Some
players would be dishing themselves cash
every time they roll the dice; others might send
the other players to jail as they pass them on the
board. When the time came for the players to
justify their behavior, they would all say the
same thing: “There are no rules, so shut your
trap.” or “Whaddya gonna do about it?!” or
“Make me!” or . . . well, you get the picture.
But the business world isn’t a game of
Monopoly — there are consequences. If all the
partners were to run around doing whatever
they felt like doing without getting proper
approval from the other partners, it could spell
the end of your business. Yes, you could try to
settle everything in court, but without a written
operating agreement, the plaintiff could say that
there was a verbal agreement. In that case, the
judge has to decide who’s right and who’s
wrong, and it could be very hard to tell which
way the wind will blow. So, you gotta ask your-
self — why go through that hassle?
After you and your partners agree on and adopt
an operating agreement, everyone knows
where their boundaries are. And when issues
pop up, you have a guideline on how to deal
with the situation. You can rest assured that
your business is safe from all kinds of internal
disputes that can land you in court.

Organization
You might as well just copy and paste the text from your articles of organization
(see Chapter 6) and put it in this section of your operating agreement because,
for the most part, that’s all it is. The Organization section just reviews the
items you already decided on in the articles of organization. You see, your
articles were most likely signed and submitted by an organizer who, for the
most part, has no actual involvement in your business. By placing this infor-
mation in your operating agreement, you tell the world that all members and
managers of the LLC are in full agreement with the terms outlined in the arti-
cles of organization that were filed with the state.
In this section, you should include such provisions as the name of your LLC
(under the subheading “Name”), your LLC’s main office address (under the
subheading “Principle Office”), the state in which your LLC was formed in
and whose laws your LLC will abide by (under the subheading “Governing
Law”), how long your LLC is to remain in existence (under the subheading
“Term”), the name and address of your registered agent in all states your LLC
is transacting business in (under the subheading “Registered Agent and
Office”), and, lastly, the purposes for which your LLC was formed (under the
subheading “Purpose of the Company”). Of course, all operating agreements
are different and these subheadings are interchangeable, so feel free to
arrange your information however you like — as long as it’s there!
View the sample operating agreement on the CD to see how the Organization
section is laid out.
Membership Interests
It’s mandatory for your LLC to have one or more members. Members are the
owners of the company. An LLC without members is like a child without 
parents — it just doesn’t work! Your members are usually the ones who
invested their money or time in the business in the first place because they
believed in the idea. When a lot of people have a lot at stake, emotions are
bound to get involved, and people tend to act irrationally. That’s why you
141
Chapter 9: ABCs of Setting Up Your Operating Agreement

need to create some guidelines from the get-go that clearly delineate what
each member’s responsibilities are and what they can and cannot do.
Also, many situations come up that can be fatal to the business if they aren’t
dealt with properly. These also need to be addressed in the operating agree-
ment so that there is a contingency plan that allows the business to not just
stay afloat, but also prosper. A few questions that need to be addressed in
this section are:
 How can a member sell or transfer his membership shares?
 What happens when a member gets divorced, passes away, or goes
bankrupt?
 What happens when a member wants to retire?
 How can the company take on more members, if needed?
 How can the company expel members?
 What sort of contributions are allowed?
 Are there multiple types of members?
In the next few sections, I dive into some of these provisions in more detail. I
only address the provisions that are important to customize to your organiza-
tion and leave the rest for you to copy from the operating agreement I have
provided for you on the accompanying CD.
Normally, with other types of partnerships, the document that covers part-
nership interests and shares is called a buy-sell agreement. However, with
LLCs, the buy-sell agreement is normally incorporated into the operating
agreement. If you have many different rules and provisions for many different
members, such as who can transfer membership shares and how, then you
should create a separate buy-sell agreement for each member and have him
sign it (Chapter 10 has more details on drafting buy-sell agreements). After
all, no one says there needs to be one solution for everybody!
Initial Members of the Company
Unlike corporations, where the shares are completely transferable and the
shareholders change often, LLCs generally keep the same members that they
have from the start. Because of this, you can list the initial member informa-
tion in the operating agreement. If your LLC has a lot of members, you may
want to list them on a separate piece of paper and refer to it as Addendum A.
Here’s the information you should include for each member:
 Their full name
 Their home address
142
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

 The type of contribution they made (cash, equipment, services, and so
on) and its value
 Membership shares or percentage of the company that was issued to them
 What class of membership shares they were issued (if your operating
agreement allows for multiple classes, as shown in the “Membership
Classifications” section)
You may also want to have each member sign next to her name. This shows
that they concur with the information stated in the operating agreement.
Percentage of Ownership
When discussing how much of an LLC you own, you generally specify what
percentage of the company your shares represent. For instance, if you have
ten shares and the sum of all of the members’ shares (including yours) is 100,
then you can safely say that you own 10 percent of the company. Even if your
shares are nonvoting and everyone else’s are voting (see the next section),
you still own 10 percent. Here’s a sample provision you can use:
A member’s ownership of the Company is the total of his Voting Shares and
Nonvoting Shares, together with all of the rights that arise from the ownership
of such shares. The Percentage of Ownership (“Ownership Percentage”)
shall be calculated by adding together that Member’s membership shares
(Voting and Nonvoting) and then dividing this sum by the total of all of the
Members’ membership shares (Voting and Nonvoting).
Membership Classifications
LLCs are flexible in that you can give your members as few or as many powers
and responsibilities as you want. And all members don’t have to be equal! You
can classify membership shares by the powers and responsibilities associated
with them. One common method (the one that I have outlined in the sample
operating agreement) is to have one classification of shares that is voting and
one classification that is nonvoting. If you only intend to issue one type in the
beginning, but you want the option of issuing the other type of shares in the
future, then you can specify this by using the different phrases “The company
shall issue . . .” and “The company may issue . . .”
Here are a few sample provisions you can use:
The Company shall issue Class A Voting Membership Shares (“Voting Shares”)
to the members who vote (the “Voting Members”). The Voting Members shall
have the right to vote on all company matters, as outlined in this Agreement.
The Company may issue Class B Nonvoting Membership Shares (“Nonvoting
Shares”). Nonvoting Shares hold no voting rights whatsoever, and members
who only own Nonvoting Shares will have no right to vote on any matters.
Members may hold both Voting Shares and Nonvoting Shares.
143
Chapter 9: ABCs of Setting Up Your Operating Agreement

Management by Voting Members
Some businesses have two kinds of partners: operating partners, who manage
the day-to-day affairs, and silent partners, who keep their noses out of the daily
goings-on. If this is how you’ve structured your LLC, with only one group of
your members doing the managing, do you really want your silent, nonvoting
members to be muddling in your daily operations? Not likely.
First, you need to make sure that your LLC is manager-managed (because not
all members will have equal say in the management), and then set up two
classes of shares. Remember, you can set this up however you want. For this
example, I’ve used voting and nonvoting classes. Then you state that one
class shall have full management rights and shall be managers, while the
other class has no management rights at all. Here’s an example of some provi-
sions that you can draw from:
The Voting Members shall manage the Company. In their capacity as
Managers, they shall have the right to make decisions and vote upon all
matters as specified in this Agreement, in proportion to their respective
Ownership Percentage of the Company. Voting Members need not identify
whether or not they are acting as a Member or a Manager when they take
action.
Nonvoting Members have no right to participate in the management of the
Company, nor vote on any matters of the Company. No Nonvoting Member
shall take any action or enter into any contract or obligation on behalf of the
Company without the prior written consent of all of the Voting Members.
Likewise, no Nonvoting Member shall perform any act that is in any way
pertaining to the Company or its assets.
New Members
As your company grows, you probably will want to take on new partners.
When and how you add these folks is an important element of the operating
agreement that you should decide on at the LLC’s conception. This section
doesn’t have to be lengthy, but the provision’s wording will be determined by
what you and your partners decide.
You may want to consider the following points when drafting this section of
your operating agreement:
 Will new members have to make a contribution of any sort? If so, what
types of contributions are acceptable?
 How do you determine the value of the shares of the company? This is
important to figure out, considering that your company’s value may have
appreciated since inception. If your company is worth, say, $2 million,
you don’t want to take on a 50 percent partner with only a $100,000
contribution.
144
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

 Will the new member be required to sign a copy of the current operating
agreement, wherein she agrees to be bound by its terms?
 Does the current members’ vote have to be unanimous to admit a new
member with full voting privileges, or is a majority vote enough?
Here’s a sample provision you can use:
The Voting Members may issue additional Voting Capital or Nonvoting
Capital and thereby admit a new Member or Members, as the case may be,
to the Company, only if such new Member (a) is approved unanimously by
the Voting Members; (b) delivers to the Company his required capital contri-
bution; and (c) agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement
by becoming a party hereto.
Upon the admission of a new Member to the Company, the capital accounts
of all Members, and the calculations that are based on the capital accounts,
shall be adjusted appropriately.
Liability of Members
Although state law normally provides a default liability protection for the
LLC’s members, it’s always good to throw in a provision that calls for it
anyway. It doesn’t have to be anything too lengthy. Here’s an example of a
limited liability provision that you can use:
No Member shall be personally responsible for any debts, liabilities, 
or obligations of the Company solely by reason of being a Member. All
debts, obligations, and liabilities of the Company, whether by contract or
not, shall belong solely to the Company.
Transfer & Assignment of Membership Interests
By default, most LLCs don’t allow membership shares to be freely trans-
ferred. However, they can be assigned. This means that I can give my mem-
bership shares over to my brother, but he won’t actually own them along
with all of the voting rights and other perks. He will only receive any distribu-
tions of the profits and losses that the membership shares get. Operating
agreements often state that membership interests can be transferred upon
the approval of all or the majority of the other members.
You can structure this section however you want. However, I wouldn’t allow
your membership shares to be freely transferred like corporate stock is. Here’s
why — one of the three things that sets LLCs apart from corporations is that
the stock can’t be easily traded. If you sidestep this little rule and look and feel
too much like a corporation, you can lose your charging order protection (the
idea that the LLC is protected from the members’ debts and obligations; see
Chapter 11 for a complete explanation). I would, instead, require all the
members to vote on whether to allow the shares to be transferred.
145
Chapter 9: ABCs of Setting Up Your Operating Agreement

In the Transfer & Assignment of Membership Interests section, you deal with
a lot of pertinent issues that need to be sorted out before you proceed with
business. These issues include such things as what happens when a member
retires or if a member wants to resign. You’ll most likely want to sit down with
your attorney and have her help you and your partners decide how you want
your company to run in the future. Some important subjects that you will
want to address in this section of your operating agreement are
 When and how can a member resign?
 If someone resigns, does he get his contribution or capital back?
 What happens when a member passes away?
 What happens when a member retires?
 What happens if a member goes bankrupt?
 Can a member be expelled?
 How are membership shares transferred?
Also, you should add a provision that states what happens if a creditor suc-
cessfully obtains a charging order against a member. A good trick of the trade
is to include a paragraph in your operating agreement that states that, should
a charging order (a court order that takes any profits that would be distrib-
uted to a member and gives them to the creditor instead until the debt is
paid; see Chapter 11 for more details) be obtained on a member, the remain-
ing members have first right of refusal on purchasing the member’s shares at
a portion of their fair market value.
First, you want to uphold the charging order protections:
If a creditor obtains a lien or a charging order against any Member’s member-
ship interest, or in the event of a Member’s bankruptcy or other involuntary
transfer of interest, this act shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement
by such Member. The creditor or claimant shall only be considered an
Assignee and will be limited to the rights of such. The creditor or claimant
shall have no right to become a Member or have rights to management partic-
ipation nor have the right to participate as a Member or Manager in any
regard to the affairs of the Company. Said creditor or claimant shall only be
entitled to receive the share of profit and losses, or the return of capital, to
which the Member would otherwise have been entitled.
Then, you want to state that the partners have the option of purchasing the
membership shares at a discount:
The Members may unanimously elect to purchase all or any part of the
membership shares that is subject to the charging order, bankruptcy, lien, or
other involuntary transfer at a discounted price. The price shall be equal to
one-half (1⁄2) of the fair market value of such shares. Written notice of such
purchase shall be provided to the creditor or claimant.
146
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

Allocations and Profit Distributions
Considering that all of the LLC’s members have contributed a portion of the
upstart capital — whether in the form of cash, equipment, or services —
everyone should be due a portion of the business’s profits. Generally, this
amount should be proportionate to their ownership percentage or their capi-
tal account. After all, the more you invest into the company, the more you
should profit, right?
One of the great benefits of operating as an LLC is that you don’t necessarily
have to distribute the company’s profits and losses according to the mem-
bers’ percentage of ownership. You can vary the distributions however you
like, as long as you make sure you can give the IRS a good reason for doing so
(which doesn’t include tax avoidance. You didn’t think they’d let you get
away with that now, did you?).
Allocations of Profits and Losses
An allocation is the amount of company profit and loss that is passed on to
each member for him to report on his personal tax returns. How much is allo-
cated to a member has no bearing on how much cash is actually distributed
to a member. This can cause what is called phantom income, in which case
you’ll be forced to pay taxes on company profits even when cash was never
distributed to you.
The IRS (very stringently, I might add!) allows allocations to vary from
member to member — and not just according to their ownership percentage.
Of course, it’s customary to allocate profits and losses to each member in
accordance with how much they actually own, but if you want to change it
up, you can! Just make sure that you work with your accountant before doing
this so she can help you avoid potential tax pitfalls.
For instance, some members may want to be allocated more losses than other
members. Why? Well, they may have a lot of passive income from real estate
properties and such that they want to offset. In this case, they can deduct the
passive losses from the LLC from their passive income from their real estate
endeavors. The remaining amount is what they are taxed on. You just have to
make sure that if you’re going to be messing with the allocations this way, you
have some reasoning behind it that doesn’t involve avoiding taxes.
Here’s a standard provision that you can include in your operating agreement
that allows you to vary the allocations whenever you and your partners choose:
The profits and losses of the Company shall be allocated to the Members in
proportion with their individual ownership percentages. Should the
Company wish to make special allocations, they must comply with Section
704 of the Internal Revenue Code and the corresponding regulations.
147
Chapter 9: ABCs of Setting Up Your Operating Agreement

Distributions
When the cash actually hits your pocket, then it becomes a distribution.
Although all company profits have to be allocated to the members (for them
to pay taxes on it), not all company profit has to be distributed — you can
leave some in the business. And you can schedule your distributions when-
ever you want — they don’t necessarily have to be once a year. You can make
the payouts quarterly or even monthly if you like.
You should also specify in your operating agreement the kind of distribution
that can be made. For the most part, you’ll only be distributing cash to the
members. If the company doesn’t have the money to pay a member, then that
member can’t demand an asset in lieu of the cash. They’ll just have to wait
until the LLC has the money or the entity is dissolved.
Here is a sample provision that you can use:
Subject to applicable law and limitations elsewhere in this Agreement, the
members may elect to make a distribution of assets at any time that would not
be prohibited by law or under this Agreement. The amount and timing of all
distributions of cash, or other assets, shall be determined by a unanimous vote
of the Voting Members. All such Distributions shall be made to those Members
who, according to the books and records of the Company, were the holders of
record of Membership Interests on the date of Distribution.
The Voting Members may base a determination that a distribution of cash
may be made on a balance sheet, profit and loss statement, cash flow state-
ment of the Company, or other relevant information. Neither the Company
nor any Members shall be liable for the making of any Distributions in
accordance with the provisions of this section.
No Member has the right to demand and receive any distribution from the
Company in any form other than money. No Member may be compelled to
accept from the Company a distribution of any asset in kind in lieu of a pro-
portionate distribution of money being made to other Members except on
the dissolution and winding up of the Company.
Make sure that your operating agreement contains a contingency plan for
members who come and go in the middle of a fiscal year. Normally, the distri-
bution that they receive is calculated according to the number of days that
they held membership. You can create whatever formula you think works
best for your situation.
Meetings & Voting
Chapter 11 has lots of information about holding meetings, taking votes, and
keeping records. In the meantime, you need to figure out how and when 
you’ll hold meetings, and what issues need to be approved by a majority of
the members.
148
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

A few of the issues that you should make sure to touch upon in this section of
your operating agreement are
 When holding a meeting, what sort of notice needs to be given to the
members?
 What sorts of decisions require a meeting of the members and a vote to
take place?
 How many members need to be at the meeting in order for a vote to be
taken (that is to say, what’s the quorum)?
 How are voting interests calculated? For instance, does every membership
share get one vote, or do all members have an equal vote, regardless of
their percentage of ownership?
 If a member is unable to make it to the meeting, will you allow her to
vote by proxy?
Notice of Meetings
Before having a meeting, you gotta give notice! After all, how will everyone
know when and where you’ll be meeting? Notice is required for LLC meetings,
not just because it’s polite and considerate, but also because it keeps the
members from purposefully withholding meeting time and location informa-
tion from certain members to prevent them from showing up at the meeting
and voting against their proposals. Here’s a sample provision you can use:
If any action on the part of the Members is to be proposed at the meeting,
then written notice of the meeting must be provided to each Member entitled
to vote not less than ten (10) days or more than sixty (60) days prior to the
meeting. Notice may be given in person, by fax, by first class mail, or by any
other written communication, charges prepaid, at the Members’ address
listed in Exhibit A, attached. The notice shall contain the date, time, and
place of the meeting and a statement of the general nature of this business
to be transacted there.
Quorum
Exactly what percentage of members it takes to hold a meeting is called a
quorum. Quorums can be unanimous, a simple majority, or 75 percent of the
members. It’s entirely up to you. If you don’t have the requisite number of
voters at the meeting, whether in person or by proxy, then no voting can take
place. A new meeting time and place must be scheduled, and you can then
try again to get the members there. I know that getting members to a member
meeting can often be like herding cats — especially when you have a lot of
members. If this is the case, then you may want to make the quorum a simple
majority. That way, it only takes half of your members to be on the ball to
make things happen. Here’s a sample provision:
Members holding at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the Voting Membership
Interests in the Company represented in person, by telephone, or by proxy
149
Chapter 9: ABCs of Setting Up Your Operating Agreement

shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of Voting Members. In the absence
of a quorum at any such meeting, the Voting Members may adjourn the
meeting for a period not to exceed sixty days.
When drafting your operating agreement, you need to determine whether any
decision or issues, regardless of quorum, require a unanimous consent of
members. The minority shareholders often get the short end of the stick
when it comes to voting on business affairs. To combat this, you can set up
your LLC so that pertinent issues need to be approved by all members before
they can be put through. This includes such issues as selling the business,
offloading major business assets, acquiring a large amount of debt, or settling
major litigation claims.
Voting
Not only do you have to determine what specific issues require a vote of the
members, but you also have to determine how members get to vote (usually
called their voting interests). You can structure voting interests two ways:
 Allow each membership share to have one vote. That means that if
your membership shares represent 55 percent of the company, then you
have 55 percent of the vote. This is the most common way to structure
voting interests.
 Give one vote per member. This means that if you have 55 percent of
the company, you will have one vote, which is equal to the member who
owns only 1 percent of the company.
You also have to take into account that you may have different types of mem-
bership shares: voting and nonvoting (see the earlier section, “Management
by Voting Members”). If this is the case, then only the voting shares receive
votes — no matter how you structure it.
Here’s a sample provision you can use:
Except as expressly set forth elsewhere in this Agreement or otherwise
required by law, all actions requiring the vote of the Members may be
authorized upon the vote of those Members collectively holding a majority
of the Membership Interests in the Company. The following actions require
the unanimous vote of all Members, who are not the transferors of a
Membership Interest:
i. Making an Amendment to the Articles of Organization or 
this Agreement;
ii. Absolving any Member from the obligation of making a capital contri-
bution or returning money or property that was distributed to such
Member in violation of law or this Agreement;
150
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

iii. Approving the sale, transfer, assignment, or exchange of a Member’s
interest in the Company and the admission of the transferee as a
Member with full rights therein;
iv. Purchasing, by the Company or its nominee, the Membership Interest
of a transferor Member.
You may want to calculate each member’s voting interest from the get-go and
place it in the operating agreement where you state their name, address, and
initial capital contributions. This way, when a vote takes place, the voting
interests are already calculated, and the members have already approved
and signed off on their individual voting interests.
Proxies
Say that you can’t make the meeting but still want to vote on the issues that are
being addressed. A common solution is to do a proxy vote, which means that
you assign another person to vote in your place. If you have ever held shares of
a publicly traded company, then I’m sure you’re aware of proxy voting. You tell
your proxy how you want them to vote, and they submit the vote for you.
Otherwise, every time a Fortune 500 company that you own a share or two of
holds a meeting, you’d be required to fly around the country to cast your vote.
If you want to allow your members to vote by proxy, you need to say so in the
operating agreement. You can state whatever terms you like; however, a
common provision is as follows:
Proxies are only valid when signed by the Member entitled to the vote and
must be filed with the secretary of the meeting prior to the commencement
of voting on the matter in which the proxy is being elected to vote upon.
Proxies shall become invalid after 11 months from the date of their execu-
tion unless otherwise stated in the proxy. Additionally, the proxy may be ter-
minated at will by the voting member. The termination of such proxy must
be submitted to the Company prior to the termination being effective.
Management & Duties
This section is especially important for manager-managed LLCs. If your LLC
is managed by the members, as opposed to a separate manager or two, then
all members have equal say in the management of the company. On the con-
trary, if your LLC is manager-managed, then you’ll be bringing in an outside
person (or group of people) who may not even be associated with the business.
They don’t even have to own a percentage of the company.
The manager is the person who runs the company. His actions determine
whether the business succeeds or fails. He is a pertinent player in the game,
and, for this reason, the members must choose wisely. The members must
151
Chapter 9: ABCs of Setting Up Your Operating Agreement

also retain control of the manager. If the manager screws up, the members
need to have the power and authority to replace him on a dime. If you are a
manager-managed LLC, this is probably the most critical part of the operating
agreement.
Unless you plan on changing your managers out often, you’ll probably want
to place the names of the initial managers in the operating agreement. If there
are more than a few, you can attach a separate piece of paper with the names
and refer to it as Addendum A or B.
If you have multiple managers, you’ll want to state in this section who is the
Big Boss. You’ll probably want to give the Big Boss a more official title like
CEO, president, operating manager, Chief Yahoo . . . you get the picture. If you
have other positions that you can place managers in, feel free to list them
here. You may want to list things such as chief financial officer, treasurer, vice
president of yadda yadda yadda . . . . Make up whatever you want; just make
sure to include what that position entails, such as the limits of responsibility
and the day-to-day duties.
Election
If you are in business for a while, you’ll probably see a lot of people come and
go. You see it happen with Fortune 500 companies all the time — they recycle
leaders on what seems like a weekly basis. If you’re like most people invest-
ing in a business, you’ll want to make sure that if the people you put in
charge aren’t cutting it, you can kick them to the curb and find someone who
can do the job better. Hey — it’s your hard-earned money you’re talking
about. You wouldn’t entrust it to some yackahoo, now would you?!
I didn’t think so. That’s why you need to sit down with your partners at the
beginning and decide how you’re going to manage your managers. If you want
to give your managers some job security, you may want to state in this sec-
tion that the managers stay in power for a one-year term; then the members
have to vote to reinstate them. At this point, the members can choose some-
one more qualified if they want to.
If you’re a little more cutthroat, you may want to write the provision so that
the manager can be replaced at any time by a vote of the majority of the
members. At that point, the members will elect a new manager or select
someone to serve in the interim.
Here’s a sample provision you can use:
The Company shall be managed by one or more appointed Managers. The
name and address of the Managers of the Company can be found in Exhibit
B, attached. The Members, by a majority vote, shall elect and appoint as
many Managers as the Members determine shall be in the best interest of
the Company, though no less than one.
152
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

One manager shall be elected to take the position of Chief Operating Manager.
The Chief Operating Manager shall be held responsible for managing the oper-
ations of the Company and shall carry out the decisions of the Managers.
Members shall serve until they resign or their successors are duly elected
and appointed by the Members.
Delegation of Powers
The question will come up — “What can and can’t we do as managers?”
Although managers must use common sense to avoid stepping over their
boundaries and making important decisions without consulting the members,
the operating agreement must have a section that gives them guidance. This sec-
tion tells them what decisions they can make on their own and what decisions
require a resolution of the members. Here’s a sample provision you can use:
The Managers are authorized on the Company’s behalf to bind the
Company to contracts and obligations, and to do or cause all acts to be
done deemed necessary or appropriate to carry out or further the business
of the Company. All decisions and actions of the Managers shall be made
by majority vote of the Managers as provided in this Agreement. The
Managers have in their power to authorize or decide the following:
i. The employment of persons or institutions for the operation and man-
agement of the company affairs.
ii. The execution of all checks, drafts, and money orders for the pay-
ment of company funds.
iii. The delivery and execution of promissory notes, loans, or security
agreements.
iv. The purchase or acquisition of company assets.
v. The sale, lease, or other disposition of company assets.
vi. The granting of security interests in the company assets in exchange
for capital.
vii. The prepayment or refinancing of any loan secured by the company
assets.
viii. The execution and delivery of all contracts, franchise agreements,
licensing agreements, assignments, leases, and subleases which
affect the company assets.
For the most part, your managers can bind the LLC to contracts and other oblig-
ations. You can limit their powers in this section of the operating agreement.
However, even if they act out of their authority, it doesn’t necessarily void any
contracts that they entered into. Ultimately, it’s up to a judge to decide.
153
Chapter 9: ABCs of Setting Up Your Operating Agreement

You may want to include a paragraph that states that any expenditures over a
certain amount (say, $5,000) require an additional authority. This can mean
that a vote of the members is required. Or perhaps more than one manager
or member has to sign off on the expense.
Compensation
The managers’ compensation isn’t something normally decided by the man-
agers — for good reason. Generally, most LLCs are structured so that before
any high compensation or bonuses can be doled out, the members must take
a vote, and the majority must approve. This is a great provision which can
really keep company costs from spiraling out of control. It maintains a checks-
and-balances system and is a great way to keep payroll in check. You can also
throw in a sentence or two that states that the company is required to reim-
burse the manager for all expenses she incurred on behalf of the company.
Here’s a sample provision you can use:
Any Manager who renders services to the Company shall be entitled to com-
pensation in direct proportion to the value of such services. Additionally, the
Company shall reimburse all direct out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Managers while managing the Company.
Miscellaneous
As you now know, you can put anything you want in your operating agreement.
You can make it as detailed or as basic as you like. I have laid out a basic format
for your operating agreement, but you don’t have to stick to it. You can orga-
nize your provisions however you want. Then you can put all of your leftover
provisions — the ones that don’t easily fit into the categories — under a
Miscellaneous section.
Financial Records and Reporting
This section gives members the right to inspect all of the business’s financial
records. It should tell them where the financial records are held and what
sort of financial reporting they can expect as members. After all, as a
member, wouldn’t you want to know what’s going on with your investment?
A few specific things that you should include in this section:
 Books and Records: Here you should state that all company records
shall be held in a corporate kit (see Chapter 11). Also state where 
the corporate kit is to be maintained — whether at the registered 
agent’s office, the company’s headquarters, or at the company’s
attorney’s office. Here’s a sample provision you can use:
The Members shall maintain at the Company’s principle place of
business the following books and records: a current list of the full
154
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

name and last-known business or residence address of each Member,
together with their capital contribution and membership interest; a
copy of the Articles and all amendments thereto; copies of the
Company’s federal, state, and local income tax or information returns
and reports, if any, for the six (6) most recent taxable years and a
copy of this Agreement and any amendments to it.
 Accounting and the Company’s Fiscal Year: This provision states what the
company’s year-end is and also who the company bookkeeper or accountant
is. You can choose whether to include this in your operating agreement.
It’s not vital, but may be nice to have, depending on your situation.
 Financial Reporting: It is common practice for the company manager to
provide regular financial reports to the members. The type of financial
reports (balance statements, profit and loss statements, and so on) and
the frequency of which they are distributed should be noted here. Here’s
a sample provision you can use:
The complete and accurate accounting and financial records of the
Company shall be held by the Managers at the Company’s principal
place of business. Such records shall be kept on such method of
accounting as the Managers shall select. The Company’s accounting
period shall be the calendar year.
The Managers shall close the accounting records at the close of each
calendar year, and shall prepare and send to each member a state-
ment of such Member’s distributive share of income and expense —
in the form of a Schedule K-1 — for income tax reporting purposes.
Who is responsible for maintaining the company books and records? Will one
person be in charge of this? If you have a larger company, everyone will most
likely go about their daily business and not give a care in the world about
dealing with the random record-keeping tasks that come up. You may want to
assign one person to handle everything; that way, they are responsible for
the job and can be held accountable if it isn’t completed.
Indemnification Clause
Although all managers and members are provided a basic level of indemnifi-
cation (a fancy word for “limited liability”), it’s always good to restate it in your
operating agreement. Essentially, you’re telling the world that all of the LLC’s
managers, members, and employees are free from and are not responsible for
the obligations and debts of the company. Like I said, this provision isn’t
required, but hey — it can’t hurt! Here’s a sample provision you can use:
The Company shall indemnify any person, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, who is a party defendant or is threatened to be made a party defendant,
pending or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the
Company) by reason of the fact that he is or was a Member of the Company,
Manager, employee, or agent of the Company, or is or was serving at the
155
Chapter 9: ABCs of Setting Up Your Operating Agreement

request of the Company, so long as the person did not behave in violation of
law or this Agreement, for instant expenses (including attorney’s fees),
judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred in connection with such action, suit, or proceeding.
Dispute Resolution
Whenever a lot of people get together and work on a project for an extended
period of time, disputes are bound to come up. Often, they come out of
nowhere, blindsiding you at the worst times. Unless dealt with properly, they
can seriously harm your business, and resolving them can take time and pre-
cious resources that your business needs to grow and prosper. To prevent
these situations from occurring, you and your partners should be forward-
thinking enough to add guidelines on how to effectively deal with disputes
when they come up.
First, you should specify the state in which the disputes are to be dealt with.
It can be incredibly expensive to handle lawsuits and disputes in states other
than where your company headquarters are. Therefore, it’s a great policy to
make sure that all members are bound to taking legal action only in the state
that your company is located in.
Second, you’ll want to keep your disputes out of the courtroom. Lawsuits can
be costly and, at times, debilitating. You should provide your members with a
means to get their disputes handled in a friendlier, laid-back way. Specifically,
you’ll want to bind them to mediation and arbitration (a diplomatic way to
handle disputes in which a third party hears both sides of the disagreement
and then makes a decision about the outcome).
Here’s a sample provision you can use:
The Members agree that in the event of any dispute or disagreement solely
between or among any of them arising out of, relating to, or in connection
with this Agreement or the Company or its organization, formation, busi-
ness, or management, the Members shall use their best efforts to resolve
any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement by good-
faith negotiation and mutual agreement. The Members shall meet at a mutu-
ally convenient time and place to attempt to resolve any such dispute.
However, in the event that a member dispute cannot be resolved, such parties
shall first attempt to settle such dispute through a nonbinding mediation pro-
ceeding. In the event any party to such mediation proceeding is not satisfied
with the results thereof, then any unresolved disputes shall be finally settled in
accordance with an arbitration proceeding. In no event shall the results of any
mediation proceeding be admissible in any arbitration or judicial proceeding.
Dissolution
The dissolution provision is an incredibly important one that you definitely
should include in your operating agreement. Just because it’s in the
156
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

Miscellaneous section doesn’t mean that it should be taken lightly or disre-
garded altogether. All good things come to an end, and chances are that your
LLC will be no different. Eventually, you’ll have to go through the dissolution
process. If you are in a short-term project, then this provision is especially
imperative because it specifies how the profits and losses are divvied up among
the members, and you’ll want to make this section as detailed as possible.
First, outline what scenarios or actions will cause the company to dissolve.
(For more information on the actions that can trigger a dissolution, read
Chapter 12.) You also need to specify what percentage of members it takes to
approve a voluntary dissolution. It’s common to require a unanimous con-
sent from all members — that way, no members can come back and dispute
the dissolution, saying that they never approved it.
You should also outline the process for winding up the company’s affairs.
After the company is liquidated, what is the order in which people are paid?
By law, you generally have to pay the company creditors first, but then what?
You should check your state laws to see how much leeway you have. In most
states, you are legally obliged to distribute profits according to the member’s
ownership percentages.
Putting It All Together
How you put your operating agreement together isn’t nearly as important as
what it contains. However, if you’re going to take the time to create it in the
first place, why not make sure it’s organized and easily readable? It isn’t hard
to make your document look like a million bucks — or at least like the million
bucks it probably would have cost to have an attorney draft it from scratch.
Achieving A+ form and structure
The operating agreement is laid out similar to the articles of organization
(see Chapter 6) in that that there are articles, sections, and subsections, all
designated with letters, numbers, and/or Roman numerals. For instance, the
layout may look something like this:
Article I
Section A
1.
2.
3.
Section B
157
Chapter 9: ABCs of Setting Up Your Operating Agreement

Or, something like this:
Article 1:
Section A
Subsection I
Subsection II
Subsection III
Section B
Subsection I
Subsection II
Subsection III
Article 2:
Section A
If you use a lot of legalese or industry terminology, you may want to consider
making the first article a “Defined Terms” article with a list of definitions so
the reader understands what certain words mean as he reads through the
document. After all, if he is binding himself to the contract, he needs to
understand it fully.
Signing and ratifying
With an LLC, all of your managers and members should sign the operating
agreement (if you are used to running a corporation, then this part may
throw you off a bit). As attorney David LeGrand has told me over and over
again, “Some of the worst client problems I have seen arose because not
every member had signed the operating agreement, resulting in thousands of
dollars of legal fees and lost time from disputes.”
To protect against this, not only should each member (and manager, if man-
ager-managed) sign off on the operating agreement, they should also sign off
on their capital contribution, membership interest, and distributive shares
that are listed in the agreement. If there are a lot of members, then you can
include a signature page as a separate piece of paper.
You should also make sure that you hold a meeting of the members (and
managers, if you like) and take a vote to approve the completed operating
agreement. You should draft minutes of this meeting to further document
that all of the members got together and approved the document. This way, if
158
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

the document is ever contested in court, you can prove that the contesting
member was there when the document was up for a vote and could have dis-
puted the document at the time. This is why it’s a good idea to have all of the
members approve the operating agreement as opposed to a simple majority.
(For more information on how to hold meetings and draft meeting minutes,
flip ahead to Chapter 11.)
Now . . . put it away!
First, you may want to give copies of the operating agreement to each of the
members and managers. This ensures that everyone is on the same page and
each person is familiar with company policies and procedures. Second, you
will want to keep the original safely tucked away in your company kit (see
Chapter 11).
Before putting your operating agreement away, it’s a good idea to run it by
your company attorney to make sure that you aren’t missing any pertinent
information that is applicable to your company or industry. By drafting the
operating agreement yourself and then having an attorney double-check your
work, you do a lot of the legwork and save yourself a lot of dough, but you
still get the professional finished product that you would have gotten if your
attorney had drafted the entire thing from scratch.
Amending the Agreement
As companies grow and change, so should their infrastructure. If you are in
this for the long term, then you’ll probably reach a point in time when the
operating agreement needs to be amended. How you amend your operating
agreement is largely determined by the laws of the state that your LLC is
domiciled in. If your home state says that your operating agreement can be
amended by unanimous consent, then all members will have to approve the
amendment for it to be made. All in all, you need to check your state laws.
Some states say that it only takes a majority of the members to amend the
operating agreement, while others permit the managers to amend the operating
agreement if the articles of organization permit it.
When amending your operating agreement, you go through the same process
as if you were amending your articles of organization (see Chapter 6). You’ll
hold a meeting of the members (see Chapter 11), present the amendment for
a vote, then draft a resolution stating that all (or a majority) of the members
resolved to amend the operating agreement. Then draft meeting minutes to
this effect and keep the minutes and resolutions in your corporate kit. It’s
159
Chapter 9: ABCs of Setting Up Your Operating Agreement

vital to have this proof that all members agreed on changing the operating
agreement. If you’re ever taken to court, you can prove that all members
voted and signed off on the amendment.
Unlike when you amend your articles of organization, you don’t need to file the
amendments to your operating agreement with the state or local jurisdictions
because your operating agreement isn’t a public record. Your operating agree-
ment is a private contract between the members (and managers) of the LLC.
This means that your amendment is valid as soon as it has been voted on.

n the eyes of the law, your LLC is a separate entity — almost like a sepa-
rate person. But because it’s not alive and can’t breathe or think on its
own, someone must do so on its behalf. In this case, the owners — that is to
say, you — will make sure the business stays alive.
The LLC’s members are the major decision makers. For the most part, the
business’s success falls on their shoulders. Even if they don’t manage the
day-to-day affairs, they still control who does. As far as I’m concerned, until
membership in your LLC has been issued — in other words, until the LLC is
actually owned by someone — the business doesn’t really exist.
In this chapter, I show you how to take ownership of your LLC by issuing
membership interests to you and your partners. I also go into detail on how
to sell and transfer membership shares and deal with situations such as the
death or divorce of a member. Then, I show you how to raise money by sell-
ing your membership shares in exchange for investment.
Interpreting the Terminology: Members,
Interests, and Certificates
The legal term for the owners of an LLC is members. Some states have a spe-
cific definition for what a member is, while other states have no definition at
all. Don’t let this throw you off.

162
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 
Think of the ownership of the LLC as a big pie, and each owner gets a por-
tion. These portions are called the membership interests or ownership percent-
age (different states tend to use slightly different terminology, but they all
mean the same thing). Often, when you issue membership interests, the
entire pie must be consumed, so to speak. The pieces of this pie are normally
called membership units.
For instance, if there is a total of 100 membership units in the company and
you have 35 membership units, then you own 35 percent of the company. In
other words, you have a 35 percent membership interest in the LLC. An easy
way to calculate your membership interest is to divide your membership
units by total number of membership units the company has issued.
The piece of paper that proves your ownership of the LLC is called your
membership certificate. A membership certificate includes the name of the
member, the date that the certificate was issued, the amount of membership
interests, and the signature of one or two members and/or managers.
It’s a strange thought — you can invest thousands into an enterprise, and all
you get is a simple piece of paper. But that piece of paper gives you the one
most important thing in business — control. Without that certificate, you have
no say in how the LLC is run, how the money is spent, or how the company is
The reality of membership shares
Childhood friends Ed, Sal, and Greg have
dreamed forever of opening up their own motor-
cycle shop. Although they all work odd jobs,
they soon realize that together they could finally
make this mere vision a reality. Ed owns an
excess of equipment for building custom bikes,
including the paint and specialty tools. Sal has
full access to, but doesn’t own, an old vacant
warehouse, and Greg has saved $50,000 in his
successful entrepreneurship. Together, they
possess all the pieces to build their own custom
bike shop, ESG Motorbikes.
They form an LLC and divvy out their member-
ship shares. Although Greg is fronting the capi-
tal to get the business afloat (providing the
largest set of funds), Sal and Ed aren’t letting
Greg overlook the value of their contributions,
so after some persuasion, Greg finally relents
and agrees to spread the shares out evenly at
33.3 percent. The LLC protects the members
from losses that can’t exceed what they invest
into the company, but it seems Greg has much
more at risk and might deserve a greater piece
of the pie.
A couple years down the road, when the going
isn’t great, a private investor offers to purchase
ESG Motorbikes for $100,000. Greg, having
invested the most money, isn’t too happy about
this, but Sal and Ed outvote him and decide to
sell. Sal and Ed will make a quick profit, but
unfortunately for him, Greg’s membership cer-
tificate states that he owns one-third of the
company. Therefore, he is only entitled to one-
third of the proceeds from the sale of the busi-
ness. So now it seems Greg’s risk in the venture
may have exceeded his reward, while his bud-
dies gained probably more than they should have.

structured. The business could be terminated tomorrow, and you would get
nothing. That little certificate means everything in the world of business, so
make sure you have one!
Believe it or not, in most states, membership certificates aren’t actually required
by law to be distributed to the members — the ownership breakdown can just
be stated in the operating agreement. However, just because it isn’t required,
doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it anyway. I recommend that each and every
member gets a membership certificate as proof of their ownership.
Do a quick review of your state’s laws regarding LLC ownership to figure out
what terminology the state uses. I have provided contact information for
each state in Appendix A.
Setting Up and Managing 
Your Membership
After you have filed your articles of organization and have created your operat-
ing agreement (see Chapter 9), you can stake your claim! You take ownership of
the LLC by issuing membership shares to yourself and your partners. The
percentage of the LLC that a member owns should be relatively proportional 
to the amount that he initially invests, be it money, equipment, or services. All
of this is reflected in the buy-sell agreement that you and your partners will
write up and the membership certificates that each member will receive.
In this section, I explain most of the basic rules of membership shares. After
you’ve got that down and you know what your limitations are, I show you
how to issue membership shares for the first time.
Looking at some membership rules
LLCs are really flexible entities where members are concerned. The laws give
you a lot of freedom in how you can structure your LLC. Some examples of an
LLC’s flexibility are:
 Most states allow members to make contributions in the form of services
in exchange for membership interests. Services are defined as time that
the member puts into the organization. (This allows someone who has a
talent you need to invest his time and skill instead of money.) Just make
sure that if you allow services as a type of contribution, this is specifically
stated in the operating agreement.
163
Chapter 10: Who Owns What: Deciphering Membership Shares

 Distributions can be varied from member to member. In other words, if
you follow some very specific IRS rules, you can change the company’s
distribution of profits and losses to be different from the percentage of
ownership. For example, if you and your partners choose, and you meet
IRS criteria, you can own 10 percent of the company and get 50 percent
of the profits and zero percent of the losses.
 There can be an unlimited number of members. Unlike some entities,
you can have hundreds of thousands of members if you want! This is a
huge benefit if you are looking to raise capital for your business.
Keep in mind, though, if you are a really small business, you may want to
limit the number of members you bring on. Even if your LLC is managed
by separate managers who aren’t involved in the business’s day-to-day
operations, you’ll still need the members to vote on important issues,
such as selecting the managers and taking on sizeable debt. If your mem-
bers are not easily accessible or you have too many, making a quorum
or getting a majority of the members to vote can be an issue. Not to
mention the fact that the more people who are involved in the decision-
making process, the harder it is to reach a consensus.
 The members can be non-U.S. citizens and even be other entities, such
as corporations, trusts, limited partnerships, and LLCs. Making another
entity a member in your LLC is a huge benefit if you’re trying to set up
an asset protection plan where the LLC needs to be a subsidiary of
another company. Also, if you are the only member in the LLC and you
don’t want to share any control, you can form another entity to be your
second member. This way, you’ll keep all the power, but avoid having to
deal with the hassles of being a single-member LLC.
 You can have different types (classes) of membership. For instance,
you can issue Class A membership, where the members can participate
in the management of the LLC, and a Class B membership, where the
members are only silent partners with no participation in the day-to-day
operations. In most states, you can structure these classes however you
want — just put it in the operating agreement. (I go into more detail on
this in the next section.)
 You can decide how members will transfer their membership shares.
Members can be restricted to transferring only the economic interest
(the distributions), or they can transfer their full membership (voting
rights, economic interests, and all) but only on a vote of the majority of
the other members.
As you can see from this list, when I said that LLCs were flexible entities with
regard to membership, I meant it! This amazing flexibility allows LLC owners
to run many different types of businesses, from raising financing for a real
estate deal to movie production to running a small business. Also, keep in
mind that with an LLC, the members don’t have to manage the company.
164
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

Instead, separate managers can be selected. These managers can be owners
or non-owners. This is one of the main reason why LLCs are gaining popularity
as an entity to raise capital with — you can fully manage the entity yourself,
while your investors remain silent in the business’s day-to-day activities.
If a person in the organization isn’t given membership, then they aren’t an
owner. If they manage the LLC, they have a say in the day-to-day operations,
but their position isn’t necessarily permanent. The members decide who
manages the LLC, and the manager’s involvement solely depends on the
members’ approval. In other words, a manager who isn’t a member is little
more than a glorified employee.
Establishing membership classes
If the LLC is the most flexible entity around — allowing you to tailor it com-
pletely to your needs — it definitely lives up to its reputation when it comes
to the ownership. You see, if you choose, your LLC can offer different classes
of membership. Membership classes designate certain rights and rules for dif-
ferent groups of members. Often, these different classes are marked with a
letter (Class A membership, Class B membership, and so on).
Now, what can you do with these different classes? Anything! With member-
ship classes, you can give some of your partners more voting rights than
others. Or the rules regarding the transfer of the membership shares can be
different among members. You decide. Hey, no one said life is fair! Your LLC
needn’t be either.
165
Chapter 10: Who Owns What: Deciphering Membership Shares
Meeting the minimum number of members 
(No, your dog doesn’t count)
LLCs are set up to be partnerships. Therefore,
you need a partner! I know a lot of you want to
fly solo — but trust me, you don’t want to go
there! Although it’s possible in many states to
operate as a single-member LLC, it isn’t a good
idea.
If you are intent on having 100 percent control
over your entity, you can gift a small percentage
of shares to a close friend. That way, you still
have the majority vote, which means complete
control over the LLC.
If the thought of having a friend involved in your
business makes you cringe, or if you don’t have
anyone whom you can trust, you have another
option. You can form a corporation and make it
your partner in the LLC. This may seem like a lot
of work, but you can use the extra corporation
to protect your assets even further. If you are
serious about flying solo and protecting your
assets, this move may be the best one.

To establish membership classes, you create one set of rules and procedures
for the Class A membership and another set for the Class B membership. For
instance, you can create different classes of membership for the operating
partners, the investors, and the employees. Their control in the company can
be limited according to their respective positions. You can also use member-
ship classes as an incentive for investors to contribute more money to the
business. After all, it only makes sense that the investors who contribute the
most money should have more influence in the company than those who
barely invested at all.
After you have decided what you want your different membership classes to
be, you include them in your operating agreement (I show you how to do this
in Chapter 9). You also include the information on your membership certifi-
cates. You usually do this by putting the class (such as “Class A,” “Class B,”
and so on) on the front of the certificate. Then, you put a legend — a para-
graph stating the class restrictions — on the back of the certificate.
When creating classes, if you want to allow some of your members to manage,
but not all of them, then you need to make sure that your LLC is designated as
manager-managed. In most states, if you designate your LLC as member-
managed, then all members are equal managers in the business, regardless of
the classes set forth in your operating agreement. For more information on
manager-managed versus member-managed LLCs, see Chapter 4.
Creating a buy-sell agreement
A buy-sell agreement outlines the rules regarding members voluntarily or invol-
untarily transferring their membership. It also explains what the members
should do when a member retires, goes bankrupt, becomes incapacitated, or
passes away. Normally, if your buy-sell agreement covers all members in the
company, then you just include these provisions in your operating agreement.
But with LLCs, you don’t have to hold everyone to the same standard. If you
want, you can have individual buy-sell agreements for each of your members.
A buy-sell agreement prevents situations like the following two:
 Your best friend and long-term business partner dies in a skiing accident.
You are devastated. When you think it couldn’t get worse, his nephew, his
only heir, decides that he has the right to step in and take control of the
business. Legally, you and your partner had no agreement in place that
provided for a situation such as this one. When you show up at court 
to provide your defense, you are empty-handed. Meanwhile, the little
scamp is acting like a tyrant and undoing all of your years of hard work.
 You and your brother start a pet shop and put it in a member-managed
LLC. When the two of you get into a quarrel, he finds the only person in
the world who doesn’t like puppies and sells her his membership
166
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

shares. The next day, Cruella DeVille, your new partner, shows up for
work and starts making changes. She fires your best employees and
spends the company money like there’s no tomorrow.
A buy-sell agreement must cover
 How much money a member’s membership shares are worth
 Who controls the member’s shares if she leaves the LLC for any reason
 The reasons why someone may be admitted as a member and issued
membership shares
 What happens to a member’s shares when the member departs or 
withdraws
• The LLC or the other members can purchase the shares
• The shares can be sold to the general public
 The process of transferring membership shares
 What happens if a member declares bankruptcy or divorces
The buy-sell agreement is usually a component of the operating agreement
when all the members have to follow the same rules and regulations.
However, you don’t have to put your buy-sell agreement in your operating
agreement. If different members are subject to different rules and regulations
(for instance, a certain set of members can’t transfer their shares, while the
rest can), then you need a separate buy-sell agreement for those members. In
this case, you would have individual buy-sell agreements, instead of a com-
pany-wide one that resides in your operating agreement. (Chapter 9 shows
you how to create an operating agreement.)
When you issue your membership shares, you must create a buy-sell agree-
ment at the same time. Otherwise, a buy-sell agreement that you create after
issuing membership shares may not be retroactive and cover all members
and any future transferees. If you’ve already issued your membership shares
and now want to create a buy-sell agreement, make sure that
 All of your members vote on it.
 The agreement specifically states that it covers all current LLC members.
Determining profit and loss distributions
First, let me describe what profit and loss distributions actually are. At the end
of every year, whatever income (profit) the company generated during its
operation passes on (or is distributed) to the owners’ personal tax returns,
167
Chapter 10: Who Owns What: Deciphering Membership Shares

almost as if it were their personal income. They report this on a Schedule K
that they attach to their Form 1040 that they file every year. The same goes
with the company’s expenses and losses — they are also passed on to the
LLC’s owners.
Normally, the amount of profits and losses that are passed on is determined
by the amount of the company they own. For instance, if you own 20 percent
of the company, then you will be allocated 20 percent of the company’s prof-
its and 20 percent of the company’s losses. When you don’t distribute the
profits and losses according to the percentage of the company that a person
owns, it’s called a special allocation of the profits and losses.
But it’s not just a free-for-all out there regarding company profits. To prevent
fraud, the IRS doesn’t let you decide how to allocate profits however you
want. If it did, members with the most personal income would make sure they
received all of the LLC’s losses to offset the income they made from other
ventures. For instance, unless you have a good reason, one partner can’t
receive 100 percent of the losses, while another takes 100 percent of the prof-
its. You have to be able to substantiate your decision. In other words — you
can’t play with the profit distributions for tax-evasion purposes — you must
have a real reason behind it.
Want to always be guaranteed that you can change your distributions of prof-
its and losses at a moment’s notice without getting nailed by the IRS? Well,
there is a way. The IRS provides guidelines for determining whether special
allocations are okay. You can put certain language in your operating agree-
ment and do some simple things to protect yourself from any tax troubles.
Here are a couple of ways to make sure you’re covered:
168
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 
When special allocations make sense
Eric decides to partner up with his best friends
Martin and Adam. They have been thinking
about setting up a film production company
since they were kids and have decided that now
is the time to jump in. Martin and Adam will be
putting in the upstart capital ($30,000 each), and
the three of them will be sharing equally in the
work.
Eric, knowing that it wouldn’t be fair for them to
split the profits equally, works out a deal with 
Martin and Adam. Each partner will own one-
third of the company, so they all have equal
voting power and control over the company, but
Martin and Adam will receive 100 percent of all
company profits until they have been paid back
their initial investment plus 20 percent. Martin and
Adam agree and they decide to form an LLC —
the only entity that allows them to distribute the
profits not according to the percentage of
ownership each member has.

 The partners’ capital accounts (how much equity each partner has in
the partnership) should be carried on the books according to the IRS
regulations. Don’t worry — this isn’t as difficult as it seems and is nothing
out of the ordinary. For more information on this, speak with your tax
professional or read the regulations regarding capital accounts under
Section 704 of the Internal Revenue Code.
 The operating agreement must specify that upon termination and
liquidation of the LLC, the members will receive the profits according
to their capital accounts. If a member’s capital account is in the nega-
tive (that is, she owes money to the company), then that money must be
paid back when the company ceases operations or before the member
sells her membership share in the company. Look at your equity as a
loan that must be paid back if the investment isn’t profitable.
As your company distributes profits and losses, accepts contributions, and
the assets appreciate and depreciate through the year, you’ll need to adjust
each members’ individual capital account. Because this is a complex process
unless you’re well educated in accounting, you should work with your com-
pany accountant so he can adjust each member’s capital account. You’ll also
want to reissue the membership so it properly reflects each member’s new
percentage of the company.
Setting up a single-member LLC
If you’re planning on being the only member of your LLC, watch out! LLCs
were designed to be partnerships. Therefore, the IRS only agreed to accept
LLCs if they followed some simple partnership rules — the main one being
that you have an actual partner. And no, it can’t be your cat or your dearly
deceased Aunt Peggy.
Unless you are completely diligent in your record keeping and dot every i and
cross every t, single-member LLCs (SLLCs) lack a lot of the basic liability pro-
tection that an LLC offers. And this protection is one of the LLC’s fundamen-
tal benefits. The IRS doesn’t even consider an SLLC a partnership (after all,
there aren’t any partners!). SLLCs are taxed as sole proprietorships, and you
pay the company taxes on a Schedule C, Profit or Loss From Business,
attached to your personal tax return.
You know what an SLLC is called in IRS terms? A disregarded entity. And disre-
gard it, you shall. Without the basic limited liability, why even go through the
hassle of forming an LLC in the first place?
Still being stubborn and don’t want to share your ownership with someone
else? Don’t fret. I’ve got you covered! If you don’t mind extra paperwork, you
can be the only owner of your LLC and keep your limited liability. It might be
somewhat tedious, but you’ll get your way!
169
Chapter 10: Who Owns What: Deciphering Membership Shares

Some states don’t even allow single-member LLCs. If you are unfortunate
enough to be located in one of these fussy states, you can just file your LLC in
another state, such as Nevada or Wyoming, then register to transact business in
your home state (see Chapter 5 for more on choosing a state to file your LLC in).
If you are a single-member LLC and deemed by the IRS to be treated as a disre-
garded entity, you lack the dual liability protection that a partnership offers (see
Chapter 2 for details). Therefore, if you claim a home-office deduction (IRS Form
8829, Expenses for Business Use of Your Home), your home could theoretically
be considered a business asset and could be seized if you lose a lawsuit.
Although the law doesn’t automatically offer it to single-member LLCs, you
can still demand the liability protection that an LLC or corporation offers.
This isn’t easy, though, because you must be rigorous in making sure that
everything is filed correctly, and you have to go above and beyond to treat
your entity as though it were truly separate from yourself.
To keep the liability protection in your SLLC
 Be diligent in keeping your business assets and cash flow completely
separate from your personal assets and cash flow. You must have
documentation to this effect.
 Sign all of your filings as owner, on behalf of your LLC. Never sign any
business documents without this designation.
 Add your federal EIN number and your LLC’s filing number (provided
by the Secretary of State) to your Schedule C. Adding your LLC’s file
number makes your LLC look much more legitimate and can deter those
looking for a lawsuit.
 Act like a corporation. This involves complying with all corporate
formalities, such as meetings of the members and managers, keeping
extensive minutes, and passing resolutions. Just because only one person
is involved in your entity, don’t think you can get out of these tasks. It
may seem silly to have a meeting with yourself, but it’s necessary to
document all decision-making affecting the company.
 Elect corporate tax treatment on IRS Form 8832, Entity Classification
Election. When electing corporate tax treatment, you are automatically
saved from being considered a proprietorship, and none of the above
rules need to be followed.
Do you still want to be the only owner of the LLC, but are afraid of the risk of
operating as a single-member LLC? Don’t worry, you have some other options.
 You can form another entity to act as a second member of the LLC.
 You can choose someone whom you trust to act as a secondary partner.
170
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

The person or corporation that you select as the second member doesn’t
have to own that much interest in the LLC — you only need to issue another
party a small percentage of membership to avoid being considered a single-
member LLC.
One plus one equals one. Don’t believe me? A husband and wife who are the
only members of an LLC are considered one unit; therefore, the LLC is a
single-member LLC.
If you choose to have a single-member LLC, then be aware that you probably
can’t take advantage of the charging order protections that LLCs offer (which
I explain in Chapter 11).
Adding and Withdrawing Members
When you are jumping head first into business and then working flawlessly
with your partner, you may think that it’s silly to discuss the prospect of a
change in ownership. After all, you and your partner work incredibly well
together, and everything is moving forward seamlessly — there’s no way the
ownership will ever change!
Listen, I know that you may think it’s bad luck or a touchy subject to come up
with a contingency plan when things are running so smoothly, but when else
are you going to do it? When the you-know-what hits the fan? Not a good plan!
Not to mention that a change in ownership doesn’t necessarily have to be the
result of some argument or other sort of falling-out. A change in ownership
can occur for myriad other reasons, good and bad.
It’s somewhat more difficult than you might expect to transfer an LLC’s
membership units.
 An LLC is considered a partnership by the IRS, and one of the primary
things that sets a partnership apart from a corporation is that the
ownership isn’t freely transferable.
 Your state believes it’s imperative to protect the partners in a business
from showing up for work one day and finding out they have a new partner
who they now have to find a way to work with.
Ultimately, the laws are designed to protect you, and these little guidelines
make LLCs the phenomenally superior entities that they are.
You see, the fact that ownership is not freely transferable really works for you
when you lose a lawsuit and the plaintiff is about to seize your ownership of
the LLC. Because the LLC’s shares aren’t easily transferred, the plaintiff can’t
171
Chapter 10: Who Owns What: Deciphering Membership Shares

seize the actual shares. He can only seize the profits (and losses!) that you
receive from your interest in the company. You can use this little rule to your
advantage to stay out of lawsuits. I go over this in detail in Chapter 2, but for
now, keep in mind that these rules work for you more often than they work
against you.
All of the rules regarding adding and withdrawing members can be laid out in
your operating agreement. You want to make sure that the required provi-
sions are there, because if your operating agreement or buy-sell agreement
doesn’t address an issue, then state law decides. If you require a vote of the
members before a membership share can be issued or transferred, then your
operating agreement or buy-sell agreement should state what percentage of
members must approve the transfer. Will you require a unanimous decision
among members, or will a simple majority do? You decide.
Doing the membership shuffle
No one should be stuck in an investment that isn’t working out for them, just
like no owners should be stuck with partners whom they don’t like or agree
with. You may need to remove (technically called withdraw) a person from
your LLC team when
 A member passes away
 A member retires
 A member becomes severely ill or incapacitated
 A member goes through a divorce
 A member goes bankrupt
 The other members are unhappy with one member
 A member needs cash and wants to sell his membership
 A member wants to gift his membership to someone close to him
 A member has his membership units seized
 The owners want to bring on an additional partner
Sometimes you may want to add members after your LLC is already
established. Some reasons include
 You want to raise additional capital to take your LLC to the next level. In
exchange for his investment, you want to offer the member a piece of
the pie.
172
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

 You have a member-managed LLC, and the workflow is becoming too great.
You want to bring on another owner who can contribute her experience
and expertise to take your business to the next level.
 Your employees have worked hard for your company over the years. 
As a way of repaying them, you want to issue them a small percentage
of ownership.
Make sure that all actions on behalf of the members of the company, espe-
cially those concerning adding and withdrawing members, are clearly docu-
mented in the company minutes. Recording these changes shows a history of
the company procedures and will be invaluable if any actions are contested
or if the company is taken to court.
Giving new members their share
When a new member joins your LLC, how do the profit distributions work?
Assuming that you are distributing the profits according to the ownership,
you would pay her a percentage of the profits based on her ownership shares
and how long she has been a member during the current fiscal year.
For example, if a new member, owning 10 percent of the LLC, is admitted to
the LLC on July 1, does she get 10 percent of the profits at the end of the
year? Of course not! Your accountant can assist you in your exact calcula-
tions, but in this case, if the total profits distributed are $100,000, then the
new member will receive 50 percent (for the half of the year she was a
member) of the 10 percent (her ownership share) for a grand total of $5,000.
After that distribution has been made, the remaining $95,000 can be distrib-
uted according to the other members’ percentages.
Make sure that you have outlined this provision in your buy-sell agreement,
especially if you allow members to come and go. Can you imagine the out-
come if a member were to buy in on December 20, take a huge chunk of the
distributions for that year, then sell out on January 2? Trust me, it’s hap-
pened, and the only way to prevent that situation is to make sure your oper-
ating agreement or buy-sell agreement clearly states that distributions are
calculated according to the number of days of the year that the member has
been admitted to the entity.
If a member is contributing a piece of property or equipment in exchange for
membership shares, her tax basis may change (especially if the item carries a
mortgage or other debt). This is called a return of capital in IRS terms and can
be a good thing in the long run, trust me. The member should hire a qualified
small-business accountant or CPA to keep track of her tax basis.
Speaking of taxes, whenever a new member contributes money, property,
equipment, or any other type of asset, the IRS doesn’t consider any gain or loss
taking place by the member or the LLC itself. It is considered an equal-value
173
Chapter 10: Who Owns What: Deciphering Membership Shares

exchange in IRS terms. This means it’s a tax-free transaction; even though you
report the transfer on your tax return, the IRS takes no money out of your
pocket.
When a member wants to leave
When a member withdraws, two things can happen to the person’s membership
shares
 The withdrawing member will sell her interest to another member or a
third party.
 The withdrawing member will want the LLC to buy her interest back
from her.
First, the LLC should attempt to purchase the membership interest itself.
After this has been done and the member has relinquished her shares to the
LLC, the other members can reconfigure their ownership percentages. For
instance, if three members each owned 33 percent of the company and one
member decides to sell her shares back to the LLC, then the remaining two
members will each own 50 percent of the company.
Make sure you outline the specifics of this process in your operating agree-
ment or buy-sell agreement. If you don’t do this, in some states, the LLC may
have to pay the member the value of his initial contribution, or worse, the
value of the membership shares he wants to get rid of. Obviously, this could
be a problem if the LLC doesn’t have that sort of money lying around.
In other states, the complete opposite may happen, and the withdrawing
member may have to pay damages to the LLC to cover the losses that the
LLC incurred by her withdrawal. As you can see, the laws vary widely, and
the best way to control what happens in the event of a member withdrawal is
to state what you want in your operating agreement or buy-sell agreement.
If the member wants to sell her shares, the most common way to handle this
situation is to give the other members right of first refusal. This means that
the other members have the option of purchasing the membership shares at
their current value (the total value of the LLC divided by the percentage of
membership shares being sold).
If no members purchase the shares, then the withdrawing member has the
right to sell them to the general public. If someone who is not a member buys
the shares, the incoming member won’t have full rights in the LLC; she’ll only
have economic rights, which means she gets the profit and loss distributions,
but has no right to vote or manage the LLC. However, the other members can
vote to allow the incoming member the rights that were previously denied
her. At that point, she becomes a full member.
174
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

If the member withdraws during the fiscal year, it’s usually up to the with-
drawing member and the incoming (new) member how to work the distribu-
tions. In most cases, I would advise you to pay the distributions to the new
member and let him then pass on the profits and/or losses that are due to the
old member. If you want to be nice, you can calculate the distributions on a
per-day basis and pay the old and new members their individual shares.
When it comes to hiring, firing, and retiring managers, state law is usually
silent on the issue. So you need to have provisions in your operating agree-
ment that discuss how managers will be retained and replaced. If the LLC is
manager-managed, the operating agreement should state that the members
get to vote every year on whether to replace the current manager. The mem-
bers should also be able to take a special vote to expel the manager at any
time, if need be. Managers should also be admitted in much the same way —
with a vote of the members. As for the manager withdrawing, you have to
choose whether to allow it, and if you do allow it, what penalties will be
assessed. This should also be placed in the operating agreement.
What to do when a member passes away
Although you can decide on your own how your LLC behaves upon a
member’s death, you should know that no matter what, the law protects the
remaining members. Because membership shares of LLCs are considered per-
sonal property, those shares will go through estate and probate much the
same as the other assets of the deceased. The membership shares will be dis-
tributed according to his will or estate plan. Therefore, you can easily end up
with a new partner.
175
Chapter 10: Who Owns What: Deciphering Membership Shares
When you just gotta say goodbye!
Say you gave membership to an employee, and
six months later, you catch him stealing from the
till. You and your partners are furious, and you
decide that the only option is to fire him.
Unfortunately, he still has the membership that
was given to him. Considering that you and your
members want to cut ties with the thief, you
consult your buy-sell agreement.
Luckily, you see that you were smart and
included a provision that allows for the expulsion
of a member. You and your members take a vote
and send a letter to the excommunicated
employee letting him know that he is being
expelled as a member of the LLC and will
receive the value of his shares in a structured
payment plan that suits the company. This is all
in accordance with the buy-sell agreement that
he signed and received a copy of when he was
issued his shares.

The plus side is that, if your operating agreement is worded correctly, the bene-
ficiary of the LLC membership interests has no real power in the company, only
an economic interest. So the beneficiary can only receive the portion of profits
and losses that his membership shares entitle him to. When it comes to voting,
he has no say. When it comes to managing, he must remain silent. He can only
become a full partner if the other partners take a vote and agree.
Now, this isn’t necessarily the status quo in all states; therefore, it’s important
to add a provision in your operating agreement that outlines what happens if
one of the members dies. You may also want to add a provision that states that
the LLC has the right to buy back the shares within a certain timeframe.
Transferring membership shares
You normally can’t automatically transfer your membership shares like you
can when you own stock in a corporation. You must first assign them, which
means that whomever you assign the shares to doesn’t have voting and/or
management rights. They can only receive the distributions. Upon a vote and
agreement among the majority (or whatever you set in your operating agree-
ment) of the members, then the member can be transferred the shares in full,
meaning he will no longer have any restrictions to his membership.
When approving a transfer of membership, most state laws don’t require a
unanimous vote — just a majority. You can put whatever you want in your
operating agreement as long as a majority vote is required.
Not all states make a distinction between transferring membership shares to
members and transferring to nonmembers. However, the IRS doesn’t require
that all members consent when it comes to transferring to other members.
Make sure to have a provision in your operating agreement that goes over this.
When the transfer has been complete, don’t forget to reissue the membership
shares of the LLC to reflect the transfer and, just as important, collect and
cancel the old certificates.
Although you can set up your operating agreement to allow membership inter-
ests to be freely transferred (like stock), you should avoid this. By allowing
the ownership of your company to be freely transferable, you become less like
an LLC in the eyes of the law and more like a corporation. This can be a big
issue when someone sues you, and you ask for charging order protection (see
Chapter 11), a benefit that is exclusive to partnerships such as LLCs.
Regardless of whether you want your membership to be freely transferable,
the feds may not like that idea. In their opinion, any membership shares that
were purchased under a registration exemption such as those listed later in
the chapter, will be considered restricted securities. This means that they can’t
176
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

be offered or resold without the resale taking place under an available
exemption. Otherwise, you must register the securities with the SEC and that
is definitely a process you won’t want to stray from — I promise.
If you or your partners really want to transfer your membership shares and
have obtained approval from the other members, then all you will have to do
is transfer the membership in accordance with one of the exemptions that I
detail in the next section. Also, make sure that the state laws allow for the
same exemption; otherwise, you risk getting in trouble with the locals.
Selling Membership Shares for Dough
Before you can open your business, you most likely need money. More often
than not, the upstart capital for a business comes from the founders and
people willing to finance it for a piece of the action (otherwise known as
investors). Therefore, raising money is a vital aspect of any up-and-coming
business. The good part is that, unlike sole proprietorships or general part-
nerships, LLCs can actually sell portions of the ownership — the member-
ship shares. Membership shares are normally given to investors in return for
cash, property, or other assets. You can also give them to employees or con-
tractors in exchange for their services. This is a great tactic to use if you’re
just starting out and don’t have a lot of money to pay employees.
In some states, you can give promissory notes for future money, property, or
services that someone intends on contributing. That way, you can issue the
shares first, and then the person can make his contribution. You can always
note in your operating agreement that if the individual doesn’t live up to his
promises, his shares are confiscated.
One of the reasons LLCs are quickly becoming the entity of choice for raising
money is because they provide unmatched limited-liability protection for
everyone involved in the business (see Chapter 14 for more on limited-liability
protection).
When setting up your LLC and creating your operating agreement (see
Chapter 9), make sure to list all of the members, their membership interest,
and all of the contributions received from them. This isn’t always necessary,
and the information can be changed later with the members’ approval; how-
ever, I strongly recommend that you follow tradition and keep these pertinent
facts in the operating agreement.
Although you don’t have to issue membership certificates, I always recom-
mend them. They add legitimacy to the investment, and investors like to
have them. If your operating agreement includes restrictions about transfer-
ring the membership, then you should print a notice of these restrictions on
the actual certificate. This notice is commonly called a legend.
177
Chapter 10: Who Owns What: Deciphering Membership Shares

In the following sections, I go over federal and state laws regarding invest-
ments. Then, I show you ways that you can get around the detailed process
of registering your offering with the federal and state securities commissions.
These are called registration exemptions. You should remember that term
because these exemptions will be your lifeline when navigating the securities
law minefield.
Knowing the laws when it comes 
to securing investments
So, you know that an LLC is the best entity to use when raising capital. Now
the question is whether you legally can. After all of the hard work of finding
investors, you’re nearing the finish line and just need to cut a deal, right?
Unfortunately, you may not be able to just take their money. Special securities
laws protect the innocent from bad investments, and you must comply with
these laws before legally raising financing. I know it seems like a pain in the
neck — and it is — but trust me when I say that you do not want to mess with
securities laws. The penalties for noncompliance are steep and include huge
fines and jail time.
Most people think of securities laws and the Securities Exchange Commission
(the SEC) as only applying to large public corporations trading on exchanges
like NASDAQ and NYSE. Not so! If you sell shares of your small business or real
estate property to the general public, then the securities laws apply to you.
To make matters even worse, not only do you have to comply with federal
laws — which are regulated by the SEC — but you also have to follow state
laws. State laws are called blue sky laws. The term blue sky originated from a
judge who said that the advertisement of a certain stock had “about the same
value as an area of blue sky.” When setting up your financing plan, you need
to take state and federal laws into account.
Federal securities laws
The federal government considers anything to be a security if an individual or
entity invests cash, property, services, or other assets into a business and
isn’t involved in the business’s management decisions. This means that
whenever you accept any form of contribution for your membership shares,
you are dealing in securities. Ha! And you thought you had to be some bigwig
Fortune 500 company to do that!
Two major pieces of legislation control all U.S. securities: the United States
Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Both pieces
of legislation have their own sets of rules and regulations and have been
amended numerous times over the years. These acts were set up to protect
the investor, but also make the act of complying with them too difficult for
178
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

most small businesses. First of all, the process of registering your securities
with the Securities and Exchange Commission is not only a lengthy one but
also comes with some enormous expenses, including registration fees, CPA
fees, attorney fees, underwriting fees . . . The list goes on and on.
So, what’s a small business to do if it can’t afford the huge costs of raising
just a little bit of money? Well, the Feds got smart, and they now allow regis-
tration exemptions for businesses that want to raise a limited amount of
money and don’t mind being limited to some pretty strict rules. These are
called exemptions, and I get into them in more detail later in the chapter.
State securities laws (also known as blue sky laws)
If you want to advertise your investment nationally or find investors from all
over the U.S., then you have a long road ahead. It isn’t as simple as just regis-
tering your securities with the state that your LLC was formed in; you have to
register your securities in every state that you seek and/or find investors in.
Because the laws differ from state to state, registering your securities in mul-
tiple states can be very time consuming and very expensive — especially if
you have a securities attorney doing all of the research and filing.
There is a way to get around this, but it will still take some good old-fashioned
research on your part. You can use the registration exemption to get around
having to register your offering with every state securities commission.
Registration exemptions actually started with the federal government. Because
it’s so difficult to register securities with the SEC, the feds decided to cut the
average small-business owner or real estate investor a break and let them
raise money without too much red tape. The problem that occurred, though,
179
Chapter 10: Who Owns What: Deciphering Membership Shares
Securities laws protect you and the economy
Believe it or not, the securities laws in place
help make the United States the economic
superpower that it is today. Before the United
States Securities Act of 1933 was created, the
stock market was a pretty rogue business.
There were no regulations, and anyone invest-
ing in the market was definitely doing so at their
own risk (and risky it was!). It was common for
criminals to create fictitious companies with the
sole purpose of taking the common man’s life
savings and heading for the border. It’s because
of these dishonest practices that when many of
these seemingly legitimate companies failed to
report any earnings, the great Stock Market
Crash of 1929 rocked the nation. When the U.S.
dove into the resulting Great Depression, law-
makers knew that something had to be done.
With lessons learned, the Securities and
Exchange Commission was thus born, and laws
were drawn up that protect the innocent man
from fraudulent investments.

is that companies were easily able to navigate the federal securities laws but
were still getting hung up in all of the red tape created by state securities
commissions. Registering your securities in one state is difficult, and then
add to it all of the states that you intend on finding investors in. There aren’t
enough painkillers in the world to cure that headache!
So, to help out the small businesses and real estate transactions that don’t
raise a large amount of financing (between $1 million and $5 million), the
Uniform Commission of State Laws with the blessing of the SEC tried not only
to put all of the states on the same page, but to offer registration exemptions
that matched those of the federal government.
The resulted was a set of provisions titled the Uniform Limited Offering
Exemption (or ULOE), and the federal government offered them to the states
on a silver platter, begging them to copy and paste that set of securities laws
into their own state statutes. The idea was that if you comply with the federal
registration exemptions, then you’re automatically in compliance with the
state securities laws. Some states agreed, but others only copied part of the
code. Therefore, you and your attorney must go through each state’s code to
see whether that registration exemption is available in your state, and if so,
what the specific rules are.
If you want to file under the ULOE, you can get the SEC Form D document at
www.myllc.com/dummies. Basically, the ULOE took the federal registration
exemptions 505 and 506, made a few simple variations, and then handed
them over to the states, ready for the taking. Just remember: Run things by a
qualified securities attorney before filing!
You are required to register in every state that you advertise your investment
in or take investment from, not just the state that your LLC was formed in.
How the laws apply to you
One of the first ways to legally get around securities laws is to make sure that
when you raise capital, the membership shares you offer aren’t considered
securities in the first place. The best way to determine whether securities
laws apply to your organization is to take a good look at how the management
will be structured after you raise the financing.
 If the investors have a full and equal say in the management of the
company, then the securities laws do not apply.
 If the LLC is managed by separate managers or the investors have limited
managerial powers, then the securities laws do apply.
I like to think that there are a few loose rules to determine whether you will
be selling securities. If any one of these rules applies to your LLC, then you
are automatically required to comply with securities regulations.

 Your LLC is member-managed, but some or all of the investors are junior
managers and don’t have a full say in the business’s day-to-day operations.
 Your LLC has hundreds of members. Even if they all have a say in the
company’s management, there are too many to realistically manage the
day-to-day operations.
 You are widely advertising the investment and looking for multiple
investors.
Now, beware! These guidelines are loose and based on federal interpretations
of the law. When it comes to states, the laws and the interpretations of what a
“security” is differs greatly. For instance, states such as New Mexico, Ohio,
Vermont, and Alaska consider all membership shares to be securities,
whether the LLC is manager-managed or not.
If you are just looking to raise a little bit of money, then I suggest that you
find an investor or two who may have good input in the business operations.
This way, you can avoid a lot of the securities laws, but your investor can
also be an asset in terms of knowledge and experience.
When you want to create a member-managed LLC, make sure that the articles
of organization and the operating agreement both specify that each member
is equally responsible for the operations and success of the LLC. There
should be no centralized management, like corporations, where the share-
holders elect directors, who then elect the officers, who then manage the
LLC. Avoid that structure and instead get used to managing as a team. All
members must collectively be in charge of the major decision making and
have the power to select or remove key employees. (See Chapter 4 for how to
set up a member-managed LLC.)
If you transfer your membership shares to someone, such as a family member,
as a gift, the securities laws do not apply. However, this can only happen once —
you may not make multiple gifts of unrestricted membership shares!
Securities registration exemptions
So, when all is said and done, you have decided that you still want to sell
membership shares as securities. You don’t want your investors to have control
over the operation of the business; you just want them to sit back and be
silent partners. That’s okay. As a matter of fact, because the federal govern-
ment knows how difficult, costly, and time consuming it can be to register
your securities with the SEC, it has provided some exemptions that mostly
apply to small businesses or small projects that are looking to raise a small
amount of capital.
181
Chapter 10: Who Owns What: Deciphering Membership Shares

Now, what I list here only applies to federal exemptions, so you’ll still need to
look at each and every state in which you intend on selling your securities and
determine which laws apply to you and whether you can meet their criteria
for an exemption from registration.
At this stage in the game, I recommend working with a securities attorney
who is familiar with conducting searches on securities laws in multiple
states. To save money, you may be able to work out an agreement with the
attorney in which you take on some of the workload yourself. Just make sure
that, no matter what, the attorney specializes in securities laws. A regular
business attorney normally won’t cut it.
In the following sections, I outline the federal exemptions available to small
businesses. Remember, most states offer some variation of the Rule 505 and
506 exemptions. You should check the laws yourself or contact a securities
attorney who can check for you.
Rules 504, 505, and 506 are called Regulation D Exemptions because they all
belong to Sections 3 and 4 of the Securities Act. If you’re using a Rule 504,
505, or 506 offering exemption, you must read and follow some correspond-
ing general rules. These are Rules 501, 502, 503, 507, and 508. You can find
these at www.myllc.com/dummies.
Intrastate exemption
The intrastate exemption seems better than it is. It requires that you find
investors or members only in the one state that your LLC operates. There are
a few problems with this:
 All of the members of the LLC must be in the same state where the LLC
has its business operations.
 The LLC can’t advertise for investors in any state other than the one
where it has its business operations.
 The LLC can only operate in this one state. This is the worst rule of all
and where most people get disqualified. This means that anything
related to your business can’t be done in any state other than your
home state. You can’t market to people out of state, and you can’t have
customers in or purchase supplies from other states.
In a day and age where the world keeps getting smaller and smaller every
year, it becomes increasingly impossible for most companies to raise money
under this exemption. However, if you’re a small mom-and-pop business that
only operates locally, this exemption may work for you — just make sure that
you don’t do any business out of state. Also, keep in mind that you’ll still be
required to file an exemption with your state’s securities commission. To do
this, file the SEC Form D (which I have uploaded at www.myllc.com/
dummies) with your state securities commission. Just make sure to clear
everything with a qualified securities attorney before doing so.
182
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

Rule 504 exemption
If you’re looking to raise less than $1 million, then you are automatically
exempt from having to register your securities with the SEC. This is the Rule
504 exemption. In general, you can’t advertise the investment opportunity,
and you aren’t required to make any specific disclosures about the invest-
ment. However, all of this must be done within a 12-month period. After that
time, you must register the securities with the SEC or find another exemption.
After you first sell some of your securities, you have to file a Form D, which
includes some basic information about the company, such as the names and
addresses of its owners and stock promoters. You can download a Form D
from www.myllc.com/dummies.
You can only use this exemption if your LLC isn’t selling any other securities
that are registered with the SEC. For instance, if your LLC has another class
of membership that is being offered for $50 million and is registered with the
SEC, the same LLC can’t use this exemption to raise under $1 million.
The federal exemption code that most states have adopted doesn’t cover
Rule 504 exemptions. If you choose to sell securities under the Rule 504 regis-
tration exemption, then you should contact a qualified securities attorney
who can assist you in all of the states you’ll be selling your securities in.
Rule 505 exemption
If you plan to raise less than $5 million, you may be able to use the Rule 505
exemption. It has a few more limitations than the Rule 504 exemption, but this
is natural considering that you’re raising more money. First, you can’t use
general advertising (any advertising that is targeted to the public at large,
such as newspaper ads, TV ads, and so on) to sell your securities. Also, you
can only have a maximum of 35 regular-Joe investors; although, you can have
as many accredited investors as you like.
What’s an accredited investor? It’s a person or institution that meets certain
financial criteria. These investors are well-off enough to suffer the financial
hit of a bad investment. They normally have a net worth of more than $1 mil-
lion. They generally are more educated about investing and can make better
decisions on where to place their money than the average person.
When selling to non-accredited investors — the regular Joes — you must adhere
to the SEC rules regarding investment disclosures. These disclosures outline
the risks inherent in the investment. You must be completely forthright and
disclose everything that the SEC requires you to. Your attorney can help you
write disclosure statements that comply with both federal and state laws.
Like the Rule 504 exemption, you can’t take longer than 12 months to raise
your funds. Also, to use Rule 505, your company must have CPA-certified
financial statements, which can be quite costly since the Sarbanes-Oxley laws
took effect.
183
Chapter 10: Who Owns What: Deciphering Membership Shares

Rule 506 exemption
Rule 506 is the golden rule that most companies raise funds under. When offering
securities under the Rule 506 exemption, you are doing what is called a private
placement, and you can generally raise as many funds as you like. The guidelines
for Rule 506 are very similar to Rule 505. Here, you’re also limited to 35 Joe-
schmo investors, but you can still sell to an unlimited number of accredited
investors. Again, like Rule 505, you can’t do any general advertisement of the
investment. However, if you sell any securities to non-accredited investors, you
must make very specific and comprehensive disclosure statements regarding
the investment to all investors.
To streamline the process of a Rule 506 offering, many companies issue what
is called a private placement memorandum (or PPM, for short), which adheres
to the SEC guidelines on what needs to be disclosed regarding the invest-
ment. If you ever come across investment opportunities that aren’t listed on
the stock exchange, you will most likely see them in this format. Or you may
see what is called an executive summary, which is just a summary of the PPM
that teases your interest in the investment. After you’re interested, you will
most likely be given the full PPM.
A PPM is normally a complete business plan, 30 to 50 pages long, put into a
special format that includes certain disclosures, such as who is involved in
the business and the risks that are inherent to the investment. I encourage
you to be completely forthright when drafting your PPM. Most smart
investors will look for these disclosures and, believe it or not, will be a lot
more confident in the investment when they see that the company is being
very open and honest about the risks involved.
You can always purchase a template for a private placement memorandum
online. However, you may want to have your attorney draft it for you, even
though the cost may be in the thousands. Most templates only comply with
federal laws, and your attorney will have to make sure that your PPM and
your financing plan comply with the blue sky laws (state laws) as well. Not to
mention, your presentation will end up looking much more professional to
prospective investors.
Regulation A exemption
If you plan to raise less than $5 million, you may want to consider offering
your securities under the Regulation A exemption.
With a Regulation A offering, you aren’t limited to the number of Joe-schmo
investors you bring on board. You will still need to do a private placement (a
long-winded form that is comprised of your basic business plan and some
hefty disclosures about the investment); however, Regulation A allows you to
advertise the investment in more ways than a Rule 505 or 506 exemption
184
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

does. For instance, you can use radio or mass mailing to advertise your
investment. Also, when registering under a Regulation A exemption, you can
advertise your investment before having prepared a private placement mem-
orandum, so long as you don’t take in any money. This allows you to test
your response rate before incurring the cost of creating all of your disclosure
and financial statements.
As part of the disclosure, you must show financial statements; however, they
can be unaudited if no audited statements are available.

Record Keeping and Maintaining
the Charging Order
In This Chapter
 Understanding the charging order
 Maintaining your limited liability
 Keeping your company records properly
 Conducting productive meetings
R
ecord keeping is the most important aspect of LLCs and often the least
understood. I would say that the majority of LLC owners in the United
States don’t keep their company records properly, usually because they don’t
know what to do. For most people, the entire concept of recording meeting
minutes and drafting resolutions is foreign. Because of all of the confusing
vocabulary and the lack of reference materials on what exactly needs to be
done, most people just avoid the task altogether. And who can blame them?
You need to take the time to read this chapter and find out how to properly
record your decisions and organize your company records. Then you can
peruse the accompanying CD in this book for the documents you need.
Otherwise, if you ignore your record-keeping obligations, you’ll no doubt end
up in front of a judge with a confused look on your face as he orders the liqui-
dation of your personal assets to settle a petty lawsuit. At that point, it’s too
late to get your records in order. You never want to be caught back-dating
corporate documents at the last minute — it only gets you into more trouble.
You must be diligent about dotting your i’s and crossing your t’s. It’s not
nearly as difficult as you think, and in this chapter, I give you the tools you
need and the steps you must take.

Keeping Your Limited Liability: 
Why It’s Important
Record keeping is just that — the keeping of the records. However, you can
also think of it as the “keeping of the limited liability,” because without main-
taining your records properly, you lose all the benefits of operating as an LLC.
All of the hoopla about LLCs generally stems from one thing — the liability
protection that they offer. LLCs actually offer two types of liability protection:
 A standard veil of limited liability — similar to what corporations offer
their shareholders — that protects the members from the LLC’s debts
and obligations
 A charging order protection that protects the LLC from the members’
debts and obligations
If you’re going to own and operate an LLC, you need to understand what
these layers of liability protection are and how to maintain them. In the fol-
lowing sections, I give you a brief overview of each type and explain what you
need to do to keep each layer of liability protection intact.
Limited liability: It goes both ways
First and foremost, you must understand that LLCs offer the same basic lia-
bility protection that corporations do. In other words, unless you personally
guarantee something, you aren’t responsible for any of the business’s debts,
judgments, or obligations. If your business gets sued, you can rest assured
that your house, your car, and the money in your bank account are safe and
protected.
With corporations, though, the limited liability protection only goes one way.
It protects the business owners from the debts and lawsuits of the busi-
nesses, but it doesn’t protect the business from the owner’s personal law-
suits. If a business owner gets sued personally, his stake in the corporation is
considered a personal asset and can be taken away from him. If the business
owner has a majority of the business’s stock, then the entire business can be
liquidated and the money can be taken.
But LLCs are different, and this is the reason they are the entity of choice.
LLCs are considered partnerships, and under the partnership law that gov-
erns them, a debtor can’t just seize the membership shares of a partnership
like she can corporate shares — this would put the other partners in a bad
position. The law states that partners can’t be forced into an unwanted 
partnership — this would cause the business’s innocent partners to suffer.
188
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

What this means in real life is that a creditor can’t take the LLC membership
shares from the partner in legal trouble; she can’t have a vote or say in the
business; she can’t have a role in managing the company. She can simply
receive profit distributions to those membership shares. Nothing more. This is
called a charging order protection, which I go over in detail in the next section.
Piercing the veil of limited liability
Like corporations, LLCs offer their members a veil of limited liability. This is
the main thing that separates LLCs from general partnerships, which offer
the owners of the business no liability protection at all. (Chapter 2 talks
about what a general partnership involves.)
The best way to understand the term veil of limited liability is to think of your
liability protection as a piece of fabric, a veil that protects you and your per-
sonal assets from your business’s litigious predators. The term specifically
refers to the protection that the LLC provides your personal assets if a law-
suit is filed against the business.
Whenever this veil of protection is breached by a creditor of the LLC and
your personal assets are seized, this is called piercing the veil. In short, the
limited liability, perhaps the most important attribute of an LLC, has been
lost.
The one and only way to keep your veil of limited liability intact is to keep
perfect records in accordance with your state’s laws. You must keep a close
eye on your company’s record-keeping practices. Not only is properly keep-
ing records a practical solution for keeping all partners on the same page, but
it shows the courts that you are a serious business, and it motivates them to
treat you like one.
To pierce your veil, the creditor has to add you, as an individual, to the law-
suit against your company. In the complaint, she will seek to impose personal
liability on you, the owner, for the business’s debts or wrongdoing (in other
words, she’ll plead the court to pierce the veil of limited liability). Then the
creditor has to prove to the court that the veil of limited liability should be
pierced. If the creditor proves that the veil should be pierced, the court will
make you personally responsible for the judgment. This means that the credi-
tor can seize and liquidate your personal assets to settle the claim.
Under most circumstances, the court will pierce the veil of limited liability
and hold the owner responsible for the debts if the creditor can prove one of
six things:
189
Chapter 11: Record Keeping and Maintaining the Charging Order

 Your LLC is an alter ego. This means that the LLC wasn’t treated as an
entity separate from its owner — the LLC’s only job was to do the
owner’s bidding, without actually operating as a business. In this case,
the creditor must establish that the owner failed to separate his per-
sonal financial affairs from the entity’s financial affairs, and/or he failed
to keep proper records and follow established formalities (see the
“Maintaining Company Records Properly” section for more information).
 The LLC was undercapitalized. If you don’t put money into your LLC,
then how can you say that it’s an operating business and that you aren’t
just using it to protect yourself from creditors? You can’t. This is why
you must invest in your business when you purchase the membership
shares. This is the easiest way to satisfy this requirement. After all, if
your business doesn’t have even a little money, the judge may find this a
good reason to pierce the veil and hand over your personal assets to
settle the lawsuit.
 Your LLC is actually a sole proprietorship. Single-member LLCs aren’t
too different from sole proprietorships. They both have pass-through
taxation, and they both have one owner and very few reporting require-
ments. Single-member LLCs are even classified as sole proprietorships
by the IRS. The problem here is that sole proprietorships offer no lim-
ited liability whatsoever. So, to maintain a basic level of limited liability,
the best thing to do is to just take on a partner. Even if your partner is a
friend or a corporation that you control, and only owns a small percent-
age, this prevents the LLC from being classified as a sole proprietorship.
 Your LLC is in “revoked” status. The department that you file your arti-
cles of organization with — usually the Secretary of State’s office — will
require you to file an annual or biannual statement. (I go into more detail
on annual statements of information later in this chapter.) If you miss
your filings, eventually your LLC will go into a revoked status. This means
that your company is no more, as far as the state is concerned. In other
words, the state gave your LLC life, and it can take it away — especially
if you miss filings and don’t pay your state fees. If you’re sued when your
LLC is in a revoked status, the judge can disregard the LLC’s liability pro-
tections and hold you personally responsible for the judgment.
 Your records are incomplete. The law is vague when it comes to the
record-keeping requirements of LLCs. Don’t assume that if there is no
law, no record keeping is required. If you only file your articles of organi-
zation and keep no other records of company activities, a judge can
determine that you’re operating as a general partnership and pierce the
veil of limited liability. To avoid this, stay on the safe side by carefully
following all record-keeping requirements that I outline in this chapter.
 Your LLC has been dissolved. A lot of events can trigger the dissolution
of your LLC. The most common is that your LLC went past its duration
period, and you never renewed it by amending the articles of organiza-
tion and/or the operating agreement. For more information on dissolu-
tions, see Chapter 12.
190
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

Piercing the veil of limited liability is one of the most frequently litigated
issues involving small businesses. If you get a creditor persistent enough to
sue your LLC, you can be confident that she’ll attempt to pierce your veil.
After all, it costs nothing for her to add you to the lawsuit. So you must make
sure all of your ducks are in a row before you ever hit the courtroom.
If you’re doing business in a particular state and haven’t registered to trans-
act business there or aren’t in good standing, don’t worry too much — your
limited liability is still intact. Your status in the state that you originally filed
in (your domicile) is what matters. However, make sure that you catch up on
your filings before heading into court.
What is a charging order?
After a creditor obtains a judgment against you for a certain amount of
money, she can request that the judge grant her what is called a charging
order. In a corporation, your personal creditors can obtain your shares of
stock and can sell them, transfer them, and do whatever else they desire with
them — the shares are theirs. With an LLC, all the creditor gets is a charging
order. A charging order is a special court order which says that if any profits
are distributed to you, they must go to the creditor instead until the debt is
paid. With a charging order, the creditor gets no rights in the business and
has no say. She can just hold on — quietly — and wait to be paid.
Charging orders are so protective to the members of an LLC that if an attor-
ney sees that a savvy business owner has protected his business assets in an
LLC, he will often try to settle or refuse to sue altogether. Charging orders are
a pain in the butt for creditors because they are so restrictive that a creditor
basically just sits there, bound and gagged from making any decisions regard-
ing the company, and waits for the other partners to pay her — should they
choose to.
Because the managers decide if and how much profit is to be distributed to
the members, the managers can actually withhold distributions from all mem-
bers, and the creditor receives nothing. The managers can still take their
salaries, as usual, of course.
The most vital element of record keeping is your operating agreement, to
which I have dedicated all of Chapter 9. Unless you’re in one of the few states
that actually requires creditors to obtain charging orders by law, then you
must provide for them in your operating agreement. If you don’t and you get
sued, then state law can prevail, and your company can be taken away from
you in the blink of an eye.
191
Chapter 11: Record Keeping and Maintaining the Charging Order

Thirteen states provide for charging orders in the statutes (therefore, you
don’t need to provide for them in your operating agreement); they are
Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Illinois, Louisiana,
Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and Virginia. Keep in
mind, though, that even if you are operating in one of these states, I encour-
age you to put the charging order protections in your operating agreement.
Review Chapter 9 for detailed instructions on how to do so.
Why creditors hate charging orders
In order for a creditor to obtain a charging order for your LLC, she must be
granted one by the judge who is handling your case. The charging order gives
the profit distributions you receive from the LLC to the creditor until your
debt is paid. This would seem like a viable solution for most creditors, right?
Think again! From a creditor’s perspective, this seemingly great scenario can
be a nightmare! Creditors normally avoid charging orders like the plague
because
 The creditor can’t force the LLC to make any payments to her. The
LLC’s managers decide how much money is distributed to the members
and to which members it is distributed.
 The charging order doesn’t allow the creditor to have any voting
rights, make any management decisions regarding the LLC’s opera-
tions, or add or withdraw other members. This means that the creditor
holding the charging order can’t make any executive decisions — espe-
cially those that involve distributing company profits to her!
 If the operating agreement allows for it, the LLC’s managers can
refuse to distribute the earnings. How is this bad for the creditor? Well,
the creditor is still required to pay income taxes on these profits as if
they were received. This is called phantom income and a way that a lot
of savvy LLC owners (like you) pass on their income tax burdens to their
creditors instead of their cash.
A creditor who obtains a charging order on your LLC membership shares
doesn’t become the full owner of them. Instead, she becomes a transferee or
assignee who is only entitled to the profits (and the income taxes!) of the LLC,
but isn’t allowed to vote or take any role in managing the company — she
can’t even force a payment of the profits!
The negotiating power of a charging order
The best way to get rid of a creditor is to hold tight and not distribute any
profits to her. This way, because the creditor is considered a substituted
partner in the LLC, she is still required to pay income taxes on the profits she
should have received. Instead of making money, she will be spending it, and
you will have forced her into a much better position to negotiate.
192
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

Unfortunately, while you are doing this, you and your partners can’t take any
profits either. However, you can pay yourself a salary and take company
loans instead. After all, it won’t be for too long! In the meantime, the creditor
has no say about it because she has no management control over the busi-
ness. If you can still pay yourself, why bother distributing membership
shares in the first place? After all, wouldn’t you want to just sit tight and
make the creditor pay for all of your income taxes on the profits instead?
Come to think of it, doesn’t it make you almost want to have someone obtain
a charging order against your LLC?!
After a creditor has a charging order against your LLC and you have put them
in a tight spot where she is dishing out the dough to the IRS (on your behalf!),
you’ll be in a much better negotiating position. At this point, you should try to
settle the judgment debt or just convince her to drop her collection efforts.
Regardless, your business is still intact, and that’s what matters. If you were
operating as a corporation or other type of entity, this wouldn’t be the case.
193
Chapter 11: Record Keeping and Maintaining the Charging Order
How to get rid of a creditor with a charging order
Does a creditor have a charging order against
your LLC interests? If so, here are a few ways to
make her life a nightmare and encourage her to
settle:
 Increase your and your partners’ salaries
(make sure that the salaries remain in line
with similar positions in your industry). Your
intention is to make sure that you’ll have an
income and that very little profit is left in the
company to be distributed at the end of the
year.
 Amend your operating agreement to allow
the company to retain the profits and to
minimize the profit percentage that is dis-
tributed to you (which would be going
directly to your creditor).
 Every six months, send your creditor a letter
stating how well the business is doing and
that you are making sure she is prepared to
pay the taxes on the profits at the end of the
year.
 At the end of the fiscal year, send the cred-
itor the K-1 which states her percentage of
the income generated by the LLC (income
which is being retained by the company and
won’t be distributed). Along with the K-1,
send a letter advising your creditor that she
is required to pay taxes on this income.
 Send a letter to the IRS requesting an audit
of the creditor because you want to be tax
compliant and you want to make sure that
all taxes have been timely paid and are up
to date.
 Send the creditor a copy of the letter sent to
the IRS with an additional copy of the K-1.
 Repeat this process until the creditor is so
saddled with IRS debt and headaches that
she proposes a settlement.
This may seem to be a harsh way of getting rid
of a creditor, but I assure you it’s common prac-
tice. The attorneys that I work with on a day-to-
day basis use this strategy all the time with our
clients. If you are unclear about anything,
though, you should definitely have your attorney
assist you!

Ways to protect your charging order
The worst thing that can happen to you is to think that your assets are pro-
tected, when they really aren’t. To make sure that, no matter what, your LLC
holds up in court and a charging order can be applied, you must do a couple
of things:
 Before a lawsuit, distribute profits regularly. When suing you, if a credi-
tor sees that your LLC doesn’t distribute profits regularly to its mem-
bers, a creditor can petition the courts to allow her to foreclose on the
member’s shares. This means that if state law allows, and the courts
agree, the creditor can become the new legal owner of those LLC mem-
bership shares and have all the rights and powers that you once had.
After your creditor has obtained a charging order, you can then stop dis-
tributing the profits.
 Have at least two members in your LLC. This one is important. LLCs
have this special charging order rule to protect the innocent partners in
the business. If the business has no other partners, then the creditor
can apply to have the charging order circumvented and can seize your
company right out from underneath you. I also recommend that the
other member is not your spouse. If you have no one else whom you can
trust to act as the other member, then you can always form a corpora-
tion to serve as the second member. And remember — that other
member can own a very small percentage.
 Classify the LLC as manager-managed. If you classify your LLC as
member-managed instead of manager-managed (see Chapter 4 for more
details), then any creditor who obtains the assets may be able to
manage the LLC to the same extent as the owner. Even if all members
will equally manage the business, I suggest that you still classify the LLC
as manager-managed and name each person, individually, as a manager
of the LLC.
 Elect pass-through taxation. Theoretically, an LLC that looks and acts
like a corporation can be treated as a corporation by the courts. This is
the one drawback of electing to be taxed as a corporation as opposed to
sticking with the pass-through taxation that is the default for partner-
ships. For more information on pass-through taxation, see Chapter 2.
Maintaining Company Records Properly
One of the most debated aspects of LLCs is how much record keeping they
are required to do. They definitely don’t have the strict record-keeping
requirements of corporations, but the laws about what record keeping is 
194
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

necessary are pretty vague. However, to be safe and not put yourself at risk
of having your veil of limited liability pierced (see the “Piercing the veil of
limited liability” section earlier in the chapter), you should keep detailed
records of all of your company activities and go through many of the same
formalities that corporations do.
Throughout the following sections, I go over all of the pertinent record-keep-
ing requirements, including
 Storing your records in a special customized company kit
 Maintaining your membership roll
 Keeping your tax and financial records organized
 Holding regular meetings with the other members and managers of the
company
 Drafting resolutions which document your major company decisions
 Documenting your corporate activities in the meeting minutes
I know that this all seems incredibly time consuming, but believe it or not,
this stuff isn’t that difficult! Your company records don’t have to be perfectly
drafted in complex legalese either. Even if you write and sign your company
resolutions on the back of a napkin and hold your company meetings with
your partner at the local bar — it’s still better than nothing and will most
likely still hold up in court. The point I’m trying to get across is this: Just get
it done!
Completing the company kit
Although it’s not necessary or required by law, a company kit can be a god-
send. It will keep everything organized for you and cover your butt if you end
up in court. With it comes your company seal, which in most states is
required by law. Your company seal is a little device that imprints your com-
pany name and formation date onto paper. It’s often used to show that a doc-
ument is a true and original copy that was verified by the company.
The kit is not very complicated. It’s normally a nice binder that is closed by
either a zipper or in a slipcase. The kit allows you to easily carry your corpo-
rate records from place to place. If you intend on meeting with banks or pri-
vate investors for capital, you will definitely want a corporate kit. It’s the only
truly accepted method of presenting your company documents in an orga-
nized and professional manner.
195
Chapter 11: Record Keeping and Maintaining the Charging Order

Don’t order your corporate kit through your attorney or incorporating 
service — you will pay a premium price. Instead, order it online from a 
corporate kit supplier. My company uses CorpTech Supply (www.corptech
supply.com) — all kits are completely customized and are shipped the
same day you order (two-day shipping is included in the price). Most of their
kits are $59.
When ordering from a kit supplier, your company kit should come with the
following:
 A professional binder that either zips closed or is enclosed in a match-
ing slipcase, and is customized with your LLC’s name on the spine
 A seal customized with your LLC information
 Custom-made, numbered membership certificates printed with your
company name
 A complete set of index divider tabs. The actual tabs may vary, but they
should include articles of organization, operating agreement, and mem-
bership certificates.
 Some blank template documents including a sample operating agree-
ment, some sample meeting minutes, and a sample membership
issuance agreement
 A blank membership roll
 Perhaps some business licensing information that is applicable for your
state
After you receive your kit, you should keep the following documents in your
company kit:
 Your state-filed articles of organization and company charter
 Your operating agreement
 Your company meeting minutes and resolutions
 Your membership roll
 Any cancelled membership certificates
 Your federal tax ID number and filing
 Your business licenses and state filings
 Any foreign filings that you have made in other states
 Your company’s registered agent information for each state
196
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

If your attorney is forming your entity, he must supply you with a corporate
kit. This is the standard practice and is the only professional thing to do.
Some attorneys try to save money and make their own corporate kits out of
plastic binders that they buy at the local office supply store. Those attorneys
also don’t often supply their clients with company seals. If your attorney
does this, you should consider where else he may be shorting you on value.
Creating a membership roll is very simple. You just take the blank form that
you received in your company kit and fill in each member’s name and
address. Next to this information, put the amount of membership shares each
person has. Make sure to update the roll every time your LLC’s membership
changes. Some states even require that you supply your registered agent with
an updated copy of your membership roll. That way, if any of your members
wants to view the membership roll, they can arrange to do so with your regis-
tered agent.
Staying up-to-date with annual reports
Shortly after you file your articles of organization, you must file a statement
of information (also called an initial report, depending on the state; see
Chapter 8). This filing normally states such information as your managers
and/or members, their addresses, your corporate headquarters, registered
agent and address, and so on.
In most states, you are required to file this form every year, in which case it
becomes known as the annual report. Some states, like Alaska, only require
you to file this form once every two years. The fees that go with these filings
vary from state to state. Check Appendix A for your state’s annual fee.
Always file your annual report on time. In most states, if you fail to file this
form once, you’ll go into a “default” status until the filing is made. If a full year
passes and you still haven’t filed the form, your LLC will then be revoked,
which is a similar to being forcibly dissolved. Not good.
If you are sued while you are in revoked status, piercing the veil of limited lia-
bility is easy. After all, your LLC doesn’t even exist in the eyes of the state.
The annual filing is the first step to protecting your LLC — if you fail at this
step, then you shouldn’t even bother with the rest.
197
Chapter 11: Record Keeping and Maintaining the Charging Order

Tracking tax filings and 
financial information
Your tax returns and financial reports show the backbone of your business.
These records undeniably prove that your LLC is an operational business.
Because they are backed up by bank statements and receipts, they are taken
very seriously by the courts as testimony to the intricacies of your business.
You need to hang on to your pertinent tax records and financial statements
for seven years. These tax records show the courts that your company is,
financially, a separate entity — in other words, you and your LLC don’t share
a bank account. Your financial information proves that you have been
actively engaging in business and not using the entity as an extension of
yourself (also called an alter ego).
Your operating agreement (see Chapter 9) should designate what sort of
financial reports the members have access to and how they can go about
viewing the records. Tax returns, balance sheets, and profit-and-loss state-
ments should be kept at your corporate office in case one of the partners
wants to view this information. Also, in the event of a lawsuit, you will most
likely be required to hand copies of this information over to the plaintiff.
Let’s Keep in Touch! Holding 
Regular Meetings
What would a business be without meetings? You know — those boring
snooze fests where the only thing that is usually accomplished is a mutual
sense of frustration? Yeah, those. But, at least you can skip out on them from
time to time (which really means every time). After all, it isn’t like they are
legally required, right? Wrong. The government has managed to make every-
one’s least favorite pastime an actual legal requirement. Luckily, the govern-
ment is pretty lax when it comes to LLCs (as opposed to corporations), and
therefore, meetings only need to take place once a year and before making
important decisions that affect the fate of your company.
There is a plus side, however. What the law doesn’t state is where the meeting
must take place. And anywhere it does take place, you can deduct the travel
expenses. Umm . . . Hawaii, anyone? Tahiti, perhaps? Aruba? It doesn’t matter
if it’s just you and your business partner. Or, if a corporation that you own is
the only other partner, then it’ll be a lonely party of one on the island.
198
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

The most important aspect of the meeting is the meeting minutes. Minutes
are the detailed records of what took place at the meeting. Larger companies
have secretaries who record the discussions as meeting minutes while the
meeting takes place. The minutes of smaller companies just record any issues
that were brought up in the meeting and any decisions that were made
(called resolutions). Minutes serve as a record that all partners in the busi-
ness got together to discuss the issues at hand and that all major decisions
were approved by a majority of the partners.
Deciding when to meet
Corporations are required to meet annually to go over corporate business.
However, LLCs aren’t obligated to have set meetings unless the LLC’s operat-
ing agreement requires them. I recommend that you provide for yearly meet-
ings in the operating agreement. I believe it’s important for all of the partners
to get together with the sole purpose of discussing infrastructure and busi-
ness affairs. It’s also a common practice for LLC members to reelect the man-
agers at these annual meetings.
In addition to the annual meeting, you should call a meeting if
 A legal or tax issue needs to be addressed, approved, and recorded
 Membership shares are to be issued or transferred
 There is a change in management or managers need to be elected
 Assets need to be sold
 Major purchases need to be made
 Leases or other debts need to be incurred
 The company is to be dissolved
 The company’s name changes
 Any other pertinent decisions need to be made that require the consent
of all of the partners
Assembling the members for the meeting
In order for it to be worth your while to hold a meeting in the first place, you
have to have what is called a quorum. A quorum is the number of members it
takes to pass a vote and should be stated in your operating agreement. If it’s
not stated there, the state law prevails. Some states require a simple majority
of the members (51 percent); other states require three-quarters. Without the
proper number of members showing up at the meeting, a vote can’t take place.
199
Chapter 11: Record Keeping and Maintaining the Charging Order

For instance, if your LLC’s operating agreement states that the quorum is a
majority of the members, and four of your ten members show up, then a
quorum is not present. You would need to have six members for a quorum.
Otherwise, nothing can be resolved by a vote.
If getting all of your members together for a meeting is like herding cats, then
you may want to allow your members to vote by proxy. A proxy vote is cast
by a person (a proxy) on behalf of a member who can’t attend the meeting.
The member will tell the proxy how they want their votes represented. Proxy
votes count toward meeting a quorum.
Like most non-Fortune 500 companies, you most likely can’t afford to hire a
special proxy voting service. If you want to allow your members to vote by
proxy, you can send out cards or a sheet of paper that describes the issues
up for debate and allows the member to check how they want to vote. After
they have marked their response, they send in their card to the proxy, who
represents them at the meeting.
Is it hard for you to get all of your members in one place? You can have your
meetings in cyberspace! There are a lot of different software solutions for
online meetings. Some sites that facilitate this are www.gotomeeting.com
and www.webex.com.
Just a minute: Holding the meeting and recording minutes
As much as you dread the idea, you know you have to call a meeting. I’m sure
you’ve spent more hours than you’d care to count attending seemingly point-
less meetings called by your colleagues. You want your meetings to be a valu-
able use of time, and you want everyone to leave the meeting feeling as if
something worthwhile was accomplished. There is a way to do this.
Say your Uncle Joe wants to get involved with your business and is even will-
ing to make a sizeable investment in exchange for some membership. You
approach two of your five partners, and they agree that it’s a good idea. It’s
time to call a meeting.
Here are the steps that you will take:
1. Loosely gather information from your partners on what would be a
good date and time for the meeting. Then prepare a notice of meeting
and send it to all partners.
2. Prepare a meeting agenda with all of the items that you would like to
resolve. Make a copy of the agenda for all partners in attendance.
In this case, you include an agenda item to discuss whether your Uncle
Joe should become an investor.
200
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

3. At the meeting, appoint a chairperson, who conducts the meeting, and
a secretary, who documents the votes and the resulting decisions that
are made.
4. The chairperson calls the meeting to order — the meeting has begun.
5. The secretary determines whether a quorum is present. (See the
“Assembling the members for the meeting” section for an explanation
of a quorum.)
6. If any unfinished business was tabled at the last meeting and needs to
be addressed at this meeting, the secretary reads the minutes of the
last meeting.
All issues that are being carried over from the last meeting are
addressed first.
7. The managers present their reports on how the company is operating.
This is not required, but a lot of your silent partners will appreciate it, I
promise.
8. Go over the agenda items one by one and discuss them. Then take a
vote of the members. Make sure to write down what was discussed!
The notes you take during the discussions and votes will become the
minutes.
9. Adjourn the meeting.
10. The secretary drafts the minutes of the meeting — in the proper
format (you can find an example on the accompanying CD) — and
sends them to all of the members for their signatures.
If there are too many members, the secretary can sign the minutes 
herself.
Resolutions to be on the lookout for
When an item has been voted upon and approved by the quorum of mem-
bers, it’s called a resolution. Here are some common resolutions that you may
have to put in your meeting minutes:
 Resolution for the treasurer to open and use LLC bank accounts along
with a designation of authorized signers
 Resolution for adoption of a fictitious firm name (a “DBA”)
 Resolution for the approval of a contract
 Resolution for the lease of property by the LLC
 Resolution for the purchase or sale of real property by the LLC
 Resolution for the LLC to elect corporate tax treatment
201
Chapter 11: Record Keeping and Maintaining the Charging Order

 Resolution for the acquisition of an independent audit of the LLC’s tax
and financial records
 Resolution of the LLC’s fiscal tax year
 Resolution to amend the LLC’s articles of organization
 Resolution to amend the LLC’s operating agreement
 Resolution designating membership distributions
 Resolution approving additional capital contributions by members
 Resolution admitting a new member
 Resolution allowing the transfer of membership
 Resolution approving the LLC’s purchase of the membership shares of a
withdrawing member
 Resolution appointing LLC managers
 Resolution approving salaries and bonuses of key employees

Knowing Your Exit Strategy:
Dissolutions and Extensions
In This Chapter
 Reviewing the reasons your LLC can go kaput
 Knowing how the dissolution process works
 Avoiding the tax traps that dissolutions can cause
A
ll good things come to an end — your LLC is no different. Sometimes
things just don’t go as planned and you decide that you need to close
up shop. Other times, legal technicalities get in the way and you are forced
into what is called a technical dissolution, which I explain in greater detail
later in the chapter. In legal terms, the termination of the LLC is called a disso-
lution, or in some states, a termination.
Dissolving doesn’t necessarily mean that you are giving up your business. In
some cases, you’re just dissolving on paper or for tax purposes, but it doesn’t
affect your day-to-day business operations. Other times, you will be shuttering
your services and calling it quits. Whatever your reasoning, you need to make
sure that you do it right. The devil is in the details — if you don’t cover all of
your bases before dissolving, you can end up with a hassle later on.
When terminating your business operations, a proper dissolution allows you
to tie up all the business’s loose ends so it quietly fades away with its paper-
work in order and all of its affairs wrapped up. A dissolution wreaks less
havoc in the long run and keeps your previous business dealings from
coming back to haunt you. It allows you and your partners a fresh start to
pursue your next big idea.
Before dissolving your LLC, I advise you to thoroughly review this chapter and
get with your members and create a detailed plan. This way, you’re all on the
same page and there are no arguments later. After you have created this plan,
get your accountant to take a look at it and advise you of any major tax conse-
quences that may occur. If you change your plans at any stage, run them by
your accountant to make sure that you aren’t walking into a huge tax trap.

Help! It’s Melting! Examining the
Reasons Your LLC May Dissolve
One of the big things that sets LLCs apart from corporations is that they
weren’t originally meant to have a perpetual existence, meaning that they
aren’t supposed to operate indefinitely. LLCs weren’t designed to be long-last-
ing entities, and because of this, they are much easier to wrap up and dis-
solve than other entities. This is one of the reasons why LLCs are the best 
bet around for short-term projects, such as movies or real-estate deals.
Here’s a list of common reasons why your LLC may dissolve, which I cover in
detail in the following sections:
 Your business isn’t working out — management is deadlocked over an
issue, or the company isn’t profitable — therefore, the members decide
unanimously to terminate the LLC.
 One of the members (if state law provides for this) directly or indirectly
terminates the company. In most states, it only takes one member to
trigger a dissolution. He can do this by:
• Being kicked out by the other members (in other words, expelled)
• Passing away
• Going bankrupt
• Retiring and choosing to resign as a member
• Going insane or becoming incompetent in some way
 The IRS or the courts order you to dissolve your LLC. This is commonly
caused by a bankruptcy or if your business is caught red-handed in
criminal acts.
 You have reached the set dissolution date for your LLC as stated in your
articles of organization.
 You have sold or transferred more than 50 percent of the company
within a 12-month period, and you’re subject to a tax termination.
 You fail to file your state reports and the Secretary of State terminates
your LLC.
 The articles of organization or operating agreement states that the LLC
is to dissolve when a specific event occurs, such as the sale of a patent
or technology. After that event occurs, let the dissolution begin.
 You are a licensed professional, such as a physician or an attorney, and
you lose your license. If you are operating under a professional LLC,
there is a good chance your LLC will need to be terminated.
204
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

You just want to dissolve: 
At-will dissolutions
Business is hard. Really hard. If you’re tired of struggling and have decided to
throw in the towel, don’t beat yourself up about it — you’re not alone. One in
ten businesses don’t make it past their first year. And because you had the
foresight to set up your businesses as an LLC, it should be relatively painless
to close the doors.
If you used an LLC for a short-term project, such as film financing or a real
estate deal, maybe the project has run its course, so you dissolve the opera-
tion and split the cash among the members. Simple as pie.
Some states only require that three-quarters of the members need to vote for
a dissolution in order for it to happen. If you own one-quarter or less of the
LLC, it could easily be dissolved under your nose! You can protect against
this by specifying in your operating agreement that it takes a unanimous vote
of the members for a dissolution to occur.
Now, the complications arise when one member wants to dissolve and the
others don’t. Or it’s split fifty-fifty. Unless you have specified otherwise in
your operating agreement, most states dictate that when one or more mem-
bers decide to resign, the remaining members still have the option of continu-
ing on with the company. I go over this in more detail in the next section.
The at-will dissolution is relatively simple to perform. If all the members are
on board and no legal proceedings are looming over the LLC, terminating the
company is easy. I cover the process in the “Undergoing the Dissolution
Process” section later in the chapter.
Considering that LLCs are separate from their owners, they can file bank-
ruptcy separate from their owners as well. This means that your company
can handle its debts through bankruptcy without your personal credit being
affected. When an LLC wants to file bankruptcy and call it quits, it files for
Chapter 7 bankruptcy. When an LLC wants to file bankruptcy but stay in busi-
ness (called a reorganization), it files Chapter 11 bankruptcy. If you are a
single-member LLC, you may be able to file a personal bankruptcy. When
filing for bankruptcy, you must work with a qualified bankruptcy attorney
who can assist you in doing it legally and without any tax consequences.
Disassociating yourself from the LLC doesn’t dissolve it. Even if you are a
single-member LLC, selling or assigning your membership shares to someone
isn’t considered a dissolution. An LLC is an entity separate from yourself. The
LLC is still in existence; it’s just that now the other person owns it and all of
its assets.
205
Chapter 12: Knowing Your Exit Strategy: Dissolutions and Extensions

I know that sometimes people ignore things, hoping that they go away. But if
the company isn’t doing well, you can’t sell it, and your heart isn’t in it any-
more, then you should definitely take a couple of days and do a formal disso-
lution. When you file everything properly and go about paying the debts as
best you can, nothing can come back to haunt you later. The extra peace of
mind that you get from going that extra mile will be worth it, I promise.
Being left in the dust by a member
There are a zillion reasons why a member might leave his membership
behind. Some will make you sad (he passes away or loses his sanity); some
will make you jealous (he retires); and some will make you irate (he empties
the bank account and heads for Mexico). But regardless, you still have to
address these matters because they can cause your LLC to dissolve if you
aren’t careful.
If a member experiences any of the following, your LLC is in jeopardy of 
dissolving:
 Death
 Retirement
 Resignation
 Bankruptcy
 Expulsion
It doesn’t matter what percentage of the LLC the member owns; she could
own only 2 percent, and, in some states, single-handedly dissolve the LLC.
When working with partners, you need to protect your interests. You don’t
want to work hard to build your future, only to have it torn down by some
minority partner. This is where the operating agreement becomes vital.
Although most states have laws that allow the members to continue the LLC,
you don’t know what the specifications and technicalities are. With LLCs, you
can make your own rules, so make sure to specify in the operating agreement
that the remaining members can vote to continue the LLC if one of these mat-
ters befalls a member. Then take it a step further and specify whether the
decision to continue should be unanimous, or if a three-quarters or majority
vote “yes” is enough to continue the LLC. Remember, these decisions affect
you big time. You need to make these judgments; don’t trust your state laws.
If the remaining member (or members) just doesn’t want to deal with the
company anymore, then she should go through the formal dissolution
process that I outline in the “Undergoing the Dissolution Process” section
later in the chapter.
206
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

The laws on LLCs vary widely from state to state. For instance, in South
Carolina, if a member invested a total of $10,000 for 5 percent of the business,
she can demand that $10,000 back at any time during the course of business.
If she can’t get it back — for instance, if the company is tight on cash at the
moment — she can legally dissolve the LLC all by herself simply by filing arti-
cles of dissolution with the Secretary of State. Even if she only owns 5 per-
cent of the business! The members can’t say anything about it. For this
reason, it’s imperative that you specify in your operating agreement and/or
buy-sell agreement, the company policies on dissolving. See Chapter 9 for
more help on this.
After a member leaves the LLC and you have decided to continue operations,
make sure that you redistribute the membership shares accordingly among
the remaining members. You should distribute new membership certificates
to the remaining members and document the new ownership percentages in
the company minutes.
207
Chapter 12: Knowing Your Exit Strategy: Dissolutions and Extensions
When expelling a member is the only choice
Chris, Alex, and Brad, best friends from college,
decided to form a Web design and hosting com-
pany that caters to small businesses in New
York City. Things were going great for a couple
of years, the business was making money, and,
while not wealthy, the guys could cover their
living expenses. Around the third year in, things
took a turn for the worse. Brad started partying
all night at the clubs and got hooked on drugs
and alcohol. His life started to spiral out of con-
trol, and Alex and Chris were concerned. They
tried to talk to Brad, but he got defensive, and it
only made things worse between them.
After a few months, Brad had run out of money.
He started using his company credit card to pay
for his late-night escapades. The guys decided
to take Brad off the bank account, but because
the LLC was member-managed, he just put him-
self right back on. He was dragging the com-
pany down, and after not being able to make
payroll, Chris and Alex realized that their only
solution was to expel him from the company.
They wanted to do this the legal way, so they
took their operating agreement to their attorney
and had a powwow. Their operating agreement
and state law stated that they could expel a
member if he was incapable of operating the
business.
The guys then sat down with Brad for lunch and
gave him the hard news. They passed him a
letter that documented that they had used their
collective 66 percent of the company to expel
him. They included a cashier’s check that cov-
ered his initial contribution and his portion of
what the company was worth. Chris and Alex
had to take out a business loan to cover this, but
they knew that it was their only hope of saving
what they had worked for. Brad protested, but
he legally had no recourse. Alex and Chris tried
to remain friends with Brad, but after many
unsuccessful interventions, they eventually
parted ways.

‘Cause the IRS says so
Believe it or not, the IRS can actually dissolve your entity. Well, sort of. It’s
not a full dissolution, so to speak — it will be what’s called a tax termination.
Your LLC will still keep on kicking, and the Secretary of State’s office will 
definitely keep sending you invoices and reports that you need to file. A tax
termination just means that, in the eyes of the IRS, your LLC has dissolved
and distributed all of its assets to a brand-new LLC (which, as far as you are
concerned, is really just the same LLC as you were using before).
So, what does it take to trigger one of these so-called tax terminations? One
of two things can happen
 Your LLC suddenly stops conducting business for a lengthy period of
time.
 You sell or transfer 50 percent or more of the membership of the LLC
within a 12-month period.
The latter of the two is the most common. If you stop doing business, the IRS
waits until you actually liquidate and distribute the cash to the members
before considering it a termination.
In the event of a tax termination, your tax election is dumped and a new one
must be made. Remember when you chose to be taxed like a corporation for
a couple of years until you got your business up and running? Well, that’s a
tax election. When you elect to be taxed as a corporation, you are sort of
blocking yourself in because you can’t change your tax election for five years
(see Chapter 13 for more on tax elections).
Because tax terminations ditch that entity classification election, you can
reorganize your company if you decide you want to be taxed like a partner-
ship and don’t want to wait for five years. The easiest way to reorganize your
LLC is to have a corporation be a member of the LLC. When you want to trig-
ger a tax termination, you just form a new corporation and transfer the LLC’s
membership to that entity. Assuming you transfer more than 50 percent of
the membership, this is a quick and easy way to change from corporation tax
status back to a partnership tax status.
If your LLC has been tax terminated, you don’t need to file new articles of
organization or even acquire a new tax ID. Really, you don’t have to do much
of anything except consult with your company accountant so he can work
out the tax issues, if there are any. However, you and your partners may have
to recognize a gain or a loss on your personal federal tax returns. Therefore,
you may want to just head to your accountant’s office to have a little chat.
Nothing big — just so he knows what’s going on and can plan for it.
208
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

I know tax terminations can be incredibly confusing. Just sit back, ’cause the
whole dissolved/not dissolved thing happens pretty instantaneously. It’s
strange, I know, but don’t forget — it’s the IRS we’re talking about here!
After a tax termination has occurred, you need to elect a new tax year. You do
this by filing IRS Form 1128. You can download a copy at www.myllc.com/
dummies.
If you get hit with an unexpected tax termination, don’t fret! They are usually
completely tax-free events. Just make sure that your accountant knows
what’s happening.

Chapter 12: Knowing Your Exit Strategy: Dissolutions and Extensions
The history of the fictional dissolution
By now, you are probably wondering why on
earth going through this process of dissolutions
when you plan to keep the company going is
even necessary. I know that it makes zero
sense, but it’s just one of those formalities that
happens when our federal and state govern-
ments are a little too slow to adapt to the con-
stantly changing nature of business. Let me
explain. When Wyoming first decided to allow
the illustrious LLC, the IRS had no idea how to
tax it. It was sort of like a corporation (liability
protection for all) and sort of like a partnership
(the profits and losses pass through to the
owners). Because it looked like a corporation,
yet still wanted to be taxed like a partnership,
the IRS decided that at the LLC could choose
from four corporate characteristics. It could
only choose two, though, because otherwise it
would be too similar to a corporation and could
not be taxed like a partnership.
These four corporate characteristics are limited
liability, centralized management, perpetual life,
and free transferability of ownership. Lawmakers
felt that the two most important facets were the
limited liability and the centralized management
(LLCs can have separate managers) and there-
fore set up the following regulations to differen-
tiate the LLC from corporations:
 There must be a limited duration; in other
words, it can’t “technically” continue on for
the rest of eternity like corporations can.
 Membership shares cannot be freely 
transferred.
In response to this, most of the states decided to
add their own laws which alleviated some of the
pain of having to dissolve so soon after forming
the LLC. They added in their statutes that,
should the members vote and agree, they can
choose to continue the existence. Now do you
understand why I call it a “fictional dissolu-
tion”? Even though during the formation you
have to choose a termination date, you don’t
really ever have to dissolve!
Because of this obviously “fictional” dissolution
requirement, the IRS has started to ease up its
restrictions. Thankfully, it now allows corpora-
tions to have pass-through taxation like partner-
ships (S corporations) and limited liability
companies to elect to be taxed like corporations.

You’ve reached the set dissolution date
When LLCs were first created, one of the big things that set them apart from
corporations (and thus allowed them to have the favorable pass-through tax
status) was that they didn’t have a perpetual existence. Luckily, the IRS has
smartened up to their absurdity, and this is no longer the case. However, this
explains why you have to put a duration, or a dissolution date, in your articles
of organization in most states. The most common is a 30-year duration. That
means that 30 years after the initial formation date, the LLC has to dissolve.
Although the IRS has moved forward, most states still require your LLC to be
limited in its lifespan. Well, if you have any sense at all, you most likely don’t
want to spend 30 years building a company only to kill it off after it has
reached critical mass on the success scale. You don’t have to! Luckily for you,
you can specify in your operating agreement that the members of the LLC
can choose to continue the business past the proposed dissolution date —
which is why this is called a fictional dissolution. And unless you decide it’s
time to pack up and move on, there’s no good reason why you wouldn’t
choose for the LLC to carry on with operations.
Later in the chapter in the “It Just Keeps Going and Going: Using an Extension
to Avoid Dissolution” section, I show you how to extend the life of your LLC
when a dissolution date is looming.
If you have reached the end of your duration and your termination date is
near, make sure that you act fast! Most states require that you and your part-
ners get together and vote on whether to continue the business within 
90 days of the termination date.
It Just Keeps Going and Going: Using 
an Extension to Avoid Dissolution
Business is going great, and before you know it, you’re hit with a dissolution.
Lots of things can trigger an unwanted dissolution, which I discuss in the
“Help! It’s Melting! Examining the Reasons Your LLC May Dissolve” section
earlier in the chapter, but how do you get out of a dissolution when it occurs?
You do what’s called an extension. This is where the operating agreement
comes in handy. Your operating agreement allows you to decide what hap-
pens in the event that you are faced with an unwanted dissolution. If your
operating agreement doesn’t address this situation, you’ll fall victim to the
state’s rules.
210
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

Chapter 9 covers how to create or amend an operating agreement. Go
through the steps there and amend your operating agreement so that it speci-
fies that you can continue the LLC by a vote, instead of dissolving.
After your operating agreement is set up properly, you can take the following
steps when faced with an unwanted dissolution:
1. Hold a meeting of the members.
2. Take a vote on whether to dissolve or continue the LLC.
3. Make a record of the resolution that was made by the members.
4. Put that resolution in the company minutes.
For more details on all this voting, meeting, and minutes stuff, head over to
Chapter 11, where I explain the ins and outs of each of the steps above.
Keep in mind that if your dissolution date is looming, you’ll want to take
these steps as early as possible and extend the life of your LLC before it actu-
ally passes the dissolution date.
If you are voting to extend the life of your LLC because of a dissolution date
in your articles of organization, you’ll have to vote to amend the articles
(which I explain how to do in Chapter 11) and then file the amendment with
the Secretary of State’s office.
If, however, your LLC is facing dissolution because a member died, resigned,
or experienced one of the other events listed in the “Being left in the dust by
a member” section earlier in this chapter, the member who created the disso-
lution event normally doesn’t get a vote (unless you state otherwise in your
operating agreement) when the other members vote on whether to continue
the LLC. Therefore, if you have three members, and you own 40 percent,
while the other remaining member owns 30 percent, and it only takes a
majority to approve the continuation, then you have the majority and can
take the vote all by yourself.
Upon the occurrence of one of these dissolution events, you don’t have much
time to get your act (and the members!) together. You often must take a vote
and resolve to continue the LLC within 90 days of the triggering event!
Undergoing the Dissolution Process
With all of the things to do, it almost seems harder to dissolve an LLC than it
does to form one in the first place! It makes sense though, considering that
after years in business, your LLC may have a lot of baggage, so to speak. It’s
like a divorce — the longer you have been married, the more stuff there is to
211
Chapter 12: Knowing Your Exit Strategy: Dissolutions and Extensions

sort out. My goal in this section is to take you through the dissolution steps,
one by one, so you can file your two-page dissolution form with the Secretary
of State’s office and know that you are completely protected from anything
coming up in the future and biting you in the butt.
Everyone must go through a three-step process when dissolving an LLC:
1. Acknowledging the end is here.
This is simple — the LLC is legally forced to dissolve, or the members
vote to discontinue the business. Either way, coming to terms with the
fact that the company is going to be dissolved and coordinating the
logistics of it is what this first step is all about.
2. Winding up the affairs.
This is probably the longest and most arduous process of them all. The
longer you have been in business, the harder this step may be because
of the sheer amount of paperwork, creditors, clients, and business asso-
ciates that you have acquired over the years. Here, you make all of your
last filings and liquidate the company. You then distribute the assets:
first paying creditors, then any members the company owes money to,
then you return the investments of the members, and finally distribute
the profits according to each member’s percentage of the company.
3. Terminating the company.
This part is probably the easiest — it’s all just filing paperwork. Before
doing anything, you want to make sure that you are in good standing
with the Secretary of State’s office. You can’t file a dissolution until you
are caught up with your previous years. Why? Because they want your
money, of course! Then, if you are operating in multiple states, you’ll
want to withdraw from those states. I show you how to do this later in
the chapter. After you have withdrawn from all of the states that you are
foreign filed in, you must file articles of dissolution in your home state.
Read your state statutes regarding dissolutions. You can find a list of state
Web sites in Appendix A. If you don’t like your state’s laws and guidelines,
then I urge you to create your own rules and stick them in your operating
agreement. I show you how to do this in Chapter 9.
In the following sections, I cover the most important dissolution processes in
detail. For now, though, this checklist gives you an idea of the baby steps you
should follow within the bigger steps I outlined earlier. The list also includes
the paperwork involved to successfully dissolve your LLC:
 Hold a meeting of the members and vote to terminate the LLC.
 Liquidate all LLC assets.
212
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

 Make final federal tax deposits — IRS Form 8109B.
 File final quarterly or annual employment tax forms:

• Form 943, Employer’s Annual Tax Return for Agricultural
Employees (if necessary)
• Form 943A, Agricultural Employer’s Record of Federal Tax Liability
 Issue final wage and withholding information to employees — IRS 
Form W-2.
 Report W-2 information to the IRS — IRS Form W-3.
 If necessary, file the final IRS Form 8027, Employer’s Annual Information
Return of Tip Income and Allocated Tips.
 File federal tax returns:
• Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return
• Form 1065, U.S. Partnership Return of Income
• Form 1065 (Schedule K-1), Partner’s Share of Income, Credits,
Deductions, etc.
• Form 1120 (Schedule D), Capital Gains and Losses
 Issue payment information to subcontractors — IRS Form 1099-MISC.
 Report information from 1099s issued — IRS Form 1096.
 Report business asset sales — IRS Form 8594.
 Report the sale or exchange of property used in the LLC — IRS 
Form 4797.
 File final employee pension/benefit plan — IRS Form 5500.
 If necessary, report the exchange of like-kind property (1031 exchange).
 Cancel all state and local business permits.
 Cancel all fictitious firm name filings.
 Transfer all intellectual property (domain names, patents, state and fed-
eral trademarks, and so on).
 File the last state tax return.
 Pay all franchise and corporate tax fees for the current year.
 If necessary, obtain a certificate of good standing with your state tax
bureau.
213
Chapter 12: Knowing Your Exit Strategy: Dissolutions and Extensions

 Send notification of dissolution to vendors/creditors.
 Publish a notice of dissolution in the local newspaper in each jurisdic-
tion you have transacted business in.
 Pay/reject all creditor claims.
 Pay all debts that are owed to members, including distributions that
were never made.
 Distribute any remaining profit to the members according to their 
ownership percentage.
 Pay any back fees that are owed to the Secretary of State in each 
jurisdiction you are transacting business in.
 Withdraw from all states in which you are foreign-filed.
 File articles of dissolution with the Secretary of State.
 If necessary, notify your customers of the dissolution.
All in favor: Taking the vote
Unless you really want to make your partners angry and probably end up in
court, you won’t want to go around like some rogue operator, terminating the
company all on your own. You need approval. You and your partners need to
sit down and agree on the approximate date that you want to terminate your
company. You should then come up with a plan on how you are going to go
about doing it.
If your termination date is upon you, and you and the other members have
decided not to continue the company (see the “You’ve reached the set disso-
lution date” section earlier in the chapter), then taking a vote is optional.
Normally, you can just start the dissolution process.
However, if you want to dissolve the LLC before the termination date —
assuming that it’s your decision to make and you aren’t being forced into it —
then you’ll need to take a vote of the members. Make sure to check out what
your operating agreement says about dissolutions. For instance, it should go
into what percentage of members must vote to dissolve and what the process
is. If your operating agreement is silent on the issue, then your state’s laws
will automatically govern your dissolution. Call your registered agent or your
attorney for assistance — they should know this stuff by heart.
After you have all of the members together, you can vote to dissolve your
LLC. When taking a vote, make sure to hold a proper meeting, keep meeting
minutes, and then create a resolution that records your vote. I go into detail
on how to do this in Chapter 11. This way, the other members have no
recourse should they change their minds afterward. In other words, they
can’t say that you did it without their permission!
214
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

Settling your debts: Paying creditors
Most states require that you notify your creditors in the event of a dissolu-
tion. However, even if it isn’t mandatory, you should still do it. During the dis-
solution process, the more of a paper trail you create that shows you
attempted to pay your creditors, the less recourse they have in the future.
Members have limited liability and are protected from the LLC’s creditors. But
this doesn’t mean that you can just liquidate the company, take the money,
and dissolve. If you have debts, they must be paid before any member sees a
penny. Otherwise, the creditor may be able to go after you and your partners
for any money that you took that may have belonged to them.
If your LLC is faced with a dissolution, but the members decide that they
want to continue on with business, then the creditors don’t need to be noti-
fied that you’re not dissolving the LLC. As a matter of fact, if you send a notifi-
cation, it may just cause a lot of confusion.
Giving them notice
Before doling out the cash to your creditors, you should send them a notifica-
tion letter. The purpose of the notification letter is to allow creditors to send
their claims. The good thing about this is that if they fail to send their claim
by the cutoff date (usually 120 days), then they can’t make the claim after the
dissolution has occurred. You just may be a lucky duck and have lazy credi-
tors who never send their claims in.
The notification letter should contain the following information:
 A statement that you intend to dissolve, including an approximate disso-
lution date, if you have one.
 What information you want the creditor to give when they send in the
claim (invoice numbers, dates, and so on).
 The deadline by which claims should be submitted. I know it’s tempting
to make this a very short amount of time, but if you make it too short,
the notice may be disregarded by the courts. The standard deadline is
120 days — you should probably just stick to that.
 A paragraph that states that any claims received after the deadline won’t
be honored.
 The person and mailing address to which the creditor must send the
claim (normally your registered agent’s address).
When sending a notification letter, make sure to send it via certified mail. You
need to have a receipt that proves you sent it.
215
Chapter 12: Knowing Your Exit Strategy: Dissolutions and Extensions

You don’t necessarily know who may think that you owe them money. I rec-
ommend sending this letter out to all companies and individuals that your
LLC has used as a vendor or independent contractor in the past.
Handling claims
Now, after you have received a claim, you have the option of either accepting
it or rejecting it. If you choose to accept it, keep in mind that everything is
negotiable. You can often settle the claim for less than the total amount. Just
make sure that once you settle a claim, you pay it.
Before paying your creditors, you need to liquidate all of the LLC’s assets.
The amount of cash that your company has after liquidation determines how
much the creditors get paid. Whatever is left after the creditors have been
paid gets paid to the members.
If you choose to reject a claim, you will have to do so at your own discretion.
Will this creditor seek recourse? If you think the creditor will be a problem,
talk to your attorney to prepare for any actions the creditor may take after
the company has been dissolved. When you reject a claim, you should write a
letter to the creditor stating that you are rejecting it. If possible, and if your
attorney thinks it’s a good idea, you should give a brief explanation as to why
you’ve refused the claim.
Covering your bases
So, what about the creditors you don’t know about? It’s always what you
don’t know now that can hurt you later. One of the most powerful moves that
you can do when dissolving your LLC is to publish a notice in the local news-
paper. With this notice, you can let creditors know that they have a certain
timeframe in which to send claims to be considered. I know, I know . . . how
many companies actually read these ads with itty-bitty type in the newspa-
per? Very few probably. However, this shows that you did your due diligence
and is usually enough to satisfy the courts.
If you are registered in multiple states, you should probably publish this
notice in every state that your LLC conducts business in. This can be time
consuming, so I recommend that you get your multistate registered agent to
help you.
Who’s due what: Paying members
After you have liquidated your LLC’s assets (that is to say, sold them) and
settled all of its debts, you can focus on paying the members. The IRS recom-
mends a specific order in which members are paid, and unless your operat-
ing agreement states otherwise or the members have taken a vote and
created a resolution, you should probably stick to the status quo.
216
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

Generally, the first to be paid are those members who are owed distributions.
For instance, if the LLC recognized a profit, but for some reason didn’t dis-
tribute that money to a member (say it needed the cash for something else),
then that member should be paid what he is owed. Also, if a member has
made a loan to the company, then that member should be paid back.
After the members have been paid what they are owed, the remaining money
is used to refund the members for their initial contributions. This may seem
strange, but it’s true. The money that you invested will actually be returned
to you before receiving any dividends.
Did your investment in the company only consist of services? Well, services
have a value too! Get with the rest of the members in the company and
decide what the value of your services was worth. You can look at current
pay scales in your industry as a guideline. For instance, if you worked for free
for the company for one year, and your peers were paid $50,000 for that same
year, then you can reasonably ask for $50,000 as payment for your services.
After all of the initial contributions have been returned to the members, the
remaining money (if there is any) can be distributed to the members accord-
ing to their percentage of ownership. Yes, according to their percentage of
ownership. If you weren’t distributing profits and losses in the past according
to the member’s percentage of ownership, this can be a bit confusing. But it’s
rather simple. If a member owns 30 percent of the company, she gets 30 per-
cent of the remaining cash. Easy as pie!
As for taxes, as long as you are being taxed as a partnership, you’ll just
report this income on your personal tax return as you normally would.
Wrapping up the government affairs
Now that the creditors have been paid and the members have been 
reimbursed — and perhaps even given some extra cash — everyone should
be happy (assuming there was enough money for everyone; otherwise, you
may know some pretty grumpy folks out there). Now it’s time to deal with the 
government — and that means paperwork. Lots and lots of paperwork.
First, are the tax forms. You have the federal, state, and local tax forms. First,
your accountant needs to file your final federal and state partnership tax
returns. To file your final federal return, you just file a normal return and
check the box at the top which indicates that this return is a final return. If
your state requires you to file a special LLC tax return, then you will also
want to file a final version of this return.
217
Chapter 12: Knowing Your Exit Strategy: Dissolutions and Extensions

There are quite a few other forms and returns that you must file. It would be
virtually impossible to go over all of them in detail, so check out the dissolu-
tion checklist, which you can find earlier in the chapter. Make sure to go over
this with your accountant. LLCs all differ somewhat, and you may have to
make additional filings, depending on the nature of your business.
Now, before dissolving, make sure that your LLC is in good standing with
your home state and all of the states that you are foreign filed in. Your regis-
tered agent should be able to provide you with your status in every state and
also let you know the steps that you need to take to get back into good stand-
ing, if necessary. If you have failed to file your annual returns in many states,
this could be a costly endeavor. After you are in good standing in all of the
states that you are registered in, you can start the withdrawal and dissolution
process.
Making it official: Filing the dissolution
After your affairs have been completely wrapped up, it’s time to officially dis-
solve your LLC. When you terminate it with the state, its public status will be
shown as dissolved or terminated.
If you are registered in multiple states, before dissolving in your home state,
you need to withdraw from the other states that you are registered to trans-
act business in. The withdrawal process is similar to the dissolution process
and usually requires a nominal fee. Just keep in mind that you don’t file arti-
cles of dissolution to withdraw from a state. States have separate forms for
this purpose.
If you have a multistate registered agent, let her handle the entire withdrawal
and dissolution process for you. It can be a big hassle to coordinate with
many state agencies at one time, especially because they all have different
timeframes that they process the paperwork in. Leave it to the pros who
already have the relationships. It is definitely worth the extra fee.
It’s important that you pay all of your taxes before filing the dissolution.
Some states don’t even allow you to file unless you have received a tax clear-
ance. Your registered agent or accountant can usually help you resolve things
with the state and local tax boards.
To make your life a little easier, I have included the dissolution form for each
state on the accompanying CD.
218
Part III: Running Your Brand-New LLC 

You can also create your own articles of dissolution; just make sure to use
the points on the state form as a guide for what needs to be included in your
articles. Generally, articles of dissolution consist of
 The name of the company
 A list of the members of the company
 The reason the company is dissolving
 The date that you wish the dissolution to become effective
 Any information regarding unpaid taxes
 The members’ signatures and the date the form was signed
You may also need to include a statement, signed by the managers, that
states that the LLC has handled all of its liabilities, made the distributions to
the members, and no lawsuits are pending (or if there are, a payment
arrangement has been made for any judgments).
If you don’t dissolve through your registered agent, you should let her know
that you are dissolving your LLC and no longer need her services.
Some states have it backward and require you to file your dissolution papers
before paying your creditors and winding up your affairs. In this case, talk to
your registered agent, who should be well apprised of all state laws regarding
dissolutions. She can let you know the proper order in which things must be
done.
Dealing with the tax consequences
The tax consequences can be good and bad for the members when dissolving
the LLC. Your accountant can go over these with you when you run your dis-
solution plan by her before dissolving. Remember that if your LLC isn’t prof-
itable, the losses can also be passed on to the members. This can offset other
income and save you and your partners a lot of money in taxes.
Because your LLC is a pass-through entity, it doesn’t have to deal with too
many tax consequences. Just file Form 1065, U.S. Partnership Return of
Income, on its behalf at the end of the year; the form is more of an informa-
tion statement than anything else. All profits and losses are passed on to the
members and are reflected on their personal tax returns on the Schedule K-1.
If you are operating as single-member LLC, then you attach a Schedule C to
your personal IRS Form 1040 instead.
219
Chapter 12: Knowing Your Exit Strategy: Dissolutions and Extensions

If your LLC is canceling debt that the members were personally responsible
for (for example, paying off bank loans and such), then the IRS treats this as
income to the members, which can cause some unexpected tax burdens. This
is one of the reasons why it’s important to go over your dissolution plan with
your accountant. You can read more about this rule under Section 108 of the
Internal Revenue Code. We have included a copy for you at www.myllc.com/
dummies.
Unfortunately, your state has you by the throat when it comes to dissolving.
Often, they won’t honor your dissolution until every penny of your state
taxes is paid. If your state has a franchise fee, you need to make sure that
you’ve paid it for the year before dissolving. In states such as California, this
is based on the company’s income and can be as much as $750 or more.
When your LLC has employees, there is a whole new level of consideration.
You must make sure that you are caught up on your federal and state payroll
taxes and your unemployment insurance. Again, your accountant is the best
person to help you with this.

Making Cents of
Taxes and Protect-

In this part . . .
W
hat’s the point in reading a book on LLCs if it doesn’t
address the two things that LLCs are known and
admired for — asset protection and tax savings. Limited
liability companies offer excellent tax savings, which I
address in Chapter 13. They’re also commonly used for
protecting your business and personal assets, which I
cover in Chapter 14.
I devote Chapter 15 to LLCs and real estate — one of the
most common investments that LLCs are used for. LLCs
and real-estate investments were made for each other, and
in this chapter, you’ll see why. You’ll also get some pretty
nifty strategies on how to protect your investment proper-
ties better by using multiple entities.
Lastly, in Chapter 16, I go over estate-planning techniques
that you can use in conjunction with LLCs. For anyone
looking to plan their estate, this chapter is a must-read.

LLCs and Taxes: Arranging 
the Best Scenario
In This Chapter
 Understanding pass-through tax status
 Filing your tax returns
 Saving taxes with your LLC
I
know, I know — just the thought of taxes probably makes you want to
throw this book across the room. But don’t do it. This isn’t the most enter-
taining chapter that you’re going to read, but it will be quick and painless, I
promise. Although taxes can be a pain in the butt, by educating yourself
about them, you gain the upper hand and end up paying less. Just think, after
reading this chapter, you’ll be able to stride into your accountant’s office with
your head held high, and you’ll have no problem discussing the tax basis of
assets, tax reporting requirements for LLCs, and how you can avoid sending a
chunk of change to the IRS.
LLCs can be taxed a multitude of ways, but I’d say about 90 percent of them
just stick with the default pass-through taxation. And why not? It’s a great
way to be taxed! I touch on all types of taxation in this chapter, but I spend
the most time discussing the pass-through tax status because it’s the most
common and the most unique.
If you are like most people, you’ll be confused by the tax information at
times. Don’t let this get you down. You don’t need to know everything — just
enough for planning purposes and to have an informed conversation with
your accountant. After all, accountants are there for a reason — use ’em! An
accountant spends his days poring over tax law and dealing with the IRS.
Although you should have a basic understanding of this stuff — which I strive
to provide for you in this book — you should still use an accountant for the
important stuff, such as distributing money to the members and filing the
end-of-year tax forms.

Understanding LLC Tax Categories
The LLC has been gaining in popularity because it’s the only major entity
type that combines full limited-liability protection for all members and pass-
through partnership taxation. For the most part, pass-through taxation is
more straightforward than corporate taxation, and therefore, easier to figure
out. You don’t have any extra returns to file, and sometimes the members can
personally benefit if the LLC has a bad year. Plus, you can transfer assets in
and out of the company tax free.
Your LLC will fall into one of the following tax categories:
 Partnership: If your LLC has more than one member, it will automati-
cally be taxed as a partnership and given pass-through tax status.
 Sole proprietorship: If your LLC has only one member (a single-member
LLC), then it will automatically be deemed a disregarded entity by the IRS
and will be taxed as a sole proprietorship.
 Other: If you want, you can elect a different type of taxation such as 
corporate taxation or even S corporation tax status (a different type of
pass-through taxation) for your LLC.
I cover these approaches in more detail in the following sections.
Examining LLC pass-through tax status
All LLCs are created with a default tax status. It’s like hair color — you’re
born with one color, but as you get older you can choose to change it if you
want. The default tax status for LLCs is “partnership taxation” — a favorable
form of pass-through taxation. Pass-through taxation means that the entity
itself doesn’t pay federal income taxes. Instead, the business passes the prof-
its and losses on to the individual owners so they can pay the taxes on their
personal tax returns. Not only does this save some paperwork hassles, but it
also allows the members to offset some of their other income with the losses
of the business, should it not be profitable.
Even though the LLC isn’t required to file a tax return, the IRS wasn’t going to
let it get off that easy! LLCs still have to file a Form 1065, U.S. Return of
Partnership Income, at the end of every year. Form 1065 is just an informa-
tion statement, not a return. It lets the IRS know the amount of profits and
losses that the company allocated to each member — that way the Feds can
follow up and make sure they get their dough.
224
Part IV: Making Cents of Taxes and Protecting Your Assets 

If you are currently operating as a sole proprietorship or general partnership,
you are already familiar with the pass-through tax status of LLCs. Essentially,
you are taxed the same — all of the business’s profits and losses flow through
to you, the owner, and get reported on your personal tax return.
A lot of people think that just because corporations can choose to have pass-
through taxation (called an S corporation), that it’s the same as an LLC.
Close, but no cigar. LLCs and S corporations are dramatically different. For
one, S corporations have more restrictions on who can and can’t be an
owner. Also, certain things like contributions are taxed differently. Don’t
make the mistake of forming an S corporation because you think it’s the same
as an LLC. Make sure to have a good long chat with your accountant to go
over the merits (and differences!) of each entity before making your decision.
The partners pay the taxes!
To understand partnership taxation, you need to understand two concepts:
 Distributions: When a distribution occurs, a member is actually handed
cash for his share of the company profits.
 Allocations: When a member is allocated a percentage of the company’s
profit (which is stated on his Schedule K-1), he has to state the amount
on his personal tax return and pay taxes on that profit on behalf of the
company. This has nothing to do with the actual cash he gets from the
company (the distribution).
After the members get together and decide what profits and losses are to be
allocated to whom and how the cash is to be distributed, a Form 1065 is filed.
Form 1065 isn’t very extensive — it just asks for the names and addresses of
each of the members and the amount of each member’s share of the com-
pany’s taxable income and deductions. Later in the chapter, I give you more
information on how to file Form 1065.
At this point, the company notifies the members of the profits and losses that
were allocated to them, and each member is responsible for paying the taxes
on these profits. The company notifies each member of the percentage of
profit they have to pay tax on by issuing the member a Schedule K-1.
Unfortunately, paying taxes on behalf of the company sounds easier than it is.
Members can’t just write in the amount that they are to be taxed on. They
have to list things such as their allocated share of the company’s income,
gains, losses, deductions, and credits as well as the LLC’s tax preference.
Tax basis and taxing distributions of profits and losses
When working with your accountant, you’ll probably hear a lot about your
tax basis. Your tax basis is the amount that you have invested in the company
over the years. It’s adjusted every time an allocation or distribution is made
225
Chapter 13: LLCs and Taxes: Arranging the Best Scenario

or your LLC takes on debt. Your adjusted tax basis determines how much tax
you pay when the company makes cash distributions to you. If the amount of
your cash distributions exceeds your adjusted tax basis, then you’ll normally
be required to pay tax on the overage.
Your tax basis starts with the amount that you initially invested in the com-
pany. (If you contributed services, then you need to determine the value of
those services.) Then, you add the amount of any monies that the company
allocated to you but didn’t distribute to you (called phantom income). After
you have that number, you add the amount of your share of the company’s
debts that you’re personally responsible for to determine your adjusted tax
basis. Don’t throw in the towel yet — I explain this all in detail below.
You usually will be allocated more profit than is actually distributed to you.
Your tax basis is increased by the amount of company profits that are allo-
cated to you and decreased by the amount of profits that are distributed to
you. So if the company allocates $10,000 in profits to you that you must pay
taxes on, but only distributes $5,000 in cash to you, then your tax basis
increases by the difference — $5,000.
It doesn’t stop there. If your LLC has liabilities such as loans and/or mort-
gages that you are personally responsible for, you can include the amount of
your share of those liabilities in your basis. There are two types of liabilities:
 Recourse: Debt that you are personally responsible for
 Non-recourse: Debt that you are not personally responsible for
Only loans that the member can be held personally responsible for repaying
can be included in a member’s tax basis. When calculating your percentage of
liabilities, you may want to seek the assistance of an accountant because it
can get pretty complex.
Now that you know what your tax basis is, you can calculate your taxes.
Generally, your distribution amount minus your adjusted tax basis equals
your gain. Also, if you decrease the amount of your share of the company’s
liabilities, then that is treated as a cash distribution. If this amount is over
your adjusted tax basis, then you will have to recognize the difference as
gain.
Obviously, I’m simplifying this process so you have a basic idea of how it
works. I strongly recommend that you have a qualified tax professional work
out all of your calculations for you, because they get much more complex
when you throw things such as heavily appreciated assets and real estate
into the mix.

Part IV: Making Cents of Taxes and Protecting Your Assets 

Deducting LLC losses from your other income
If you have sources of income besides your LLC, you may be able to deduct
your LLC’s losses from that other income to pay less taxes! In the eyes of the
IRS, there are three types of income — passive (rental properties), active
(wages and 1099 compensation), and portfolio (dividends from stocks held).
For the most part, you can use the losses from your LLC to offset your pas-
sive income. The IRS defines passive income as income from a business or
rental property in which you are not an active participant (you don’t deal with
the business on a regular basis, and you don’t work very many hours in the
business).
If you aren’t an active participant, you can’t deduct your LLC losses from any
other type of income, such as the income from your job. In other words,
under the passive income rule, if your LLC isn’t doing so well and passes on
$50,000 in losses to you, you can’t use it to offset the $50,000 you made when
you made a good trade on Wall Street (which is considered portfolio income).
So you can sound like a smarty-pants when talking to your accountant, this is
called a passive loss limitation.
The only way to avoid being subject to the passive loss limitation is to
actively participate in the LLC’s operations. If the IRS considers you to be an
active participant, then you can deduct the LLC’s losses from your other
income, such as wages and stock dividends, without limitation.
If your LLC holds rental property, you will have to be so actively engaged in
the managing of the property that you qualify as an active real estate profes-
sional. Otherwise, the rental property will be considered a passive invest-
ment, and if the LLC distributes losses to you, they will be subject to the
passive loss limitation rules.
Preserving pass-through taxation status
Although pass-through tax status is the default for LLCs, your LLC can lose
the right to this partnership tax status if it’s not structured correctly.
Partnership tax status is reserved only for partnerships; therefore, if you
don’t look and act like a partnership as far as the IRS is concerned, then it
won’t allow you to be taxed like one.
The IRS differentiates partnerships from corporations in a couple of ways.
Basically, three characteristics make a corporation what it is:
 Ownership is freely transferable.
 The entity has a perpetual existence.
 The owners and officers all have limited-liability protections.
227
Chapter 13: LLCs and Taxes: Arranging the Best Scenario

If an LLC has all three characteristics, then in the eyes of the IRS, it’s a corpo-
ration and will be taxed as such. However, if an LLC only has two of these
characteristics, then it’s a partnership and will be allowed the partnership
pass-through tax status.
Considering that you most likely aren’t going to want to give up the limited-
liability characteristic, your best choice is to keep your membership shares
from being transferred freely. Most LLCs don’t allow the free transfer of own-
ership; they require that the members take a vote, and the new member is
admitted upon majority approval. If you stick this provision in your operating
agreement (see Chapter 9), and then stick to this provision, you should be 
A-okay when it comes keeping your pass-through tax status.
Selling your membership interests
To determine the amount of tax you have to pay when you sell your member-
ship interest, you first have to figure out your tax basis. You subtract this
adjusted tax basis from the sale price to figure out your profit (which, in IRS
terms, is called your capital gain). Depending on how long you have held the
interest, you’ll most likely have to pay short-term or long-term capital gains
taxes on this amount.
Operating as a single-member LLC
Many states permit you to form and operate a single-member LLC. However,
although the state recognizes the entity as an LLC, the IRS doesn’t. In the
eyes of the IRS, single-member LLCs are “disregarded entities” and taxed as
sole proprietorships. You report and pay the company’s taxes on your per-
sonal tax returns. If your single-member LLC is operating as a business, then
you report all income and expenses on a Schedule C, Profit or Loss from a
Business, that you attach to your Form 1040. If your single-member LLC is
holding rental real estate properties, then you report all income and
expenses on a Schedule E, Supplemental Income and Loss, that you attach to
your Form 1040.
Being a “disregarded entity” in the eyes of the IRS can be a good thing! Your
LLC can still have the limited-liability protections that the state offers, yet be
treated by the IRS as if it were an individual. A perfect example of how this
can be beneficial to you is if your LLC were to own real estate. Because the
property is owned by a single-member LLC, which is considered a disre-
garded entity by the IRS, you still can engage the property in a like-kind, tax-
free 1031 exchange. If this is something you are doing, speak with a tax-free
exchange professional.
228
Part IV: Making Cents of Taxes and Protecting Your Assets 

Now, just because you’re a single-member LLC doesn’t mean that you don’t
have choices. You can still make a tax election — you just can’t elect partner-
ship taxation. If you are operating as a single-member LLC and you want to be
subject to corporate taxation instead, simply file IRS Form 8832, Entity
Classification Election, within 75 days of your formation date. After this form
is filed, you will pay taxes as if you were a corporation.
If you are operating as a single-member LLC and are still dead set on having
partnership taxation, you have an option. You can elect to be taxed as an S
corporation. An S corporation is basically just a corporation but with the
pass-through tax status that partnerships enjoy. Though the tax differences
between sole proprietorships and S corporations aren’t very pronounced, it
may help protect your limited-liability status in the courtroom. After all, the
IRS won’t consider you a disregarded entity any longer. I show you how to file
for S corporation tax status later in the chapter.
Choosing corporate taxation
No matter how many members you have, you can always elect to be taxed
like a corporation. Corporate taxation is completely different than partner-
ship taxation. First and foremost, nothing gets passed on to the members. For
the most part, the only thing a member has to report on his personal tax
return is the money that he actually receives from the company as income or
profit distributions. There is no such thing as allocations when it comes to
corporations.
Corporations are taxed as are separate entities. In the eyes of the IRS, your
corporation is completely distinct from its owners. But it gets even better.
Although you personally have to pay federal tax on all of your income, corpo-
rations only have to pay federal tax on all of their profits. That’s right — 
corporations only are taxed on the profits that remain in the company at the
end of the year. Also, the corporate tax rate is much lower — normally around
15 percent — than it is for partnership or sole proprietorship taxation. (The
average tax rates for those entities are between 15 percent and 35 percent,
plus an extra 15.3 percent for self-employment taxes.)
When it comes to corporations and taxes, most people worry about some-
thing called double taxation. Double taxation occurs when the owners of the
corporation (called shareholders) take the profit out of the company, and the
profits are taxed on the shareholder level. This means that the same profits
are taxed once at the corporate level, and then taxed again at the share-
holder level when they are paid out.
229
Chapter 13: LLCs and Taxes: Arranging the Best Scenario

When to choose corporate taxation
Different business structures require different types of taxation. First and
foremost, if your LLC is being used to hold real estate, you should probably
stay away from corporate taxation. When it comes to holding real estate — or
any appreciating asset, for that matter — pass-through taxation is always the
way to go. Why? Because the double taxation that comes with a corporate tax
status can annihilate your profits. You’ll have almost nothing left!
If you are in business, however, you may want to consider corporate taxation.
First of all, you most likely won’t be making too much in profit in your forma-
tive years. Second, even if you plan to pay out profits, the double taxation
can actually be less of a tax burden than the self-employment taxes that come
with pass-through taxation.
Until you are profiting more than $75,000 per year, you may want to look into
electing corporate tax status. Generally, until you start profiting more, the
corporate tax rates are lower than the individual tax rates of the members
who will be paying taxes on the LLC’s income.
After you have decided that corporate taxation is right for you, you must file
a Form 8832, Entity Classification Election, with the IRS within 75 days of your
formation date. Your election will go into effect on the date of your choosing
(you just enter this date on line 4), or if you don’t select a date, the IRS will
use the date on which you filed the form. (Later in the chapter I go into how
to prepare your tax returns if you have elected to be taxed as a corporation.)
Believe it or not, when it comes to some businesses, I’m somewhat of a pro-
ponent for electing corporate tax status. In a lot of situations, the double tax-
ation can actually amount to less than what a partnership tax entity would
pay after self-employment taxes are calculated. Also, you have access to
more tax deductions than you would if you were taxed as a partnership. If I
were you, I would sit down with your tax specialist or corporate consultant
and discuss the merits of both types of taxation and see what works best 
for you!
When you elect corporate taxation, you are stuck with it for five years. This
means that you can’t go back to pass-through taxation whenever you choose.
There are ways around this, but they involve loopholes that lawmakers can
amend or close at any minute. Before filing your Form 8832, just make sure
that it won’t be detrimental to your business to be taxed at the corporate tax
rate for the next five years. Also, make sure to speak with a tax professional
who can help you plan.
230
Part IV: Making Cents of Taxes and Protecting Your Assets 

Ways to minimize corporate taxes
Corporate taxation can be great for small businesses because you have a
little more flexibility when it comes to tax planning. For instance, by domicil-
ing your corporation in a tax haven, you can avoid a lot of state taxes that
would be imposed on you personally in the state that you live in. I go into
this in more detail in Chapter 5.
Unfortunately, the most prominent downfall of the corporation — double 
taxation — is a hard one to get around. Luckily, if you are operating the busi-
ness, you can be an employee and take money out of the company by having
it pay your salary, pension plan, employee benefits, and even loans. At the
end of the day, the company’s net income will remain the same; however, it
won’t all be in the form of company profits. Instead, it will be a deductible
expense to the company (your salary, for instance), which reduces the
amount of taxes you will have to pay on what you take.
Electing S corporation tax status
Although both the partnership and S corporation tax status allow for pass-
through taxation, the two have some pretty big differences. The big benefit is
that S corporations don’t have to pay self-employment tax on all the profits of
the business. As an owner, you only pay the tax on amounts that were paid
out as compensation for services. Considering that the self-employment tax
is about 15.3 percent, this little benefit of the S corporation can save you a
pretty good chunk of change.
However, there are plenty of downsides, some of which may or may not apply
to you:
 The ownership is restricted. The S corporation tax status comes with a
lot of restrictions on who can be an owner and how many owners there
can be (see Chapter 2 for the list).
 You can’t add debt to your tax basis. Earlier in the chapter, I discussed
that LLCs allow you to deduct from your distributions the amount of
debt that the company has that you can be held personally responsible
for. With S corporation tax status, you receive no tax benefits for being
personally responsible for the company’s debt.
 There is no step-up in basis on assets after you die. When your heirs
inherit your assets in your S corporation, they’ll have to pay capital
gains tax on the appreciation from the date you first purchased the
asset, instead of just from the date that you passed it on to your heirs. 
I discuss this in more detail in Chapter 16.
231
Chapter 13: LLCs and Taxes: Arranging the Best Scenario

It’s normally a terrible idea to hold assets in an LLC that has elected S corpo-
ration status — especially real estate. Even though you get around the
double-taxation nightmare that comes with a regular corporation, you’re still
limiting yourself by not being able to personally deduct the mortgage.
On the contrary, because of these specific benefits and drawbacks of S corpo-
ration tax status, small businesses are the ones that benefit from this sort of
taxation. Why? Because they hold their assets elsewhere, so the last two
items on the list don’t bother them. Also, they are relatively small entities, so
the ownership restrictions normally don’t apply to them.
If you want to be taxed as an S corporation, then you need to file Form 8832,
Entity Classification Election, and Form 2553, Election by a Small Business
Corporation, within 75 days of your formation date or the beginning of your
fiscal year. Later in the chapter, I go into detail on how to prepare the exact
filings required for the S corporation tax status.
Check to see how your state taxes LLCs that have elected S corporation taxa-
tion. Most states conform with the IRS on this, but about half a dozen states
will tax S corporations as corporations. If you are holding real estate or are in
another form of business where double taxation can kill you, you could be in
trouble. Make sure to speak with your local accountant or do some research
on local state law.
How to File Your Federal Returns
Although you’ll most likely delegate the filing of your federal tax returns to a
competent accountant, I still recommend that you have a good, basic knowl-
edge about what your LLC needs to do at tax time. This not only helps you
have much more educated conversations with your accountant, but also
assists you in double-checking his work. After all, you’ll be signing these 
filings — don’t you want to know exactly what you are signing?
You don’t really file a tax return for your LLC. Instead, you only file an infor-
mation statement — IRS Form 1065, U.S. Return of Partnership Income. On
this statement, you report the company’s income, deductions, gains, losses,
and the allocations that are being made to the partners. After this statement
has been filed, the company will then issue Schedule K-1s to each member
that shows what income and deductions have been allocated to them. They
then report the income and deductions on a Schedule C attached to their per-
sonal tax return. All members will personally pay their share of the company
taxes.
232
Part IV: Making Cents of Taxes and Protecting Your Assets 

For the most part, in this section I stick to discussing the pass-through tax
status because that is the most common. Regardless, you should use this sec-
tion for informative purposes only. There is absolutely no way that in one
chapter I could get into every piece of tax law that could apply to your spe-
cific situation. Even if I were writing an entire book on the subject, would you
really want to read it? Probably not. That’s why, no matter what, I recom-
mend that you find a qualified professional to assist you in filing your com-
pany taxes. After all, you’re a smart cookie — you should be spending your
time making your fortune, not reading up on boring tax code.
Before you can file your IRS Form 1065, or any return for that matter, you
need to obtain a tax identification number for your LLC. You can do that by
submitting a Form SS-4, Application for Employer Identification Number, to
the Internal Revenue Service or applying online at https://sa1.www4.
irs.gov/sa_vign/newFormSS4.do. I recommend that you apply online;
that way you can get your number immediately.
If you’ve chosen something other than partnership tax status for your LLC,
skip ahead to the “Ponying up when you’ve chosen a different tax status” 
section. The next couple of sections most likely don’t apply to you.
Preparing Form 1065
All partnerships, including LLCs, are required to file a Form 1065 each year.
The 1065 isn’t a tax return; it’s a summary and information statement that
lets the IRS know who is responsible for paying which percentage of the com-
pany’s tax burden for the year. It is four pages long and contains six different
schedules. (About ten other schedules can be filed with the 1065 if your
accountant deems it necessary.)
The company also must make some tax decisions — called elections.
Elections can include decisions concerning the research credit, for example,
and also depreciation of assets. These decisions can affect all of the members
and can have huge tax consequences. Therefore, whoever is preparing and
filing the Form 1065 must look to the operating agreement for guidance on
how tax elections are to be decided. If the operating agreement doesn’t pro-
vide guidance on this, then all members should come together for a vote.
After Form 1065 is completed, only one member needs to review and sign it;
however, that member must answer to all of the other members if they have a
question or problem with the filing.
If you are operating as a single-member LLC, the IRS treats you as a disre-
garded entity, and you will be taxed as a sole proprietorship. This means that
you don’t need to file Form 1065. I go over what filings are required for single-
member LLCs in the “Coughing up taxes as a sole proprietorship” section.
233
Chapter 13: LLCs and Taxes: Arranging the Best Scenario

Form 1065 asks for the tax year of the LLC. It’s customary to make this a cal-
endar year. LLCs are required to have the same tax reporting period as their
majority members, and normally, majority members are U.S. citizens who pay
taxes on a calendar-year schedule.
Distributing K-1s to the members
After she fills in the Form 1065 for your LLC, your accountant will create a
Schedule K-1 for each member of the LLC. The K-1 contains the allocation
information for each partner (see the “The partners pay the taxes!” section),
including how much and what type of company income the member has been
allocated and what sort of deductions he can write off. It also provides an
updated analysis of each partner’s tax basis.
Unfortunately, it isn’t always as simple as just writing in the portion of each
member’s profits and losses. The K-1 calls for different types of income to be
reported separately, such as short-term capital gains, long-term capital gains,
charitable contributions, royalties, interest income, and rental real estate
income, among others. You should be able to find what percentage of profits
and losses that each member is allocated in the operating agreement.
234
Part IV: Making Cents of Taxes and Protecting Your Assets 
Taking your accounting system into account
On Form 1065, you indicate the accounting
method that your company uses. If you have a
bookkeeping service or an accountant, you can
just ask them. If not, you will have to choose one
yourself.
Cash-based accounting is the simplest method
of accounting and is generally used by smaller
companies that do their bookkeeping them-
selves. With cash-based accounting, you clas-
sify income only when you actually receive it,
and you classify expenses only when the
checks you wrote have posted to your bank
account. If your register matches your bank
statement, with no other debits or credits show-
ing, then there is a good chance that you’re on
a cash-based accounting system. If your 
income is over $1 million, however, I recom-
mend that you ditch this accounting method and
go with accrual-based accounting instead.
Accrual-based accounting is a little bit more 
difficult to track, but it offers the most tax bene-
fits. It is a standard for most professional book-
keepers because it provides a more accurate
picture of how the business is actually doing.
Essentially, with accrual-based accounting, you
record income when the sale occurs, not when
you actually receive the money. You also record
expenses when the invoice is received, not
when your check is cashed by the vendor. With
this type of accounting, it’s virtually impossible
to spend more money than you have. Also, at
the end of the year, you’ll show less of a profit
that you will need to allocate and pay taxes on.

Having to calculate percentages of different types of income for a multitude
of members can be a huge headache. That is why I recommend you leave it to
the professionals.
Also, remember that one of the benefits of an LLC is that the company profits
and losses don’t have to be allocated to the members according to their own-
ership percentages. LLCs allow for special allocations, which means that you
can own 10 percent of the company and feasibly receive 100 percent of the
profits and losses for a specific year. Granted, you can’t make these decisions
without having a good reason (that doesn’t include tax purposes); however,
special allocations are common and easy to do. You just have to prove that
you have the LLC’s business goals in mind and that you aren’t making special
allocations to avoid tax liability.
When your accountant creates the Schedule K-1s, she will file the originals,
along with Form 1065, with the IRS. At this point, you should get a photocopy
of your Schedule K-1 that you can use when filing your individual tax return.
The amount of profit that is reported on your K-1 isn’t necessarily the profit
that was distributed to you. In other words, you may have to pay taxes at the
end of the year on the company’s profits when you haven’t even seen a penny
of a cash distribution. Remember — there is a difference between what the
LLC allocates to you and what it distributes to you. Allocations are the profits
and losses that you have to report on your personal tax return and pay taxes
on. Distributions are your cash portion of the profit that you actually receive.
Paying the actual taxes
If you are a U.S. citizen, you pay your personal taxes on IRS Form 1040. But
your 1040 tax return doesn’t include a line that specifies “LLC Income.” If you
take a look at Form 1040, you’ll see that line 17 mentions business income. So
here, you list the total income stated on your Schedule E, Supplemental
Income and Loss, which you submit with your Form 1040.
You use a Schedule E to report all income and losses from business activities
that don’t constitute your primary source of income. Now, if you are manag-
ing the day-to-day business of the LLC, then you should be on the company
payroll, and your regular paycheck should be what is considered your pri-
mary source of income. The allocations that the company makes on a yearly
basis are considered secondary income. In other words, if all you do is sit at
home and collect profits from businesses that you don’t actually operate, and
you don’t have any “job” per se, that income will still be reflected on a
Schedule E.
235
Chapter 13: LLCs and Taxes: Arranging the Best Scenario

If you are a single-member LLC and you are an operational manager of the
company, then this doesn’t apply to you. You don’t list your business income
and deductions on a Schedule E. Later in the chapter, I go into single-member
LLCs in more depth.
When you are filling out your Schedule E, you report all of the business
income and deductions in Part II of the Schedule E. Figure 13-1 is a snapshot
of what this section looks like.
Because the Schedule E isn’t as simple as copying and pasting the informa-
tion from your K-1 (there are a few other schedules involved), I recommend
leaving the preparation of this form up to your accountant. I have included
the basic how-to in this book so you can familiarize yourself with it. Armed
with this information, you can check your accountant’s accuracy and have
intelligent discussions with your accountant about the documents that she
has prepared.
If you are actively engaging in business, you are required to pay self-employ-
ment tax on your percentage of the company profit. You must calculate your
self-employment tax on the Schedule SE, Self-Employment Tax, that you’ll file
with your Form 1040.
Caution. The IRS compares amounts reported on your tax return with amounts shown on Schedule(s) K-1.
which any amount is not at risk, you must check the box in column (e) on line 28 and attach Form 6198. See page E-1.

loss from a passive activity (if that loss was not reported on Form 8582), or unreimbursed partnership expenses?

Ponying up when you’ve chosen 
a different tax status
A small portion of limited liability companies choose to be taxed in some way
other than the standard partnership tax status. If this is the case for you, you
file your taxes just like any other entity with the same tax status you have
chosen. For instance, if you have elected to be taxed as a corporation, then
you file taxes as if you are a corporation. If you have elected to be taxed as a
sole proprietorship, then you file taxes like you are a sole proprietorship.
Coughing up taxes as a sole proprietorship
If you have a single-member LLC, then the IRS will classify it as a disregarded
entity by default and will tax it as a sole proprietorship. This means that the
company doesn’t have to file a Form 1065 information statement and doesn’t
have to issue you a Schedule K-1. You just report your company’s income and
expenses on a Schedule C, Profit or Loss from a Business, and attach it to
your Form 1040 like you would if you didn’t form an LLC in the first place. If
you have rental property, the profit and loss information will be listed on a
Schedule E, Supplemental Income and Loss, instead.
Keep in mind that as a sole proprietor, you can’t pay yourself a salary.
Therefore, all of your income is subject to self-employment tax, which you
report on a Schedule SE, Self-Employment Tax, that you attach to your Form
1040. You can, however, deduct other employees’ salaries as an allowable
business expense.
If you have less than $5,000 in expenses for the year, then you may be
allowed to file the short form of the Schedule C (the Schedule C-EZ).
Settling your tax bill under corporate tax status
When you decide to be taxed as a corporation, you are subject to the same
type of taxation that corporations are — with no exceptions. If you aren’t
used to corporate taxation, just think of your company in terms of being an
official “person” that is separate from yourself. You don’t pay taxes on behalf
of your company. All taxes are paid by the corporation on the profits that are
left in the business at the end of the year.
You report all of your business’s income and deductions on IRS Form 1120,
U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return — a separate tax return. (You should
send a signed copy of Form 8832, Entity Classification Election, to the IRS
with your corporate tax return.) Your profits will be subject to the federal
237
Chapter 13: LLCs and Taxes: Arranging the Best Scenario

corporate tax rate, which averages around 15 percent. Then, if you distribute
them to the members, those same profits will be taxed again as capital gains
income to the members. This is called double taxation.
Shelling out for taxes with an S corporation tax status
If you have elected to be taxed as an S corporation, you no longer file the tra-
ditional partnership returns that you filed previously. Instead, you file an IRS
Form 1120S, U.S. Income Tax Return for an S Corporation. The 1120S is more
of an information statement than anything else. After all, S corporations don’t
really pay taxes; they just pass the profits on to the owners for them to
handle the burden.
When filing a Form 1120S, you prepare a Schedule K-1 for each member, give
a copy of the K-1 to each member (so he can use the information when
preparing his personal tax returns), and submit one copy to the IRS with your
Form 1120S. Keep in mind that when paying taxes as an S corporation, mem-
bers are referred to as shareholders.
You are required to file Form 1120S by March 15 of the following year, or if
you’re on a fiscal year, then the 15th day of the third month after the close of
the fiscal year. Depending on your state, you may also have to send a copy of
Form 1120S and the corresponding K-1s to your state tax board. Or, they may
have a similar form that you need to file. Your accountant can assist you in
pulling together all of the required filings for your LLC.
Avoiding LLC Tax Traps
Business is business, and often it’s easy for the unwary to fall into quagmires.
Every entity has its tax traps, and LLCs are no different. You just have to
make sure that you plan around them and you’ll be fine. Oh, and a great
accountant helps too!
Transferring assets into your LLC
For the most part, transferring assets into your LLC in exchange for member-
ship is a nontaxable event. This means that, for income tax purposes, no gain
or loss is recognized. Problems only arise when debt or liability is involved.
LLCs have a tax pitfall which is known as a deemed cash distribution. It only
occurs when one of the members reduces the amount of his liability. The IRS
considers the reduction in liability to be a cash distribution, and like a cash
distribution, the member must pay taxes on any of this amount that goes
over his tax basis.
238
Part IV: Making Cents of Taxes and Protecting Your Assets 

A good example is of a member who transfers a piece of property into the LLC.
Say that the property has a mortgage on it for $80,000. When the property is
transferred into the LLC, the two members decide to refinance the property to
include the other member as a personal guarantor. Unfortunately, the partner
who was transferring the property didn’t realize that by refinancing it he was
reducing his debt by $40,000 (one-half) and that the IRS would consider that
$40,000 a cash distribution. This means that at the end of the year, the con-
tributing member will have to pay taxes on $40,000 that he never actually
received. Had the members talked to a professional before they refinanced the
property, the contributing member could have avoided a big tax surprise.
Dealing with phantom income
When a partner is allocated a sizeable company profit that she has to pay tax
on, but is not actually distributed any profits, this is called phantom income.
Phantom income can be dangerous because a partner in the LLC can end up
with a pretty hefty tax bill but with no profits to pay it with.
It’s common to experience some phantom income — especially in your LLC’s
beginning stages when you need to keep the profits in the business to help it
grow. However, you can feel pinched in the pocket if the business doesn’t
even distribute enough cash to the members to help cover the tax burden.
You’ll have to scrounge up the dough on your own. Garage sale anyone?
239
Chapter 13: LLCs and Taxes: Arranging the Best Scenario
Triggering gains on securities LLCs
Although a securities LLC can be a great way to
diversify and protect your investments at the
same time, it can also be subject to a pretty seri-
ous tax trap. A securities LLC may be subject to
the investment company rules that state that the
transfer of appreciated securities into the LLC
triggers capital gains. This means that after you
transfer your securities into your LLC, you’ll
have to pay taxes on the capital gains that 
you realized from the date you purchased the
securities to the date you transferred them to 
the LLC.
These rules only apply if
 You are classified as an investment com-
pany (which means that more than 80 
percent of your LLC’s assets are in the form
of publicly traded securities).
 The securities that you have transferred are
not already in diversified portfolios, and the
transfer results in the diversification of your
securities.
If both of these are the case, then the tax basis
will be reset, which means that all of your
appreciation thus far will be subject to capital
gains taxes.

Now, there’s a good and a bad side to phantom income. The bad side is that it
can happen to you. The good side is that you can force it upon a creditor who
obtains a charging order on a member’s interest. A charging order is all that a
creditor can go after if a member is liable personally, and it only gives a credi-
tor access to the allocations and distributions that a membership interest
can receive. Now, if you only allocate profits to the creditor and don’t give
him any cash to pay the taxes on those profits, how happy do you think the
creditor will be? Needless to say, he’ll be running for the hills and eager to
settle in the member’s favor. (Chapter 11 covers charging orders in more
depth.)
You can add a provision in your operating agreement that can force the com-
pany to distribute enough cash for the members to be able to pay the taxes
on their allocations. You can figure out some formula that works for every-
body and also includes a percentage for state taxes. However, by doing this,
you completely undermine the strategy outlined above that gets rid of credi-
tors who have obtained charging orders.
Minimizing self-employment taxes
Even though LLCs aren’t imposed with the same double layer of taxation on
profits like corporations are, if you aren’t careful, you can still end up paying
more in taxes. After all, aren’t you’re supposed to be saving taxes? Not paying
more!
You see, the IRS hits you the hardest with self-employment taxes. Self-employ-
ment taxes are Social Security and Medicare taxes, and they are imposed in
addition to the federal income taxes that you have to pay. These taxes
amount to about 15.3 percent of the total income allocated to you. About 12.4
percent goes to Social Security, which will be paid out to you when you reach
retirement (I hope), and 2.9 percent goes to Medicare, which is a form of hos-
pital insurance. You figure the self-employment tax that is due on Schedule
SE, Self-Employment Taxes, and file it with your personal Form 1040 tax
return.
You have to pay self-employment taxes if
 Your LLC offers licensed services to the public, including accounting,
actuarial science, architecture, consulting, engineering, health, and law.
 You work more than 501 hours during the LLC’s tax year. That is, on
average, nine hours per week.
 You have the authority to execute contracts on behalf of your LLC.
240
Part IV: Making Cents of Taxes and Protecting Your Assets 

If you are an investor or partner in the business, you aren’t required to pay
self-employment tax on the money you earn.
Luckily, there is a maximum amount of earnings that are subject to self-
employment taxes per year. Unluckily, that amount is $94,200, which is way
over the national average — and that only applies to Social Security.
Anything over that amount is still subject to the 2.9 percent Medicare tax.
Currently, you can only deduct half of what you paid in self-employment tax
when calculating your adjusted gross income — the amount that you have to
pay income tax on.
You are only required to pay self-employment taxes on profits if your LLC is
actively engaged in business. If your LLC only engages in passive activities,
such as real estate, then you don’t have to pay self-employment taxes on
what you earn. For instance, if your LLC only holds rental properties and the
rent is the only profit distributed to the members, then it’s passive income
and not subject to self-employment taxes.
Becoming a silent partner
Not everyone is required to pay self-employment tax. SE tax is for wage earn-
ers, not necessarily big fish. So if you are a silent partner who doesn’t deal
with the day-to-day matters of the business, you may be able to find a way
around the mandatory self-employment tax.
First, I would make sure that your LLC is manager-managed. If it’s member-
managed, it’s hard to attest that the members aren’t doing any managing of
the day-to-day affairs! Then, find someone trustworthy who can act as man-
ager and will be able to enter into contracts with your and the company’s
best interests in mind. Finally, make sure that you work no more than 500
hours per year on that particular company.
Obviously, this will never work if you are one of the operating partners. But if
you are a simple investor, it’s very possible to eliminate the required self-
employment taxes and keep a hefty chunk of change in return.
Choosing to be taxed as an S corporation
Unlike partnerships, the owners of S corporations can hire themselves. In
fact, they are expected to hire themselves — an S corporation without any
owners on the payroll is a sure path to an audit. The main benefit of hiring
yourself is that you are paid as a regular employee, as you would be if you
had any regular job. This means that the income you receive isn’t subject to
self-employment taxes. You’ll still have to pay regular payroll taxes, but this
is often much less.
241
Chapter 13: LLCs and Taxes: Arranging the Best Scenario

Of course, you must hire yourself for a wage that is standard in your industry.
If your company hits a windfall, you can’t necessarily take all of the cash out
as a bonus, because you are limited to having a salary that is believable for
an executive of your rank, in a company your size, in your industry. For
instance, if everyone else in similar positions is pulling around $100k per
year, you can’t take home a million bucks and not expect to get audited.
After you’ve taken your maximum salary, the rest must be taken as a distribu-
tion. You’ll have to pay tax on this (including self-employment tax!) as you
would if you were a regular partner and not an employee of the company.
Keep in mind that if you are an owner who is active in the business’s day-to-
day operations, the IRS considers you to be an employee. Therefore, you
need to include yourself on the company payroll and pay payroll taxes on
that income. You don’t have to take too much — just enough so that it’s stan-
dard for your position in your industry. The rest you can classify as company
profit.

Using Your LLC to Protect 
Your Assets
In This Chapter
 Knowing who’s eying your assets
 Understanding how LLCs protect your assets
 Looking at some strategies
T
his very well may be the most important chapter that you read. After all,
why would you want to work so hard to build your future only to have
someone else take away all the assets you’ve accumulated? If you think that
because you observe good business practices you won’t be sued, think again.
There’s a reason for the term frivolous lawsuits — because lawsuits don’t
need to be soundly based or even well-intentioned.
A lot of people out there are looking to get something for nothing.
Unfortunately, that means that hardworking folks like yourself, who have
built up a sizeable nest egg, are a target. Aside from expensive insurance poli-
cies that may or may not cover everything, the only thing that you can really
do to protect yourself is to plan ahead and structure your assets so they’re
safe. It’s important to do this now because once you’re in a lawsuit, it’s too
late. And if you’ve ever been sued, you know — lawsuits can come out of
nowhere when you least expect them!
You need to keep asset protection in mind from the beginning. From here on
out, you must take asset protection into consideration every time you save
money, start a new company, register intellectual property, or make any big
purchases. LLCs are such a big facet of asset protection that normally, when
an attorney sees that you’re protecting your assets in an LLC, she’ll advise
her client not to sue you in the first place. In this chapter, I show you how
you can protect your assets for the rest of your life by forming an LLC, and
how you can safely own high-risk assets (assets that are very likely to be
sued) while protecting everything else that you have worked for.

Worst-Case Scenarios: What Can Happen
Without Asset Protection
More than 50,000 lawsuits are filed in the United States every day and the
numbers keep growing. Litigation has become a way of life for Americans,
and we are suffering because of it. Our collective mindset is shifting to that of
“get somethin’ for nothin’,” and our small businesses — the lifeblood of the
American dream — are suffering. Although it may be relatively easy for a
large corporation to cover the costs of an everyday lawsuit, to a small busi-
ness these legal fees may be debilitating.
You may think you’re exempt, but chances are, if you haven’t been sued yet,
it won’t be long. Although businesses tend to get sued most often, it’s still
very likely that you’ll be sued personally. Actually, statistics say that within
your lifetime you’ll be sued twice. And that’s at today’s numbers — can you
imagine tomorrow’s? Just think — as hard as it can be for a small business to
pay the $75,000 legal bill on a frivolous lawsuit, it can be even harder for an
individual. Even if you win, you may have nothing left! This is why it’s just as
important for individuals to use LLCs to protect their assets and deter law-
suits as it is for businesses.
Often, attorneys tie in asset protection with estate planning. Although it’s
imperative to protect your estate — making sure that it actually makes it to
your kids and not into the hands of some Joe Schmo who tripped over a sprin-
kler in your front lawn — estate planning doesn’t really have much bearing on
protecting your assets from litigators. In other words, just because you have
an estate plan, does not mean that your assets are protected while you’re
alive. See Chapter 16 for more on using an LLC with your estate planning.
When lawyers and creditors come calling
The saddest thing about lawsuits is that even if you win, you lose. A lot of
these lawyers who take on frivolous cases work on a contingency basis. This
means that they don’t charge the client unless they win the case. So, ulti-
mately, you may be the victor, but you are the only one paying the legal 
fees — and they can be debilitating. The only way to protect against having
to pay outrageous sums of money for seemingly petty arguments is to stay
out of court in the first place. I’m not saying that you should settle a lawsuit
brought against you. I’m saying that you should make your assets either
unapparent or unattractive to the wolves who are scoping them out. LLCs
can do just that.
244
Part IV: Making Cents of Taxes and Protecting Your Assets 

Those people and businesses who loan you money — your creditors — also
have their eye on your hard-earned assets. Had a bad month and didn’t keep
up with your debt? Your creditors will no doubt be looking at how they can
capitalize on their loss — and rightfully so. They lent you the money, and they
need to get it back. If you let an angry creditor have his way with your assets,
you’ll be in a huge hole with no way to climb out. To prevent this, make sure
that you have an LLC in place that protects your assets. When you are in con-
trol of your assets, attractive settlements are pretty easy to come by.
When it comes to suing a member of an LLC (where the person’s assets are
held), a judgment creditor only has one remedy — a charging order. This
means that the creditor can only receive the same distributions and alloca-
tions that the member previously received. He can’t take the actual asset, 
liquidate it, and spend the money. Because of this charging order remedy,
creditors can spend a long time holding their hand out without receiving a
penny if the other members don’t want them to (see Chapter 11 for more
details). This isn’t a good scenario for them and is rarely worth the time.
Therefore, an attorney will offer to settle for a lower amount or even avoid
the lawsuit altogether when she sees that an LLC is involved.
245
Chapter 14: Using Your LLC to Protect Your Assets
The birth of the frivolous lawsuit
Back in the old days, business was done on a
word and a handshake. Should a person not live
up to his agreement, he would face the shame
and disappointment of the people around him.
That disgrace was enough to keep people in
their place. Money was only associated with
hard work, not simple accidents. If you slipped
in the supermarket, you would simply be embar-
rassed. That’s all. You wouldn’t be thinking about
all of the free cash you could get from the local
family business.
Nowadays, things have changed. Lawyers
patrol hospitals, and commercials run on TV for
class-action lawsuits. If you’ve ever been in a
car accident, however minor, you have most
likely received a flood of letters from personal-
injury attorneys looking to make a buck.
If you backed out of a parking spot too fast and
got into a fender bender, there’s a good chance
that an attorney will be looking to sue you. If you
don’t have deep enough pockets, or they can’t
get to your assets, they will sue the insurance
company, the car maker, your Aunt Margaret
who purchased the car and loaned it to you to
drive — basically, they will sue anyone and
everyone who has money. Often, it doesn’t
matter whether you injured someone — all 
that matters is whether someone with deep
pockets can be targeted. Lawyers play on
jurors’ emotions — they make them sympathize
with the plaintiff, who may work a dead-end job
and can barely support her kids — and chastise
you for being one of the lucky few who has
struck it rich. The game is called Robin Hood —
and it’s one you needn’t play.
According to the Wall Street Journal, frivolous
lawsuits cost the average family approximately
$3,520 per year. Don’t be a statistic. Using LLCs
to protect your investments and your assets is
normally enough of a deterrent to keep you out
of the courtroom in the first place!

Now, if you aren’t at enough risk from lawsuits and creditors, remember that
you still have to worry about the IRS. You probably think that the IRS is part
of the all-powerful government and can just seize bank accounts, no matter
the reason. Nope! The IRS is subject to the same laws and restrictions as
most creditors; it just has a little bit more knowledge and disclosure.
Hiding your assets from the IRS can be difficult because you are most likely
reporting them and/or depreciating them on your tax returns. You don’t want
to hide from the IRS (that’s tax evasion), and you shouldn’t have to. Your
asset protection plan should be so solid that the IRS doesn’t have the ability
or, better yet, the justification for going after your assets to settle an IRS debt.
Liens can kill your business
Some of these lawyers are really good, and the worst thing that can happen is
to get sued by one of them without having any sort of asset protection plan in
place. Imagine . . . you get taken to court over a contract dispute and the
attorney talks the judge into placing a prejudgment lien on your assets — this
means that you can’t move, touch, or transfer your assets or even conduct
business with them until the lawsuit has been decided.
Say the amount of the lien covers the entire amount due on a ten-year con-
tract. It’s pretty hefty, and your assets don’t quite cover it. Your home and
your bank account are attached to the lien, and you aren’t even able to write
checks. If this happens, you may have a hard time buying necessities, such as
gas and food, but the worst thing of all is that you most likely won’t be able
to afford to pay your attorney to defend the case. Eek! You’re trapped! If this
happens, unless you have some good friends to keep you going in the mean-
time, you may have to settle immediately and for unfavorable terms.
What about when this happens to your business? What if you’re unable to
move money, write checks, pay bills, pay your rent, pay on your business
loans, or make payroll for two months or longer? Where would your business
be then? The damage could be so great that you would possibly lose every-
thing you’ve worked so long to build. Unless you have significant savings,
this could be debilitating.
Even if you get through the lawsuit without a prejudgment lien, you aren’t
necessarily in the clear. If you win the lawsuit, you’re okay, but what if you
lose? Say someone gets a judgment on you for more than you can afford to
pay at the moment? Unless you can immediately write a check for a big chunk
of change, the judgment creditor can request to have a judgment lien placed
on your assets. This means that your bank account is completely frozen. Your
home, rental property, savings account, mutual funds, CDs, kid’s college fund,
246
Part IV: Making Cents of Taxes and Protecting Your Assets 

everything is frozen and can be liquidated to pay the lien. Have equity in your
house that you want to use to pay for the lawsuit? You can’t refinance or sell!
Instead, your home will be put on the auction block, right before your eyes.
You can’t even collect income from your investment properties or invoice
your clients in your business. Liens are the worst thing that can happen to
you in business. Unless you have an LLC, that is.
You don’t have to lose a lawsuit to have a judge impose a lien. Anyone can
request a lien on your assets, including creditors or the IRS.
Why LLCs Are the Best Choice 
for Asset Protection
Some asset protection plans just try to hide your assets from prying credi-
tors and potential plaintiffs. Although that should be the first line of defense,
it isn’t nearly enough. You see, if you do get dragged into court, you probably
will be subpoenaed for the information or asked about it while on the stand.
In either case, you shouldn’t lie. If you do, you’ll have a lot more to lose than
your assets — you can lose your freedom.
If these predators see that you have hordes of cash and real estate sitting in
an LLC, there’s a good chance they won’t go after the assets in the first place.
Why? Because LLCs are very tough nuts to crack, and they know this. They
also know that if you are smart enough, you can trap them in a situation
where they are paying out money for you! And because most credit agencies
work on commission and attorneys work on a contingency basis, they 
don’t want to waste their time on you if they know they aren’t going to get paid.
When you choose to protect your assets with an LLC rather than another
entity, you win on multiple fronts.
 Because LLCs are pass-through entities (the business’s income and
expenses are reported to the IRS on the owners’ tax returns), you don’t
face as many tax consequences as you would if you held your assets in a
corporation. With a corporation, the profits are taxed at the end of the
year and when the profits are distributed to members, the distribution is
taxed again (see Chapter 2 for details).
 Although it’s advisable to do so, you aren’t legally required to hold an
annual meeting and keep the minutes on file. With a corporation, you
have a lot more paperwork to complete and hoops to jump through to
maintain your liability protection. (See Chapter 11 for more on meetings
and minutes.)

LLCs versus corporations: An example
Josh took over his father’s business, J.R. Marine
Inc., when he was only 23. He was smart and
good with numbers, and the business grew
steadily over the years. Ten years in, J.R. Marine
had taken over the market. It was good timing
too, because Josh had just met the love of his
life and was eager to start a family.
One day, he was in the parking lot of the local
supermarket, and he accidentally backed into a
woman’s car. The woman seemed all right to
him. They traded insurance information, and he
helped her on her way. Two months later, Josh
was served with a lawsuit. The woman claimed
that she was severely injured in the accident
and was unable to work her waitress job and
support her four kids (she was a single mom).
She was suing Josh for wages and emotional
trauma.
Josh’s attorney referred him to a partner who
handled litigation. After slapping down a $10,000
retainer to defend the case, Josh wiped the
sweat off of his brow and left the attorney to do
his work. Four months later, the case went to
trial. Josh couldn’t believe how the woman’s
attorney made him seem like the big, wealthy,
bad guy who thinks he can drive however he
wants to just because he has money, or how the
attorney portrayed the woman as a struggling
cocktail waitress who can’t afford to feed her
kids and now will never get ahead in life. The
woman, wearing a neck brace, cried on the
stand. Her attorney asked the jury to “do the
right thing.” Of course, their idea of the “right
thing” was to award the woman more than $2
million of Josh’s money.
At first Josh thought he was okay — after all, 
he didn’t have too much money in his bank
account. However, what he did have was the
ownership of the family business, which is con-
sidered a personal asset. Before long, his busi-
ness was seized. They liquidated the inventory,
the building, everything — just to pay off his
judgment. Josh was destroyed. He thought
because he had a corporation he was pro-
tected. The reality is that the business — his
livelihood — was never protected from him.
Had he formed an LLC, this would never have
happened.
If J.R. Marine Inc. had been J.R. Marine LLC,
Josh may not have been sued in the first place.
When the personal-injury lawyer did an asset
search to determine whether Josh had any
assets that could be taken away, he would have
seen that Josh’s business (or his share of the
business) was held in an LLC. Attorneys know
that LLCs are notoriously hard to get to, and the
smart ones will avoid them at any cost.
But if the plaintiff’s attorney was a rookie and
had never been bitten by an LLC before, he may
have tried to seize the LLC interests anyway. In
that case, he would have hit a brick wall called
a charging order. After the attorney obtained the
charging order, he would only have received the
distributions that the LLC’s manager (in this
case, Josh’s dad) decided to give to him. Josh’s
dad — being the smart guy that he is — would
have decided that instead of distributing the
profits, he would just keep them in the company.
Therefore, the unknowing lawyer would have
just indebted his client, the waitress, into paying
the taxes on Josh’s business. The lawyer would
have been rushing to settle the case for $2,000
to pay the medical expenses, and Josh’s busi-
ness would be safe.

 LLCs protect your personal assets from lawsuits against the business.
This is called the veil of limited liability. With corporations, CEOs, share-
holders, directors, and even employees can be attached to lawsuits
against the business. LLCs don’t allow the owners or employees to be
personally attacked for the actions of the business as a whole. (Chapter
11 contains more information on the veil of limited liability.)
 If you are sued personally, a charging order prevents a creditor from seiz-
ing your membership shares, and thus the LLC’s assets as payment. The
creditor gets no rights to the business and no say in the business. He
just waits for payment. If this happened to you and you had shares in a
corporation, the creditor could sell your shares of stock for payment.
(See Chapter 11 for more information on charging orders.)
 Contributions and distributions are tax-free. This means that, for the
most part, when you transfer assets in and out of the LLC, there’s no tax-
able event. (For more information, see Chapter 13.)
Protecting Your Assets with 
Some Simple Strategies
Protecting your assets is so simple that I challenge you to give me one good
reason why you shouldn’t do it. Not later in the year, not in a couple of
months, but now. You see, asset protection strategies only work if you do
them before you ever get into trouble. After you are sued by a creditor (or if

What’s the deal with trusts?
A couple of years ago, trusts were the hot thing
for asset protection, especially spendthrift
trusts where your assets couldn’t be touched by
creditors. You just named yourself as the bene-
ficiary and you were good to go! Unfortunately,
thanks to a New York Times article, which
blasted these trusts for allowing the wealthy to
avoid creditors, and Jim Talent, a Missouri sen-
ator, spendthrift trusts aren’t what they used 
to be.
Here’s the deal: Senator Talent slipped an act
into a bankruptcy bill, right before it was about
to pass, that allows creditors to get to any
assets that were put into trusts within the ten
years previous to the claim. Therefore, you can
still create a spendthrift trust, but it doesn’t do
much good if anything happens within the next
ten years. Not a good idea!
Unless you’re looking to add a trust to your arse-
nal for estate-planning purposes, I’d just stick
with an LLC.

the IRS is after you), you can’t transfer your assets into an LLC to protect
them. Otherwise, it looks like you did what is called a fraudulent conveyance
of assets. This means that you set up your asset protection plan to defraud
your creditors and prevent a specific claim. In this case, your assets will not
only be handed over to the creditor on a silver platter, but you may also face
some pretty steep fines and maybe even some jail time.
So you need to set up your asset protection plan when you don’t have any
lawsuits pending or creditors looming. After all, you never know what tomor-
row may bring. That’s why you need to set up your defenses early and make
sure that as you accumulate more and more in life, no one can take it away.
In the following sections, I go over a few simple strategies that you can use:
 Using a nominee to make it harder for others to find your assets
 Using the charging order law to your advantage to trap a creditor in a
bad position so he’ll have more incentive to settle in your favor
 Using multiple LLCs to segregate your assets from one another, so that if
one asset, such as a piece of property, is engaged in a lawsuit, the others
will be safe from seizure
 Forming two companies in different states to separate your business’s
assets from the actual operations of the company
 Transferring all of your personal assets into a family LLC that keeps finan-
cial instruments, such as stocks, bonds, cash, and mutual funds, safe
Privacy as the first step: 
Electing a nominee
Privacy is the first line of defense when it comes to asset protection. If people
don’t think you have anything, then they won’t bother suing you in the first
place. You know how the saying goes: “Own nothing, control everything.” But
that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t own and enjoy the finer things in life
because people may take those things. You’ve worked hard; you deserve to
enjoy the fruits of your labor. The world can see that you have money; that’s
fine — they just don’t need to know where it is. That’s where privacy comes
in handy.
Some states, like Nevada, protect the privacy of the LLC’s members. This
means that the members don’t need to be publicly listed in the articles of
organization or the annual reports your company must file with the Secretary
of State; only the managers have to be listed. If the members don’t need to be
listed in your state, then you can just hire a nominee to serve as your LLC’s
manager. A nominee is a person who can truthfully state on the stand that
250
Part IV: Making Cents of Taxes and Protecting Your Assets 

she is unrelated and unknown to you. You can hire a nominee from a nominee
company, usually for under $500 per year. Keep in mind, though, this only
works if your LLC is manager-managed.
If you’re in a state that doesn’t allow privacy protection for members, con-
sider forming your LLC in another state, such as Nevada, that does allow it.
After you have a nominee manager in place, unless you broadcast to the
world that you own the LLC, people won’t even think to look into the issue
further. Your name won’t be on public record, and unless they ask you
directly, creditors will have no way of knowing that you are even associated
with the LLC.
If your LLC is currently member-managed, then you need to amend your arti-
cles of organization to make it manager-managed. Otherwise, you have to list
your members (namely, you) on your annual report — which is public record.
Here’s the thing: Privacy won’t fully protect you. It’s not a strategy in and of
itself, per se, but more like an add-on. It’s icing on the cake. If you solely use a
manager-nominee and think that you are completely protected, you’ll get the
shock of your life when you get dragged into court. The lawyers will ask you
about your assets, and at that point, you have two choices: Give up the
goods, or perjure yourself. Considering that perjury is a pretty serious crimi-
nal offense, I would take door No. 1 — and that leads to you revealing the
location of your assets so they can be taken.
Setting up a booby trap
LLCs have two types of liability protection — they protect the individual from
the LLC’s liability and the LLC from the individual’s liability (called charging
order protection). Charging order protection is a powerful tool that you can
use to protect your LLC and its assets from any lawsuits or creditors that you
may acquire personally. Corporations don’t have this type of protection. If
your business is structured as a corporation with you as the sole or majority
owner, your personal creditors can seize your ownership of the corporation
and easily liquidate its assets and dissolve it to pay your debts. However,
because you own an LLC, the creditor can’t seize your ownership of the LLC;
he can only obtain a charging order against it.
You see, when a creditor obtains a charging order on your membership
shares, he doesn’t have the same powers that you do. Actually, he has zero
powers or say when it comes to your LLC; he can only receive the profit and
loss distributions that you receive as a member. So, assuming you have a dif-
ferent manager (preferably a corporation that you own, a nominee, or a close
family member), the manager can determine how the distributions are made.
(See Chapter 11 for lots of other facts about charging orders.)
251
Chapter 14: Using Your LLC to Protect Your Assets

Say, for instance, that your buddy manages the company; do you think that
he will hang you out to dry if a creditor obtains a charging order? Not likely.
Instead, he will do the following: He will make sure to report a profit at the
end of the year, but not distribute any of the profits. That way, the members
will have to pay taxes on the profits but won’t actually receive any money to
pay them. This is called phantom income. Now, when I say “members,” this
includes the creditor. Can you imagine?! A naïve creditor, instead of receiving
his check in the mail, gets a notice that he has to pay thousands of dollars in
taxes? (If the other members complain about having to pay taxes and not
receiving any income for a while, they can just borrow money from the LLC
and it can all be sorted out at a later date.)
To ensure the creditor (also known as the unwelcome member) knows what’s
going on, here’s what you do:
1. Send a letter to the creditor making them aware of the tax debt that
he owes and is obligated to pay.
2. Send a letter to the IRS letting them know how much the creditor
owes.
Include in the letter a point stating that you want to keep your LLC cur-
rent on its tax debt, and you suggest that, should the IRS not receive
payment, an audit on the creditor may be required.
3. Make sure to send a copy of this IRS letter to the creditor.
I guarantee you that it won’t be long before the creditor is approaching you
with a settlement amount that is definitely in your favor.
LLCs get special charging order protections because they are considered to
be partnerships. If you are operating as a single-member LLC, the judge in
your case may not grant you charging order protections and may allow the
creditor to foreclose on your membership. If you insist on flying solo, then I
recommend that you issue a small percentage of shares to a trusted friend or
to a corporation that you control.
Using charging order protections is a really powerful strategy for LLCs; how-
ever, it’s a common mistake for people to rely on this strategy when they
have member-managed LLCs. The manager has to be the one to determine
the profit and loss allocations. If the LLC is member-managed, then a creditor
stepping in as a member may be able to actually determine these allocations
on his own. This depends on the operating agreement and the judge’s deci-
sion. To avoid this risk entirely, do not make your LLC member-managed.
Even if all of the current members are managing, you should still designate
your LLC as manager-managed; then name all of the current members as indi-
vidual managers.
252
Part IV: Making Cents of Taxes and Protecting Your Assets 

The more LLCs, the merrier!
So, your business is protected from you, and you are protected from your
business — but what protects your business from itself? When your business
is sued, the creditors may not be able to go after your personal assets, but
they can still go after the business’s assets! We need to fix that.
Any business or property that operates directly with the public is at risk of
being sued. If you have all of your business assets in your operating company
and you get sued, all of your business assets can be seized. The same goes
for personal assets. If you own ten properties and put them all in the same
LLC, then someone slips and falls on your first property and sues you, every-
thing in that LLC is up for grabs, namely all ten properties.
The best and easiest way to protect what’s yours is by insulating each of your
major assets in its own LLC. This can be somewhat costly, but on large
assets, it’s a small price to pay. For instance, New York taxi cab companies
often place each taxi into a separate LLC. That way, if one driver gets into an
accident and the cab company gets sued, only that one cab can be seized and
liquidated to pay off the claim. That LLC can then be dissolved, and the taxi
company is still standing. You don’t have to worry about million-dollar judg-
ments now!
253
Chapter 14: Using Your LLC to Protect Your Assets
What happens if your charging 
order protection fails you?
Lawsuits are still open to interpretation; thus, a
judge can decide your case however she
wants, depending on how she sees the evi-
dence. Although uncommon, if a judge finds
good cause, she can circumvent the charging
order protections that LLCs offer and instead
allow a creditor to foreclose on a member’s
interest. In this case, you and your partners can
do a couple of things to minimize the damage:
 You can draft a provision in the operating
agreement that requires a debtor member
to sell his membership shares back to the
LLC or to the other members. You will have
to give a formula that determines the value
of those shares, or the buy-back can be
done for the exact amount of the member’s
original investment in the LLC. This way, you
and your partners are assured that you
won’t have to deal with any unscrupulous,
transplanted members who don’t have your
company’s best interests in mind.
 If a member is already in the process of
having his membership shares seized, cre-
ating a huge problem for the other mem-
bers, the remaining members can vote to
dissolve the LLC and purchase all of the
assets upon liquidation. They can also
choose to form a new LLC without the
indebted member and transfer the assets to
the new entity. Any monies that would be
given to the indebted member instead go to
the creditor who holds those membership
shares.

Make sure you aren’t already facing a lawsuit when setting up a structure like
this. If you have been sued and start transferring entities to different LLCs to
protect them from the creditor, then you are engaging in fraudulent con-
veyance. Not only will it not hold up in court, but it’s also illegal. Make sure to
set up your asset protection now. After you are sued, it’s too late.
You may have heard about a new version of the LLC that is popping up in
some states and gaining popularity called a series LLC. A series LLC is like
having lots of smaller entities under one umbrella LLC. I go into more detail
on the series LLC in Chapter 2. They are great entities and may save you
some dough in state fees; however, they are newer entities and don’t have
much case law to back them up. Therefore, I would speak with your corpo-
rate consultant at length before setting one up.
You don’t need to spend a lot of money in legal fees to jump on the asset pro-
tection boat. Although some attorneys may charge you thousands of dollars
for fancy-sounding trusts or family limited partnerships (read Chapter 2 for
more info on FLPs), when it comes to asset protection, all you normally need
is a simple LLC. More than one LLC is ideal for many people, but if you only
want to dole out the cash for one — that’s a lot better than nothing.
Following the dual-company strategy
An easy way to protect your business’s assets is to simply not keep them in
the LLC that operates with the public. You can do this by creating a separate
LLC that holds your primary LLC’s assets (making this a dual-company strat-
egy). This is my favorite strategy by far, and in addition to keeping your
assets safe, you also save on some of your state and local taxes. This can
work no matter the LLC’s tax structure and whether it’s manager-managed or
member-managed.
Here’s how it works: Say you decide to start a local pizza delivery company.
You live in a high-tax state such as California. In this case, I would advise you
to form your LLC in the state of California (not much you can do about this —
if you’re located there, you have to register and pay taxes there, no matter
what). Then, place all of your assets, such as your pizza ovens, cash regis-
ters, and so on, into a Nevada LLC that has elected corporate taxation (see
Chapter 13 to find out how to make tax elections). For extra protection, I
would have you make this Nevada LLC a completely private entity by hiring a
nominee (see the “Privacy as the first step: Electing a nominee” section ear-
lier in the chapter).
Your Nevada LLC that owns the assets then leases those to your California
LLC (your operating company — the one that deals with the customers, ven-
dors, and so on). This way, your company’s assets are 100 percent protected.
Why? Because they are in a completely separate entity. Your California LLC
254
Part IV: Making Cents of Taxes and Protecting Your Assets 

controls the assets, but doesn’t own them, which is the most powerful posi-
tion to be in. If your company gets into a legal predicament, such as a cus-
tomer gets injured, the inquiring attorney will see that your company is
completely devoid of assets. Even if he finds out that you own the Nevada
LLC, he can’t do anything.
If you choose to use this strategy, make sure the lease between the California
LLC and the Nevada LLC is legitimate. You need to pay a reasonable leasing
fee to the Nevada LLC every month or every quarter. This may seem like a
pain in the butt, but believe me, this is a good thing because if you ever go to
court, your strategy will be legitimate.
One of the main reasons you should form your LLC in Nevada is because
Nevada has absolutely zero taxes. Zero business taxes, zero franchise taxes,
zero personal income taxes — zilch. And you have to elect corporate taxation
on that Nevada LLC because if you were to try this plan with an LLC with
pass-through taxation, although your assets would still be protected, the
profits would flow through to you personally, and you would be required to
pay taxes in whatever state you live in.
So, here’s how the tax reduction goes. If you have $100,000 in profit at the
end of the year that you want to keep in the company, instead of having the
profit flow through to you and your partners and paying state and federal
taxes on it, you can have it go to your Nevada LLC as a lease payment for the
use of the assets. This $100,000 payment is a legitimate tax deduction, so it
eliminates the profit in your LLC. After the money is in your Nevada LLC, it’s
only taxed at the federal corporate tax rate (which is usually just above 15
percent), as opposed to the personal income tax rate (which can be 35 per-
cent or more!). If you want to save money for assets or other business-related
items, this is a great strategy to use.
Keep in mind that you can also use Wyoming as a tax haven; however,
Wyoming doesn’t allow single-member LLCs, so you would have to find some
partners.
Depending on your state laws, your Nevada LLC may have to register in the
state that you are doing business in. This won’t affect the strategy as a whole,
but you’ll lose some of your privacy. Speak with your corporate consultant
about this so she can plan accordingly.
When family comes first: The family LLC
Although a family LLC sounds really official, it’s really just an LLC like any
other — you don’t have to do anything different when you file your articles of
organization. It just serves a different purpose. The family LLC protects the
assets you and your family will need in the future. If you are like the majority
255
Chapter 14: Using Your LLC to Protect Your Assets

of folks, you have a savings or money-market account that is coupled with
your checking account. Maybe you have some mutual funds. Regardless,
everything is in your name. That’s not good. Remember: Own nothing, control
everything. Instead, your assets should grow under the protection of an LLC.
The usual arrangement for a family LLC is that you and your spouse both
own 50 percent of the membership. If you can throw a couple of shares to a
non-family member for good measure, that helps protect your assets even
further. After the LLC is set up, all savings accounts, insurance policies, bro-
kerage accounts, mutual funds, CDs, bonds, and so on are transferred into
the LLC. Don’t worry — this isn’t a taxable event.
Do not place your home in your family LLC. Your home can be the source of
many lawsuits. For example, if a neighborhood kid sneaks onto your property
and accidentally drowns in the pool, all of the assets in the LLC can be taken.
Instead, form a separate LLC for your home or get a homestead exemption.
Now, if you or your spouse is sued, the assets will be safe in the entity, and
the creditor can only obtain a charging order. In this case, you use the booby-
trap method that I outlined in the “Setting up a booby trap” section earlier in
the chapter to resolve the situation.
Also, if your LLC acquires any debts or obligations, you (and your spouse)
aren’t liable for them. For instance, say you are extended a margin on your
brokerage account and you make a few bad trades; unless you personally
guaranteed the loan, you aren’t responsible for it — although all of your
other assets in the LLC may be at risk of being liquidated to repay the debt.
The more that your family LLC is legally separated from you, the better it is.
You can do this by using nominees and finding a way to make your personal
assets seem like a normal course of business. Create a paper trail that sepa-
rates you from the assets in the LLC. For instance, if your vehicles are in the
LLC, make sure to lease them to your family. This is also a good way to have a
legitimate purpose for transferring savings into the LLC on a regular basis.
Make sure to document everything — have legitimate contracts and keep
your records in order as if it were a real business. The less obvious it is that
the LLC only serves to protect your assets, the more certain you can be that
the LLC will be rock solid in the courtroom.

eal estate offers the easiest path to success . . . and the easiest path to
lawsuits. If someone is living in a rental property that you own and is
injured, he will most likely sue, especially because he doesn’t even have to do
an asset search to know that you have at least one valuable asset — the prop-
erty he’s living in.
Even if you just own vacant land, you are still open to multitudes of liabilities.
It seems as though no matter how clear the signs are, trespassers will always
end up on your property. If an accident happens, you will most likely be held
responsible. Not to mention all of the environmental liabilities that can occur
with vacant land. Although you should be wary, all of these potential liabili-
ties aren’t the end of the world. With some good advice (starting with this
chapter!), and an LLC or two, you’ll be fine!
LLCs: The Entity of Choice 
for Real Estate Assets
There is absolutely no doubt that LLCs are the best entities for holding real
estate. They offer the most liability protection of any entity type out there
(Chapter 2 goes into detail about the other entities), and when you’re looking
to protect valuable assets this peace of mind is priceless.

Different people need different strategies. I’m writing in generalities, so keep
in mind that you may be one of the few cases where a corporation or S corpo-
ration is your best bet. For instance, if you are flipping properties so often
that it’s considered an operating business, a corporation may not be such a
bad thing.
Before you create your plan for protecting your real estate investments, make
sure to speak with a qualified professional. You need to get everything right
in the beginning because you normally only find out that you have made a
mistake after it’s too late to fix it.
In the following sections, I go over some of the best reasons for using LLCs
for holding your real estate (or land trusts). Before you proceed, though, here
are some other goodies to keep in mind about the benefits of an LLC:
 LLCs are the most flexible entities around. You decide how the property
is managed — you make your own rules. You can put whatever you want
in your operating agreement, including what rights, powers, and limita-
tions the company’s manager is subject to.
 LLCs don’t require the same intensive formalities that corporations
require. For LLCs, minutes, resolutions, and so on are optional (but rec-
ommended!). For instance, if you don’t do your annual meeting minutes,
you won’t have to worry about such dire consequences as your entity
being disregarded in court and your personal assets seized.
 Everyone involved in the LLC — all members, managers, and employees —
is protected from being held liable for the actions of the company itself.
This is a stark contrast to the limited partnership, where only the limited
partners, and not the general partners, are protected.
Corporations: The worst choice
When it comes to real estate, corporations are by far an inferior choice. Don’t
get me wrong — I don’t dislike corporations at all. Actually, I recommend
them to a lot of clients who are starting up small businesses. But when it
comes to real estate, corporations are the worst! Corporations are to real
estate like kryptonite is to Superman . . . they are poisonous. Don’t do it.
I wish that were enough to convince you, but regardless of what I say, there is
always a skeptic out there who needs more information. Well, here you go —
two important things to keep in mind:
 Corporations don’t offer the same level of liability protection that LLCs
do. They only offer one layer instead of two. Your personal assets are
protected in the event that the corporation gets sued; but if you get sued
personally, your corporation is toast — in other words, it’s liquidated to
258
Part IV: Making Cents of Taxes and Protecting Your Assets 

pay off your judgment. Considering that real estate is normally pretty
expensive and not something that you want to lose, this may sway you
to use an LLC instead.
 Double taxation. The term “double taxation” alone should make you
want to run far, far away. This is the main reason why you should never
use a corporation to hold your real estate assets, especially if they are
rental properties. You see, all income that the property receives is first
taxed at the corporate tax level and then taxed at the high capital gains
tax rate after you take the cash out of the company.
Here’s an example of how double taxation can hurt you. Say you purchased
an investment property -in an LLC - at $500,000 during the California real
estate boom, then held it for four years until it appreciated to $1 million (only
in California!). You now want to sell it at this price before the market turns.
This means that you will realize a $500,000 profit which is passed on to you.
This profit will be taxed at a long-term capital gains rate, which is only 15 per-
cent — a pretty good deal!
Let’s say, instead, you chose to hold that same investment property in a cor-
poration. First, the profit is taxed at the corporate rate, which means your
corporation will pay about $170,000 in taxes (15 percent on the first $50,000,
then 34 to 37 percent on the remaining). Then, after you take the remaining
$330,000 personally, you’ll need to pay personal tax on the dividend income.
That means you’ll be paying an additional $129,030 in federal taxes (assuming
you are in the 39.1 percent tax bracket) for a grand total of $299,030 in taxes.
Yikes — and you haven’t even figured in state taxes yet!
At this point, clients often bring up the value of the S corporation. After all, S
corporations can elect to have the similar pass-through taxation as the LLC
and therefore are not subject to double taxation, so there is very little differ-
ence. Although the differences appear slight on the surface, you’ll actually
still dish out more cash for taxes with an S corporation than an LLC. Say you
want to transfer the property out of the S corporation without selling it
(maybe to convert it to a personal residence for the added tax benefits, for
instance); then you’ll be taxed. LLCs, on the other hand, allow you to transfer
property in and out of the entity without being taxed.
If your business is operating as a corporation and wants to purchase some
property for its operations, you should put the building into a separate LLC.
Not only will the building then be insulated from any lawsuits filed against
the business, but holding the building in an LLC can also save you from the
whole double taxation debacle. The corporation can be a member of that LLC
and contribute the money for the purchase (which is a tax-free event). The
corporation can then lease the office space, which is a deductible cost. As far
as the LLC goes, the rental income it receives from the business is offset by
the operating expenses of the property and its depreciation. You only pay
taxes on what is left over.
259
Chapter 15: Real Estate and LLCs

Land trusts are just icing on the cake
If you are currently in real estate, or have been heavily researching it, then
you’ve probably heard of land trusts. (For those of you who don’t know what
a land trust is, it’s trust where one person, “the trustee,” agrees to hold the
title of the property for the benefit of another person, “the beneficiary”.)
Although they seem like a newer thing and are gaining popularity, land trusts
have been around for a while — a long while. They go back as far as the
Roman Empire. In Western history, they were heavily used during the Tudor
period in England, when owning land came with many more burdens than
just kooky tenants, such as serving in the military. Because land trusts offer
such a thick veil of privacy, citizens of England hid their land ownership to
get out of fighting the war of the week.
Today, land trusts are used to avoid a different type of war — that which
exists in the courtroom. Land trusts not only allow you to keep your real
estate out of your name, but you can also use them to avoid probate and
have the property immediately pass on to your heirs upon death. Because of
a trust’s privacy protection, large corporations often use them to secretly
buy up large plots of land in little chunks without anyone being the wiser.
How land trusts are set up
Like all trusts, land trusts have a trustee and a beneficiary. The trustee is the
one that is on public record and can be a person, LLC, corporation, or other
type of entity. Although the trustee is on public record, they don’t own the
trust; the beneficiary does. You are the beneficiary. Therefore, you indirectly
own and ultimately control the trust; however, your name is kept private and
can’t be accessed by the roving eye of a litigation attorney looking to sue you.
Sounds great, right? Well, it is! Sort of. You see, land trusts sound really offi-
cial, but the reality is that they are no more separate from yourself than a
sole proprietorship is. They aren’t separate entities with separate identities.
What does this mean for you? You guessed it — it means zero liability protec-
tion. If one of your tenants burns himself while messing around with the
water heater and decides to sue, you can kiss your house, your car, and the
property in your land trust goodbye. Also, if your neighbor sues you person-
ally for running over her cat (accidentally, of course!), your land trust is con-
sidered personal property and it and everything in it, including your real
estate holdings, can be taken away. Your attorney may have you place your
assets in a land trust for estate planning purposes, but considering the law-
suit statistics nowadays, there is a good chance that your assets won’t even
make it past your retirement without being taken away by some snarling per-
sonal injury attorney.
260
Part IV: Making Cents of Taxes and Protecting Your Assets 

A good question that all of my clients ask me is, if the attorney doesn’t know I
own it, how can they take it away? Well, that’s easy. They get you on the
stand and ask you point blank if you own any real estate properties. You can’t
lie. After all, you are the land trust’s beneficiary, also known as a beneficial
owner. You have to tell the court that you own the real estate and also dis-
close any other assets you have, whether in land trusts or not. So as soon as
you get dragged into court, the little protection that your land trust offered
you disintegrates.
Pluses and minuses of land trusts
Land trusts do have their benefits. Privacy is huge nowadays, and if you don’t
want to use a nominee (a person who allows you to maintain your privacy 
as the LLC’s owner) for your LLC (see Chapter 14), then a land trust will be
perfect for you, as long as it’s paired with a good ole LLC that can deliver on
its shortcomings. Put an LLC and land trust together, and it’s double trouble
for anyone who wants to steal your hard-earned assets. The LLC has the 
liability protection, and the land trust offers the privacy and estate planning
advantages.
The best way to maximize the benefits of both the land trust and the LLC is
to make the LLC the beneficiary of the land trust. That way, if you need to
take the stand, you can easily say that you don’t own the land trust, your LLC
does. If the plaintiff wants to continue to sue you, great! Then you can just
snag him in the awesome LLC booby trap that I outline in Chapter 14. But
that will rarely come to pass. If the attorney is smart, he’ll know you’re as
smart as you look and won’t want to mess with you any further. He’ll most
likely drop the case or offer a reasonable settlement.
Now, holding your real estate in a land trust with an LLC as the beneficiary
has some other pluses and minuses. Because it would take pages and pages
to go over them all, I’m just going to give you a brief overview.
Here are some advantages:
 The property’s sales price can be kept off public record. This can help
keep property taxes lower than they would be at the property’s fair-
market value.
 When you sell or gift the property, it can be done quickly and efficiently.
You don’t have to record a new deed; you just name a new beneficiary.
 You can easily continue the project in the event that a partner dies.
261
Chapter 15: Real Estate and LLCs

Here are the disadvantages:
 You cannot do a tax-free, like-kind (IRS Section 1031) exchange with
property in a land trust. You must transfer the land out of the trust for
the like-kind exchange to be possible. This may involve sizeable fees and
taxes and also removes the veil of privacy during the transfer.
 Often, trustees are unwilling to take certain necessary actions on your
behalf, such as signing mortgage documents. The mortgage may need to
be placed in your name, and this eliminates all privacy protection.
Looking at the LLC Property Logistics
Like many things, putting property into a newly formed LLC sounds easier
than it actually is. Instead of just figuring it out as you go, you’ll need some
real-world advice to guide you. The reality is that mortgage companies are
skittish about loaning money to newly formed LLCs. I mean, wouldn’t you be?
The LLC has no financial history, no assets, no credit score to go by . . . the
bank would probably be better off lending money to a 4-year-old. If you
already own the property and want to transfer the title — this can also
quickly become a sticky situation. You need to prepare for these situations,
among others, when setting up your asset protection plan.
Deciding which state to form in
Unfortunately, in the case of rental properties, you don’t gain too many tax ben-
efits by forming the LLC that holds the property in a tax haven, such as Nevada
or Wyoming, unless, of course, the property is actually located in Nevada or
Wyoming — in that case, good thinkin’! Renting a property to someone is con-
sidered “doing business,” and therefore, you are required to register in that
state and also pay franchise fees (a common term for state business taxes or
fees). Also, for the most part, the lawsuits against your property will be han-
dled in the state that the property is in and where the incident occurred. So, if
another state has better laws than yours does, you may not be able to take
advantage of them, even if your LLC is domiciled there.
You may get around having to register to transact business in a particular
state if all you’re doing is holding vacant land. Holding onto land is not consid-
ered “conducting business” as long as you haven’t started the development
process and aren’t receiving any rent payments. In this case, you can probably
form your LLC in Nevada or Wyoming and not have to worry about foreign
filing or paying taxes in the state that the property is actually located in.
262
Part IV: Making Cents of Taxes and Protecting Your Assets 

If your rental property is going to make a lot of profit and your state imposes
some pretty hefty taxes, then I would use the dual-company strategy that I
outlined in Chapter 14 to reduce the amount of state taxes you pay. In this
case, you just form an LLC in the state your property is located in, and then
transfer the property to that LLC. You then form a Nevada or Wyoming corpo-
ration and set this up as a management company that you pay to manage the
property. You then pay a reasonable percentage of the LLC’s profits to the
management company. These profits are now safe and secure in a tax-free
entity and away from the potential creditors and lawsuits of the property.
Getting lenders to loan to an LLC
If you just formed your LLC yesterday, you may have a hard time getting your
banker to loan it money. After all, when banks loan money, they have certain
criteria that they use to evaluate credit-worthiness. For instance, with busi-
nesses, they look at cash flow and assets. With individuals, they look at
income and credit scores. Your LLC has none of these. From the bank’s per-
spective, your LLC has no credit history, no track record, and no assets.
Therefore, you’ll most likely be required to personally guarantee the loan.

Chapter 15: Real Estate and LLCs
Protecting your home
I know that with all of the benefits of LLCs that I
have laid out, you’re going to be tempted to put
your personal residence into an LLC. After all,
you know that LLCs can protect your assets
from creditors and lawsuits — and what more
important asset do you have than the home you
have built your life in? Well, as tempting as it
may be, don’t do it.
Owning a home comes with a lot of amazing tax
benefits that you could lose if you transfer it out
of your name. For instance, when you sell the
property, you won’t have the tax-free benefit
that you are currently getting. You will also lose
your mortgage interest deduction.
Most states have laws that automatically pro-
tect your home in the event of a lawsuit or lien.
This is called a homestead exemption and only
applies to your personal residence — invest-
ment properties don’t count. You should check
with your state laws to see whether this exemp-
tion is automatic or whether you have to file a
claim to acquire it. With the exception of a pos-
sible small filing fee, homestead exemptions are
free.
Depending on your state, your homestead
exemption may cover all or part of the equity
you have in your home. Some states, like
Florida, Texas, and Oklahoma, cover your home
100 percent, while other states only cover it up
to a certain dollar amount.

Now that you understand this fact, you have to try to persuade the bank to
allow the LLC to hold the property’s title (the legal document which shows
the ownership of the property). Banks obviously don’t like this. They want
the person guaranteeing the loan to hold the title. However, the bank usually
relents in certain instances.
I guarantee you that the worst way to get the bank to let the LLC hold the title
is to tell your banker that you want to transfer the property into the LLC for
asset protection purposes. Banks hate that phrase. After all, they are some of
the biggest creditors around. However, bankers do understand (and respect!)
estate planning issues. Let your banker know that you want to transfer the
property into the newly formed LLC for estate planning purposes. If your
banker isn’t savvy enough to understand what you’re doing, then shop around.
I’m sure you can find a bank that is more than willing to accommodate you.
After you get a banker on board, you’ll get the loan personally. Then, when
the title is in your name, you can transfer it into the LLC’s name. The whole
process shouldn’t take more than a few days to complete. You’ll still be per-
sonally guaranteeing the loan; however, the title will be in the name of your
LLC and protected from creditors.
If you are currently financed and want to transfer the title into your LLC,
check with your mortgage company first. Transferring the title may trigger a
due-on-sale clause in your contract, which means that you’ll have to pay your
mortgage back in full. That will force you to refinance. Mortgage companies
will often enforce this when you have locked in a really low fixed rate and
they want you to refinance at a higher rate.
If your mortgage company won’t allow you to transfer your property into an
LLC, you may want to see if it will allow you to transfer the property into a living
trust for “estate planning purposes.” Most mortgage companies have policies
that accommodate this sort of thing. If so, have an attorney form a living trust (a
trust that a grantor creates while he is still alive), then make your LLC the
trust’s beneficiary. Now you’ll still get the protection that an LLC offers, and you
won’t trigger a due-on-sale clause when you transfer your property.
Transferring the title
After the LLC has been formed and you are in the clear to transfer the title of
the property to the LLC, you are ready to prepare a deed (a document which
transfers the ownership of a property). You can choose from a lot of different
types of deeds. Some make the original owner responsible for all current
defects or liabilities of the property, while others waive the previous owner

Chapter 15: Real Estate and LLCs
Making the 1031 exchange work 
when you have partners
If you have property that you want to eventually
do a 1031 exchange on, and you have multiple
owners, the best way to structure the deal is to
have each partner form his own single-member
LLC, like Jack and Mary in the figure. Then, all of
the members’ LLCs will own their portion of 
the property as tenants-in-common. This way,
you still have liability protection (through your
LLC), and you can still execute a like-kind 1031
exchange.

from all responsibility — the property is just transferred as is. If you are
transferring the property from your own name to an LLC that you control, I’d
use the latter. After all, it is a much easier deed to draft. The deed you will
want to use is called a quit-claim deed. You can download a copy of a sample
quit-claim deed at www.myllc.com/dummies.

The deed should be in the LLC’s name and be signed by you and anyone else
who will be authorizing the transfer of the property. The deed will most likely
have to be notarized. Now you’re ready to file! The deed must be filed in the
county that the property is located in. As to exactly where you file it, I can’t tell
you specifically. The exact office differs from county to county, so you need to
do a little bit of research to get the office’s name and address. I’d start with the
county recorder’s office or the county clerk’s office and go from there.
Your property should be held in the name of your LLC. For instance, your
county recorder should show that your parcel number is titled to your LLC. If
this isn’t recorded properly, your assets could be in jeopardy.
Make sure to check with your title insurance company before transferring the
title. Some insurance companies will cancel coverage if the title has been
transferred to a new entity.
You have to be careful, because although contributions to an LLC are tax-free,
some states impose a separate transfer tax. It often depends on why the
property is being transferred, and in some circumstances, the tax burden can
be pretty hefty. This is why I recommend you do a quick phone consultation
with a real estate attorney or tax advisor who specializes in the county that
the property is located in.
Using a Series LLC to Hold 
Multiple Properties
Series LLCs are the newest, coolest things around. If you own multiple pieces
of real estate (or other assets), you’re going to love them! They will make
your life so much easier.
Up until a couple of years ago, advisors and attorneys alike were recommend-
ing that business owners and real estate investors place each of their impor-
tant assets (be it a vehicle, a trademark, some equipment, or piece of
property) into a separate LLC. Although this was the safest thing you could
do, the paperwork could get a little ridiculous. Not to mention, in states like
California where the annual franchise fee is over $700 per entity, this strategy
could also get really expensive, really fast.
266
Part IV: Making Cents of Taxes and Protecting Your Assets 

Well, the folks in Delaware — always itching to provide the latest and greatest
in asset protection vehicles — saw an opportunity. They decided to eliminate
all headaches associated with forming and managing multiple LLCs and thus
created what’s now referred to as a series LLC. A series LLC is like a lot of
little LLCs all put together under one big umbrella. These little LLCs are
referred to as cells. Each cell is a separate and distinct entity and can have
different members and managers than its brother cells.
Series LLCs have recently caught on and are available in more and more
states every year. Even if your state does not yet allow you to form a series
LLC, you can still create one in another state. You’ll just have to work with a
consulting company to analyze your business strategy and set up the struc-
ture for you.
Unfortunately, the Series LLC is so new that there is no guidance from most
federal or state taxing authorities as to how Series LLC’s will be treated.
However, in 2006 the California Franchise Tax Board issued a ruling that it
would treat each series or cell as a separate LLC that requires a separate fran-
chise tax return. This is on top of the usual state law requirement that each
series or cell needs to have a separate checking account and accounting.
Although the series LLC adds extra flexibility and saves you some dough in
filing fees, these features don’t compare to the added benefit of liability pro-
tection. With a regular LLC, if your LLC gets sued, your personal assets are
protected — we’ve already established that. However, everything inside the
LLC is fair game. If you have a prosperous business or a lot of real estate
holdings, creditors don’t need to worry about going after your personal
assets — the business assets alone will keep them happy and fed for years to
come! Well, the series LLC takes away this incentive.
If someone sues a series LLC, she’s limited to taking the assets that were
actually involved in the lawsuit. For instance, if you have five rental proper-
ties held by one regular LLC, and the tenant of one rental property gets
injured and sues the LLC for damages, then all five rental properties can be
seized to settle the debt. With a series LLC, though, things are a lot different!
If you place each of the five properties into different cells of the series LLC,
then when the tenant sues you, only the property that she lives in and is
suing about can be seized to settle the judgment. All of the other properties
are safe. Think of each cell of a series LLC as a veil of protection that keeps
that particular asset from being seized for the actions of another asset in a
different cell (see Figure 15-1).

Estate Planning: Avoiding 
Death Taxes
In This Chapter
 Understanding estate taxes
 Dodging the gift tax
 Using LLCs to protect your estate
You know what they say: “Nothing is as certain as death and taxes.” Well,
if you leave it to me (and a qualified estate planning attorney), those two
don’t have to go hand in hand.
I know, I know. Death isn’t an easy thing to talk about. Almost everyone
seems to think that it won’t happen to them. Unfortunately, it’s pretty
inevitable. It will happen to you, and sometimes sooner than you think. If you
were to die tomorrow, where would that leave your loved ones financially?
You have worked very hard over the course of your lifetime, and upon your
death, you’ll most likely want to keep the rewards in the family or give them
to charity. You surely won’t want to give them to the IRS.
Estate taxes were meant to be taxes on the super-rich, but under the new 
tax law, it has been proved that individuals with estates from $1 million to 
$5 million end up paying the most tax. I think this happens for two reasons:
 The new tax law plays around with the tax basis of the assets (which 
I cover later in this chapter).
 The super-rich are generally more prudent about structuring their
estates to take advantage of as many tax breaks as possible. This is what
I’m going to show you how to do in this chapter.
In this chapter, I introduce you to estate planning and gift taxes, and then
show you how LLCs give you better control over what happens to your
assets and taxes after you pass away. I also give you a couple of pointers on
using gifts and trusts in your estate planning strategy.

It would be impossible to cover all of the facets of estate planning in a single
chapter. In this chapter, I only cover the federal estate tax structure and the
role of LLCs in estate planning. For a more in-depth analysis of the topic, get
the book Estate Planning For Dummies (Wiley) by Jordan Simon and Brian
Caverly. I also encourage you to work with a qualified attorney who special-
izes in estate planning and family law.
Getting Acquainted with Estate 
Planning and Gift Taxes
Clients often ask me how much they need to be worth to make estate plan-
ning necessary. My answer: If you have $1 million or more in assets, then you
need an estate plan. Also, if you own property that has appreciated a sizeable
amount (even if you have refinanced and taken the equity out of it), then you
must plan your estate. And with estates come estate taxes.
Even if you are young, you shouldn’t ignore estate planning. Life is a fragile
gift that can be taken away at any moment. If you are successful and have
accumulated any measure of wealth, you need to plan now to protect your
money from falling into the wrong hands upon your death.
You need estate planning not only to reduce the tax burdens of your heirs,
but also to dictate who your heirs are. Your offspring may be warm and won-
derful now, but you’d be surprised. Upon your death, all bets are off, and it
isn’t uncommon for large estates to end up divvied out in court because of
outraged children. Wills can normally do the trick when it comes to doling
out inheritances, but a well-crafted estate plan using LLCs can be pretty bul-
letproof should anyone decide to contest your last dying wish.
In the next few sections, I go over the tax regulations in more detail so you
can use the information to better plan your approach to your estate planning.
Understanding the basics of estate taxes
Estate taxes, often called death taxes, can be an astronomical burden to your
children or grandchildren if you aren’t careful. The government wants you to
think that with the new tax breaks, estate taxes have been nearly eliminated.
Unfortunately, that isn’t the case.
270
Part IV: Making Cents of Taxes and Protecting Your Assets 

Let me explain how the IRS figures estate taxes. Upon your death, everything
you own is added up — business interests, real estate, securities, insurance,
cash, annuities, and so on — and this amounts to what the IRS calls your
gross estate. Normally, these assets are calculated based on their current fair
market value, not what you originally paid for them. After your gross estate is
calculated, the IRS allows certain deductions, such as mortgages, certain
charitable expenses, and any costs associated with administering the estate.
With these deductions in place, you now have what the IRS calls your taxable
estate.
From here, you add all of your lifetime taxable gifts (the amount of money you
gift in your lifetime that goes over your $12,000 per year limit), and the estate
tax is computed. You then subtract the available credit (courtesy of Uncle
Sam) — which varies from $1 million to $3.5 million, depending on the year
you pass away — and your children are taxed on the remaining amount. The
tax rate ranges from 45 percent to 55 percent, depending on the year (with
the exception of 2010, which I discuss later in the chapter). The kids gener-
ally have to pay the estate taxes within nine months of the date of their
parent’s death.
Because many estates consist of property, it is not uncommon for the total
amount of the estate to go over the $1 million exemption. When this occurs,
the kids can face pretty astronomical tax burdens. Unless the heirs are inde-
pendently wealthy and have a lot of liquid cash to pay the tax outright, they’ll
need to sell the property or qualify for a loan to use the equity to cover the
tax debt. This is why it’s even more imperative to have an estate plan if you
intend to pass on assets that aren’t liquid.
Knowing when your estate won’t be taxed
If you pass away while you’re still married, then to the extent you leave
assets to your spouse, your estate won’t be subject to federal gift or estate
taxes, no matter the amount. The U.S. has what is called an unlimited marital
deduction. This means that whatever you pass on to your spouse is tax free
and doesn’t eat up any of your $1 million gift tax exemption or your estate tax
exemption (which I discuss in further detail in the next section).
Estates under $1 million are never required to pay any estate tax. The heirs
aren’t even required to file a return. The only exception occurs when you have
been gifting more than $1 million per year to the heir who receives the estate.
In that case, you should speak with an attorney who specializes in estate plan-
ning so she can add up all of your gifting overages from the past years and
give you an exact amount of tax that your heir will be required to pay.
271
Chapter 16: Estate Planning: Avoiding Death Taxes

Understanding the Tax Reconciliation
Relief Act
In 2001, Congress passed the Economic Growth and Tax Reconciliation Relief
Act, which implemented a reduction of federal estate taxes on a sliding scale.
This means that your children could feasibly be paying a lot less in estate
taxes — as long as you die before December 31, 2010, when the act expires.
Now, unless you plan on taking your own life so your kids can receive some
extra dough, you’d be much wiser to implement an estate plan instead of
relying on the government to cut you a break.
Here’s how the act works: From 2002 to 2010, the estate tax credit will go up
(from $1 million to $3.5 million), and the tax rate will simultaneously go down
(from 55 percent to 45 percent). In 2010, there will be no estate taxes, per se
(although you could end up paying more taxes, which I discuss later in the
chapter).
Table 16-1 shows a breakdown of the estate tax credit, the gift tax credit, and
the estate tax level on a per year basis. In 2011, the taxes revert to their 2002
levels. If you are a high-worth individual, you can see from the chart that the
act probably doesn’t apply to you.
For instance, if you are passing on a $10 million estate in 2008, then $8 million
will be subject to taxes (after you deduct the $2 million estate tax credit).
That $8 million will be taxed at an astronomical 45 percent tax rate! Your kids
will pay at least $3.6 million in taxes. And if you were to pass away in 2013,
then your kids will pay 55 percent on $9 million!

Part IV: Making Cents of Taxes and Protecting Your Assets 

If you have just inherited an estate that contains simple assets such as 
cash, securities, and so on, that is under the exemption amount (refer to
Table 16-1), then you don’t have to file an estate tax return.
It’s possible that when 2011 rolls around Congress will renew the act. If law-
makers decide to implement some of the changes on a more permanent
basis, it will probably be only random bits and pieces and entail a tax struc-
ture that doesn’t fluctuate from year to year. This is a huge unknown that
makes it very difficult for the elderly and the sick to plan accordingly.
2010: The year of capital gains
Although the 2001 act was a good thing, it’s still a devil in disguise — 
especially when 2010 rolls around. The act wrongly leads folks to believe that
they don’t need an estate plan. Believe it or not, if you pass away in 2010
when it appears that there is no estate tax, your children may pay a lot more
in taxes than you anticipated.
You see, if you inherit property, stocks, or other appreciating assets in 2010,
your offspring may be forced to pay the capital gains tax on all of the appreci-
ation that occurred from the date you first purchased the asset. The IRS
allows a $1.3 million step-up in basis (where you add $1.3 million to the origi-
nal purchase price before calculating the appreciation), but for kids whose
parents were good investors, this still could amount to huge chunk of change.
For instance, say John purchased $1 million in real estate and stocks in 1990.
Having invested wisely, those assets are worth $10 million upon his death in
2010. Because he had cancer and knew that he would be passing away in
2010, he assumed that he wouldn’t need an estate plan because no estate
taxes would be imposed for that year. Unfortunately, he wasn’t aware of the
little provision in the act that states that there is no step-up in basis on the
assets that his children receive. This means his kids have to pay capital gains
tax on the $9 million in appreciation from when he purchased the assets.
What does this amount to? Well, the IRS allows a $1.3 million step-up in basis,
so that means that you would subtract the $2.3 million (instead of just the 
$1 million purchase price) from $10 million. That leaves the kids with 
$7.7 million in capital gains, which are subject to the 15 percent long-term
capital gains rate. This means that as soon as John’s heirs sell the assets,
they will have to pay about $1.15 million to the IRS — ouch! In other years,
there would be what is called a full step-up in basis, and John’s children
wouldn’t have to pay any capital gains taxes when they sell the assets. In
other words, they wouldn’t be penalized for their parent’s savvy business
decisions. LLCs can help you with this, which I explain later in the chapter.
273
Chapter 16: Estate Planning: Avoiding Death Taxes

Skipping a generation can kill your estate
Way back in the day, the wealthiest families in America avoided paying estate
taxes by using a loophole that allowed them to use repetitive life estates to
freely pass assets on to their grandchildren. In 1976, Congress decided to
close this loophole once and for all and created what we now know as the
generation-skipping transfer tax, or GST tax for short.
This means that if you decide to transfer assets directly to your grandchil-
dren, the same taxes will be imposed as if you were to transfer your assets to
your child and then your child passed the assets to her children. In short,
you’ll be taxed twice. And unless you pass away in 2010 when this tax is tem-
porarily suspended, your grandchildren most likely won’t receive much more
than the $1 million to $2 million exclusion amount.
For the most part, the GST tax rate matches the estate tax rate for that year.
So, if you pass away in 2011 — when the estate tax rate is 55 percent — then
your grandchildren will owe approximately $7.2 million in taxes on a 
$10 million estate. Here’s how the math would look:
Total Estate
$10,000,000
Minus Exclusion
-$1,000,000
Total
$9,000,000
55% Estate Tax
-$4,950,000
Total
$4,050,000
55% GST Tax
-$2,227,500
Total
$1,822,500
Plus Exclusion 
+$1,000,000
After-Tax Total
$2,822,500
This is the amount your grandchildren 
will receive.
The GST tax only applies when you pass money to your grandchildren while
their parents (your children) are still alive, thereby skipping a generation. It
also applies if you pass money to someone who is more than 37.5 years
younger than you.
The GST tax applies to gifts also, so if you’re planning on giving pieces of
your estate to your grandchildren or to someone who is significantly younger
than you while you are still alive, then you need to sit down with a qualified
estate planning attorney to discuss your specific needs. The sooner the
better.
274
Part IV: Making Cents of Taxes and Protecting Your Assets 

Deciphering the gift tax
One strategy that I discuss later in the chapter is minimizing your estate tax
burden by gifting assets to your heirs while you’re still alive. Individuals often
use this strategy to avoid estate taxes. Unfortunately, the IRS has caught on
and has imposed a gift tax, which is very similar to the estate tax. Gifting can
still be a good strategy though, because when all is said and done, your heirs
will still pay less to Uncle Sam.
While alive, you can gift up to $12,000 per year to each person, tax free (this
amount is adjusted each year for inflation). If you have a spouse, you and
your spouse can collectively gift $24,000 per year to each person, tax free
(this is known as a joint gift). Anything over that amount will be added up and
taxed upon your death at the current gift tax rates.
Table 16-2 shows the current gifts tax rates (with estate tax rates included)
for each year.

If you gift more than $12,000 in one year to a particular recipient, don’t worry.
As long as your collective overages don’t amount to too much, your estate
won’t be burdened with any gift taxes upon your passing. You see, you get a
$1 million lifetime gift tax exclusion. This means that as long as your overages
don’t amount to more than $1 million, your gifts won’t be taxed.
Unfortunately, if you’re gifting assets and/or cash to your heirs, you still have
to pay income tax on that money. Gifts to heirs aren’t deductible expenses —
unless your heirs are 501(c)3 charities, that is.
275
Chapter 16: Estate Planning: Avoiding Death Taxes

As long as you’re alive, you can gift as much as you want to educational insti-
tutions (such as for your grandchild’s college education) or to pay for med-
ical services. This money doesn’t count toward your $12,000 allowance.
However, the money must go directly to the educational institution or the
medical service provider, not to the person using those services. Keep in
mind though, that if you’re paying for college expenses, the money for room,
board, books, entertainment, and so on doesn’t count — only tuition. The
money you spend on these ancillary items goes toward the $12,000 tax-free
allowance.
As long as your gifts remain under the excluded amounts — $12,000 per year
per recipient and under $1 million in overages — then the gifts won’t be sub-
ject to generation-skipping taxes. This means that you can gift a pretty size-
able amount to your grandchildren — as long as you have some forethought
and act quickly!
How LLCs Help with Estate Planning
Planning your estate is sort of like shooting at a moving target — you can’t
plan for a future that you are unsure of. Nothing is certain in estate taxes, and
you can pretty much bet that Congress will pass another tax act in the
coming years that changes the estate tax structure. Who knows what the tax
rates will be when you pass on!
You need to take control of your estate and not leave everything up to the
fickle whims of the U.S. government. LLCs are the perfect tool for this. With
LLCs, you maintain control of your assets as the ownership passes on to your
heirs, all the while avoiding probate. You can also rest assured that your
estate is protected from the roving eye of creditors and lawyers who want to
take it away.
LLCs avoid probate
One of the greatest benefits of using LLCs in your estate planning is that no
probate process is required. Probate is a lengthy and expensive process
where the court settles your estate for you. The court resolves all creditors’
claims and distributes your assets according to law or according to your will
(if you recorded one). Probate is managed by someone whom you designate
in your will, called an executor.
276
Part IV: Making Cents of Taxes and Protecting Your Assets 

Probate often undermines all of the tax-saving steps that you take (such as
gifting) because the legal fees and court costs can become so astronomical
that the taxes are nominal in comparison. And if someone contests the will or
the executor, the courts can take many years to execute the will, and there
may not be too much of an estate left to divvy up after it’s all over.
When you set up your estate in an LLC, the LLC just transfers to your heirs,
and all is said and done. This way, you can rest assured that your loved ones
won’t be hit with any huge legal fees that eat up your estate before it’s ever
delivered into their hands.
If you are married and live in a community property state (Arizona, California,
Idaho, Louisiana, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin), all of your
assets will be transferred to your spouse upon your death. In this case, no
probate is necessary. If your spouse is no longer alive, then your estate will
enter into probate.
LLCs provide asset protection
The biggest problem with most estate planning techniques is that as you col-
lect assets to pass on to your heirs, the assets aren’t protected from credi-
tors and lawsuits. Without this protection while you’re alive, you are a
walking target. Although most trusts help ease the transfer of your assets
upon your death, they don’t protect your assets from creditors like an LLC
does.
When you work with your attorney on an asset protection plan, he will proba-
bly suggest using a trust. (A trust is a legal situation where someone gives
financial control over certain assets to a person or institution for the benefit
of another person [the beneficiary].) In my opinion, LLCs, when structured
properly, offer the same benefits as trusts when it comes to avoiding probate
and reallocating income, but many attorneys hold other positions. After all,
LLCs are newer entities, and trusts are the standard, age-old way of estate
planning.
When you meet with your attorney to draw up an estate plan, make sure that
your attorney incorporates asset protection strategies into the plan. There is
no use in preventing your assets from being taxed after your death if your
assets get seized by a creditor before your heirs can even get to them. An
LLC, if used by itself, should do the trick because it offers many layers of
asset protection. You can read Chapter 14 for more information on how to
protect your assets using an LLC.
277
Chapter 16: Estate Planning: Avoiding Death Taxes

If you want to use a special trust in your estate planning endeavors, then I
recommend that you use an LLC (or two or three) to hold the assets, thereby
protecting them from creditors. The trust will be the majority owner of the
LLC to help avoid probate and reduce estate taxes. This way, if you get sued
personally, the estate is protected by the charging order.
When you work with your estate planning attorney, he may not look at the sit-
uation from an asset protection perspective. Or, he may look at it only from
an asset protection perspective and ignore the tax implications. Make sure
that you have all of your bases covered and that whoever you work with
looks at both of these important aspects when planning your estate.
LLCs give you control
If you’ve ever delved into asset protection before, you’ve probably heard of
family limited partnerships (or FLPs, for short). FLPs gave some of the part-
ners full managerial control (the general partners), while others had none
whatsoever (the limited partners). In return for having no say in business
matters, the limited partners had limited liability protection, while the gen-
eral partners had no liability protection. The LLC is the next generation of the
limited partnership. Although the LLC offers limited liability for all partners,
it offers even more flexibility in how the entity is controlled.
An LLC can be either member-managed, where all partners share equal con-
trol of the day-to-day affairs, or manager-managed, where one or a few people
(who don’t make up 100 percent of the partners) make managerial decisions.
In estate planning, it is common to use manager-managed LLCs, where the
managing partners are the parents and the non-managing (the “silent”) part-
ners are the kids. This way, as the LLC is transferred to the children, the par-
ents can still manage the assets even if they no longer own the LLC.
Also, with the LLC’s operating agreement, you can set it up so that basically
anything goes. You can have different types (classes) of membership, where
some partners have more voting rights than the others. You can restrict the
transfer of ownership so your kids can’t sell their shares in the family estate.
You can describe in detail how you want the succession to go after you pass
away, and you can name the successor managers. You can even distribute the
profits and losses however you want, meaning they don’t have to be distrib-
uted according to the membership percentages.

Looking At Some Easy 
Planning Strategies
You can plan your estate in so many ways; you can’t possibly discover them
all in a book. It’s really important for you to sit down and work with a quali-
fied attorney. But before you do, you should understand some important con-
cepts that will no doubt be brought up in the meeting.
For larger estates, gifting away your assets while you are alive is a common
strategy. LLCs are especially good for this because only a limited amount of
your assets can be gifted each year (see the “Deciphering the gift tax” section
earlier in the chapter), and when it comes to noncash assets, such as real
estate, it’s much easier to gift shares of the LLC than it is to retitle the prop-
erty each year. Not to mention that LLCs offer a bulletproof layer of asset 
protection.
Because LLCs are such flexible entities, they are perfect for transferring
expensive assets, such as real estate and business interests. Think of these as
the gifts that keep on giving. Say that you have a family business that is set
up as a corporation. Being the smart cookie that you are, you place the stock
(the ownership) of that corporation into a manager-managed LLC. You set it
up so the LLC is managed by a second corporation (that you and your spouse
both own).
Now that the LLC contains an asset, you have to determine the value of the
LLC membership shares. You start by having the asset appraised by a quali-
fied business appraiser. Then, the IRS allows you certain deductions from the
fair market value by making the membership shares less appealing — namely,
by limiting the control of the members. This is where it’s good to have a cor-
poration as the member.
Your entire goal here is to continually reduce the value of your taxable
estates. And no, that doesn’t mean you want the real estate market to tank
and your properties to go down in value! It means you want to slowly “leak”
the assets to your children in such a way that it doesn’t raise any red flags
with Uncle Sam. Currently, the best way to do this is to make sure that you
and your spouse give a maximum combined amount of $24,000 to each recipi-
ent every year.
279
Chapter 16: Estate Planning: Avoiding Death Taxes

So, given the previous example, how is this done? Well, say that the business
that you transferred into your LLC is worth $4 million. Because you restrict
the control of the members, the IRS will allow you to knock 30 percent off of
that valuation. That leaves your total estate valued at $2.8 million. If you have
100,000 shares, that means each share is worth $28. If you have five kids who
will equally own and manage the family business upon your death, then you
and your spouse can transfer 857 shares ($24,000 ÷ $28 = 857) to each of your
children every year, tax free. This means that every year, you can lower the
value of your estate by $120,000 ($24,000 × 5 = $120,000) by slowly gifting it
away under the radar and without having to pay gift tax. Without factoring in
inflation, after approximately 11 years, your estate will be under the $1 mil-
lion exclusion amount, and upon your death, your heirs won’t be required to
pay any estate taxes.
You have to be careful when you transfer noncash assets that have appreci-
ated a lot. When your heirs decide to sell the assets after you pass away, they
will have to pay long-term capital gains tax on the appreciation from the date
you purchased the asset. If you have ever gone through a real estate boom,
you can understand what sort of money I’m talking about here. LLCs have the
unique ability to force a step-up in the tax basis by having certain provisions
in their buy-sell agreements. If you have a lot of heavily appreciated assets,
then you should definitely work with an accountant to assist you in minimiz-
ing your heirs’ capital gains tax burdens.

y now, you’ve probably figured out that I think LLCs are the best entity
structure around. And for good reason! LLCs are flexible — you can use
them for practically any purpose — and they offer more benefits than any
other entity type. They have a favorable pass-through tax status, and with
the dual liability protection that LLCs offer, corporations and limited partner-
ships can’t compare.
What I love the most about LLCs is that they are completely customizable.
You can pretty much draft whatever rules you want in the operating agree-
ment. Most people don’t realize that many state laws can be overwritten by a
simple paragraph. This is incredibly powerful. You can also choose whatever
tax structure you want. LLCs can elect to be taxed like corporations. So much
can be done with LLCs that most people don’t realize their power. They are
stuck in their comfort zone dealing with older entity types that they are more
familiar with. Wake up — LLCs are the future, and they’re a good thing!
Small-Business Owners 
Can Customize an LLC
LLCs are great for small businesses because they are adaptable to all situa-
tions. No matter if you have 100 silent investors or are a two-person small-
business operation, the LLC is so flexible that you can pretty much write the
operating agreement to suit your needs; you can make your own rules, pave
your own path, and tailor your entity to suit the intricacies of your business.
With corporations, you are limited to the stiff corporate formalities and
weighty infrastructure of shareholders, directors, and officers.

If you’re operating as a sole proprietorship (which is how most small busi-
nesses are structured), you would be crazy not to drop this book (after you
have finished reading it, of course!) and form an LLC today. A sole proprietor-
ship is the most dangerous form of doing business. It offers zero protection
against creditors and lawsuits, and therefore, leaves your personal assets on
the table for pretty much anyone to grab. Not to mention that you can’t raise
capital as a sole proprietorship (and you won’t go very far when it comes to
impressing people).
By combining a lot of the advantages of C and S corporations (see Chapter 2)
with their own special attributes, LLCs have become exceptionally attractive
to small-business owners. They offer the same liability protection that corpo-
rations offer, but with an added layer of protection from the charging order
(see Chapter 11). They have the pass-through tax structure (see Chapter 13)
but with zero restrictions. This means that any person or entity can be an
owner. You can also have an unlimited number of members.
Real Estate Moguls Can 
Protect Their Assets
LLCs are awesome for real estate — you just can’t beat ’em! First, LLCs have
dual liability protection that shields your investments from the frivolous law-
suits filed against people like you every day. This means that if someone sues
you personally (say you rear end someone in the parking lot, for instance),
they can’t seize and liquidate your investment properties to settle the claim.
If that’s not reason enough to form an LLC, I don’t know what is! (Chapter 15
has more information about LLCs and real estate holdings.)
Plus, you can easily transfer your property in and out of the entity because
LLCs don’t impose taxes on contributions or withdrawals of the assets. As
long as no money is changing hands, you’re good to go. Of course, make sure
you talk to your accountant about any hidden tax issues or your attorney if
there are any mortgages on the property.
LLCs are so great at holding real estate that I advise each of my clients to
form one LLC per property that they own. This way, each property is isolated
from the others. If one property gets sued, the others are safe from being
seized. With the ease of operation and the limited record-keeping require-
ments, having multiple LLCs isn’t as difficult as you may think.
284
Part V: The Part of Tens 

If you own multiple properties, you can form a series LLC. A series LLC is one
LLC that is composed of multiple cells — each with its own layer of liability
protection. Think of it like this: You put all of your properties into one LLC —
which minimizes the paperwork — then you separate each of your properties
into a different cell in that LLC. This way, while all of the properties are in one
entity, if one property gets sued, the others are still safe from being seized
and liquidated to settle the judgment.
Series LLCs aren’t available in all states because they’re a relatively new
entity. Because they are so new, some old-fashioned accountants and attor-
neys may not want to work with them. If you run into this situation, I recom-
mend finding a professional who has educated herself on series LLCs.
Einstein Types Can Shield 
Their Intellectual Property
I am a firm believer in keeping your intellectual property as far away from
your operating business as possible. Think about it. What is more valuable
than your brand which you have worked so hard to build? Or the patents that
you have centered your business around? Nothing. Therefore, you need to
protect those things with your life. Or with an LLC. Your choice.
Unless you have a bunch of important patents, it is overkill to place all of
your intellectual property in separate LLCs. Your intellectual property
shouldn’t be operating with the public — only your operating company
should be dealing with the public. So how do you link your intellectual prop-
erty in your LLC to your operating company? The LLC that holds your intel-
lectual property should lease the patents, trademarks, or copyrights to the
operating company for its use. You need to sign paperwork and transfer
money to make the arrangement official. After all, if it doesn’t look legit, then
there’s no point in doing it in the first place.
Now, who owns the LLC? Because of the charging order protections, it 
doesn’t really matter too much. But, investors generally like to have the intel-
lectual property of the business be owned by the business; therefore, the
operating company should own the LLC. To be on the safe side, a common
holding company can be the owner of both the operating company and the
LLC with the intellectual property. The investors invest in the holding com-
pany and voila! They are happy, and the property is safe from lawsuits and
angry creditors.
285
Chapter 17: Ten Good Reasons to Form an LLC

Only LLCs should be used for holding intellectual property — not corpora-
tions. You see, if the LLC is owned by the operating business, and the business
is sued, then the corporation that owns the intellectual property will be con-
sidered an asset of the business and subject to liquidation. Corporations don’t
have the same charging order protections that LLCs have (see Chapter 11 
for more on charging orders). Therefore, if the intellectual property is in a
corporation and the owner (in this case, the business) gets sued, then the
intellectual property is toast.
You Want to Ask Donald Trump 
to Invest in Your Company
LLCs are quickly becoming the entity of choice for raising capital. First of all,
investors love the pass-through tax status. Why? If your little upstart doesn’t
turn a profit, they can use the losses to offset other income they may have.
That is huge to an investor. If the business fails, they may not get their invest-
ment back, but they’ll still get a nice little deduction.
Yes, S corporations offer the same type of pass-through tax status as LLCs do;
however, S corporations are an inferior choice because they restrict who can
and can’t be an investor. Why limit yourself like that? LLCs can have as many
investors as you choose — even hundreds of thousands! — and anyone can
invest. One investor can be a small business in Wichita, while your other can
be a newly formed hedge fund based out of London.
One of the LLC’s features is that the membership shares can’t be transferred
freely. Your investors can’t go around selling or transferring your shares to
random people. If they do transfer them, the new owner has no voting rights
until the rest of the members take a vote and grant them to him. Although this
can work in your favor — you don’t end up with some crazy, not-so-silent silent
partners — it can also be a drawback for potential investors. You can handle
this by clearly explaining your membership transfer policies in the marketing
materials for your investment. If some people are turned off by it, so what. I
guarantee you that more people will appreciate the pass-through taxation than
they will dislike the restrictions on the transference of membership.
With an LLC, you can have different classes of membership. For instance, you
can give members with Class A membership full voting rights, whereas mem-
bers with Class B membership have absolutely no voting rights. Or, you can
allow one class of membership shares to be transferable, whereas the other
class of membership shares can’t be transferred without the approval of all
members.
286
Part V: The Part of Tens 

You’re Planning Your Estate
You shouldn’t overlook the value of LLCs when you plan your estate. While a
simple entity, in comparison with some of the uber-complex trusts that your
attorney may recommend, LLCs are powerful in the way of asset protection.
They not only protect you from creditors, but also from probate lawyers and
court costs. LLCs allow you to avoid probate altogether, which means that
your estate isn’t subject to the nickel-and-diming (I wish they were just nick-
els and dimes!) that the probate attorneys will deduct from your estate as the
courts divvy up your assets.
With LLCs, you can structure the management however you like. This is
useful if you are minimizing your estate (to reduce or eliminate estate taxes)
while you’re alive by gifting a little bit of your assets to your heirs each year.
An LLC is especially convenient for gifting property — you can just gift some
membership interests. It beats having to re-title the property each year! In
the meantime, you can be the LLC’s sole manager as the membership inter-
ests are transferred. This way, you control the property, but the kids get to
own it. Upon your death, you can assign the kids as managers, or you can
name someone else a temporary manager until your children reach a certain
age. (Flip to Chapter 16 for more details.)
LLCs are commonly used with different types of trusts. Don’t get me wrong —
trusts are great and definitely have their place in most estate plans. However,
don’t make the mistake of only looking at your estate from a tax-saving per-
spective. Trusts don’t offer anything in the way of liability protection, and 
if you don’t use an LLC to cover your assets, then you may not have anything
to leave your heirs. Those assets may go to the dogs (errr . . . I mean, 
creditors)!
A Short-Term Project Is in the Works
LLCs were made for short-term projects. When these entities were first intro-
duced, they were never supposed to live forever like corporations do. That’s
why when you create your articles of incorporation, you state a specific dis-
solution date or term. The term is the number of years that the LLC is to be in
existence. Although most states allow you to extend the LLC beyond this
term with a simple vote of the members, this scheduled termination of the
company is convenient for short-term projects, such as real estate develop-
ment and film financing.
287
Chapter 17: Ten Good Reasons to Form an LLC

With their pass-through taxation for investors, LLCs are especially great for
those flash-in-the-pan projects that you have to raise money for. Normally
how it works is the investors come together, pool their money, do the pro-
ject, and make the profit; and then they dissolve the company. Upon dissolu-
tion, all assets are liquidated, the creditors are paid off, and the remaining
profit gets split among the members according to their ownership percent-
ages. All profits flow through to the investors’ personal tax returns, so they
don’t have to worry about double taxation. (Chapter 12 covers the dissolu-
tion process in more detail.)
When you are doing a short-term project, all members must be on the same
page from the get-go. When bringing on members, make sure that you give
plenty of information about the project and be sure to specify that the LLC
will be liquidated and dissolved, and tell them when this is expected to take
place. Remember that you will need a vote of the members to dissolve on a
date other than the dissolution date specified in the articles of organization.
If all members aren’t in agreement, you’ll have trouble moving forward with
your plans.
You Need to Segregate Assets
Segregating assets is vital in business because segregation puts your assets
out of reach of your company’s creditors or someone who wants to sue you.
A lot of people incorrectly think that if they’re operating as a corporation or
LLC, then their assets are safe, but that’s not necessarily true. If you’re like
most entrepreneurs, your business is your biggest asset. If you lose the abil-
ity to operate, you’re doomed. Your business may be protected from your
personal creditors, and you may be protected from your business’s creditors;
however, what protects your business from its own creditors? If your LLC
gets sued, everything inside of it can be seized and liquidated. Even worse,
the courts can put a lien on your company and then do an asset freeze. This
means that you have zero access to the cash — you can’t write checks or
invoice clients. Tell me — how stable will your business be after three
months or more of an asset freeze?
The best way to fully protect against this is to make sure that there are no
assets in the operating company. Instead, the company uses leased assets.
Now, this doesn’t mean that you have to start looking for furniture- and
equipment-leasing companies — the assets are leased from their respective
LLCs. You see, each asset is put into a different LLC. The LLC then leases
these assets back to the operating company. When the operating company is
sued, it has no assets with which to settle the claim. So, in the worst case,
you dissolve the operating company and form a new one. You once again set
up the lease agreements with the various LLCs, and you’re back in business!
288
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Entrepreneurs Can Minimize 
Their Tax Burden
When you first go into business, chances are your company won’t be prof-
itable right away. It takes time for businesses to build up, and in the first year
or two, you probably will incur thousands of dollars in losses. A lot of entre-
preneurs, eager to soften the financial blow of the startup phase, decide to
form an LLC. With an LLC, the losses of the business flow through to the
members so they can use them as deductions for other income.
Say, for instance, your business incurs $40,000 in losses in the first year of
operation. If you and your partner each own 50 percent of the company, then
you each get a $20,000 business deduction on your personal tax returns. That
could save each of you as much as $6,000 in federal income taxes alone!
Don’t try to implement these strategies yourself. When it comes to tax law,
don’t try to figure it out as you go. Speak with a qualified attorney or a corpo-
rate consultant.
Members Can Change the 
Profit Distributions
An LLC’s profits can be paid out disproportionately to the actual ownership
percentages. So you and your partners can set up the company so that you
receive all of the profits and losses — even if you only own 10 percent of the
company. Why would you want to do that? Well, a common reason for chang-
ing the distribution is to provide an extra incentive for investors. For
instance, if an investor invests all of the capital, he will get 50 percent of the
company. However, the profit distributions will be varied so that he receives
100 percent of the profits until his investment has been paid back (plus 10
percent in some cases). Then the profit distributions will return to normal,
and the profit will be split equitably among members.
The only contingency that the IRS places on altering the distributions is that
it delivers substantial economic effect. This is just a fancy way of saying that
you gotta have a decent reason for changing up the distributions. For
instance, in the above example, you have proven substantial economic effect;
that is, you aren’t just varying the distributions to avoid taxes.
289
Chapter 17: Ten Good Reasons to Form an LLC

If you want to vary your profit distributions, you should work with your
accountant, who knows all of the IRS rules surrounding this. I don’t recom-
mend doing this on your own, because you could get yourself into some seri-
ous tax trouble if you don’t do all of the due diligence that the IRS requires.
You Need to Protect Your Personal Assets
Although I don’t recommend putting your home into an LLC (you’ll lose all of
the great tax breaks that you get as an individual), I do recommend putting all
of your other personal assets into one. When you spend your entire life
saving for retirement, your children’s education, or even that second home
you’ve long dreamed about, nothing can be more crippling than losing it all in
a lawsuit.
Almost 50 years ago, an incredibly smart man by the name of Rockefeller
gave the world a sound piece of advice: “Own nothing but control every-
thing.” You don’t have to be a billionaire to walk in his footsteps. If you’re like
most people, you currently hold all of your personal assets in your own
name. Your savings account is in your name; your cars are in your name;
your mutual funds, stocks, and bonds are probably in your name. This means
that the reverse of Rockefeller’s advice is true — you own everything, yet
control nothing. It can all be taken away from you.
If you really want to follow in the footsteps of giants, I would start with form-
ing an LLC. Better yet, form a series LLC. Then, contribute all of your per-
sonal assets to the LLC and make sure that they are all isolated from each
other. That way, if a creditor arises with one of your assets — for instance,
you get a margin call that you can’t quite pay for — then all of your other
assets are safe. LLCs are cheap — I form them for clients every day for under
$200. You don’t have to be a millionaire to take advantage of strategies of the
rich. After all, whatever your net worth is at the moment, you worked hard
for it and deserve to keep it safe.

Ten Ways to Keep Your 
Limited Liability Intact
In This Chapter
 Filing all the proper paperwork
 Watching where the money goes (and comes from)
 Making sure you have the right people in your corner
N
ow, really — what is the point of a limited liability company without the
“limited liability” part? Without limited liability, it’s just a company
really — no special protections, no special tax treatment, no ability to issue
shares of ownership. If you don’t do the simple things necessary to keep your
limited liability intact, you might as well not even file your LLC. Instead, you
can save yourself the filing fee and kiss all your hard-earned personal assets
goodbye.
Before you even think about taking extra steps to protect your limited liability,
you gotta do one thing for me: Be on your best behavior. No, I don’t mean keep-
ing your elbows off of the dinner table and saying “please” and “thank you.” I
mean don’t lie, cheat, and steal in the name of your LLC. Wrongful misconduct
on the part of a member is the easiest way for your LLC’s veil of limited liability
to be pierced. Don’t think that your company will protect you from purposeful
fraud that you initiated. So, be good! Now, with that said, I can go on.
Filing the LLC Properly
The first step to obtaining liability protection is filing the LLC. I know this
may sound sort of elementary, and trust me — I don’t want to insult your
intelligence. But plenty of extremely intelligent and accomplished individuals
have failed at this first step and ended up being taken to the cleaners. Often,
entrepreneurs get too busy and distracted — after all they’re running a busi-
ness! They start their LLC paperwork and then leave it to sit on their desk,
collecting dust, until they find the time to get around to filing it.

If this description makes you think I’ve been spying on you (I haven’t), you
should hire an incorporating company to file the documents for you. You
don’t even have to sign anything (except maybe the check to pay the 
company!). Your incorporating company can list itself as the organizer — a
temporary position that only lasts until the company is filed. The fee is 
normally small, and it can get this task off your plate.
Regardless of the situation, just file the paperwork. Use the forms I provide
on the accompanying CD and the provisions I include in Chapter 6, do some
research at your Secretary of State’s office or Web site, fill the forms out, and
then drop them in the mailbox. You’ll still have to take care of other filings,
but at least the company is filed — your first step to protecting your assets.
Often, situations will come up when you don’t have any time for preparation
and want to file quickly. Keep in mind that when you rush to file, you run the
risk of getting your articles of organization rejected because you didn’t do
the requisite research and preparation. Also, you need to attach to your arti-
cles certain provisions, such as the limited liability provision and the charg-
ing order provision that are never included on the state’s generic articles of
organization.
Finding a Partner
One of the easiest ways to have your LLC disregarded and thrown out by the
courts is to have a single-member LLC. LLCs were created to be partnerships,
which means they are meant to have partners. So little separates a single-
member LLC from a sole proprietorship (which is just one person operating a
business without any liability protection) that many states don’t even allow
them.
If you live in a state that does allow single-member LLCs, don’t blur the line
between what is allowed and what is advised. You may be able to form and
operate a single-member LLC without a problem; however, when a business
lawsuit comes up, the courts often won’t even recognize your LLC as being a
real entity with real liability protections. This means that all of your personal
assets are at risk of being taken away. In fact, the IRS already requires single-
member LLCs to file as “disregarded entities.”
If you plan to go it alone and are totally intent on having a single-member
LLC, then you must follow all the tips in this section — especially the ones
about having meeting minutes and a good, solid operating agreement. I also
recommend that you elect corporate tax treatment. Treat your LLC as a cor-
poration — you may have to jump through more hoops, but the peace of
mind will be worth it.
292
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Keep in mind that if you are operating as a single-member LLC, you will get
no charging order protections (see Chapter 11). Charging orders protect the
other partners in the business from a personal lawsuit filed against another
member, and judges have decided that if there are no partners to protect,
then a charging order can’t be issued. Although this isn’t completely set in
stone, case law sets a powerful precedent, and you must know this before
going in.
If you aren’t dead set on having a single-member LLC and are willing to fight
for your liability protection, then I recommend that you do one of two things:
 Find a friend or family member (not a spouse, for IRS purposes) whom
you can trust, and issue them a small membership percentage. Make
sure that you have a contract or your operating agreement states that
they can’t sell or transfer the shares without your approval. Because
they aren’t contributing anything to the business, you can also state in
your operating agreement that they get a very small percentage of the
distributions or none at all.
 Form a corporation that you can control — preferably in a tax-free 
state — and make the corporation your second partner in the business.
Remember — LLCs can have anyone as a member, and they don’t even
need to live in the same country.
If you want to completely protect your LLC, you should have more than ten
members. Historically, any organization that has more than ten members has
never been pierced (or “disregarded”). If you have more than ten members,
you should be in the clear, no matter what.
Creating an Operating Agreement
If you have read any part of this book, I’m sure that you have a pretty good
idea of how absolutely necessary I feel an operating agreement is to have.
Your operating agreement is the backbone of your company. It creates the
infrastructure and acts as an operations manual that you and your partners
will fall back on time and time again to sort out the gray areas and disputes
that occur during the normal course of business.
The operating agreement should be tailored to your own company, but if you
can’t do this, keep in mind that something is better than nothing. Even just
filling out the operating agreement on the accompanying CD is better than
walking into court empty-handed. Just make sure that the template you use is
tailored to the type of management that you have. If your LLC is member-
managed, then you can’t want to use the agreement on the CD because it’s for
manager-managed LLCs.
293
Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Keep Your Limited Liability Intact

However, you really should take the time to create your own operating agree-
ment. It will be a good experience for you to build your business from the
ground up and decide how you want your enterprise to be structured. LLCs
are very flexible entities — you can tailor your LLC to whatever your needs
are. Whether you are raising capital, building a business, or flipping a real
estate property, you’ll want different people in your organization to have dif-
ferent authority, and you’ll want to create a system for keeping everyone on
the same page. You can create a customized agreement in less than a day —
see Chapter 9 for instructions on how to put it together.
Capitalizing the Company
The term capitalizing the company means investing money into your busi-
ness. A business without even a little bit of money is not really a business at
all. Although I don’t like to trot out the old adage that it takes money to make
money, it’s often true that you need to invest some capital to get your busi-
ness going. I’m not the only one who thinks this — the courts agree.
The easiest way for the court to determine whether your company is a sepa-
rate operating business or an alter ego (a company put into place to protect
its owners) is to see whether you’ve invested in the business. After all, most
small businesses aren’t profitable when they’re starting out, so the courts
can’t base their decision on profitability. They must go on capitalization.
What if you’re starting small and didn’t invest any money into your LLC? In
this case, if you can show substantial cash flow and prove that your business
is operational and deals regularly with the public, then you have a good
chance of being in the clear. Make sure that you have a reason for your
shares being issued to you, though — whether for services rendered, assets
given, or money invested. You must put this in your meeting minutes.
Filing Your Annual Reports
You must file your annual reports on time each year. If you fail to file your
reports, you will go out of good standing with the Secretary of State. If you
remain out of good standing for a certain amount of time (usually a year),
then your LLC will automatically be revoked, and you’ll have no limited liabil-
ity protections at all. Not good!
294
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Often, the filings are one page and require minimal information such as the
names and addresses of the LLC’s members and/or managers, the name and
address of the LLC’s registered agent, and the corporate office address
(Chapter 8 has more details about annual reports). You file your annual
report with the same state office that you filed your articles of organization
with — in most states, this is the Secretary of State. See Appendix A for the
address and phone number of your state’s office that handles LLC filings.
Holding Member Meetings Regularly
Although annual meetings are only required for corporations and not LLCs,
you must hold them anyway. If a creditor of your LLC wants to attach your
personal assets to a lawsuit, he will attempt to prove one of two things
 Your LLC is an “alter ego.”
 Your LLC appears to be a sole proprietorship or general partnership and
should be treated as one.
The best defense against this is to choose to go through the same formalities
that corporations are required to go through. I know what you’re thinking.
You’re a busy entrepreneur! How on earth can you find the time to draft meet-
ing minutes and issue financial reports? Rest assured, though, that it won’t
take as much time as you think. Not only does all this documentation help
designate the LLC as a separate entity (so as to disprove it’s an “alter ego”),
but it helps prevent your LLC from being classified as a sole proprietorship
or general partnership, which have no meeting minutes at all.
You must have annual meetings, but you also must hold a meeting whenever
a major action affecting the company is to take place. Whenever you have
meetings, you must keep a record of everything that takes place in the 
meeting — these are called the meeting minutes and resolutions. Meeting min-
utes show that important business decisions were made after a successful
vote of the members — these decisions are called resolutions. They prove
that an action of the company wasn’t done by some rogue member deciding
things himself (in which case, there is a good chance he would be personally
liable), but instead by the company as a whole, with all in agreement as to
the course of action.
295
Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Keep Your Limited Liability Intact

The IRS also will look to your meeting minutes to show that certain loans and
financial transactions were approved. In other words, if you issue yourself a
loan from the company, the IRS may not allow it if they don’t see it properly
documented in the company’s minutes or some other form of agreement.
Minutes are also good to have when requesting a ruling from the IRS, such as
a 1031 exchange (for all of you real estate investors out there!), or defending
a position to the IRS or Department of Revenue during an audit of the com-
pany or an LLC member. The minutes must also authorize any major salaries
and pension contributions, contractual relationships, and the election of
managers.
In addition to all of these things, minutes also can be used to explain any mis-
takes or company oversights that may have occurred. You can state what
actions the company has taken to remedy the situation. Minutes are also
good for justifying why the company took a certain questionable action. A
good example of this is changing the income distributions to be dispropor-
tionate to the ownership percentages. (For more information about meetings,
minutes, and resolutions, see Chapter 11.)
Obtaining Your Licenses and Permits
Before opening your doors and taking orders from customers, you need to
make sure that you are squared away in the eyes of the law. Many state gov-
ernments require businesses to have licenses and permits in an effort to con-
trol various industries and obtain tax revenue. Most companies only need to
file a state and city (or county) business license. However, if you’re in a heav-
ily regulated industry, such as gambling, alcohol, or land development, you
need to inquire as to which licenses and permits you must obtain. (Chapter 8
covers licenses and permits in more detail.)
When you aren’t in good standing with the state and its departments, you
won’t be held in high favor with the judge when he is determining whether to
disqualify your LLC. If you find the ordeal of determining which business
licenses you must file a bit overwhelming, contact your registered agent —
she can either file the business licenses for you or point you in the right
direction.
While you are applying for your state licenses and permits, don’t forget the
ever important federal employer identification number (also called an EIN or a
tax ID number). Think of it as a Social Security number for your LLC. Until
you obtain an EIN, you can’t do much business without it. It is incredibly easy
to apply for a number online at the IRS’s Web site (www.irs.gov). The direct
link is https://sa1.www4.irs.gov/sa_vign/newFormSS4.do.

Avoiding Commingling Funds and Assets
If you’re treating your company account as your personal piggy bank, stop.
When you treat your business’s money as your own, it’s called commingling of
funds. Not only do you run the risk of being heavily penalized by the IRS, but
you also run the risk of jeopardizing your LLC’s liability protections.
This goes back to that “alter ego” thing again. If the courts decide you’re
treating your money and the company’s money as one in the same, they
could easily disregard your entity as being separate from you — hence the
term “alter ego.” Freud, anyone? No? Okay, moving on . . .
Here are a few examples of commingling:
 You use the funds from your business for obvious personal expenses
without documentation. For example, unless you’re a model or news-
caster, getting your teeth bleached is not a business expense. Good try
though!
 Your personal bank account and your business bank account are one
and the same.
 You endorse checks to yourself that are made payable to your business.
 You often move money between your business and personal accounts
without keeping proper records.
The best way to stay on the safe side and avoid mixing your personal and
business funds is by taking the following advice:
 Make sure your LLC has its own bank account.
 Do not use the business money to pay for personal items. (If you
absolutely must, then carefully document it on the company’s books.)
 Do not pay yourself indiscriminately. The money you receive from the
company should be in the form of a loan, salary, or distributions.
Signing Your Documents Properly
In the course of business, you’ll have to sign stuff. Lots of stuff. When you are
doing business under your company name, you must sign as a representative
of the company. What this means is that under your signature, you must
include your title and the company name, or you must write “on behalf of”
and your company name. Also, always use “LLC” or “Limited Liability
Company” after your company name.
297
Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Keep Your Limited Liability Intact

Your signature should look something like this:
By: Your signature
Name: Your name
Title: Manager (or Member)
Your LLC Name, LLC
The Wurzburg Bros. Inc v. James Coleman case shows how important it is 
for you to sign documents correctly. In this case, James Coleman was the
president of Coleman American Moving Services, Inc. When the company 
was behind on its payments to Wurzburg Bros. Inc., one of its vendors, 
Mr. Coleman decided to send over a promissory note to ease the tensions.
When Mr. Coleman signed the promissory note, he failed to put his title and
the company name under his signature. Wurzburg Bros. successfully sued
James Coleman, the person, and succeeded in taking his personal assets to
cover the judgment.
Giving Up Some Control
To avoid having the courts determine that your company is an “alter ego,”
you need to limit your control somewhat. If you have 100 percent control
over all of the company’s decisions and finances, and your company does
something wrong, the courts could easily hold you personally liable. This is
one of the most common ways to lose your liability. It happens most often in
civil cases; however, the IRS has been known to force members to pay for
their company’s debts on this basis.
If you’re a very small company, you often won’t have too many people making
decisions on a day-to-day basis. It is common that small companies are con-
trolled by a small handful of people. In this case, just make sure that you
don’t have any nonfunctioning managers — that is, anyone who can be
viewed as your puppet — and that you observe all formalities.

Chapter 19
Ten Things to Absolutely 
Avoid Doing with an LLC
In This Chapter
 Keeping your hands clean and steering clear of trouble
 Dotting your i’s and crossing your t’s
 Staying out of the courtroom
L
LCs are pretty powerful entities that you can do some pretty amazing
things with. But you know how the old saying goes: “With great power
comes great responsibility.” In other words, if you don’t watch out, you can
get yourself into trouble.
Business doesn’t have to be time consuming or difficult to navigate. Although
you may encounter pitfalls along the way, with some prudent record keeping,
good intentions, and an eye for details, you’ll be fine. Just make sure that,
above all, you love what you do. If you don’t love what you do, none of it is
worth the hassle.
Fraudulent Conveyance of Assets
If you picked up this book because you just got sued and want to protect
your assets, I’m sorry to say that it’s too late. If you were to transfer your
assets into an LLC, you would be fraudulently conveying them. According to
the law, you are fraudulently conveying assets when you do one of two
things:
 Sell or transfer the assets at less than fair-market value, which results in
a creditor being defrauded
 Transfer the assets so a creditor can’t seize them to recoup his claim

Fraudulent conveyance is a civil offense and can cost you a lot more money
in the long run than if you were to just hand over your possessions. If you
formed an LLC with the intent to defraud a creditor (as opposed to forming
an LLC not knowing that your assets were immediately at risk), you’re even
worse off. Not only will the creditor still be able to get your assets, in some
states, you may be subject to penalties and even imprisonment. Futhermore,
federal laws say knowingly committing fraudulent conveyance can be a crimi-
nal offense.
You can even unknowingly fraudulently convey assets. This can happen when
you’re setting up your asset protection strategy and transferring your assets
into an LLC or two, and little to your knowledge, a lawsuit is already pending
against you. Even though you don’t know about the pending lawsuit, the
assets still have been fraudulently conveyed. You probably won’t get criminal
charges in this instance, but you still may be required to turn over the assets
that you thought were protected.
Evading Taxes
Although it’s prudent for you to take every action within the law to reduce
your tax burden, actually evading taxes is a huge no-no. Tax evasion is when
you dodge paying taxes by illegal means. Tax avoidance, on the other hand, is
perfectly acceptable and legal. This just means that you legally reduce the
amount of tax that you owe. For instance, putting your retirement savings in
a Roth IRA, which allows you to defer taxes, is considered tax avoidance. It’s
a perfectly legal way to reduce your tax burden. All the strategies that I out-
line in this book legally allow you to avoid taxes.
To determine whether you are avoiding taxes or evading them, remember
this: Tax avoidance occurs when you avoid the creation of tax liability in the
first place. However, you’re guilty of tax evasion when you have done some-
thing to owe taxes and you don’t pay them. Then you’ll probably end up 
in jail.
The scariest thing about tax evasion is that it’s a criminal offense — a 
felony — which has no regard for how much tax you even evaded. Evading
$500 in taxes is the same as evading $5 million in taxes in the eyes of the law
(although, I hope the judge will be more lenient in the former case).

Choosing a Bad Partner
Partnerships are like marriages — you should jump into them with your eyes
open. Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce, and the numbers are much
worse for business partnerships. This shouldn’t be a deterrent — after all,
when you have a partner whom you work well with, your efforts are com-
pounded tenfold. You just need to make sure that
 You know the person whom you’re going into business with.
 You have policies and procedures to go by when disagreements come 
up — and they will come up, I promise you.
When you’re first getting into business, you’ll sit down with your partner and
agree on where you both want the company to go and what you want your
ownership percentage and different roles to be in the company. The prob-
lems usually occur many years after inception, when your or your partner’s
life goes in different directions. For instance, you may want to expand into a
new market, but your partner is happy with the income he has and just wants
to let the business coast along. Or your partner needs cash and wants to sell
out, but you don’t have the money to buy out his share at the moment. In
these moments, you need to have a plan to follow.
You need to have a partnership agreement, which can be a part of your oper-
ating agreement. You must take the time to sit down with your partner and
plan your partnership all the way to the end. In Chapter 4, I offer tips on
selecting your members.
Ignoring the Bureaucratic Paperwork
I know, I know. State filings, tax returns, permits, and so on — they’re all time
consuming, bureaucratic, and you hate doing them. Trust me, you’re not
alone. But unfortunately, it’s imperative that you don’t drop the ball and that
you stay on top of these things.
This especially goes for state filings. Here’s the thing: Your LLC is registered
under the laws of the state, and that which giveth can taketh away. Yep, that’s
right. If you don’t keep up with your filings, the state will revoke your LLC,
and you’ll (often unknowingly) be operating as if you were a sole proprietor-
ship. You’ll have zero liability protections if you get taken to court.
301
Chapter 19: Ten Things to Absolutely Avoid Doing with an LLC

Trademark Infringement
Infringing on another company’s trademark is one of the easiest pitfalls in
business and can end up costing you a fortune. I urge you to be cautious
about trademark infringement because not only can you fall into this trap
without any knowledge of it, but a lot of Fortune 500 companies hold hun-
dreds of trademarks each. They have attorneys and paralegals who spend
their days scouring the Internet and local communities for small businesses
that may be infringing on a trademark they own. The company is then nice
enough to send a cease-and-desist letter.
When you receive one of these letters, you have two options.
 If you’re an upstart and don’t have a lot of money wrapped up in the
name that the company is disputing, stop using the name and choose
another one.
 If you have spent a lot of time and money marketing the name and feel
as though you have the right to use it and that it doesn’t confuse con-
sumers in any way, then I would spring for a good trademark attorney.
Your trademark attorney can point you in the right direction. Just keep
in mind that if you end up going to court, you’ll be shelling out lots of
dough, especially if your opponent has much deeper pockets.
If you don’t have a trademark attorney, you can find one at www.
lawyerdex.com. (Also, see Chapter 3 for information on how to find a
great attorney).
Not Creating an Operating Agreement
Even though operating agreements aren’t legally required, you’d be absolutely
crazy not to have one! LLCs can make up a lot of their own rules — you just
have to put them in the operating agreement. If no operating agreement exists,
then the state laws automatically apply by default. Letting your state govern-
ment tell you how to run and structure your business isn’t a smart practice.
You not only miss out on one of the LLC’s most major benefits — flexibility —
but you also aren’t in control of your business.
Now, please take my advice and create a real operating agreement that is
unique to your company. I go into very specific details on how to do this in
Chapter 9. All you have to do is copy the provisions that you want into your
own document, and voilà! You have a customized, detailed operating agree-
ment that will serve your business for years to come.
302
Part V: The Part of Tens 

After you have your operating agreement, use it! You should read it over on
occasion so you know your company’s policies when it comes to certain
issues. If you decide to change your policies, that’s fine. Just make sure that
you have a meeting with the other members and vote in the changes. Meeting
procedures can be found in none other than your LLC’s operating agreement.
Not Documenting Company Activities
LLC law is pretty lenient when it comes to keeping records, but don’t let it
fool you. Documenting your company activities is still incredibly important.
At some point in time, your business decisions will be questioned, and you’ll
be relieved when you have your company minutes there to defend your rea-
soning. Not only this, but your company records prove that you do things by
the book. So, if an angry member sues because he didn’t get his way at the
last meeting of members, you can show that the proper vote was taken and
that correct formalities were practiced.
Here are a few good reasons to keep your company records in order:
 When applying for loans or creating other banking relationships, your
record-keeping practices allude to your reliability as a business owner.
 The most common lawsuits among partners in an LLC happen when one
or more members disagrees with a course of action that another
member has taken. By properly documenting your actions, you can
prove that you went through the proper channels and made and acted
upon decisions according to your powers as described in the operating
agreement.
 Should you ever wish to sell your company, take it public, or enter into a
joint venture, you need to have all of your previous company actions
properly recorded.
 If you’re ever audited, the IRS will look at your corporate records to see
your intentions behind various transactions.
Treating Your LLC like a 
Personal Piggy-Bank
This is really simple and really important: Only use your company’s money for
company-related expenses. I know this sounds elementary, but it’s a common
mistake and can cost you a lot in the long run — not only in penalties to the
303
Chapter 19: Ten Things to Absolutely Avoid Doing with an LLC

IRS, but it could also cost you your liability protection. I know that it’s often
tempting to write checks or use a debit card from whichever account has the
most money in it — but don’t do it. Personal expenses that you’ll especially
want to avoid are things such as your mortgage or groceries. Restaurant bills
are okay, as long as the dining experience was business-related.
If you really need to pay for a personal item out of your company bank
account, then do it. Just make sure that this doesn’t occur very often and
that you properly document the transaction and classify it as a loan or officer
income. If the transaction was a large one, then you’ll also want to document
it in the company minutes.
Neglecting to Foreign File
Transacting interstate business has gotten easier as the world has gotten
smaller. To make matters worse, each state has a different idea of what
“transacting business” actually means. Regardless, you’re still required to
register to transact business (foreign file) in every state that you operate in.
In Chapter 5, I show you how to go through the foreign-filing process in detail.
Here are some questions to ask yourself to help you determine whether
you’re transacting business in a certain state:
 Does your LLC have a physical location in the state, such as a corporate
office or manufacturing facilities?
 Do you accept orders in, or originating from, the state?
 Do you have employees (not independent contractors) in the state?
 Do you have a bank account in the state?
Refusing to Delegate
Some people trust no one to help them and do everything themselves. This is
because, in their mind, no one can handle the job as well as they can. I call
this the disease of the self-employed, and it can weaken you substantially.
Why? Because you can only do so much, and until you start to delegate, your
organization will never grow — not to mention that you’ll most likely get
burned out before you know it.
304
Part V: The Part of Tens 

You have to delegate some things in business, or else you can get into some
pretty big trouble. For instance, tax laws are incredibly complex, and unless
you studied to be an accountant, there’s a good chance that if you handle
your own taxes, what you don’t know will destroy you, especially if your busi-
ness is on the larger side, has employees, and is somewhat complex.
The same goes for attorneys. Don’t try to represent yourself in court. I
haven’t heard of one self-represented case that actually won. Lawyers,
although they can be expensive, are incredibly necessary to a small business.
Don’t operate on assumptions — seek the knowledge of a competent lawyer
when legal matters come up.
When handling your corporate filings, especially if you are registered in mul-
tiple states, have your registered agent assist you. Not only is a registered
agent required by law, but he also has more knowledge and resources in cor-
porate matters than you do. Use a registered agent who is part of a compe-
tent incorporating company. That way, you can save legal fees when seeking
information about simple, non-complex corporate matters or getting answers
about your filings.
Don’t be a jack of all trades. Master one thing, and then delegate the rest. For
instance, if you aren’t so hot at sales, don’t worry! Hire a great sales manager
and empower her to take the reins and build a phenomenal sales floor. Even if
you are decent at something, find someone who is better than you and
recruit him. When you find these people, take a leap of faith and don’t under-
mine them. After all, your business is only as good as the people in it.

Appendix B
On the CD-ROM
T
he CD-ROM accompanying this book contains a sample Operating
Agreement document, in Microsoft Word form, that you can fill in and
print out for your own use (see Chapter 9). It also contains current applicable
IRS forms, and also state documents, on a state-specific basis, to help you
with your LLC. 
All state-specific documents are in Adobe Acrobat PDF (Portable Document
Format) form, so you need to install Adobe Acrobat Reader on your com-
puter to use them. A copy of Adobe Acrobat Reader is included on the
CD-ROM. You can also download the most recent version of Adobe Reader
from the following Web site, free of charge: www.adobe.com/products/
acrobat/readstep2.html
Because the documents are in PDF format, you can’t change them, but you
can print them when you’re ready to fill out the forms you need. Included are
the articles, amendments, dissolutions, Change of Agent forms, and Name
Reservation documents for each state in the USA.
On the CD-ROM, the state documents are arranged in file folders named for
each state. The table in this appendix summarizes all the documents
included on the CD. The X’s indicate documents required for that state; N/A
indicates where a particular document isn’t necessary. Some states now have
online systems and resources in place of printable documents, so in those
cases I’ve supplied you with a Web address where you can find more informa-
tion. If you have further questions about a specific state’s processes or
requirements, please refer to Appendix A.
