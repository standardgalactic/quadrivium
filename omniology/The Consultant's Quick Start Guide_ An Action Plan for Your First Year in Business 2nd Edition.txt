“The best ‘cliff notes’ available for those new to consulting and an 
excellent refresher reference for the experienced.”
Pamela J. Schmidt
Executive Director, ISA
“The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide” begins and ends with the best 
questions available, and includes nine chapters in between of down-
to-earth, easy-to-use information, advice, and guides to starting a 
successful consulting practice. By considering the chapter one ques-
tions of “assessing your consulting aptitude,” you will have a clear idea 
of whether the profession is for you. And, if you answer affirmatively 
and start your own business, chapter eleven “brings it all together” 
by reviewing your first-year success in terms of personal, family, fun, 
and financial results. This is the one book that any new or aspiring 
consultant needs to quick start success.”
Barbara Pate Glacel, Ph.D.
Author, Light Bulbs for Leaders
Principal, Glacel Developing Group
“This book is a must-have guide for consultants and provides powerful 
resources to help you ‘practice what you preach’ regarding the value 
of planful approaches to prosperity.”
Debra A. Dinnocenzo
President, ALLearnatives
Author, 101 Tips for Telecommuters
“Elaine Biech is right on the mark with her latest release: The Consul-
tant’s Quick Start Guide. With bookshelves full of numerous ‘how-to’ 
titles it is refreshing to find one that really is loaded with practical, 
easy-to-use information based upon Elaine’s admirable consult-
ing experience. If you are thinking of entering the consulting field 
and are looking for one easy-to-use manual, pick up a copy of The 
Consultant’s Quick Start Guide.”
Joseph Ruppert,
Captain, USN, retired

“Elaine Biech has taken her many years of successful consulting exper-
tise and graciously hands it over to new and seasoned consultants 
alike. Many seasoned folks would have saved a lot of time, money and 
sleepless nights if they had this when they started out.”
Shirley Krsinich
Executive Talent Consultant, American Family Insurance Group
“If you really want to be a consultant, then this book is a must have. It 
takes you from A to Z, answering every question you may have about 
being a consultant. Like Elaine’s previous books, The Consultant’s 
Quick Start Guide provides practical, useful and simple advice and 
examples.”
L. A. Burke
Quality Performance Consultant, 14th Coast Guard District
“Elaine Biech has done it again! A must for every aspiring entrepre-
neur, this book takes you by the hand and walks you through both a 
reality check and a process that will help you build the bridge between 
what you can dream and what you can accomplish.”
Nancy A. Michaels
Executive Vice President, Great Circle Learning
“A must-read for people who are considering a career in consulting. 
The book is filled with realistic and practical ideas—a great way to 
learn all the tricks of the trade from one of the best!”
Vicki L. Chvala
Executive Vice President, American Family Insurance
“Anybody who wants to quit their day job to join the legions of free-
agents and consultants needs this book. There are so many facets of 
the consulting business, and Elaine provides the quickest road to 
plan for success. This book will dramatically reduce your learning 
curve.”
Kristin Arnold
President, Quality Process Consultants, Inc.

“An excellent guide for the new consultant just getting started. Also 
an extremely thorough checklist for the experienced consultant 
undergoing a process of career reevaluation. Guaranteed to help you 
answer the tough questions about how to succeed in this most chal-
lenging and rewarding of professions.”
Jack R. Snader, C.M.C.
CEO, Systema Corporation 
“The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, 2nd edition, is the best way 
I know to jump-start a successful career in consulting. Clearly writ-
ten and imminently practical, this guide will save you countless hours 
of arduous toil. It is a virtual ‘Vulcan mind meld’ of collected wisdom, 
experience, and general business savvy. Bravo to Elaine Biech for this 
innovative tool kit for the consulting profession!”
Gary Muszynski
Creative Catalyst and Consultant, One World Music
 “A logical, step-by-step guide through the consulting jungle. Follow 
Elaine’s lead as if your business life was depending on it!” 
Linda Byars Swindling
“The Peacemaker” and coauthor, The Consultant’s Legal Guide
“Elaine Biech has done it again! For anyone considering leaving the 
corporate world to become a free agent, this practical book is enor-
mously valuable. Even established consultants would do well to review 
and learn from Elaine’s focused and efficient set of tools and princi-
ples. Save yourself a lot of time and effort—buy this book and use it 
before, during, and after you begin your consulting practice.”
B. Kim Barnes
CEO, Barnes & Conti Associates, Inc.
“A quick start is no longer a luxury—it’s a survival strategy! Elaine 
Biech’s newest comprehensive resource can save you precious time 
and money when you need it the most. Learn from a ‘master’ who has 
built a very successful consulting business—you won’t regret it!”
Ann Herrmann-Nehdi
CEO, Herrmann International

“If book titles could be lengthy, I would want to call this one: How 
to Parachute into a Successful Consulting Practice Without Hitting 
a Tree or Landing in a Lake. What a treat for the new or ‘wannabe’ 
 consultant—you can think through the initial career decision, plan 
for the launch of the business, and hang the proverbial shingle with 
this book as your guide. The author has produced another practical, 
hands-on approach!”
Ronald E. Galbraith
CEO, Management 21, Inc.

   Preface to the Second 
 Edition 
 Why This Guide? 
 My recent book,  Business of Consulting, Second Edition,  provides readers with a 
great deal of practical advice for establishing a consulting business. It ends with the 
words,  “ Wish on paper, and it becomes a plan. ”  This book,  The Consultant ’ s Quick 
Start Guide, Second Edition, provides the paper that you may use for wishing. 
 The Consultant ’ s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition,  can become your plan —
 your blueprint for a consulting start - up. It includes questions to stimulate your 
planning, worksheets to develop your plan, and ideas to keep you motivated and 
moving forward. 
 The second edition of this book has been updated with statistics, dates, and 
events related to consulting. New material has been added in several areas; there are 
now questions for other consultants, advice on office location options (including 
the option of no office at all), a list of electronic resources, and suggestions for a 
discussion with your boss.

Preface to the Second  Edition
 Who Will Find This Guide Useful? 
 You will find this guide useful if you are thinking about trying your hand at becom-
ing a consultant. This guide walks you through several issues you must consider 
in determining whether this profession is right for you. You will explore whether 
you have the required skills and attributes to be a successful consultant. You will 
rate yourself against other entrepreneurs. You will identify personal, professional, 
and financial considerations necessary to ensure a quick start. And you will also 
explore your preferred future to determine whether consulting will allow you to 
achieve your professional and personal life goals. 
 You may also find this guide useful if you are new to the consulting profession 
and want to upgrade your consulting business acumen. Perhaps you started your 
practice but didn ’ t have time to develop a marketing plan. This guide presents ques-
tions for you to answer to create your marketing plan. New in the second edition 
is an overview of the ABCs of marketing to put that task in perspective. Perhaps 
you didn ’ t take the time to put together a business plan, and now you find yourself 
heading in many directions at the same time and wondering whether there ’ s a bet-
ter way. The guide will walk you through the steps of developing a business plan. 
Perhaps you thought consulting would lead to more control of your life, but instead 
you find yourself drowning in paperwork and trying to balance a completely out -
 of - control schedule. The guide shares tips, tactics, and tools to bring both your 
paperwork and your schedule under control. 
 You will find this guide useful whether you have previously read  The Business 
of Consulting  or not. If you have, you will be prepared for many of the activities, 
assignments, and exercises you will complete in this book. And you will have read 
the practical advice and the real - world examples that support them. If you have not 
read  The Business of Consulting,  this condensed version provides a painless, fill - in -
 the - blank, practical approach to setting up your consulting business. This guide will 
take you through the highlights of establishing your consulting business. Neverthe-
less, you may still wish to purchase  The Business of Consulting  for a couple of rea-
sons. If you need some of the forms discussed in this guide, you will find them on 
the CD that accompanies the other book. You may also want a more comprehensive 
treatment of the topic. To purchase a copy, you can go to any bookstore; you may 
order it from amazon.com; or you can purchase it directly from Jossey - Bass/Pfeiffer 
by calling 800/956 – 7739 or visiting the Web site at  www.pfeiffer.com .

Preface to the Second  Edition
 How to Use This Guide 
 I encourage you to write directly in this book. Although you may need a note pad 
to jot down some initial thoughts or to complete calculations, ample room has been 
provided for you to write most of your permanent plan directly on the pages. 
 This book has been designed for you to begin with Chapter  One  and work in 
order through the chapters to the end. Naturally you have your own unique needs, 
so you may wish to pick and choose the chapters (as well as the activities) that seem 
most pertinent to your situation. Of course, you will be the best prepared and most 
assured of success if you work through the entire guide. 
 If you are contemplating the consulting profession, I encourage you to begin 
with the activities in Chapters  One  and  Two . They focus on planning your consult-
ing future and will help you determine whether consulting is truly for you. You may 
also wish to work through those two chapters if you are already a consultant and 
not enjoying it as much as you anticipated. 
 Chapters  Three  and  Four  are critical to ensure that you spend enough time 
planning for a successful consulting practice. These chapters address business struc-
ture and revenue issues. Insurance has become more important since the first edi-
tion was published, so Chapter  Four  of the second edition has a list of questions 
to guide discussions with potential insurance agents. You ’ ll also find an electronic 
resource to help you unravel the insurance mystery. 
 Chapter  Five will walk you through developing your business plan. If you are 
already consulting and have skipped this step, it ’ s never too late to go back and plan 
now. This guide ’ s easy - to - follow question format makes putting your thoughts and 
ideas on paper as easy as possible. 
 Chapter  Six  is chock full of ideas for making the transition from an internal 
job to external consulting as painless as possible. New in this second edition is a list 
of suggestions for creating a discussion with your boss about your future plans. 
 Chapter  Seven  is all about your office: the whats, wheres, hows, and whys of 
running an efficient office. Working out of your home may seem like the easiest 
choice you have to make, but is it? Working out of your home has some definite 
 advantages; it also has some disadvantages. If you are consulting and have made a 
decision about location, you may still want to read this chapter to determine 
whether you ’ ve thought of everything. For example, this edition offers ideas about 
planning for your technical requirements, such as electronic record keeping. 
xvii

xviii
Preface to the Second  Edition
 Chapters  Eight  and  Nine  focus on finding and acquiring clients. This infor-
mation is worth reading at any stage of your business — unless you already have 
more work than you can handle. (And if that ’ s the case, you may want to read 
Chapter  Eight ,  “ Growing Pains, ” in  The Business of Consulting. ) Marketing is a lot 
of common sense with a touch of creativity. Often simply reading someone else ’ s 
ideas will remind you of what you knew all along but aren ’ t practicing. These chap-
ters will remind you again. This second edition includes a discussion of the kinds 
of elements you should consider for your Web site. 
 Chapter  Ten  is a lifesaver — both figuratively and literally. Surviving your first 
year of consulting is as much about the work you do as it is about the way you run 
the business and the way you take care of yourself. There ’ s good advice here no 
matter how long you ’ ve been in business. 
 Chapter  Eleven helps you focus on year two. Although you will not actually 
complete these exercises if you are just starting out, you may want to peek ahead to 
see what you will be expected to assess about your progress. A few modifications in 
the second edition to reviewing your first year with your family makes this chapter 
well worth your time. 
 The material in this guide will no doubt stimulate other thoughts and ideas. 
You may capture those thoughts at the end of each chapter on the Quick Start Lists. 
Space is available for you to list the actions you ’ ll take based on what you read, the 
ideas that were stimulated by the chapter, and the questions you need answered. 
These lists summarize the actions you ’ ll need to take to move forward. 
 To assist other consultants in getting started, I will compile ideas and les-
sons learned from consultants around the world and publish them in an upcoming 
 Pfeiffer Consulting Annual  or in a consultants ’  tips book. If you are interested in 
contributing, see the calls for submissions at the end of this book. 
 Now let ’ s see what we can do to get you off to a quick start.

 First Things First: 
Why Consulting? 
 In this chapter you will 
•   Define consulting 
•   Identify the experiences, skills, knowledge, and attributes that will 
lead you to a successful consulting career 
•   Assess your consulting aptitude 
•   Identify your initial consulting focus 
•   Test your entrepreneurial attitude 
 Consulting: What Is It? 
 A consultant is someone who provides unique assistance or advice to someone else, 
usually known as the  client.  The work is defined by the consultant ’ s expertise, the 
structure in which the consultant works, and the process the consultant uses. 
 Expertise is based on what a consultant knows and has experienced. It can be any-
thing from gardening to the stock market; from astral projection to pig farming; from 
organization development to preventing child abuse; from manufacturing to mining 
emeralds. In his book  Going Solo,  William J. Bond (1997) identifies a list of 296 specialty 
consulting fields. And his list does not include the eight I have listed in this paragraph.

The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
 The structure in which the consultant works can vary. You can work for a 
firm, for example, one of the large worldwide accounting firms, all of which have 
consulting branches. You could also work for a small or medium - size consulting 
firm or with a partner in an office. Other possibilities are working in a virtual orga-
nization with a loosely structured relationship with other consultants across states 
or even nations, working as a subcontractor to any of those I have listed, working 
by yourself from a home office, or any of a dozen other structures. 
 The process a consultant uses usually is within one of the steps of problem 
solving. For example, a consultant might help a client in these ways: 
•  Identify the problem:  “ Why aren ’ t our catalogue sales growing the way we 
anticipated? ” A consultant might identify the problem as wasteful use of 
 resources or a lack of repeat business. 
•  Identify the cause:  “ What is causing limited repeat business? ” A consultant 
might identify the cause as sales staff who are rewarded more for new than 
repeat business or as employees with poor customer service skills. 
•  Identify the solution:  “ How do we ensure that our employees have the skills 
they need? ” A consultant might identify solutions such as hiring more highly 
skilled employees, offering higher compensation to attract and retain skilled 
employees, or using coaching to improve the customer service skills of cur-
rent employees. 
•  Implement the solution:  “ How can we improve our employees ’ customer 
 service skills? ” A consultant might help implement a solution by designing 
and delivering customer service skills training, creating a mentoring pro-
gram that encourages on - the - job skill sharing, or establishing a monitored 
customer call center that provides feedback to each employee. 
 To summarize, consultants ’  expertise, the structure in which they work, 
and the process they use define the work. And consultants ’  experiences usually lead 
them naturally to each of these three elements. Experience and education provide 
the expertise that leads them to the field in which they specialize. Experience in 
other organizations as well as the lifestyle a consultant chooses lead them to using 
the right consulting structure. And experience also provides the consultant with the 
process, usually based on what the consultant has used in past work or the process 
the consultant ’ s company uses.

First Things First: Why Consulting?
 Why a Consulting Career? 
 No one should have to get up in the morning and go to work. Instead we should 
all be able to get up and go to play. That is, we should enjoy our work so much that 
it seems like play. Most of us, however, distinguish work (what we must do) from 
play (what we ’ d rather be doing). Unfortunately, most of us get up and go to work 
every morning and save what we ’ d rather be doing for later in the day or later in the 
week. Consulting affords the opportunity for your work to be what you ’ d rather be 
doing. How could that be? As a consultant you will have: 
•  The flexibility to determine when you work, where you work, with whom 
you work, and what kind of work you do 
•  The opportunity to use the skills, experience, knowledge, and expertise that 
you possess and enjoy using 
•  Control over how much money you will earn 
•  A chance to do more meaningful work, make a difference in the world, 
 address that greater calling that comes from within 
•  An opportunity to travel 
•  The challenge to do more complex, exciting, or difficult work, to learn 
and grow 
•  The ability to live in a different location 
Do any of these reasons resonate with you about why you would choose a consult-
ing career? 
 Unfortunately, even when people are given a chance to create the kind of work 
they wish to pursue, they are sometimes unable to do so because there are so many 
choices. This book will help you begin to narrow those choices by identifying your 
experiences (opportunities for learning), your competencies (skills and knowledge), 
and your aptitude (natural talents and personal qualities). 
 So why are you interested in a consulting career? In the next sections you will 
explore the experiences, competencies, and attributes that will help define your 
consulting role. Let ’ s begin by identifying the experiences you have had that would 
lead you to pursue a consulting career.

 Explore Your Experiences 
 To begin to narrow your consulting choices, examine the expertise you ’ ve gained 
over the years. Although it ’ s sometimes difficult to name your own expertise, you 
can easily identify experiences you ’ ve had. The skills and knowledge you ’ ve gained 
from your experiences helps define your consulting role. (We will further explore 
the structure you will consider in Chapter  Four .) 
 Identify all the industries in which you have worked: 
 Identify all the volunteer experiences you ’ ve had: 
 Identify the organizational levels with which you have experience: 
 Rate your breadth and depth of experience:

 Identify the experiences that were the most rewarding and enjoyable: 
 Identify the experiences that were the most negative and unpleasant and that you 
wish to avoid in the future: 
 The experiences you ’ ve had provide you with a level of expertise for which clients 
will pay. Later in this chapter, you will use the information you have filled in to 
begin to identify your consulting focus. 
 Inventory Your Competencies 
 Everyone is very skilled or very knowledgeable about at least one thing. My plumber, 
Owen, for example, is the most knowledgeable person I know about anything that 
goes wrong with my plumbing. He can diagnose problems over the telephone and 
is highly skilled at making a quick repair. 
 Identify the knowledge and information you have. For example, a computer 
salesperson knows about sales and probably has also learned time management 
skills; a nurse may have taken workshops and read several books to improve com-
munication skills.

as a consultant. 
 Assess Your Consulting Aptitude 
 Malcolm Forbes, publisher of  Forbes magazine,  has been credited with saying,  “ Too 
many people overvalue what they are not and undervalue what they are. ”   Consulting 
takes a certain aptitude — those natural talents and personal qualities we all have.

It might be the ability to solve a problem methodically or the creative talent to see 
the problem as a solution. Don ’ t underestimate your natural talents and  abilities. 
And if you know your weaknesses, also know that you can overcome them. 
 Are You a Match for the Profession? 
 Read the following statements. They identify the aptitude, natural talents, and per-
sonal qualities it takes to be a consultant. Check all with which you agree: 
 I am a hard worker. 
 I am in good health. 
 I am a risk taker. 
       I have a thick skin; being called a pest,  “ beltway bandit, ”  or con man does 
not bother me. 
 I am persistent. 
 I am a big - picture person. 
 I pay attention to details. 
 I am an excellent communicator — oral and written. 
 I can think critically. 
 I am an independent self - starter. 
 I can promote myself.

 Although this survey can give you a general picture of what it takes to be a 
successful entrepreneur, only you can decide whether the move is right for you: 
 What did you learn about yourself? 
 What concerns you the most about being an entrepreneur? 
 What obstacles might you need to overcome? How will you do that? 
 What strengths will you parlay to your benefit? How will you do that? 

16

If your score was not as high as you would have liked it to be, call your 
local university or technical college to learn whether it offers classes in 
entrepreneurship. Ask for the reading list and syllabus. If you decide you 
do not wish to take such a course, you may at least want to read some 
of the books from the reading list to bolster your knowledge about what 
to expect.

TIP
A Baker’s Dozen Questions to Ask 
a Consultant
Before you begin the next chapter, interview a consultant. Consider it your take-a-
consultant-to-lunch assignment. Gain as much information as you can about what it’s 
like to be a consultant. Use the following list of questions to start (and I’m certain you 
will come up with many others):
• How long have you been a consultant?
• How did you get started?
• Why did you decide to become a consultant?
• How would you describe your consulting practice and the business structure 
you’ve selected?
• What do you do for clients?
A C T I ON
Q u i c k 
S t a r t

First Things First: Why Consulting?
• What’s a typical project like? A typical week?
• What are the work/life balance issues for a consultant, and how do you address 
them?
• What marketing activities do you conduct?
• What’s the greatest challenge for you as a consultant? The most frustrating?
• What would you do differently if you could start your consulting practice over 
again?
• How can I best prepare myself to become a consultant?
• What would you miss the most if you quit consulting?
• What should I have asked about that I didn’t?
    After your interview, think about what you learned about consulting. How 
has it reinforced or changed your thoughts about consulting? 
 Now that you have defined consulting and identified the experience, skills, 
knowledge, and attributes that you have that will lead you to a successful consult-
ing career, you are ready to plan that career. Use the Quick Start Lists on the next 
page to capture your thoughts before moving on to Chapter  Two . You will find 
Quick Start Lists at the end of each chapter. As you read future chapters and iden-
tify items you wish to remember, turn to the back of that chapter and record the 
actions you want to take, the ideas you think of, and the questions for which you 
want answers.

   Planning Your 
Consulting Future  
 In this chapter you will 
 • Explore your preferred future 
•   Determine whether consulting will lead you to your professional 
and personal life goals 
•   Identify personal, professional, and financial considerations to en-
sure a quick start 
•   Identify the changes you will need to make 
•   Create a personal expense plan  
 Your Preferred Future 
 Why do you wish to become a consultant? What is it about consulting that appeals 
to you? How will consulting lead you to your preferred future? It is important to 
explore why you want to become a consultant and in what ways you believe con-
sulting will lead you to your preferred future. You are about to become an entre-
preneur, and it is usually difficult to separate entrepreneurs from their businesses. 
Therefore, a plan for your consulting business should begin with a plan for you 
and your life. We touched on this in Chapter  One . Now let ’ s continue by  describing 
your preferred future.

The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
 Describe Your Ideal Day 
 I remember working through this exercise twenty - two years ago in a two - week 
career exploration workshop. My descriptions went something like this:  “ I awaken 
naturally to the sound of the surf and smell of the early morning ocean breeze. I sip 
a cup of gourmet coffee on the deck for half an hour as I skim the morning paper. 
As inspiration overwhelms me, I move to my desk that overlooks the ocean to con-
tinue writing my latest novel. I am lost in the task and the time passes quickly until 
2 p.m., when I stop for a walk along the beach. That evening I prepare for the client 
with whom I will work the next day. ” 
 At the time I was living on a dairy farm in the middle of Wisconsin with a 
small income from my fledgling consulting practice and no writing experience. 
I ’ m sure the people in the workshop with me were thinking,  “ Yeah, right! What 
a dreamer. ”  Although I haven ’ t written any novels yet, I do have over four dozen 
published books and articles to my credit, most written while gazing at the Atlantic 
Ocean or Chesapeake Bay, on which I own property. 
 Describe Your Future 
 Take some time now to describe your preferred future: 
 Describe your ideal day. How does your day begin? How will you divide your time? 
How does your day end? 
 Describe your surroundings. Where do you live? What do you see when you look 
out your window? What kind of car do you drive?

 Describe your perfect job. What are you doing? With whom? Where are you work-
ing? What do clients say about your work? What do colleagues say about you? 
 Describe the logistics more thoroughly. How much do you travel? Where? How 
often? Who travels with you? What is your office like? Where is it? What ’ s the view 
outside your office window? 
 Describe the results of your work. What honors or awards have you received? 
What ’ s your annual salary? What profit does your business make? How much is in 
your retirement account? Your savings account? 
 What do you do for pleasure daily, weekly, and annually? With whom? Where? For 
what length of time? What hobbies have you tried?

 Will Consulting Lead You to Your Life Goals? 
 To determine whether consulting will help you reach your goals, you may begin by 
ensuring that you know why you want to become a consultant. 
 Why Are You Considering Consulting? 
 You probably have many reasons for your choice. Examine the three categories 
listed here and determine what part each plays in your decision. Think in terms of 
percentage. Divide 100 percent among the three categories. For example, if you just 
lost your job and consulting is the only answer you can see, you might rank  “ neces-
sity ”  as 100 percent. If you have always wanted to be your own boss and you see 
an opportunity to consult in your present company, you might rank  “ personality ”  
as 70 percent and  “ opportunity ”  as 30 percent. Place a percentage in the blank in 
front of each category that relates to your reasons. 
_______  It ’ s a necessity:  You need a way to make a living and believe consulting 
offers that. Perhaps you prefer a 9 - to - 5 job but haven ’ t found one; you can ’ t find a 
match to your expertise in your locale; your experience is too specialized for avail-
able jobs; you ’ re in a low - paying job and believe your expertise is worth more; 
you ’ ve been downsized out of a job; you ’ ve been laid off or fired; you see the writing 
on the wall and you need to take care of yourself; you ’ ve retired and want some-
thing to keep you busy; you want to pick up some extra cash, perhaps part time; or 
other reasons that necessitate making money as a consultant. Generally the reason 
is a desire for a job or the money that a job brings. 
_______  You see an opportunity:  You see a situation that you can exploit. Perhaps 
your company uses consultants, and you know you could do what they do, make 
more money, and work fewer days than you do now; you spot a trend in your field 
that is creating great demand for someone with your experience and skills; you 
have a special expertise for which there is a shortage; you have contacts, patents, 
or published works that you think are more valuable in another venue; consulting 
seems like an inexpensive and easy start - up; you want to travel; you want to live in 
a different location and see consulting as a way to get you there; or you see other 
unique options that could turn into business opportunities. Generally you could 
continue to do the job you are doing now, but want to take the risk. 
24

25
Planning Your Consulting Future
_______  Your personality demands it:  You want to consult. You would rather have 
your own business, no matter what the consequences. Perhaps you are disillusioned 
with your current employer and know you could do it better yourself; big business 
moves too slowly for you; you need a creative outlet; you want to make a differ-
ence and are not concerned about making as much money as you now make; you 
want to be independent; you want freedom from the daily grind; you want to be 
your own boss; you want to work on your own schedule in your chosen location; 
or other reasons for which you cannot work for someone else any longer. Gener-
ally you want to control your own destiny no matter what the impact on your 
lifestyle. 
_______  Other reasons: 
 Your Responses and Things to Ponder 
 The reasons why you are considering a consulting career give you some things to 
think about. If you rated  “ necessity ”  highest, chances are that you will not be in 
consulting for very long. For some, consulting is just a temporary role until they 
get a  “ real job. ”  You may not find that you have enough funds to satisfy both your 
personal and business needs. This can be a strain on you, your family, and your con-
sulting business, making it difficult to persevere. Putting your personal savings and 
assets on the line for the business will probably be uncomfortable for you. 
 If you rated  “ opportunity ”  highest, you probably also recognize how short 
that opportunity may be. You will want to jump quickly to exploit it, but you must 
first complete the planning that is required. Don ’ t put this book down until you 
have completed the work through Chapter  Five  at least. Your business plan should 
ensure that you have a focus on the future and help you to determine whether 
25

26
The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
 demand is increasing, fading, or being taken over by others. 
 If you rated  “ personality ” highest, you are competitive and will do almost 
anything to ensure that your consulting business survives and then thrives. Your 
business plan may change rapidly as you continue to see new directions you want 
to go in. Don ’ t forget to tell those around you about your new directions. Although 
you will work hard to be successful, be sure to allow time for the personal things in 
your life as well. 
 What do you want from consulting? How will consulting support the preferred 
future and lifestyle you identified earlier? Summarize what you have learned about 
yourself and your desires for the future. 
 Your Goals and Consulting 
 Return to your lists of goals on pages 22 and 23 and rank - order all of the goals you 
listed. List them in rank order below. Then specify how consulting will help or 
hinder your ability to achieve each goal.

Planning Your Consulting Future
 Professional, Financial, and Personal 
Considerations 
 Becoming a consultant means that you will join the ranks of small business 
 owners — entrepreneurs — as we discussed in Chapter  One . Owning your own 
 business is a major decision that will be a big change in your professional life and 
your family life. Capture your thoughts by answering the following questions. Then 
discuss your responses with your spouse, significant other, or other family members 
who will be affected by your decision. 
 Professional Considerations 
 What is the significance to you to give up your job, your title, and your affiliation 
with your current employer? 
 How will not having regular contact with colleagues affect your work? 
 
How much of a risk do you consider it to be to start your consulting business? 
( Although the monetary risk is the first that people think of, there are other risks.)

The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
 How long and hard are you willing to work? (If consulting will be your primary 
source of income, it will require a sustained level of dedication and commitment 
of time to become profitable.) 
 What if you fail? How will you deal with failure? 
 Financial Considerations 
 How much money are you willing to invest in your consulting business? 
 How much of your savings are you willing to invest in your business?

 How will your retirement be affected if you move into consulting? 
 
How do you feel about paying for your own dental and medical insurance? 
 
How will you react when a client does not pay on time? 
 How will you react if you do not meet your financial goals? (It ’ s not unusual to 
work with an organization for months to line up a project, only for the deal to fall 
through at the last minute.) 
 Do you have other financial resources? If required, would it be a financial hardship 
to you and your family to use these resources? 

32
The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition

 Personal Considerations 
 How will your business affect your personal life? 
 How much time and energy are you willing to invest in your business, and how will 
this affect your personal life? (Expect sixty to eighty hours per week during the first 
year.) 
 How do you feel about delaying dinner, missing a Saturday trip to the zoo, or skip-
ping a family vacation because a project took longer than you anticipated? 
 What ’ s more important to you: your family or your business? How will you dem-
onstrate this?

 Identify the Changes You Will Need to Make 
 Only you can determine if the time is right for you to make the switch to consult-
ing. To help you make that decision, think about the changes you will have to make. 
Begin to list those changes here. 
 Professional Changes 
 Moving out on your own has professional implications. What changes will you have 
to make in your lifestyle to accommodate your needs as a professional? 
 Financial Changes 
 What changes will you make to your financial situation so that you can continue 
the lifestyle you have now? Or will you adjust your lifestyle and, if so, how? 
 Personal Changes 
 Without someone assigning your hours, you will have to manage your time to 
 ensure that you take time off: nights, weekends, vacations. Do you see any changes 
that you will have to make to ensure a balanced lifestyle?

grasp on your personal living expenses. Use the process below and the Personal 
 Expense Plan to assist you.
 1. Estimate your personal expenses for the next year. The easiest way to do this is 
to analyze your checkbook for the past year. Don’t forget to include expenses on 
your credit card statements too. Remember to think about unforeseen expenses 
that may occur. It’s always better to plan for the worst scenario. Identify income 
and expenses for each month.
 2. Analyze your savings, and decide exactly how much you are willing to invest in 
the business. Many business planners recommend that you have at least six to 
twelve months of living expenses in your savings account. This of course does 
not mean that you should plan to spend all of it before you are successful.
 3. Estimate what you will withdraw from savings and how much income you 
 believe you will receive from the business each month.
 4. Summarize the data on a twelve-month personal expense plan.
 5. Recognize that this is only your rough estimate at this time. In upcoming 
 chapters, you will identify start-up costs, financial targets for the business, and 
other financial information that will provide a more accurate picture. You will 
want to return to this form later. For now, however, it does give you an idea of 
your personal income and spending pattern.

 Establish a Start - Up Budget 
 Identify everything you will need to start your consulting practice. Think in terms 
of furniture, equipment, supplies, occupancy costs, and setup expenses. 
 You may wish to go to your local office supply store and place an order for 
everything you think you will need. However, before you do that, consider how 
you could acquire the same items with a smaller outlay of cash. Look around your 
house. Do you have a table or chairs or bookshelves that you could borrow tem-
porarily? Look around your neighborhood. Could you watch the ads for garage 
sales that might have desks or telephones? We found a fabulous solid oak desk for 
our receptionist that was advertised in an employee ’ s church bulletin for forty - five 
dollars. Watch for offices that are moving or going out of business. You will find 
fabulous bargains and things you never knew you needed!

 Calculate how much you will need to start your business. Starting a business 
is an iterative process (even though it may sometimes feel as if everything has to be 
completed at once). Therefore, you may not be able to complete all the blanks yet. 
For example, you will not explore your insurance requirements until the next chap-
ter. Yet even though you do not know the exact cost of everything, it is important 
that you begin to identify what you will need and estimate as closely as you can how 
much you will need to invest. Later, when you have a better idea of your insurance 
requirements, you will be able to estimate the cost more closely. 
 Identify where you will beg, borrow, and shop to fill your start - up list. Identify 
the item, the person, or company from whom you will obtain it, and their telephone 
numbers or e - mail addresses. Then use the Start - Up Expenses form to organize 
your thoughts about what you will need and how much it should all cost.

 Put a Price on Your Head 
 This is the best part of this guide! You get to name your price! What will it be? $175 
per hour? $250 per hour? $1,500 per day? $40,000 per project? But why would a cli-
ent pay you all that money? Are you worth it? Let ’ s begin by exploring why you may 
be a good investment for your clients — and worth every dollar they pay you. Then 
let ’ s move on to determine what that dollar value will be. 
 Five Reasons Why You May Be a Good Investment 
 As technology, information, and workloads surge, so does the demand for consul-
tants. Consulting projects have dramatically increased in recent years. All the good 
consultants I know have more work than they can handle. I believe there are at least 
three reasons behind this. 
 First is the trend toward outsourcing more and more services. Corporations 
continue to hire more temporary professionals to assist when needed, as opposed 
to adding highly paid permanent staff. Consultants can temporarily provide the 
people power to complete the work at the time it needs to be completed, allowing 
organizations to avoid long - term costs or commitments. 
 Second, the exodus of the baby boomers is finally upon us. In no other time in 
history has there been an event that has marked the workforce so keenly. Without the 
knowledge of this powerful group, companies may struggle just to sustain their cur-
rent abilities. According to some estimates, 35 to 40 percent of the nation ’ s workforce 
is currently poised for retirement. Add to that the fact that the number of people in 
the U.S. workforce ages thirty - five to forty - five will actually decline by 10 percent, 
and you have a potential workforce crisis unfolding. Many organizations are pre-
pared to lose one - fifth of their executives, managers, and other employees who have 
critical skills by 2015. This is an opportunity for consultants (some made up of the 
same retirees who want to work part time) to help companies fill in the gaps. 
 The third is related to the rapid technological changes occurring in the 
world. The explosion of knowledge and fast pace of communication make it nearly 
 impossible for an executive team to remain completely knowledgeable about its 
industry, focused on the customers, and ahead of the competition; and the team 
may not know instantly what to do when these factors collide. Consultants offer the 
 knowledge, information, data, and systems to solve the puzzle. 
43

The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
 So why would your clients pay your high prices? You may offer at least five 
value - added reasons. 
  1.  You may have the experience, expertise, and time that your clients ’ employ-
ees do not. Managers are bombarded daily with new projects that require 
new skills and more time. In today ’ s fast - paced, ever - changing environment, 
organizations have difficulty hiring enough good people just to keep up 
with normal, ongoing tasks. Adding the fast - paced changes to the retirement 
 conundrum, organizations may turn to you to fill the knowledge and time 
gap for the many special projects that arise. You will bring experience and 
expertise from past projects and other organizations. 
  2.  You may provide flexibility for your clients. They may see you as someone 
who can be brought in for short - term projects. This is especially true if they 
have not planned for fast - paced changes in projects and people. You will be 
there when they need you and gone when they don ’ t. Your clients will see 
that you will work beyond the forty - hour week to get the job done. Unlike 
hired staff, who require ongoing paychecks, benefits, and severance pack-
ages, consultants serve their purpose and then they are gone. 
  3.  You may offer a fresh, objective point of view. With hundreds of other 
projects under your belt and valuable experience in dealing with an array 
of situations and personalities, you will be able to provide unbiased, fresh 
ideas. You will bring ideas and experiences from other firms and  industries. 
This cross - pollination is a surefire way to tap into the brain power of many 
resources. Staff may be too close to the problem to see the solution. In 
 addition, you will not be influenced by the internal politics that may prevent 
employees from telling the emperor he has no clothes. 
   4.   You will most likely be more efficient for three reasons. First, you bring 
 experience with similar problems and do not need to get up to speed. Second, 
you have the luxury of focusing solely on the assigned project or problem, 
unlike employees who have to complete their normal jobs while working 
on special projects. Third, you do not need to deal with the organization ’ s 
internal politics and daily tasks: staff meetings, time and attendance records, 
retirement parties, e - mails, and other policies and procedures. You will arrive, 
put your head down, and get to work. Is it any wonder that a consultant can 
get a project completed in one - fourth the time of an in - house employee?  
44

45
Dollars and Sense

   5.   You may offer proof of honest endeavor. When other parties are involved, you 
may serve as a sign that an effort is in progress. For example, during a merger 
or other organizational change, you might serve as an independent mediator 
to resolve differences. At other times, organizations may find that they are not 
in compliance with environmental or safety laws. You may be hired for your 
expertise to show that an effort has been made to correct the problem.    
 When it comes to the bottom line, consultants are often more cost - effective 
for an organization. Organizations may hire you to gain skills on an as - needed basis 
rather than training and educating internal staff with skills that may not be used 
again. You can provide the solution many organizations are looking for. You will 
have the skill, time, experience, and expertise to get the job done; you can offer an 
independent perspective and insight; you will be fair, honest, and ethical; and best 
of all, there will be no ongoing salary, payroll taxes, benefits, or equal employment 
opportunity complaints. 
 Now summarize the value you could add for your client: 
•   Do you have experience or expertise that you could implement  immediately?  
•  Can you provide flexibility to complete short - term projects? 
•  Can you offer a fresh, objective point of view? 
•  Can you be more efficient as a consultant than an employee? 
•  Do you have unique expertise that may not be found inside organizations? 
 Write a short paragraph responding to these questions to assure yourself that you 
will add value for your clients.

The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
 Calculate Required Revenue 
 As you determine what to charge your clients, you will need to keep two questions 
separate: 
•  How much money do you need? 
•  How much will clients be willing to pay you? 
Although they are related, they are different. If your client is willing to pay more 
than you need, you should not hesitate to move forward. On the other hand, if you 
need more money than you think a client would pay, you might want to reconsider 
a career as a consultant. We will be concerned primarily with uncovering the num-
bers in this chapter. If you want a more in - depth rationale and discussion, turn to 
the  “ Dollars and Sense ” chapter in  The Business of Consulting. 
 How Much Money Do You Need? 
 You can determine how much income you will need in two ways. 
 First, you may calculate in detail your salary, taxes, benefits, and business 
 expenses for one year. This will give you a more accurate calculation and a better 
prediction than the other method of where your money will be spent than the sec-
ond method. The downside is that it is more time - consuming. 
 Second, you can use what I call the  “ 3  Rule ” (pronounced  “ three times 
rule ” ). This is a fast and relatively accurate estimate. The downside is that it will not 
provide you with the detail you may want as a start - up business. 
 Both are provided here. You may wish to do both and then compare the final 
numbers. If you are serious about moving into consulting, I recommend that you 
use the calculation method because this is an important step in your planning. 
If you are still in the exploratory stages of a consulting career, the 3   Rule will serve 
you well for now. 
•  The calculation method: Most of us relate our value to the salary that we 
draw. Use Calculating What you Require on page 47 to identify your salary, ben-
efits, taxes, and business expenses for one year. If it ’ s difficult for you to identify 
the exact cost of your benefits because you do not have all the data at this time,

you can estimate them at 33 percent of your salary.  Remember when you begin to 
fill in the expenses that they are for one full year of operation but do not include 
one - time start - up expenses. 
•  The 3  Rule: If you do not wish to spend the time identifying all your 
 business expenses, the 3  Rule gives a close approximation. Many consulting firms 
use this rule to determine how much to invoice clients for services. It also serves 
as a guide to know how much consultants should generate to cover their salaries. 
For example, consultants with a salary of $90,000 are expected to bill (and in 
many firms generate, too) at least three times that amount, or $270,000. Does that 
seem excessive? Why is it that high? Of course, $90,000 is paid in salary. The rest is 
necessary to cover fringe benefits, such as insurance, FICA, unemployment taxes, 
workers ’ compensation, and vacation time; overhead, such as advertising, rent, 
professional development, telephone, supplies, clerical support, and management; 
down time, including days when consultants are traveling, on vacation, or in train-
ing; and development and preparation time. In addition, any good business should 
be looking for a profit. If it is publicly held, its shareholders expect it. You will con-
sider profit margins in Chapter  Eleven .  
 As a start - up company working from your home, you may consider something 
closer to a 2  or 2 ½   Rule. I do caution you, however, not to cut it too closely. 
Your budget will be tight and you may experience cash - flow problems. For now, 
aim for an income for your business that is three times the salary you will draw. 
Figure that out here: 
 Your Salary $
   3 = $ 
 
 Determining Actual Billable Days 
 The next step is to identify how many billable days you expect to have in one year. 
The answer is not as easy as you might expect. Begin by answering the following 
questions: 
48

 How much time will you take off for vacations? 
 How much time off will you allow for illness or personal emergencies?

 How much other down time do you expect to encounter?

 Calculating a Daily Fee 
 Now let ’ s put the two figures together. Divide what you require by the number of 
days you expect to work to identify your daily fee. If you expect to charge by the

   How do you feel about the amount you have identified? 
 How Much Will Clients Pay? 
 Ultimately the client determines acceptable fee ranges. The factors that determine 
how much a client will pay fall into two categories. The first is the client: the indus-
try, the size, location, demand, and reliance on the consultant in the past. The sec-
ond is the consultant: level of expertise, time in the consulting field, stature in the 
profession, name recognition, and area of expertise. I ’ ve worked with consultants 
who have charged as little as $200 per day and with those who charge as much as 
$55,000 for a one - hour speech. 
 To determine whether you will charge at the high end or the low end, com-
pare the following pairs of descriptions. Place an X in either the left or right column 
next to the one that more closely describes you and your potential clients. This is 
certainly not a foolproof way to determine what you will charge. It does, however, 
give you more information.

Setting Your Fee
Check the competition. Before moving forward, check your market area for services 
similar to yours and identify what they are charging. For example, a local mental health 
clinic may offer a stress management class for $25. Your local community  college may 
offer on-site support for identifying corporate computer needs at $75 per hour. A local 
training, consulting, or facilitation association chapter may offer  facilitation as a com-
munity service. If any of these is similar to what you offer, you may have a difficult 
time convincing companies to pay $1,200 per day for your  services—even if you do 
customize the materials for them. Start with the Yellow Pages. Then make a few tele-
phone calls to members of your network. Jot down any information you learn below.

 Fill Out Financial Forms 
 Although it might seem early in the process to begin to think in terms of a budget 
and cash flow projections, the truth is that it can never be too early to project what 
it will take to manage the finances of your business. The next three forms will help 
you do that. 
 The Budget Form provides a way for you to list all expenses you expect for the 
year. The First - Year Cash - Flow Projection form will help you organize the flow of 
money coming in and going out the first year. Cash flow is critical and is often a key rea-
son that businesses fail: they can ’ t pay their bills. This happens because there is a delay 
between expenses you incur for a project and the income you will receive from it. 
 For example, you may complete a project during the month of May, incurring 
copying, travel, and overhead costs. You will probably bill the client for your work 
around June 1. It may take three to five days for your invoice to reach the client ’ s 
 accounts payable department. Most companies wait until the last minute to pay 
their bills. (This helps their cash flow situation and allows them to collect interest as 
long as possible — something you will most likely do as well.) You may not receive a 
check for your work until the middle of July. And that ’ s the positive scenario. Your 
invoice could be lost in the mail or in the client ’ s system. The check could get lost on 
its way to you. In the meantime, you have those expenses incurred in May to pay. 
 As you complete your cash flow projections, I recommend that you think prac-
tically and plan generously so you are less likely to be caught in a cash flow crunch. 
 The Three - Year Cash Flow Projection form gives you the same perspective 
but for a longer period of time. It is also more general. Think three years out. How 
profitable will you be by then?

   So What ’ s It Take to Get off the Ground? 
 What Will It Cost? 
 Running a business means that you must pay your bills every month. So after all the 
numbers we ’ ve just run through, what ’ s it really going to take to get started? How 
much money will you need? 
 The total cost is actually a combination of two things. The first is your start -
 up costs. These are one - time costs to open your business, and you won ’ t encounter 
many of them again. Some, like insurance, will be due on a quarterly or semiannual

basis. Others, like the desk you borrowed from Aunt June and the scratch - and - dent 
bargain you picked up at the surplus store, will not cost anything again until you 
replace them. 
 Where Will I Find the Money? 
 Some financial advisers recommend that you have six months ’  living expenses 
saved. Others recommend a full year. It really depends on you and whether you 
have a supplemented income or whether you can tighten your belt. You can use 
your estimated living expenses from Chapter  Two  to judge whether you have suf-
ficient savings. 
 If you have decided to move forward and do not have all the money you need, 
you will spend time examining your dilemma in Chapter  Six . Now let ’ s depart from 
the financial discussions and identify other aspects of starting your business in the 
next chapter.

 Getting Started 
 You ’ ve probably figured out by now that there are many tasks to getting a business 
started and off the ground. If you have been working through the tasks along the 
way, you have completed a great deal of the preliminary work that will prepare you 
for this chapter. You will find a to - do list at the end of this chapter that will remind 
you of everything that needs to be completed at this stage. Let ’ s begin by determin-
ing what you want to call your consulting business.

 What ’ s in a Name? 
 Selecting your business name requires two important considerations. First, you 
want to select a name that is easy to remember so your clients will remember to call 
you. Second, select a name that is professional and establishes your image. If you 
can also select a name that says what you do, all the better. Your business name is 
the first image you present to your clients. 
 The name you select for your business will have strong implications for how 
your clients view you and your business. For example, you might choose to use your 
name. The advantage of  “ Joe Bloomer Consulting ”  is that it tells potential clients 
who you are and the nature of your business. The drawback is that it limits your 
clients ’  perception of your business to one person. Joe may have ten people working 
for him, but the name will prevent that information from readily surfacing. 
 What is your vision for the future of your consulting business? Will you have 
employees? Associates? Partners? Your name should allow for your future growth 
or challenge. Many consultants use  “ Joe Bloomer and Associates ”  or  “ The Bloomer 
Group ”  even though Joe may be starting out on his own. That way, they are pre-
pared for adding others as they grow the business. 
 The drawback of using your name in any configuration is that you identify 
yourself as the head person, and this may be seen negatively by colleagues who 
may want to join you in your consulting business. But if you have strong name 
recognition, such as  “ The Ken Blanchard Companies, ”  using your name can be an 
advantage to both finding clients and hiring people. 
 Some consultants choose the name of their business ’ s location as a name. Some 
names may sound great, but you will need to determine whether they also might be 
limiting.  “ The Northwest Group ”  sounds impressive and conjures up great graphics, but 
will companies in the Midwest and the Southeast consider hiring you? And consider this 
one:  “ Herrmann International ” is the ultimate in not limiting yourself to one locale. 
 Select a name that exudes a professional image and, if possible, tells the client 
what you do.  “ Bloomer Executive Coaching ” or  “ Team Solutions ” tells potential cli-
ents what you do. At the minimum, your company name should not confuse clients. 
Take care, however, that you do not get too cute with a name choice so that your 
consulting business sounds amateurish. If your name is Mark Fish, for example, 
 “ Fish Food for Thought ” might be a great name for an aquarium business, but not 
for a consulting business. You want to be taken seriously. 
60

61
Taking Care of Business
 The goal is to make it easy for your clients to select you by name the first time 
and to remember you by name forever after. You will build up name recognition the 
longer you consult. Therefore, select something that you will be able to live with for 
a long time. You may also want to think about the graphics that could support your 
name. Although it took the marketing agency nine months to convince me to use 
waves with my corporate name,  “ ebb, ”  it has proven to be the right choice. Clients 
relate the visual to the name. 
 You may also want to consider how you intend to brand your business. Will 
you be a loud and in - their - face kind of consultant? Or will you be formal and 
strong? Or maybe fun and creative? You may think it is a bit early to consider this 
now, but your corporate name will help tell your story and brand your services. The 
name is an important aspect of marketing your services. 
 Think also about the images that come to mind with the names you have 
chosen. How might they appear on all types of media you may choose in the future: 
stationery, business cards, Web site, maybe even a billboard. 
      If your business name is anything besides your own, you are required to regis-
ter it with the secretary of state ’ s office in the state where you intend to do business. 
In addition, if you use any name in addition to the one you ’ ve chosen, you must file 
a Certificate of Trade Name or a  “ doing business as ”  (DBA) certificate. For example, 
61
If you are having difficulty deciding on a name or even thinking of 
some creative possibilities that follow the listed guidelines, go to www. 
namingtoolbox.com or www.entrepreneurs.about.com The first is soft-
ware that will help you generate possible names. The second is a Web site 
that describes a process for naming a business. Once you get to the Web 
site, click on “Starting a Business.” The Web site also offers other services 
to entrepreneurs. Once you have selected a couple of possible names, use 
your favorite search  engine to conduct a quick check to determine if the 
name is being used in any  other way.

 Find the Best Accountant and Attorney 
 You will need to find an accountant and an attorney immediately. You may be 
thinking that it is too early for an accountant — you haven ’ t made any money yet! 
An accountant is necessary at this time to provide good advice for the many deci-
sions you will be making. An attorney will also get you started on the right foot and 
let you know what records you should keep. 
 You will find a good accountant the same way you find good restaurants, 
dry cleaners, and barbers: networking. Ask other businesspeople, especially other 
consultants, whom they use. Identify the qualities you are looking for so that you 
can describe your ideal accountant. In the best case, you will find someone who has 
experience with small consulting start - ups. 
 Interview several accountants before you select the one with whom you will 
work. This is one of the most important relationships in your business. You 
will work with your accountant at least once a month. 
 What are you looking for in an accountant? 
 • Keeps you informed of new tax laws? 
•  Keeps you informed of retirement law changes? 
•  Challenges you? 
•  Takes risks or is risk averse? 
 What services do you want your accountant to provide? 
•  Tax preparation? 
•  Monthly record keeping? 
•  Monthly statement generation? 
•  Payroll services? 
 When I found a great accountant, I asked her to recommend an attorney. You 
can do the same, and with a little luck the person will meet your needs. You will 
experience more value if your accountant and your attorney already collaborate on 
other business. 
63

64
The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
 Even with a recommendation from your accountant, spend time interviewing 
the attorney. You want to feel comfortable that the person will meet your needs. You 
might ask these questions in your interview: 
•  What experience have you had with consulting firms? 
•  How have you worked with my accountant in the past? 
•  How can we best work together? 
•  How do you charge for the work you do: flat fee or hourly rate? 
•  Can you provide some examples of flat fee rates for services I might use? 
•  If you charge an hourly rate, what is that rate? 
•  What determines whether someone else in the firm will work with me? 
•  Do different attorneys in the firm bill at different rates? 
•  What other costs are involved? 
•  How can you be reached in times of emergency (through office staff or at 
home)? 
 After your interview, reflect on these questions: 
•  How comfortable did you feel with the attorney? 
•  Was the attorney interested in you? 
•  Did you understand everything the attorney told you? 
•  Did the attorney use words you understood and define those you didn ’ t? 
•  Did the attorney ’ s answers meet your needs? 
•  Do you feel that this attorney will have your best interests in mind? 
•  Will you feel comfortable calling the attorney with questions? 
 After you have decided on an accountant and an attorney, the first thing they 
will do for you is to help you decide on the best business structure for your consult-
ing business.

 Determine Your Business Structure 
 The next step is to determine the best business structure for your situation. Once 
you have found an accountant and an attorney, take your plans to them, and ask for 
their advice. Determining a business structure may be confusing; however, in the 
United States, there are basically only five types: 
 • Sole proprietorships  
•  Partnerships 
•  Corporations (C and S) 
•  Limited liability companies 
•  Limited liability partnerships 
 If you are forming your consulting business outside the United States, seek advice 
from someone who understands the laws regarding business structures in that coun-
try. Also, be aware that laws are different from state to state. If you plan to do business 
outside your state, be sure to discuss this with your accountant and attorney. 
 Sole Proprietorship 
 A sole proprietorship is the simplest business structure. It is not a separate legal 
entity from the owner, and usually your social security number serves as your com-
pany ’ s federal taxpayer identification number. There is no registration requirement 
other than an assumed name filing if you want to do business in another state or 
under a different name. 
 Partnerships 
 Partnerships are formed when two or more people form a business entity. Each 
general partner has an equal voice in managing the business, which is identified by 
a federal employer identification number (FEIN). The traditional partnership is 
known as a  general partnership. A  limited partnership has limited partners in addi-
tion to the general partners. Limited partners share in the profit and loss, have 
limited rights to managing the business, and have limited liability. 
66

67
Taking Care of Business
 Corporations 
 Corporations can be formed as C corporations or as Subchapter - S corporations. 
All corporations are separate and distinct legal entities, and ownership interests can 
be transferred. To form a corporation, you must file articles of incorporation, receive a 
charter issued by a state, create bylaws, and fulfill other state requirements. Subchapter -
 S corporations have the distinct advantage of not being double - taxed as a C corpora-
tion is. This means the owners pay taxes as a corporation and again as individuals.
 Limited Liability Structures 
 Limited liability companies (LLCs) and limited liability partnerships (LLPs) 
have a corporate look but qualify for other partnership or corporate tax status. 
As more relaxed entities, they combine limited liability protection without all the 
corporate formalities. They represent a newer structure, so some attorneys and 
accountants are just becoming comfortable with them. 
 The Comparison of Basic Business Entities chart provides you with a com-
parison of characteristics of these business structures. Examine it before visiting 
your accountant or attorney. 
 The Business Structure That ’ s Best for You 
 Your attorney and accountant will help you determine the business structure that ’ s 
best for you. Complete the Business Entity Selection Worksheet here, and take your 
responses to them. The answers to these questions will also prepare you to develop 
your business plan in Chapter Five. As you and your professionals compare the dif-
ferent business structures, consider these issues: 
•  Cost of forming 
•  Process for filing 
•  Cost to maintain and operate the entity 
•  Liability risks 
•  Formalities to operate, such as requirements to hold annual meetings or 
submit meeting minutes to the state in which you incorporate 
•  Ability to transfer ownership

 Finalize Your Decision About Structure 
 The business structure for __________________ (name) will be  ______________ . 
The key reasons are: 
 Explore Your Banking and Insurance Needs 
 A banker and good insurance providers will also be important members of your 
business team. 
 Bank on Good Advice 
 Establish a separate bank account for your business from the start. Using your per-
sonal checking account may seem easier, but for good record keeping, it is wise to 
separate the accounts. Besides, the law requires it of partnerships and corporations. 
You will also be required to file a Schedule C with your income tax return, and a 
separate bank account makes this easier. Commingled business and personal funds 
may raise tax issues and liability issues for you later. Don ’ t take a chance. Keep per-
sonal finances and business finances separate. Some people use separate banks to 
avoid confusion or errors. 
 Your banking needs may not seem critical initially, but you will find that a 
good banker can become a close and valuable partner. How do you select one? Ask 
your accountant and your attorney for recommendations. If the members of your 
support team work together, it will often be more helpful to you. You can also ask 
other businesspeople for suggestions. 
 Be certain that each bank is financially sound, follows established commercial 
banking practices, and has a good customer service reputation. Then interview each 
potential banker about the bank ’ s services and methods of operation. You might 
begin with these questions: 
•  Is the bank federally insured? 
•  Does it offer the services you need today: 

77
Taking Care of Business
•  Loans in the amount you anticipate? 
•  Checking accounts? 
•  Money market accounts? 
•  Certificate of deposit accounts? 
•  Advisory services? 
•  Safe - deposit box? 
•  Wire transfer? 
•  Electronic banking? 
•  Direct deposit? 
•  Night drop? 
•  Trust services? 
•  IRA or 401k? 
•  How experienced is management? 
•  What experience have they had with consulting firms? 
•  If you plan to work internationally, can the bank handle foreign currencies? 
•  Can the bank help you set up payroll deductions for IRAs? 
•  What kind of fees will you pay for your checking account? Is it free with a 
minimum balance? 
•  How soon will you need to order checks? How much will they cost? 
•  Can you easily bank by computer? 
•  How can you access your account information? 
•  Is ATM access readily available? 
•  How do you qualify for a revolving line of credit and for what amount? 
•  What business advice does the bank provide regularly and in what format, 
such as in brochures, by phone, or through seminars? 
•  What networking capabilities does the bank have? Can it put you in touch 
with suppliers, potential clients, or other business owners? 

78
The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
•  How well did you connect with the people you interviewed? How comfort-
able will you be discussing your financial needs with them in the future? 
•  What needs does the bank think you might anticipate in the future that you 
did not ask about? 
 Be sure to discuss possible financing for your consulting business. The esti-
mates you prepared of personal income and expenses in Chapter Two should 
give you an idea of when you might need financing. It ’ s probably best to wait to 
request specific financing until you have completed your business plan in Chapter 
Five and your transition plan in Chapter Six. Nevertheless, it ’ s good to test the 
waters with your bank now. How open and receptive do the people you are consult-
ing with seem about financing, and what options do they suggest? 
 Insure Your Success 
 Insurance is a way to transfer some of the risk to another entity. For a consultant 
starting out, several types of insurance coverage are essential, and others might be 
nice to have. A word of caution: Don ’ t skimp on insurance. It is worth the peace of 
mind to be well covered. 
 Review all of your insurance needs with an agent you can trust. This does not 
mean, however, that you should not shop around for the best coverage at the lowest 
price. I recently purchased a commercial building and wanted to use the insurance 
agent I already have because we had built a relationship. When I went out for bids 
on the new property, I was able to get more coverage for almost six hundred dol-
lars less with another reputable agency. I took the figure back to my agent, who just 
shook her head and said she could not match it. I still asked her to look over the 
new policy and to reassure me that the company was reputable. 
 If you have an insurance agent, start there, though recognize that all agents 
do not cover all insurance needs. If you don ’ t currently have an insurance agent, 
interview potential insurance agents, and consider these questions: 
•   How many kinds of insurance do you represent? 
•  How many insurance companies do you represent? 
•  What kinds of policies have you written for consultants? 

79
Taking Care of Business
•   What references can you provide from other consultants? 
•  What insurance coverage do you think I need? 
•  What are the features of the policies you recommend? 
•  What is the rating for the insurance companies you propose to handle my 
needs? 
 What kind of insurance might you need? Most employees take for granted 
the insurance provided to them by their employers: health, life, disability, business 
liability, and others. As you move to self - employed status, you are probably focused 
on health insurance for yourself and your family. While health insurance is certainly 
critical, don ’ t forget about other essential insurance. Consider coverage for some or 
all of these kinds of insurance: 
•   Health. If you work for a company of twenty or more employees, you qualify 
for COBRA (Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act) coverage, which 
provides you the opportunity to continue with the company ’ s group health insur-
ance plan for eighteen months after leaving the company. You will pay the premi-
ums yourself, but it is usually less expensive than the individual policy you will 
eventually use. Use this temporarily, and have your permanent insurance in place 
six to eight weeks before COBRA expires. You have these options for permanent 
health insurance: your professional association may offer group plans or discounts; 
if your spouse works, you might be added to your spouse ’ s policy; or you can obtain 
individual policies through agencies. 
•  Disability.  These benefits are paid if you cannot work. Although many people 
often overlook this insurance, as a self - employed consultant, you cannot afford to 
ignore disability insurance. 
•  Casualty.  Sometimes called property insurance, it covers damage, destruction, 
or theft of property. 
•  Liability.  This coverage protects you if someone is hurt on your property. You 
should consider coverage of at least $5 million. 
•  Professional liability.  This protects you from claims by clients you caused 
injury or harm to (including financial loss) due to mistakes in the service you pro-
vided. Although it is expensive and difficult to locate (check to see which insurance 
companies offer this type of service), you should at least consider it. Consultants 

80
The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
can buy protection for errors and omissions (E & O), a type of professional liability, 
through a professional or trade association. For example, the International Com-
puter Consultants Association offers this coverage to its members. 
•  Workers ’ compensation.  This is regulated and standardized by state govern-
ments, and you will most likely purchase it from a broker. As a sole proprietor, you 
may exclude yourself from this coverage, but you are responsible for coverage for 
all employees and sometimes subcontractors you may employ. 
 There is other coverage you might consider as well: business interruption, crime, 
rent, group health, retirement income, and key - man insurance. It is best to discuss 
your requirements with your insurance agent. 
 Use the following list to discuss your insurance needs with an insurance agent 
or broker. Even if you have coverage, you will want to explain your intentions for 
consulting. For example, if you intend to work from your home and you have a 
home owner ’ s policy, it may not cover injuries to someone visiting for business 
purposes or the full value of business equipment you have in your home. Your auto 
insurance may not cover you if you use your car for business purposes.

Q u i c k
TIP
 Check Local Zoning Laws, Licenses, and Taxes 
 Your accountant and attorney will probably remind you of your obligations as a 
business owner, but it is still your responsibility to ensure that you do everything 
required. 
 Zoning laws are usually regulated by the municipality in which you intend to 
operate. If you are considering an office in your home, check out pertinent zoning 
laws. Local zoning restrictions might prevent you from having employees, posting 
signs, or operating certain types of businesses from your home. 
 Every city is different; therefore, call about the zoning ordinances that cover 
your situation. Unfortunately, the name of the office will be different in every city 
as well. It may be called the zoning board, building code, code compliance, or some-
thing else. A few calls should eventually get you to the right person. Once that hap-
pens, ask for the specific zoning ordinances that cover your situation. If the person 

82
The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
says there is no problem, keep a record of your discussion and the name of the 
person who provided this information. 
 If there is a restriction that prevents you from having a consulting practice in 
your home, you can always ask for a variance — an alteration that grants a change 
for one person. For example, if you are planning to hire a part - time clerical person 
and the zoning laws prohibit you from employing nonfamily members in your 
home, you could file a formal application for a variance with your local govern-
ment. Be sure to check on all the procedures before you make your request: 
 • Where do you make your application? 
•  Do you need your neighbors ’ approval? 
•  Do you need their approval in writing? 
•  Do you need to attend the board meeting in person? 
•  Do you need architectural drawings? 
 Follow the procedures. Not doing so may result in a delay, and in some munici-
palities, the zoning board may meet as infrequently as every six months. 
 During the same time you are checking on zoning laws, determine whether 
your city or state requires you to have a business license for your consulting practice. 
 And finally, check on taxes. Some large cities require that you pay a city tax 
on your gross income. It is often quite small — as little as 0.5 percent. In some cases, 
if you do business in two cities and one does not charge a city tax, the second one 
might lay claim to all your work. Your accountant will assist you with these ques-
tions and calculate how much tax you owe. 
 File Legal Documentation 
 Once you ’ ve determined the best structure for your business, file  documentation 
to legally register it. Your attorney will assist you with filing the documenta-
tion required. 
 Also request your federal employer identification number (EIN). You will 
need this number — if you have chosen anything except a sole proprietorship — to 
file tax returns, open a business bank account, deposit employment taxes (if you 
have employees), and establish a company retirement plan. 

83
Taking Care of Business
 To obtain your EIN, file IRS Form SS - 4. The form looks formidable, but it 
asks only eighteen questions, and you can answer all of them by this point. If you 
forget to do this now and later urgently need the number (for example, you want 
to open a checking account), it is possible to have a number assigned over the tele-
phone. Simply follow the instructions printed on the form. 
 You may also need a state employer identification number. Check with your 
state ’ s Department of Revenue (or Taxation) and Department of Labor for the 
requirements. If you live outside the United States, you will need to contact your 
appropriate government agencies. 
 Once you ’ ve worked through all the activities in this chapter, your consulting busi-
ness should feel closer to reality. Putting your business plan together in the next 
chapter will firm up that reality even more. 
Your First To-Do List
Okay. You’ve read through (and probably written in) this book for four chapters. It is 
time you took some action—that is, if you haven’t already! In Chapter Five, you will 
begin to write a business plan. It will be helpful if you have completed several tasks 
prior to that time. Here’s the beginning of your first to-do list. If you have already 
completed items on the list, good for you! Check them off. It is time to turn your 
thinking, planning, and considering into action. Note that the worksheets in the first 
four chapters help you complete the actions. Be sure to add others that are unique to 
your needs.

 Your Business Plan  
 In this chapter you will 
• Develop your business plan 
•   Determine how you will use your business plan  
 Are Business Plans Really Necessary? 
 This chapter is about planning: developing a business plan and then determining 
how you will implement that plan. A business plan is a document that describes your 
consulting business and where you want it to go in the future. Many new consultants 
are impatient to get started with the real work of consulting, so planning at this time 
may seem to be a waste of time when there is so much else to do. Planning may seem 
less critical than earning money when there is no income yet. Planning may not 
seem very action oriented and, quite frankly, you may find it boring! Fewer than half 
of all businesses take the time to write a business plan. 
 Nevertheless, a business plan is a critical document. Let ’ s remind ourselves 
of the value of writing a business plan from the perspective of both the process and 
the result:
 The Process 
•  Encourages you to think strategically 
•  Forces you to face difficult issues and concerns 
5
87

88
The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
•  Provides you with a realistic view of actions that require your attention 
•  Compels you to think about all key aspects of the business (marketing, 
 financial, product or service) 
•  Stimulates new ideas 
•  Creates time for you to organize all of your ideas in one place 
 The Result 
•  Delineates the strengths and weaknesses of your plan 
•  Communicates your vision and expectations for the future 
•  Provides a presentation package to raise money 
•  Provides a guide for making decisions about the business 
•  Becomes a tool for measuring progress 
•  Creates a road map for the future 
•  Serves as a reference document 
 Still not convinced that writing a business plan is a necessity? Perhaps you should 
identify why you are avoiding the task. Answer the following questions to help you 
understand your underlying reluctance. Do not read the next section until you com-
plete this activity. This activity will reveal much about you if you complete it without 
reading ahead. (If you are already sold on the idea of writing a business plan, you may 
skip the questions, go on to the next section, and begin to write your business plan.)  
  1.  How do you feel about investing time in writing a business plan? How 
urgent do you think writing the business plan is compared to the other 
things you need to do as you set up your consulting business? 
88

89
Your Business Plan
  2.  How do you feel about sharing your business plan with others? How about 
sharing it with friends? 
  3.  How prepared are you to write a business plan? How knowledgeable are you 
about business plans in general? 
  4.  How do you rate your writing skills? What concerns do you have related to 
your ability to write a business plan? 
  5.  How thorough is your knowledge of consulting and your potential 
 customers? 
89

90
The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
  6.  How confident are you that you will be 100 percent successful in the 
 consulting field? 
 Evaluating Your Responses 
 Although the questions were related specifically to writing your business plan, your 
answers divulge much about you, such as how you approach tasks and where you 
may stumble as an entrepreneur. Here is how to evaluate your responses: 
1.     How did you respond about the time investment?   If you responded that you 
thought it would be a waste of time, perhaps you do not appreciate the value of 
planning and how much time can actually be saved (or gained) by good planning. 
You may have responded that you think it ’ s a good use of time, but you just don ’ t 
have time now. The question is, If you don ’ t have time now, when will you? 
 What might this answer say about you as an entrepreneur? Planning is criti-
cal to starting any business. Although some businesses fail due to a lack of financ-
ing or poor management, most actually fail due to inadequate planning. Don ’ t fall 
into that trap. In addition, time will always be an issue for you. Once you begin 
consulting, you will find that you will often have more to do than time to do it. 
For example, you will find it almost impossible to find time to market when you ’ re 
engrossed with a huge project. Yet you must market, even though you are too busy 
to market, or you may not have work when you ’ ve completed the project you are 
working on now. As a consultant you will always be juggling many balls, and many 
of those balls will be urgent. You will need to find the time to do it all — and do it all 
with quality. You will find that there is always more to do than you think you will 
have time to complete. 
 Do you truly appreciate the value of planning? Are you always able to find 
time to complete critical events? How well do you juggle numerous tasks at 
one time?  
90

91
Your Business Plan
  2.  How do you feel about sharing your business plan with others?   One of the 
reasons for developing a business plan is to raise capital for your business, so of 
course you want to be comfortable discussing it with potential investors. But what 
about sharing it with family and friends? How appreciative will you be of their cri-
tiques? How objective can you be about suggestions that might change your plans? 
Some time ago, our company designed an off - the - shelf package for teaching process 
improvement skills. The kit, Process Tamer, is a proven process, was created using 
all the best adult learning theory, and was designed using only the highest - quality 
components. Because the price point was over a thousand dollars, a publisher friend, 
Dick Roe, advised against moving forward. He suggested we were throwing away 
 $ 100,000 — the development cost. I didn ’ t listen. He was right, and it was one of the 
costliest lessons of my consulting career. Are there other reasons you do not want to 
share your ideas? Are you worried about what others might say if you do not meet 
your goals? If you are reluctant to share your business plan because you do not want 
to hear the feedback, you may be missing valuable opportunities to hone your plan. 
 What might this say about you as an entrepreneur? Successful entrepreneurs 
must be receptive to others ’  comments. As a consultant, you must always be open 
to ideas and information. Remember that you are selling yourself. Therefore, you 
must make yourself more valuable. Feedback — whether supportive or critical — will 
make you more valuable. Even if you do not believe that the feedback is correct, 
the perception is there for a reason. Dig deeper, and learn more. Try to treat the 
information objectively. Of course, this isn ’ t easy, but good consultants are thick -
 skinned. You must be prepared to receive feedback, hear bad consultant jokes, and 
even be called names, such as beltway bandit or con man. You must consider what 
you hear, and be objective about what you might do with the information. You ’ ll 
be better for it. 
 Are you comfortable discussing your plans with others? How open are you to 
hearing negative feedback? How objective can you be to others ’  ideas? Are you able 
to discern valuable feedback from feedback that will not be helpful? Are you able to 
consider all ideas at their face value or for what might be behind them? 
  3.  How did you respond about being prepared and knowledgeable about writ-
ing business plans?   Does your response indicate a reluctance to begin writing 
because you do not know how to write a business plan or because you do not have 
experience in developing one? If so, what have you done to address this gap? As a 
consultant, you will find yourself in many situations in which you will not know 
91

92
The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
exactly what to do. Lucky (and rare) is the consultant who walks into every project 
knowing exactly what needs to be accomplished. If you do not feel confident about 
writing your business plan because you ’ ve never done one before, you are experi-
encing something that is consistent with consulting: starting something for which 
you do not know the answer. 
 What might this say about you as an entrepreneur? Entrepreneurs do not have 
all the answers to everything, but they do know how to find the answers. And when 
they don ’ t know how to find the answer, they just begin. Consultants often need to 
be the epitome of Nike ’ s  “ just do it. ”  Consultants rarely have the luxury of giving 
up. Consultants are persistent. 
 How do you respond when you hit a dead end? Are you willing to conduct 
research or use networking to resolve problems? Are you able to just begin and have 
faith that you will reach solutions? 
 4.   How did you respond about your ability to write?   Writing is a basic form 
of communication with which all consultants must feel comfortable. I listed it in 
Chapter  One  as one of the skills required of a consultant. You will most likely need 
to write proposals, reports, letters, marketing materials, and many other documents. 
Your writing will project an image of you as a consultant. If you are not confident 
in your writing ability, you may wish to consider hiring someone to edit and proof 
your work. You may also want to register for a class at your local college or techni-
cal school. 
 What might this say about you as an entrepreneur? Recognizing a weakness 
and admitting it are critical for success. The successful entrepreneur will find a way 
to overcome a weakness. As a consultant, you may not possess all the skills required 
for success. But if you have identified your weaknesses and determined how you will 
compensate, you are ahead of the game. You have at least two choices. First, you may 
learn the information or acquire the skills. Second, you may tap into someone else 
who has the knowledge or skill, for example, by hiring someone, working with a part-
ner or adviser, identifying support contractors, or using your own consultant. 
 What weaknesses or skill and knowledge gaps do you have as a consultant? 
What plans do you have to overcome them? 
  5.  How knowledgeable are you about the profession of consulting and your 
customers?   It ’ s going to be difficult to write a business plan without this information. 
92

93
Your Business Plan
You may have a general idea of how you intend to consult, but specifics are necessary. 
If your response suggests that you still need to learn more, you may find that you will 
need to conduct more research, gather more data, and learn more before proceeding 
with your plans. Have you completed the step in Chapter  One  in which you were to 
interview a consultant? That is the very least that you should do. To gain more knowl-
edge, you may want to join a professional organization such as the American Society for 
Training and Development, the Association of Management Consulting, the Institute 
of Management Consultants, or one that specializes in your unique area such as the 
Independent Computer Consultants Association or the American Society of Consulting 
Arborists. You may also want to interview potential clients whom you locate through 
your network. 
 What might this say about you as an entrepreneur? The most successful entre-
preneurs have both depth and breadth of knowledge about their chosen field. As a 
consultant, you will want to commit yourself to learning everything you can about 
the profession and about your potential customers. 
 What do you still need to know about the profession of consulting? What 
organizations should you join? What books and journals should you read? How can 
you learn more about your customers? 
 
 6.  How did you answer the confidence question?  How confidently did you 
answer this question? If you have any self - doubts or fear of failure, a plan can do a 
great deal to eliminate those concerns. A well - done business plan will describe the 
concerns and provide the answers. Does your response suggest that you might fail 
at writing a business plan? In order to sleep at night, you need confidence that you 
can accomplish anything you set your mind to do. 
 What might this say about you as an entrepreneur? Entrepreneurs, especially 
consultants, must be passionate about what they do. Successful entrepreneurs are 
absolutely and unequivocally certain of success. I remember making the decision to 
move into the consulting field. As I played with the numbers — various formulas of 
how much work I expected, what kind of work I could do, and how much I thought 
clients might pay — I remember thinking,  “ I can ’ t not succeed! ” Passion about your 
success must start with you. If you don ’ t believe in you, who will? Henry Ford said, 
 “ If you believe you can or cannot, you will prove yourself correct. ”  You must believe 
that you hold the destiny of your business in your hands. You must feel confident 
of your success. 
93

94
The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
 How confident are you that you will succeed as a consultant? Do you believe 
that you will achieve all of your goals? Are you passionate about being a consultant? 
Do you believe in your own success? Will you be able to sell yourself with confidence? 
 The point of the exercise above was twofold: to identify what might be holding 
you back from writing a business plan and, more important, to find out what your 
excuses for not getting on with the business plan suggest about your consulting 
weaknesses. If any of the comments ring true for you, return to Chapter  One to 
review your self - assessments. Pay particular attention to your responses to  “ Are 
You a Match for the Profession? ”  on page 9 and the  “ Entrepreneur Attitude Survey ”  
on page 13. Now that you have a specific task to complete — writing your business 
plan — compare your responses in Chapter  One  against how you approached the 
task. Then develop your personal improvement plan here. 
  1.  Would you change anything about your self - assessment? If yes, what? 
  2.  What might you do to gain the experience, skills, knowledge, and aptitude 
for becoming a consultant? 
94

95
Your Business Plan
  3.  How might you use other individuals to contribute or fill in what you might 
be missing? 
 When you are satisfied that you are ready to move on, begin to complete your busi-
ness plan in the next section. 
 Write Your Plan 
 A business plan is generally five to ten pages, plus several additional supporting 
documents. The plan may have several iterations and revisions. You may begin to 
write it and find that you need to conduct more research. You may also find that 
you haven ’ t thought through all of your ideas as thoroughly as you need and must 
revise your earlier business design. Don ’ t get discouraged. It is far better to discover 
these things now than later. 
 In  The Business of Consulting,  second edition, I present a business plan tem-
plate that you can download from the CD. The plan you are about to prepare 
matches that template in design and detail. If you anticipate borrowing money to 
start your business, this plan provides the kind of detail required to attract inves-
tors. Use this book to jot down your ideas first. It will help you see where you will 
need to gather more information. You may not be able to answer all the questions 
presented, and that ’ s okay, but you should make a concerted effort to answer most 
of them. Once you ’ ve captured your notes here, go to your computer and begin to 
write the narrative. 
 Your business plan has these sections: a cover page, table of contents, business 
description, market analysis, competitive analysis, marketing plan, management 
plan, financial plan, and appendixes that contain financial documentation and sup-
porting documents.

Go to the Internet or call several publicly owned companies to obtain 
copies of their annual reports. Although you will not write anything nearly 
as elaborate as these publications, they will provide you with inspiration, 
 examples of mission statements, and business language that is used.
Q u i c k
TIP
 Cover Page 
 The cover is the first page that your readers see, and it sets the tone for the rest of the 
business plan. First impressions are important, so present your best image. A cover 
page tells the reader that you take this business plan seriously and provides all the 
information necessary for someone to get in touch with you. The cover also includes 
a date so that you know which edition of the plan you are using. Fill in your infor-
mation on the following sample page. For your actual cover page, consider adding 
some line graphics as shown here or color. Add your logo if you have one.

 Business Description 
 This will most likely be the longest and the most important section of your business 
plan. Begin it with an introduction that states the purpose of the business plan. Fol-
low this with a description of your consulting business. You may divide the descrip-
tion into your plans for the business, the work you will conduct, and the business ’ s 
demographics. Use the following questions to guide you: 
 • Introduction  
•  What is the purpose of the business plan? 
•  Your plans for the business 
•  What is the mission, vision, and/or purpose of your consulting business? 
•  What are your goals for the business? (Your goals should be specific, mea-
surable, and time bound.)

What was the start - up date? 
 Market Analysis 
 The market analysis will be most beneficial for financial support if you can quote 
statistics about consulting, your consulting specialty, or the industry you have cho-
sen. You may find some of these data in industry journals or on the Internet.  Train-
ing  magazine and the American Society for Training and Development conduct 
research each year that might provide data for some consultants. Kennedy Publish-
ing and  Consulting magazine are other good sources. 
 Address these questions in the analysis: 
 • What industry or industries are you targeting? 
•  Are you in a stable, growing, or declining industry? 
•   What is occurring now or is expected to occur in the future that will affect 
your business either negatively or positively? 
•  Who are your current customers? 
•  Who are your potential customers? 
•  What are the demographics of your current and potential client base? 

100
The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition

•  What is the size of your potential market? What percentage of the market do 
you expect to penetrate? 
•  What ’ s the estimated total market in dollar value? 
Kennedy Publishing is a consulting research firm that provides data 
for market analysis during this stage of your business and then keeps 
you abreast of what’s happening in the industry. The Web site is

102
The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
 Management Plan 
 Answer these questions about how you intend to manage your consulting 
 business: 
•  Who are the key players in your business? What are their duties, compensa-
tion, and benefits? 
•  If you are the sole employee, how will you manage all that needs to be com-
pleted? What is your starting salary? 
•  What resources are available if you need assistance? 
•  When do you expect to hire additional personnel — if ever? 
•  What experience do you bring to the business in marketing, sales, managing 
a business, and other supporting roles? 
•  What is your education level? 
•  What professional support will you use, such as an attorney, accountant, or 
banker? 
•  What banking services will you use, and where? What process will you use to 
establish credit? 
 Financial Plan 
 Use these questions to write the narrative, and support your narrative with financial 
statements in the appendix: 
•  What assumptions are you making as a basis of the plan, such as market 
health, start - up date, gross profit margin, required overhead, payroll, and 
other expenses? 
•  What expenditures will you require for start - up? 
•  What are your cash flow projections for each month of your first year? 
•  What are your three - year cash flow projections? 
•  Where do you expect to find financing and under what terms? How will the 
money be used—for example, for overhead, supplies, marketing? 

103
Your Business Plan
•  Do you have a line of credit? How much is it? 
•  What is your personal net worth as displayed in a financial statement? 
 Appendices 
 The appendices contain documents that support your narrative. They may be 
divided into two sections or more. You may wish to include those listed here. 
 Financial Documentation 
•  Start - up expenses 
•  Budget 
•  First - year cash flow projections 
•  Three - year projections 
•  Personal financial statement 
•  If you are already operating, an income statement from the past year 
 Supporting Documents 
•  Testimonials from satisfied clients 
•  References 
•  Demographic information 
•  Your r é sum é 
•  Biographical sketches of your accountant, attorney, and others 
•  Industry data or demographics 
 Printing Your Business Plan 
 Once you ’ ve completed your plan, have it edited and proofread. You may wish to 
give it to several people — some who know the consulting business well, others who 
can edit for typos, spelling, and grammatical errors. Make the corrections, and print 
out a clean copy of your business plan on high - quality paper. You may wish to put 
it in a clear - front document binder. If you have pocket folders that you are using 

104
The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
for your business, you may wish to tuck the plan inside as a finished product (and 
add a brochure and a business card if you have them). 
 Plan to Use Your Business Plan 
 Whatever you do with the plan, do not put it on a shelf. It should become a work-
ing document that you refer to regularly. 
 Keep the plan handy, and use it to help you make decisions. Check your busi-
ness progress against the plan at least quarterly to keep yourself focused. And if 
something is not working, change your direction.  “ Staying focused ”  does not mean 
staying the course even when something is not working. Modify your strategies if 
they are not as effective as you originally envisioned. Keep your long - term vision in 
mind, and continue to move in that direction. 
 Consider the following to ensure that your business plan serves its purpose: 
•  Check the data from which you are operating at least twice each year to 
ensure they are still current. 
•  Read the  Wall Street Journal daily to be knowledgeable about the industries 
in which you work. 
•  Subscribe to the  Harvard Business Review, Fortune magazine, and  Fast Com-
pany magazine (at least) to stay on top of business and management trends. 
•  Read books written by leaders you respect to inspire new ideas for your 
consulting business.  
•  Attend conferences that focus on improving your skills and knowledge in 
the areas you have designated as needing improvement. 
•  Network with other consultants. 
•  Learn as much as you can from customers about their existing needs, but 
also become adept at predicting their needs. 
•  Never hesitate to pick up the telephone and call someone in your networking 
sphere to discuss something in your plan that doesn ’ t seem to be working.    
 Use all of the information from these suggestions to update your business plan 
and ensure that you are focused on an appropriate vision   .

105
Your Business Plan
Plan a Review
After you complete your business plan and before you leave this chapter, schedule a 
date with yourself (write it in your calendar or enter it into your electronic planner) to 
review your business plan. Schedule that date for six to twelve weeks out, depending 
on where you are in the process of establishing your consulting business. If you’re just 
starting, do this in six weeks; if you have been consulting for some time, you could 
wait as long as twelve weeks. You decide what seems appropriate to you.
 
Alternatively, you may wish to consider bringing together a small group of 
 advisers to provide an analysis of your progress. Perhaps start with you accountant 
(or maybe your banker and attorney depending on your relationship with them) and 
several colleagues whose opinions you value. Three or four people will be enough. 
They can serve as a quasi-board of directors for you. Send them your business plan 
now, and ask for their thoughts. In addition, ask them if they would be willing to 
meet with you in four to six months for a review of your progress. The results will be 
well worth your effort.

•   Determine your transition plan  
 Gain Consulting Experience Before 
Leaving Your Job 
 You can gain consulting experience before you leave the safety net of your full - time 
job. You should identify several opportunities to get experience prior to leaving 
your job. For example, perhaps you can: 
•  Facilitate a weekend retreat for a local volunteer group 
•  Conduct a team - building session for a civic organization 
•  Offer your services on a freelance basis to a subsidiary or another firm in 
your company ’ s business group.

 Getting Started 
 This book has focused on starting your own consulting business. There are any 
number of ways to enter the field: 
 As an employee.  Many employment opportunities exist for you, from the small 
consulting firms in your city that have more work than they can handle to one of 
the large national consulting firms. A local company can provide you with a vast 
variety of projects, and you are likely to find yourself in charge of a project rela-
tively quickly. A national company ensures name recognition if you later decide to 
start your own consulting practice. A national company also offers a salary about 
twice what you would receive if you worked for a smaller local consulting firm. You 
will probably have twice as much pressure as well. 
 As a subcontractor.  Rather than become an employee, you could subcontract 
with one or several firms. You would have a less secure position than you would 
as an employee, but you would also have more flexibility, gain rich experience, and 
 develop a sense of the market. 
 As a part - timer.  If you ’ re not ready to take the plunge, you could consult part -
 time and keep your existing job. You could use your vacation time and weekends to 
108

 conduct small projects. Be certain to keep your employer informed of any part - time 
consulting work. This arrangement is perfect for university professors or individu-
als who have vacation time or free time on weekends for additional work. 
 As a partner.  You could enter a partnership with one or more other consultants. 
You would be able to share the burden of expenses, marketing, and workload. The 
greatest drawback to this arrangement is the potential for conflict over business and 
personal preferences. These conflicts can vary from an unbalanced workload, to 
communication, to how much to charge. In the past couple of years, I have advised 
a number of virtual partnerships: the partners have their own office or locations, 
and many are located in different states. They come together periodically for syn-
ergy or to use specific expertise to collaborate on different projects. 
 As a self - employed consultant.  Starting your own consulting business is what this 
book is about. This is certainly the greatest risk among the choices, but it also pre-
sents the greatest potential payoff. 
 How do you rate the five options? Perhaps if you have discovered that you do not 
have quite enough capital to start your own business now, one of the first four 
 options might appeal to you temporarily. If you are not quite ready to leave your 
job altogether, you could try your hand at part - time consulting. Note here the 
 specific way you will move into consulting:

 Discussions with Your Boss 
 Once you know you would like to move into consulting, make your boss your ally. 
 Except in unusual situations where your boss is not approachable or your orga-
nization is not open to employees who want to strike out on their own, it will be 
helpful to you to meet with your boss to share your future plans. Use these sugges-
tions to have a discussion that will boost your chances for a successful transition 
to consulting: 
•  No matter what stage you are in when you have your first discussion, be 
honest and candid about your plans. This common courtesy will most likely 
work in your favor. 
•  If you have developed your business plan, share it with your boss, and ask 
for input. Often striking out on your own is a dream other people have but 
have not acted on for various reasons. I have found that they often enjoy 
living vicariously through those of us who have acted on our dreams. Your 
boss may be one of those people. 
•  Keep your boss informed about your progress and to act as a sounding 
board for your ideas. 
•  Take care that you are not infringing on your employer ’ s time as you plan 
for your future. That means you may wish to update your boss over lunch or 
after work hours as opposed to doing this during the workday. Remember to 
be a loyal, productive employee to the end. 
•  Do not bring up the fact that you might be able to consult with your 
 current department or company. Although it is a great transition into 
 consulting, it can appear to be a conflict of interest at this stage of your 
planning. It may appear to some that you and your boss are planning 
how to finance your business venture to the disadvantage your current 
 employer.  
•  Take care that you do not share your plans with too many people beyond 
your boss. Continue to maintain excellent working relations with your 
boss and others in your organization. You are probably excited about the 
prospects for your future as a consultant, but don ’ t let your exuberance take 
over the office and your main purpose for being at this job. 
110

111
Make the Switch Painlessly
•  Guard against the short - timer attitude as you finish your duties or projects. 
Being professional straight through to the end gives you the best send - off as 
a professional consultant. 
 Determine Your Transition Plan 
 Making a transition from being a full - time employee to consulting will require 
some adjustment. A transition plan will help prepare you and those around you for 
a different lifestyle. 
 How Will You Transition to Your New Professional Life? 
 The ideal scenario is that your employer will offer you an opportunity to continue 
working on a project basis. The current shortage of employees has been a factor in 
creating that opportunity and is a win - win for you and your employer: you receive 
a guaranteed income, and your employer receives your knowledge and experience 
while you both make the transition. 
 What should you expect if you do this? Many make the transition with 60 
percent of their salary or more and work less than 35 percent of the time. The rest 
of the time can be spent in setting up an office and in marketing. 
 Another option is working part - time at both your job and at consulting. 
This is the least appealing of all the options, though, because you will constantly 
be pulled in different directions. You will be thinking about consulting when you 
should be working for your employer and concerned about your employer when 
you should be developing a marketing plan. And it undoubtedly will happen that 
the first consulting job you land will conflict with your company ’ s annual meeting 
or some other important event that you must show up for. 
 A second transition issue is to consider how you feel about being a one - person 
company. For example, how will you respond the first time a client asks you about 
the size of your company? How will you feel about saying,  “ One. Me. That ’ s it. ”  
Will you be proud of having gone out on your own? Or is there some stigma about 
being a consultant — and a lone one at that? How will you feel about doing your 
own typing, copying, errands, dusting, vacuuming, and trash removal? Another 
111

112
The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
transition consideration is to have a plan ready to implement should you become 
ill. Could someone fill in for you? Under what circumstances? 
 A separate but related professional issue you may need to consider is working 
alone. Right now it probably sounds wonderful: you ’ ll get to make all the decisions, 
do what you want when you want, and receive all the recognition. The drawback, 
of course, is that you would also assume all the risk, be responsible for all expenses, 
and have no one readily available with whom to discuss ideas and issues. A good 
idea is to set your support network up now. Whom will you call when you want 
ideas? Whom will you call when you want sound business advice? Whom will you 
call when you are overwhelmed? And whom will you call when you just want to go 
to lunch with someone who understands what you are feeling? Make a list now of 
your support network:

 What Personal Transitions Will You 
and Your Family Make? 
 When everything goes smoothly, your family will readily accept your new role. Hav-
ing a home office sounds great. Get up when you want, brew a pot of your favorite 
coffee, write a proposal in a sweatshirt and jeans, no traffic hassle. But how will your 
family deal with you underfoot all day long? How supportive will your family be when 
the big deal doesn ’ t come through and you need to dig deeper into the family savings? 
How supportive will they be when you once again need to pass up a family outing 
 because you must work on Saturday? How will they deal with getting business tele-
phone calls at all hours of the night? You need your family ’ s support — 100 percent of 
it. You do not want them to say,  “ We told you so! ” if something goes wrong. 
112

113
Make the Switch Painlessly
 Here are some transition considerations you all might need to discuss for a 
smooth change: 
•  How will you control household noise, such as your dog barking, during 
 “ business hours ” ? 
•  How will you have privacy when you are working? 
•  How will everyone share the house to meet everyone ’ s needs? For example, 
what happens when eight five - year-olds are expected for a birthday party 
and you are in the middle of a long and important call? 
•  How will the family feel when you are late for dinner because your project is 
taking longer than you anticipated, yet you ’ re only in the spare bedroom? 
•  How will Grandma feel sleeping on the couch because you have taken over 
the guest room as your office? 
•  How will your spouse react upon seeing the mess you made in the kitchen 
for a fast lunch — and didn ’ t clean up? 
•  How will you deal with the ever - growing lawn outside your window when 
you have two proposals that are due this week? 
•   Will you be able to avoid the refrigerator as you walk past it for the twentieth 
time in one day? 
 In the space below, make a list of agreements you and your family will consider as 
part of your transition.

 Where Will the Money Come From? 
 Even if you leave your job with the promise of six months of work, there is no guar-
antee that you will have your next projects lined up when that income stream ends. 
 You may become so tied up in the project your former employer has extended 
to you that you may not find the time to conduct the marketing that you should. 
Or your family may decide that you must take a vacation before you launch your 
new business. Or you may have been on the marketing warpath and have lots of 
possibilities, but nothing has materialized yet. 
 If you plunge right in to your new business without the benefit of support 
from your former employer, you will most likely need cash to start your busi-
ness. Few people set aside enough money to start a business, no matter how far in 
 advance they plan. 
 Where will the money come from? Consider these options: 
•  You could take money from your savings account. 
•  You could borrow against your retirement account (you can do this only if 
you ’ ll continue working with your employer). 
•  You could obtain a loan on the equity in your house. 
•  You could borrow against your life insurance policy. 
•  If you have stocks, you could go on margin against them. 
•  You could obtain a line of credit from your bank. 
•  Your spouse could increase his or her contribution. 
•  You could sell something of value, such as a motor home or sailboat. 
•  You could cut back on some of your spending—for example, by not taking 
a  vacation. 
•  You could obtain a business bank loan. 
•  You could apply for a loan from the Small Business Administration. 
•  You could ask a friend or colleague to sponsor you. 
•  You could borrow against your credit card (don ’ t do this unless you have a 
great opportunity in hand and can pay it off quickly).

Plan with Your Family
Sit down with your spouse, significant other, or other family members and discuss the 
issues identified in this chapter. How supportive will everyone be of your endeavor? 
Ask everyone in the discussion to identify what excites them the most about your 
planned consulting role. Also ask them what concerns them the most. Capture these 
responses here. Then as a family, decide how you can build on the positives and what 
you can do to address the concerns.

 Setting Up 
Your Office  
 In this chapter you will 
•   Explore your options for an office location 
•   Prepare a plan to set up your office 
•   Learn how to manage your paperwork, including record keeping 
and invoicing  
 Office Location Options 
 You have many options when it comes to setting up your office. You could rent a 
standard office, lease space in an executive suite, or set up a home office. No matter 
where your office is, ensure that it projects the professional image you wish. 
 Renting Office Space 
 An office in a nice office building at a recognized location adds to your appearance 
as a professional. You may also feel more professional leaving your house every 
morning for the workplace. Leasing office space is often a long - term commitment 
(as long as three to five years), and if office space is in high demand, it could be 
costly as well.

122
The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
 Sharing Executive Suites 
 An option that lies somewhere between a full - blown office and your spare bedroom 
is an office in an executive suite. The popularity of these suites has grown due to the 
cost savings that are available by sharing a conference room, office support, tele-
phone systems, and copy machines. Executive suites run the gamut for amenities, 
service, and quality, so shop around. Ask existing tenants about their satisfaction 
with services they receive. 
 Using a Home Office 
 Just a short time ago, working out of your home was not cool. You would have been 
viewed as less than professional and not serious about your career. Today, all that 
has changed. Flexi - place, flex - time, and telecommuting arrangements are on the 
rise, and those who work at home are often envied by those who cannot. 
 Examine the advantages of having your office in your home: 
•  You work where you live. 
•  You have the flexibility of using time as you choose for both your business 
and your personal life, getting up at midnight to add an idea to your pro-
posal or being available to receive delivery of the new family television. 
•  You can deduct from your taxes a proportionate amount of your home ’ s 
utility costs, taxes, mortgage, or rent. 
•  It ’ s a low - cost option for start - ups that minimizes your risk. 
•  You don ’ t have to commute. 
 There are also some disadvantages to having your office in your home: 
•  You work where you live. 
•  It may be inconvenient for meeting clients. 
•  There are many distractions, including chores, the refrigerator, television, 
and your hobbies. 
•  You may be lonely if you are accustomed to working in a large office with 
many people around. 
122

123
Setting Up Your Office
•  You may need to overcome the stigma of working out of your home if 
 clients expect you to work out of an office. 
•  Creating dedicated space may be difficult. 
 Notice that  “ you work where you live ”  is both an advantage and a disadvan-
tage. The choice really boils down to whether it is the right decision for you. 
 No Office at All 
 Most consultants provide their services at the client ’ s place of business, so you do 
have the broadest of choices for office location. In fact, I spoke with one savvy 
young man recently who was certain that he did not need an office at all for the 
kind of consulting he did. He held up his laptop and his cell phone and said,  “ With 
these I can do everything I need to for my clients at any location! ” 
 Indeed, no office at all is certainly an option in today ’ s world. 
 Weighing Your Options 
 You have other options in addition to the four listed. You could share office space 
with someone or sublease from others. In both of these cases, you will want to 
maintain your own separate identity for legal and professional reasons. 
 Answer these questions to help you decide the best option for you. 
 How much space do you need? 
 How much can you afford to pay for office space?

125
Setting Up Your Office
 Set Up Your Office 
 Once you ’ ve decided on space, you will need to ensure that you have furnished, 
equipped, wired, and supplied it with everything you will need. 
 An Office Is an Office, Not Your Family Room 
 This may seem like a strong statement, but if you have chosen the home office 
route, heed the warning. It may be cute when your four-year-old answers the tele-
phone; it ’ s not cute when the caller is the CEO you met at last week ’ s conference. 
And the first time your dog barks as you are talking to a prospective client, you may 
understand why you must separate your office from the rest of the house. Install 
separate telephone lines for your office as one of the first things you do. You may 
want two: one for faxing and a second for voice calls. You can probably share your 
Internet service provider, but check into this to be sure. 
 Furnishing Your Office 
 Once you ’ ve settled on office space, you will need to furnish it with at least a desk, 
chairs, bookshelves, and a four - drawer filing cabinet. While you ’ re planning, think 
about where you will place the fax machine, telephone, answering machine, com-
puter and printer, and copy machine. Will you need extra tables on which to place 
some of these items? 
 Use the grid on the next page to lay out your office space. Each square counts 
as one foot. Mark where the windows are located. Then measure your larger pieces 
of furniture and start sketching — with a pencil. While you ’ re doing this, also plan 
where you will need outlets and extra telephone jacks. And very important —
 lighting. Where ’ s the natural lighting? Will you need additional lamps?
 Planning Your Technical Needs 
 You will most likely need a computer and printer, fax machine, telephone system, 
and answering machine. What about a copy machine? A lease can be reasonable, but 
if there is a copy shop or a printer near you, you may not be concerned about it im-
mediately. You will also wish to invest in a business cell phone. You may use your per-
sonal cell phone for business and simply change the way that you answer it. And how 
125

126
The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
126
Office Layout Grid
about a PDA or pager? You will need to decide what you will need. My advice is to try 
to condense as much as possible to as few pieces of equipment as possible. 
 Get Wired.  Accommodate all those electronic items with plenty of grounded out-
lets (if your home is not new, you may need to have some wiring completed) and 
telephone jacks (at least two separate lines: one for your fax machine and the other 
for a telephone). Don ’ t forget a coaxial television cable if you are hooked up to a 
cable modem for Internet access. 

127
Setting Up Your Office
 About Your Answering Machine.  The outgoing message on your answering machine 
should sound professional and as much like voice mail as possible: no distracting noise 
in the background (like your latest CD), no long series of beeps before the caller can 
leave a message, no unprofessional melodic chimes. The caller should be able to leave 
a message of any length. Your outgoing message is part of your image; it sells you. 
 Change your message daily to let people know where you are. A generic mes-
sage of,  “ I ’ m sorry I missed your call. Please leave a message and I ’ ll get back to you 
as soon as I can, ”  tells the caller nothing. Are you on another line? Are you off to the 
post office for ten minutes? Are you on a two - week cruise? The best messages are 
up - to - date:  “ Hello, this is Carlos. Today is Tuesday, May 13, and I will be in meet-
ings most of the day. I will pick up my messages at the end of the day and return 
your call no later than Wednesday morning. Thank you for calling! ” 
 One dilemma for many consultants is that we are with clients during the day and 
unable to answer telephone calls, even if others call on our cell phones. This is why 
I generally provide my office number to clients. They can call and reach a live person 
who can either tell them what I am doing and how soon they can expect a response, 
and in an emergency, my office staff can always reach me. If you will not have an office 
with support staff, you may at some point wish to switch to an answering service.  
 Supplying Your Office 
 When it comes time to purchase the office supplies you will need, there are two 
possible approaches. You can start with the following office shopping list and add 
other things to it. Or you can go to your local office supply store, grab a shopping 
cart, and walk up and down the aisles until you ’ ve found everything you think you 
will need. No matter which method you use, you will probably forget something. 
One last thing: Where are you going to store all these supplies?

 Paper, Paper Everywhere!

stamp, write on, print, read, and file more paper than you can imagine. Start a sys-
tem early to keep yourself organized. 

129
Setting Up Your Office
 Establishing a Filing System 
 Develop a filing system that works for you. File things with two important aspects 
in mind: ease of putting them away and ease of finding them! We use different 
colors of files to distinguish what ’ s inside: blue for project files, yellow for office 
files, red for client resource and information, green for volunteer activities, tan for 
resources such as articles. You may start out with just one drawer and file every-
thing alphabetically. Once you have been in business for several months, you will 
probably want to separate your drawers into categories, such as past client folders, 
originals, proposals, and resources. 
 Good Filing Habits 
•  Grab a file as soon as you start a new project, client, or another category. 
•  Write the same thing first on each file tab; usually that means the organiza-
tion or key word. If the file is about Mr. Hendrix from the San Francisco 
branch of Wells Fargo Bank, the file could be under H, S, or W. Decide what 
it ’ s going to be now, and be sure to stick with it. 
•  Put everything back in its place after you are finished with it, or  . . . 
•  Store your filing in a small basket. Once the basket is filled or Friday rolls 
around — whichever comes first — file everything. 
•  Avoid duplicate files. 
•  Do not file meaningless attachments. 
•  Condense your materials; that is, after a project, toss anything that will not 
be useful later. 
•  Purge your files regularly — at least once each year. 
 Establishing Your Record - Keeping System 
 Your records are the voice of your success. Good records can do two things for you: 
•  They will tell you whether you are financially successful. 
•   They will help keep you organized. 
129

130
The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
 After six months in business, your records should be speaking to you. They will 
tell you: 
•  Your total income and expenses 
•   Your profit or loss  
•  The number of customers you served 
•  The profit margins for each customer 
•  The accuracy of your projections 
•  How much money you will need for the next six months 
•  What you need to do to increase your business 
 Many of the forms you need were discussed in Chapters  Three  and  Five . The 
forms that follow in this chapter will round out what you need to tell you how 
you ’ re doing financially and to keep you organized. 
 Electronic Records 
 Select your financial record - keeping system early. This chapter provides you with 
some basic forms; most accounting software will be able to generate the same 
 information easily for you. You might consider using Peach Tree, QuickBooks 
Pro, One - Write Plus, or MYOB (Mind Your Own Business). 
130
You might want to organize your desk drawer with monthly dividers. This 
method can help you keep organized and see at a glance what you have 
coming up in the months ahead.

 Monthly Expense Worksheet/Record.  This record is one that I examine regularly. 
I create a budget at the beginning of each year based on the past year and the pro-
jections for the upcoming year. You have already created a budget in Chapter  Three . 
This form tells you whether you are taking in more or less income each month than 
you projected and whether your expenses are at the same level you projected. The 
implications are clear. See the sample form.

Preparing Forms
Make twelve copies of each of the forms you will need; then store them in one of 
the yellow folders you just bought during your office shopping trip. If you have the 
second edition of The Business of Consulting, all the forms are on the disk. Just pull 
it up, personalize it for your business, and print twelve of each. You will note that 
several forms in this book have been updated since The Business of Consulting was 
published, but they still provide a basis from which to begin.

 Finding Clients  
 In this chapter you will 
•   Determine your niche in the market 
•   Analyze your competition 
•   Identify your first clients 
•   Create a plan to land your first work  
 Determine Your Market Niche 
 In Chapter One you declared that you were a 
 consultant who helps 
your clients to 
 , which benefits them  
 . We ’ ll begin with 
this statement as you identify your market niche. 
 Your  niche  is the position you wish to occupy that sets you apart from as 
many other consultants as possible. This niche may be based on the type of service 
or product you provide, the type of client or industry you serve, how you provide 
your services, or the specific expertise or experience you have that validates your 
services. 
 So far you have explored your areas of expertise, the experience you ’ ve had, 
your natural abilities, the benefits you could provide a client, the results that might 
be valuable to a client, and other things. To identify your niche in the marketplace, 
you will examine what you will do from a client ’ s perspective and begin to describe 
your clients more specifically, thus homing in on your potential client base.

145

146
The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
 To what part of the market will you offer your consulting? You need to clarify 
this before you create your marketing plan in the next chapter. A portion of your 
marketing plan will target a market segment on which you will focus your mar-
keting efforts. You need this focus so that you are not trying to be everything to 
everyone. 
 The opportunities available to you as a consultant are broad. You must begin 
to identify your niche — what you profess to do. This is a long - time consulting 
 dilemma: if what you claim you can do is too broad, your expertise may appear 
shallow; if what you state you do is too narrow, it decreases your chances for locat-
ing work. To say it another way, the more generalized you are, the less credible you ’ ll 
be in potential clients ’  eyes; the more specialized you are, the more difficult it is to 
obtain business. 
 Even understanding this, you must still determine what sets you apart from 
other consultants. What is unique about what you offer? A new consulting company 
can be successful more easily if it can focus on a specifically defined market. If you are 
a small company, you will be more successful creating your own niche than trying to 
compete against larger, more established companies that may be your competitors. 
 When ebb associates started in the late 1970s, we decided to offer customized 
training programs to clients. At the time we didn ’ t really understand that we were 
selecting a unique niche. What we did know is that most participants in the training 
sessions we offered complained about not being able to transfer what they learned 
in a training session to their workplaces. We were able to do what the large training 
vendors could not: we could focus on one client at a time and design exactly what 
that client required. Now that desktop publishing is widespread, that service is not so 
unique. However, at the time, we made our mark in the training consulting field by 
filling a unique need and along the way identified our niche in the marketplace. 
 How can you discover and describe your niche? First, review the previous 
chapters where you focused on what you could offer. Second, determine if potential 
clients have a need that is not being fulfilled or a gap that is not closed completely 
by your competitors. Third, identify the services and products that you could 
 deliver to meet the need or close the gap. 
 This chapter leads you through several exercises to help you uncover your 
niche. The exercises will help you to explore your expertise and potential client 
base, present a process to discover what clients need, and suggest how you can 
scrutinize and compare your competitors. 
146

147
Finding Clients
 Begin by using the newspaper industry ’ s method of uncovering the facts —
 answering the who, what, where, when, and why questions. Answer the questions 
under each heading that follows to identify your marketing niche and describe your 
client. Where appropriate, answer these questions from your potential clients ’  per-
spective. 
 Who? 
 Use these questions to begin to develop a profile of your potential client: 
•  Will you target for - profit or nonprofit organizations? 
•  If you target for - profit, what sector will be your focus — for example, manu-
facturing, service, retail? 
•  What specific industry will you target — for example, health care, hospitality, 
food service, construction, high tech? 
•  If you target nonprofit, what sector will be your focus — for example, asso-
ciations, educational institutions, or local, state, or federal government? 
•  What size organizations will you target — for example, Fortune 500, 
 medium, small? You may choose to identify the size by number of 
 employees,  revenues, or something that is unique to the industry; hospitals, 
for  example, measure size by the number of beds. 
•  What level in the organization will you target — for example, frontline 
 employees, first - level supervisors, managers, or executives? 
•  What ’ s the structure of the group you will target — for example, new teams, 
intact work groups, individuals? 
 What? 
 Use these questions to pull together the expertise and experience that you explored 
in Chapter One. Now is the time to identify the specifics: 
•  What will your customers want from you? How will this differ from what 
they expect from other consultants? 
147

148
The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
•  Will your clients have a special situation — for example, start - up, family- 
owned, merged, or high - growth businesses? 
•  What role will your customers see you conducting — for example, trainer, 
facilitator, coach, technical adviser, process consultant, content expert, 
 support, resource? 
•  What topic of expertise will your client expect — example, team building, 
computer programming, leadership, time management, investing, regulatory 
laws, marine biology, accounting, construction, inventory control? 
•  What ’ s special that sets you apart from other consultants? 
 Where? 
 Part of your work in Chapter Two was to identify where you would ideally like to 
work. It is probable that clients in your chosen industry may be found everywhere. 
Therefore, location may have as much to do with your preference as anything else: 
•  Based on the lifestyle you have described in Chapter Two, where will you be 
working? 
•  Will your focus be local, statewide, regional, national, or international? 
•  Do your selected industries suggest a specific locale, such as furniture man-
ufacturing in North Carolina, high tech in Silicon Valley, importers in San 
Francisco, New York, and other coastal cities? 
•  In what surroundings will you work: for example, rural, village, city? What 
size city (if a city is your choice)? 
•  Will you narrow your market niche by climate? 
 When? 
 These questions will help clarify the time - bound aspects in your consulting niche: 
•  Will you focus on long - term or shorter contracts? 
•  What ’ s the range in length of the contracts you will target? 
148

149
Finding Clients
•  Will the time range be different for different services? 
•  Will you provide follow - up services? 
•  How much repeat business will you target? 
•  At what point in the problem - solving cycle would you enter — for example, 
identifying a problem, identifying the cause of the problem, identifying the 
solution, or implementing the solution? 
 Why? 
 In Chapter Three (page 51) you identified the value you add for which a client 
would be willing to pay. Use that information to help you focus your marketing 
niche based on why a client would hire you: 
•  Why would a client view your experience and expertise worthy of hire? 
•  Why would a client hire you over your competition? 
•  Why might a client see you as adding flexibility to the organization? 
•  Why would a client look to you to offer a fresh, objective point of view? 
•  How efficient do you believe you are? 
•  Would clients hire you if they needed to reassure regulatory, safety, or legal 
authorities about something? 
 Is There a Need? 
 Without getting into actual market research, it is important to identify whether 
there is a need for the niche you have just identified. You may have identified a 
service that enables you to use what you like and what you know, but will the client 
base you identified want to buy what you offer? 
149

150
The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition

Is There a Client Base?
Before you move forward, be sure that there is a client base ready and waiting for 
your consulting service or product. Select three organizations that match the charac-
teristics of the organizations you just described. Then follow these steps and record 
what you learn here.
 1. Identify specific individuals in organizations to whom you will eventually sell 
your services. You can do this by checking the company’s annual report (which 
you can usually obtain on request or by checking the company’s Web site) or 
calling the receptionist and asking for the name of the person in the position to 
whom you wish to speak.
 2. Call the individuals, and tell them that you have a business concept you would 
like to discuss and about which you would value their opinions. Ask if they have 
five minutes for you. If not, ask if there is a better time. If the person responds 
positively, move forward. If the person responds negatively, say thanks, and 
move to your next candidate.
 3. Briefly explain your business, its purpose, and how it might benefit the individu-
als and their businesses.
 4. Ask whether they think they would see a need for your services in the future. 
Probe to find out why they responded the way that they did.
 5. Thank them for their time.
 6. If they responded positively, ask them if you could send more information, a 
letter, or a brochure once your company is up and running. (This might be your 
first marketing action—and perhaps your first client. My first exploratory visit 
turned into my first paying client.)
 7. Be sure to follow up with a handwritten thank you note on the same day you 
made the phone call.
 8. Record your information:

Analyze Your Call
Did the phone calls encourage or discourage you? If you are positive about moving 
forward, spend some time analyzing your competition next. If the phone calls were 
not positive, you might analyze your calls. Did you call the right people? Did you 
call the right companies? Should you call others? Did you sell your concept well? Was 
the timing right? Did everything go as you planned it? What might you do differently 
with subsequent calls?

152
The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition

 Who ’ s Your Competition? 
 Know Your Industry 
 Keep an eye on your competition. Being a consultant can be lonely, and this means 
you may find yourself outside the information loop — what ’ s happening in the 
 industry in which you work and in business in general. You may find being alone 
psychologically difficult; it can also be financially devastating if you do not stay on 
top of what ’ s happening in your field. What ’ s happening in the field and what your 
competition does will affect your marketing direction. 
 Be aware of trends. How will a surge in downsizing affect your consulting 
services? How will the latest management fad affect the message you deliver to your 
clients? How will changes in technology affect your products and service? 
 How are your clients addressing these changes? You can observe this with what 
you already have available. Read your professional journals with these questions in 
mind: Who ’ s advertising? What are they selling? What ’ s their focus? Who ’ s writing 
articles? What are the topics? Attend conferences with these questions in mind: 
Who ’ s presenting? What are they expounding? What ’ s the buzz in the hallways? 
 Attend trade shows: Who has a booth? What are they selling? What message are 
they delivering? Visit bookstores: Who ’ s writing? What topics are being published? 
 Take time now and page through your most recent professional journal. What 
did you learn about your competition from reading it? 
 Know Your Competition 
 Review the information from your business plan in Chapter Five to get you started 
here. You need to understand your competition so that you can set yourself apart 
from it. You will want a clear sense of what differentiates you from your competi-
tion before you write your marketing plan in Chapter Nine. 
 Identify three competitors, and complete the Competitor Comparison chart 
so you can compare your business to the competition.

Use Your Network
If you are unable to answer the questions above about your industry, tap 
into your network. You might talk to friends in business, your potential 
clients, or another consultant who is outside your geographical or content 
area. Professional organizations also provide opportunities to talk with 
your competitors at conferences and chapter meetings. You should belong 
to at least two professional organizations that support what you do.
Q u i c k
TIP
   Competitive Analysis 
 Use the data you uncovered to organize your thoughts about your competition: 
 Who are your strongest competitors? 
 In which geographical areas will you have the most competition? The least? What 
does this tell you about where to focus your energy to get new clients? 

155

 How do your competitors ’  specialty areas compare with yours? How will this affect 
your ability to generate business? 
 How will your competitors ’ pricing affect your ability to get business? 
 How will your competitors ’  experience, name recognition, image, and reputation 
for quality affect your ability to compete? How might you take advantage of this in 
finding new clients?

Read your junk mail. Wallow in your junk mail! The direct mail you receive 
every day is a marketing gift. You can use it to learn what your competi-
tion is doing, how to write more effective marketing letters, how to design 
brochures, and what trends are hitting the profession. Don’t bemoan the 
fact that your mailbox is stuffed with junk mail every day. Instead, be 
thankful for all the market research that has just been dumped in your lap!
Q u i c k
TIP

157
Finding Clients
157
 Your Niche 
 Examine everything you have identified about you, the clients you will target, and 
your competitors. How would you summarize the niche you have selected for your-
self? What is special about your services that sets you apart from the rest? How are 
you defining your client base that sets you apart? 
 Use these questions as a guide to write your niche statement here. 
 Identify Your First Clients 
 You have clarified your niche. Now it ’ s time to specify the organizations in that 
niche by name. Who will be your first clients? 
 You are in control of identifying your first clients. Yes, you will acquire some 
work through referrals from friends, family, and colleagues. You may have some work 
from your current (or past) employer. And you may have some work come your way 
through people you meet at professional meetings or conferences. Some of this work 
may be related to your niche, but much of it may not. As you begin, however, you 
will most likely not turn any of it down. 
 Examine the niche statement you wrote at the end of the previous section. 
Now identify twenty organizations by name that meet your criteria and with which 
you would like to do business. This is not the time to be shy, timid, or modest. Go 
for it. Are you thinking that Microsoft is too large? Perhaps Harvard is too presti-
gious? Or General Motors is too impenetrable? Don ’ t let size, prestige, or reputa-
tion scare you. The people who manage organizations need good consulting, no 
matter what the size of the company supplying it. I ’ ve always said,  “ Go for the big 
fish; you ’ ll spend the same time baiting the hook. ”  You will invest the same amount 

158
The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
158
of time marketing to large organizations as small, and the payoff may be much 
greater. 
 Larger organizations have larger consulting budgets, they generally have a 
greater need, they are more likely to hire for repeat work, and they are often willing 
to take a risk with new consultants. So don ’ t be intimidated by size. To whom do 
you want to provide your consulting services? Identify twenty organizations here 
that you would like to hire you as a consultant:

 Land Your First Work 
 You ’ ve identified your twenty top candidates. Now how do you get to them? You 
could just make a phone call and talk to them. That ’ s called  cold calling,  and usually 
isn ’ t much fun. I have a friend in sales who lives by cold calls. He says he makes one 
hundred phone calls to find ten people who will talk to him. Of those ten, two will 
agree to meet with him in person, and one will purchase his product. That doesn ’ t 
sound like fun to me. 
 There is a way to warm up those cold calls. And although the process takes 
some investment up front, the odds of an immediate sale are much greater, you will 
begin to build relationships for future sales, and it ’ s much more fun. 
 Here ’ s the process I use: 
  1.  Identify twenty or thirty organizations you wish to target. Begin with that 
many because some will fall out along the way: you may have difficulty 
 locating information about them, or you may change your mind about 
wanting to work with them based on information you learn. 
  2.  Copy one Company Profile form for each organization you have targeted. 
Complete whatever information you know about it.

162
The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
  3.  Next check out the organization ’ s Web site. Capture all the information that 
might be pertinent to services you could offer the organization. You are try-
ing to gather enough information for two reasons: first, to learn as much as 
you can about the organization, and second, to have enough information to 
compose a unique, personalized letter that will grab the reader ’ s attention. 
  4.  If the organization is publicly traded, you should be able to obtain the 
 annual report. 
  5.  Use the Company Profile form to organize the information you find. 
  6.  You probably will not get all that you need from the Web site. Therefore, you 
will continue your research at other sites. First, conduct a general search on 
the Internet. This may uncover a wide variety of information — some useful, 
some not. Continue searching for what you need. 
  7.  If you still need more information, you may be able to find information at 
your library. If you are researching a local company, check the local busi-
ness magazines, journals and periodicals, local business newsletters, local 
newspaper, the city directory, manufacturer and business directories, and 
any other useful resources. Each of these has an index that makes it easy to 
research a list of clients in a couple of hours. If you can ’ t find it on the Inter-
net, your friendly local librarian is sure to assist. 
  8.  Once you have gathered all your information, compose a letter to each of 
these clients. Follow these guidelines: 
•  Be certain you are sending the letter to the right person. 
•  Double - check the person ’ s title and spelling of the name. 
•  Focus on the recipient in the first paragraph, and show you know what ’ s 
important to the organization. 
•  In the next one or two paragraphs, connect the recipient to the need for 
consulting services and establish your qualifications. You must customize 
these paragraphs as well. For example, a list of your experiences should 
relate to the recipient ’ s need or industry. If you can ’ t do that yet due to a 
lack of experience, provide your most impressive information to date, but 
relate it to the potential client. 

163
Finding Clients
•  In the final paragraph, tell the person what to expect. Maintain control 
of the process by saying,  “ I will call you within the week to schedule an 
 appointment to  . . . ” 
  9.  Mail your letter, and follow up as promised. 
 I ’ ve used this process for over twenty years with remarkable success. I usually 
find enough information for about half the potential clients I target. Ninety - five 
percent of all recipients are interested enough to speak to me, and more than half 
of them agree to meet me within the month. Of those, half become clients within a 
year. The rest become contacts, resources, or clients in the future because I stay in 
touch with them. 
 You can have this same success rate. And you will find that this is a very posi-
tive way to begin a client - consultant relationship. 
 The Sample Letter is a sample of the type that I use to contact potential 
 clients. Other letters using this same format can be found in the second edition of 
 The Business of Consulting (2007).

Auto Glass Specialists, Inc.

Madison, WI 53713
Dear Mr. Birkhauser:
Auto Glass Specialists is one of Madison’s phenomenons. In just over twenty years 
you have transformed an innovative idea into a successful business spanning five 
states. Your expertise for repairing windows in cars, trucks, and heavy equipment is 
now available in twenty-three locations, with sales pushing $40 million. Strong man-
agement and hard-working employees achieved these results.
At ebb associates we recognize the important role the employee plays in the successful 
growth of any company. Further, we have found that improving employees’ commu-

Finding Clients
 What About the Referrals You ’ ve Received? 
 Do follow up with every referral you receive from friends, family, and colleagues. 
Even if the project is not quite right for you now, the meeting may lead to other 
work in the future. And you may also ask potential clients to refer you to someone 
who might be able to use your services. (This is networking at its finest.) 
 Select one referral right now, and make an appointment to explore possibili-
ties. You will find this meeting helpful in several ways. First, you will get an idea of 
what to expect when you visit a potential client. Second, you will have an opportu-
nity to practice selling your services. Third, you will learn what needs clarification 
as you describe what you do. 
 You Have an Appointment — Now What? 
 Okay, you have an appointment with a client. What do you need to know before 
you go? Be sure you know at least the following: the meeting purpose, who will at-
tend, how long the meeting will last, and exactly where it will be (office, conference 
room, and so forth). What do you do once you get in the door? 
 Your initial meeting is critical. It sets a tone for the rest of your relationship. 
You may come prepared with a PowerPoint presentation, materials in a bound 
folder, and a precisely worded presentation. My preference, however, is to create 
a conversation with the client, learning as much about them as possible. Here ’ s a 
guide that has been successful for me: 
•  Read the client. Take cues from what the client says and does to determine 
whether to make small talk or get right down to business. 
•  Listen for understanding. Read between the lines. 
•  Ask pertinent, thought - provoking questions. Prepare a list of five to ten 
questions based on what you know about the situation. (Some samples are 
provided in the next section.) 
•  Address all meeting attendees by name. Follow your client ’ s lead about 
whether to use a title or first name or surname. 
•  Exude self - confidence without arrogance. 
•  Project a professional image with a firm handshake, appropriate attire, high -
 quality materials, and a genuine interest in the client.

•  How will you be involved in this project? 
•  How will a decision be made about proceeding with this project? 
•  What ’ s the next step? Do you want a proposal? 
 Follow Up After Every Meeting 
 Get in the habit of following up every meeting with a written note thanking the 
prospects for their time. Even if you will submit a proposal, dash off a quick note to 
maintain the momentum of a positive meeting. 
 Remember that you are still in the exploratory mode. Learn as much as you 
can at this stage about potential clients, your selling skills, and what you can do 
better next time. 
 This chapter helped you determine a need and analyze your competition to land 
your first work. You have just experienced your first marketing activities. Chapter 
Nine will expand your market planning.

 Marketing  
 In this chapter you will 
•   Create a marketing plan 
•   Explore creative marketing options on a shoestring budget 
•   Practice a step - by - step process to write a client proposal 
•   Develop a client tracking system  
 What Marketing Is 
 Marketing is how you advertise, publicize, or otherwise inform others of your con-
sulting services and products. Your goal is reached when clients purchase your ser-
vices and products. You may be the best consultant in the world, but until others 
know about you and can purchase what you have to offer, you will not have any 
business. Obviously you cannot just sit back with your stack of business cards and 
wait for the phone to ring. You must market your products and services. You must 
promote yourself. 
 Your first work may be work that your former employer asked you to com-
plete when you left to begin your consulting business. It may be work that you 
obtained through members of your network. But you will not be able to depend on 
people you know to keep you in business. You must reach out to others. The reach-
ing out is your marketing, and your marketing plan will help identify and organize 
how you will accomplish that.

The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
 In Chapter  Eight  you identified your niche. Your niche focuses on two things 
important to your marketing plan. First, it identifies what range of products and 
services you provide. In other words, are you a generalist or a specialist? Second, it 
identifies the range of clients you serve. Do you serve a wide market or a narrow 
market? With this start, you can begin to develop a very simple marketing plan. 
Volumes and volumes have been written about marketing. 
 The ABCs of Marketing 
 Although lots has been written about marketing, it can be as easy as ABC: 
•  Assess your situation. 
• Build a client base. 
• Contact potential clients. 
 Assess Your Situation 
 You started this step in Chapter  Eight  by examining your consulting business from 
an internal and external (clients and competition) perspective. When developing a 
marketing plan, you will explore the discussion about what you offer and to whom 
in more depth. 
 A marketing plan requires that you determine where you are today, where 
you want to be, and what the gap is between these two. For example, you may be 
offering team - building seminars in which you follow up with coaching to senior 
leaders. What you really want to be doing is increasing your coaching services and 
eliminating the team - building seminars. Your marketing plan will take this into 
consideration and create a road map to that end. 
 When you explore your customer base, you may discover that 85 percent of 
your revenues come from government clients. Since they pay lower fees than your 
private industry clients, you may develop a plan to increase the percentage of pri-
vate industry clients. And of course you should always be aware of what your com-
petition is doing. Creating a marketing plan, however, requires you to dedicate time 
to a more thorough examination. 
170

171
Marketing
 Build a Client Base 
 Once you have assessed your situation, you will use the information to create a mar-
keting plan that targets specific clients or groups of clients. You cannot pursue every 
potential client, so you need to make difficult decisions in narrowing your client base. 
 You will place everything into the mix that you have learned in the  “ A ”  step 
about you and your business, your current and potential clients, and your competi-
tors, and look for opportunities. This step will help you identify advertising and 
publicity options to consider, the marketing media you will use, which clients to 
target, and what your budget will be. 
 Contact Potential Clients 
 This third step, the  “ C, ”  is actually the follow - through with regard to your market-
ing plan. This is the sales part of the marketing process. 
 A marketing plan is a failure if sales do not result. And for consultants, there 
is only one time to market: all the time. You are on and marketing no matter where 
you are or what you are doing. 
171
Marketing is a fascinating subject and critical to your success. If you want 
to learn more about marketing, contact your local community college, and 
register for a course. You will not only learn about the marketing basics, but 
you will also be exposed to ideas you will be able to translate to your con-
sulting business. You might also consider buying my book Marketing Your 
Consulting Services. It is jam-packed with a bundle of ideas that work.
Q u i c k
TIP
 Create Your Marketing Plan 
 This section walks you through the ABCs of marketing to create your first 
 marketing plan. 

172
The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
 Your marketing plan must be in writing. A written plan puts discipline into 
your ideas, enables you to measure success, and provides data for future use. 
 In Chapter  Five  you developed a business plan, and one of its sections was 
devoted to a marketing plan. You can use that information now to flesh out the 
marketing plan. 
 Review the eight steps presented here. Then use the questions in the next section 
to build your marketing plan. You will use the information to complete your first  annual 
marketing plan. Have fun! Marketing can be almost as much fun as consulting. 
 Step 1: Analyze the Present 
 Market research should be an ongoing activity, so create a systematic method to 
keep information on client needs up - to - date. If you conduct training as part of 
your consulting, you can easily gather data through evaluations at the end of the 
training session. Other methods you might consider are mailed questionnaires, 
telephone surveys, electronic surveys, or face - to - face interviews. 
 You want to know how you are perceived in the marketplace, whether you 
meet your clients ’  expectations, whether you project the image you desire, and 
whether you have the reputation you desire. 
 If you have been in business for over a year, complete this analysis by calling 
several of your clients to obtain information. For absolutely honest feedback, you 
will have to conduct anonymous research. If you are just starting out, analyze what 
you expect to happen over the next twelve months. 
 Step 2: Clarify Your Strategy 
 Clarify where your business is heading. You have created your niche in lots of detail. 
Examine what you stated as your niche in Chapter  Eight . 
 Here you will describe your targeted client base and what you will offer them.  
 Step 3: Set Measurable Six - to Twelve - Month Goals 
 You know the value of goal setting. Set your goals here. Be specific, and write them 
so that they are measurable. Add time limits to them so you can tell whether you 
172

173
Marketing
accomplished your goals in a timely manner. Your goals should be results oriented, 
not activity based. Here are some examples: 
•  Generate $400,000 in new business from July 1 to January 3. 
•  Acquire three new clients by February 28. 
•  Acquire one new client in the banking industry by February 28. 
•  Present at one new conference in the next calendar year 
 Step 4: Select Marketing Tactics to Accomplish Your Goals 
 Tactics are actions you will take to get the word out that you are in business. Mar-
keting experts often divide these tactics into a number of categories. Sometimes 
marketing is divided into direct and indirect marketing methods. Direct meth-
ods include things such as telemarketing, direct mail, magazine advertising, and 
 directory advertising. Indirect marketing methods include such activities as public 
speaking, seminars, professional affiliations, writing books and articles, public rela-
tions, and newsletters. 
 Marketing is also divided into advertising and promotion. The differentia-
tion by some is that advertising is paid for and promotion is free. All of these items 
qualify as ways to get the word out. 
 We are not going to concern ourselves about whether your tactics are direct 
or indirect, advertising or promotion, or any other category. You just need to begin 
to think about actions you will take to get the word out. Examples include the 
 following: 
 • Make twenty - five contacts in the banking industry. 
•  Submit proposals to at least three new conferences. 
•  Submit an article to  Banking Today. 
 Step 5: Identify Resources 
 There is always a cost to marketing, whether you take out a four - color full - page ad 
in a professional journal or write a letter to the editor in your local paper. The ad 
may cost $10,000 and little of your time if you hire a marketing firm to develop it. 
173

174
The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
The letter may be less than a dollar for a stamp, paper, and an envelope, but six 
hours of your time to craft it. You must weigh the cost and the benefits to deter-
mine whether the investment makes sense to you. How many people will see the ad? 
How many will see the letter? How many of these people will be members of your 
niche market? What are the chances of one person responding to your action? 
 Besides time and money, your resources could also be people. If you are tar-
geting a specific industry, for example, you could have a booth at the industry ’ s 
conference, take an ad out in its journal, or take someone you know in the industry 
to lunch to brainstorm ideas for approaching organizations within the industry. 
 Step 6: Develop an Annual Marketing Activity Calendar 
 Your marketing activities will be more appealing if you break them down into 
smaller steps. For example, if your goal is to have one new client in a particular 
industry within the next six months, the steps to reach that goal might look some-
thing like this: 
• Ask Wisconsin staff to help identify ten possible clients by July 5. 
•  Gather information about the organizations by July 15. 
 • Brainstorm potential mailing content with Katrina. 
•  Send first mailing by August 5. 
•  Complete follow - up calls by August 15. 
 • Send follow - up mailing with article by September 5. 
•  Arrange meetings by October 5. 
 A layout for your marketing calendar is provided in the next section. 
 Step 7: Implement Your Plan 
 If you have developed your plan, you need to be faithful about implementing it. 
Don ’ t get behind. Even when you ’ re too busy to market, you must market. There 
will be times when you are busy with a big project and your desire will be to com-
plete the project and skip the marketing. The problem is that when the big proj-
ect is completed, you may not have another project to be busy with! The time to 
174

175
Marketing
 market is all the time. And the most important time to market is when you are too 
busy to market. 
 Step 8: Monitor Your Results and Adjust as Needed 
 Your plan is your best guess at the moment. You may need to adjust it as changes 
occur, perhaps in the economy or in the industry you have targeted. Perhaps you 
targeted small nonprofits and realize that their decision - making process is too long 
for you. Therefore, you may need to add some larger for - profits to your mix to 
 decrease the gaps you have between projects. 
 Whatever is happening, you will use this information as input to the analysis 
you conduct for your plan next year.

lish the results; you could interview a well - respected person at a conference; you 
could be interviewed by a newspaper about your specialty; you could interview a 
university professor and send a transcript or a CD (with permission of course) to 
potential clients; you could interview your clients ’  customers and include the infor-
mation in your proposal. 
 Now it ’ s your turn. Consider all of the possibilities, and make up your own. 
Then decide on at least fifteen that are a fit for your clients, your budget, and your

 Step 7: Implement Your Plan 
 How will you ensure that you complete everything on your calendar every month? 
 How will you reward yourself for completing your marketing activities? 
Would you like to have your marketing plan developed for free? Most 
business schools require marketing students to develop a marketing plan. 
You could be the recipient. Contact your local college’s business school to 
learn who the marketing instructors are. Then contact them. To  ensure that 
this is not only free but also valuable, do two things. First, allow enough 
time. It will be a long process, usually occurring over almost a full semester. 
Second, stay involved. Your input will be critical to provide correct data. 
Your involvement will more than likely increase the enthusiasm of the 
 student. A side benefit may be getting feedback from the professor.

 Marketing on a Shoestring Budget 
 Start - up costs are always more than most of us can predict. What are some ideas for 
marketing when your revenues are less than you would like? 
 The process that yields the best results dollar for dollar has already been pre-
sented to you. Return to Chapter  Eight , and review the nine - step plan for landing your 
first clients. That plan has worked over and over for me. Here are some other ideas: 
•  If you are planning to attend a conference, submit a proposal to speak. Often 
the conference sponsor will pay your registration if you speak. 
•  Make certain you always project a high - quality image through your statio-
nery, business cards, and the letters you write. Cheap cards or sloppy letters 
may cost much more than expensive stationery. 
•  Cards, letters, and telephone calls cost little as compared to an ad in a jour-
nal or the newspaper, and they can be personalized. Quite honestly, save 

187
Marketing
your money — my experience has been that ads in journals, newspapers, or 
the yellow pages don ’ t pull their weight in customers. 
•  Look for listings in consulting directories that are free or low cost. 
•  Pass out business cards freely. They are a great bargain, so be sure you have 
taken the time to word them perfectly and to get the perfect look. 
•  Offer to speak to civic organizations, and be sure to take your business cards 
with you. 
•  Do such a great job that your clients market for you. 
 For 113 other marketing ideas, see the list beginning on page 114 in the sec-
ond edition of  The Business of Consulting. 
 What About a Web Site? 
 Web sites are almost as common as a telephone number these days. And you can lo-
cate people everywhere who are willing to help you design your site. When market-
ing, you will often be asked,  “ Do you have a Web site? ”  If you do, it provides people 
with an easy way to get information about you and your consulting business. 
 To be sure your Web site projects your preferred image, hire a highly qualified 
Web designer to assist you. Review other Web sites the individual has designed, and 
be sure the person is a good communicator. Sometimes you will not know exactly 
what you want until you see a proposal. A good designer, that is, one who listens 
well, will be able to interpret what you want into a Web site that represents you and 
your consulting business accurately. 
 Ask for references, and establish a range of the design cost as well as what features 
that design will encompass. The initial design may be between two thousand and ten 
thousand dollars, depending on how many bells and whistles you want to include. 
 Your Web site should be effective but simple. Don ’ t allow the designer to make 
it so complex that it takes a long time to download. Be sure it is easy to maneuver 
and to locate information that is important to clients and potential clients. There is 
always an urge to do something creative and different, and I applaud you for that. 
But take care that your Web site is not so different from others that your clients 
have difficulty finding the information that they need. You don ’ t want one of their 
first experiences with you to be frustrating! 

188
The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
 Develop a Web site with which people can interact by including a quiz, a self -
 assessment, or a puzzle. Customize the site to meet the needs of clients who might 
visit. Ask yourself,  “ What would potential clients be likely to want to find on my 
Web site? ”  Begin with a page that defines your company and the kind of work you 
do. You may wish to add a client list, samples of your materials, or a descriptive 
list of services and products you provide. Ensure that potential clients can e - mail 
you while visiting your site and ask your designer how you could capture names of 
interested visitors for follow - up. 
 Many people forget that individuals sometimes go to a Web site to find other 
ways to contact people or to determine where a business is located. Therefore, don ’ t 
forget to include a telephone number, the address where your business is located, 
and its mail addresses if it is different from the street address. 
 Select a URL for the Web site that is easy to remember and makes sense to 
potential clients. Using your corporate name is the easiest. 
 Once you have a Web page, print the address on your business cards, statio-
nery, pamphlets, and anywhere else it will be useful. Remember that the  Internet 
is not intended to broadcast your message like other marketing media. Instead, 
you need to publish your Web site address so clients can find you and your 
 information. 
 Finally, maintain your Web site regularly. Visit it often and respond to e - mails 
and other requests within twenty - four hours. If you have a calendar posted, keep it 
up to date and refresh your Web site every month or two. 
Launching your Web site is a perfect excuse to contact your clients and 
market to them. Once your site is up and all the bugs are worked out, 
contact your clients and potential clients to obtain feedback about the site.

 Write Winning Proposals 
 Proposals will become an integral part of your business development strategy. A 
proposal may be the last step in the sales process — a statement that summarizes 
how you have defined and clarified your prospective client ’ s needs. At other times, 
it may be the first step in a bidding or an introductory process. In either case, it 
takes time to write a good proposal. 
 The secret to writing winning proposals is to listen carefully to the client and 
take good notes or, in the case of a Request for Proposal (RFP), read the informa-
tion carefully and highlight important information. Give the speaker or the writer 
back exactly what is asked for. If they ask for a  “ corrective measures ”  design and you 
know that they mean  “ progressive discipline, ”  use their words anyway. It is amaz-
ing to me how many people speak their own language in a proposal instead of the 
language that the client uses. Maybe your words are more descriptive or more ap-
propriate, but if the client must translate your proposal before making a decision, 
your proposal will be near the bottom of the stack. Use their words, and you will 
be surprised at how often you hear clients say,  “ How did you know? That ’ s exactly 
what we need! ” 
 Steps to Writing a Proposal 
 A proposal is simply a statement of who will do what by when and for how much. 
Follow these steps when writing a proposal: 
  1.  Gather as much information as you can before beginning to write. You 
might use the questions in Chapter  Eight ( “ What to Ask Potential Clients ” ) 
to gather some of the data. 
  2.  Plan a structure that will be easy for your clients to find their way around. 
You may develop your own proposal structure, but the one that is presented 
here will serve you well. It includes a purpose statement, a description of 
the situation, a proposed approach, a time line, your qualifications, and the 
 investment (cost) required to complete the plan. 
   3.   Complete each section writing from your client ’ s perspective, using your client ’ s 
words and language. Be certain your writing is clear, concise, and  descriptive.  

190
The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
  4.  If the RFP allows it, stay in touch with the client. Sometimes if the RFP is com-
petitive, as is the case in many government RFPs, you are not allowed to speak 
to the client. If that is not the case, you can clarify information to avoid making 
assumptions, gather information you may have missed in earlier conversations, 
or test any creative options. Certainly you would not want to call every day and 
make a pest of yourself. Nevertheless, staying in touch, done well, can help to 
maintain rapport and confirm that you care and want to do a good job.  
  5.  Have someone read your proposal to check for typos, clarity, accuracy, and 
understanding. 
  6.  Print the proposal on the best paper that you have. Attach any supplemental 
material, add a cover to the front, place it in a folder, and either hand - deliver 
it or send it in an overnight package. 
 Writing the Proposal 
 Return to one of the clients you met with in Chapter  Eight , and write your first 
proposal. Use the following guidelines to begin to sketch out your answers and 
information here. 
 Cover Page.  Include the name of the proposal ( “ A Proposal Prepared for  [Company 
Name] ” ), the date, your company name, and contact information. 
 Purpose Statement.  Open with a statement something like this fill - in - the - blank 
model: 
“ This proposal is submitted at the request of (name), (title), (company).” 
 It includes a description of the situation, a suggested approach, a time line, 
and the expected investment for the effort. 
 Write your purpose statement in the space provided:

  Description of the situation.  Discuss the situation as it currently exists. You may 
include the current problem, the current need, the desire for the future, or any 
other pertinent data. Note here some of the specifics of the situation you might 
include in the proposal: 
 A proposed approach.  This is where you describe exactly what you will do to ac-
complish the task. What is special about your approach? To make this section easier 
to understand, you may divide it into subsections and present them in the order 
that they will occur — for example, Data Gathering, Design, Content, Implementa-
tion, and Follow - Up. Make some notes about what you might include: 
 Time line.  A time line is exactly what it sounds like. You will need to determine the 
level of detail you will include. It is always good to include specific dates. You can 
just list the dates down the left side and the tasks next to the dates. You may also 
present this information as a graphic picture.

 Your qualifications.  This is optional. You may choose to include a paragraph 
about why you are uniquely qualified to complete this project. You may also choose 
to attach a biographical sketch or your r é sum é , whichever is appropriate for the 
industry. 
 Investment and responsibilities.  Use the word  investment  instead of  price  or  cost. 
It will help your clients focus on your proposals as something that will benefit 
them rather than just  “ cost ”  them. I also include some of the key responsibilities 
required to complete the plan in this section. When tied to the investment, it makes 
an impressive package that says,  “ Look at all you ’ re getting! ” Responsibilities might 
include materials you will supply and actual work you will complete, such as inter-
views, specific sessions you will lead, and so on. State travel arrangements also. List 
the investment and responsibilities for your proposal here: 
 I close in this way:   
 Your investment for (name of consultation) will be ($). In addition, travel will 
be billed at cost. 
 The terms of this proposal are effective through (date). 
 Executive - level references are available. 

193

 Attachments.  Attachments may be included as an appendix to your proposal. They 
should be added only if they enhance the proposal. Attachments could include any 
or all of these items: 
•  Biographical sketches of the individuals who will work on the project 
•  A description of your company 
•  A client list 
•  Any related materials 
 Now turn to your computer and begin to enter a draft of your first proposal. 
 A proposal can also be written in a letter format. If you do that, it will be 
shorter and perhaps less formal. Use a formal letter format, with subheads within 
the letter ’ s body. You can find a sample proposal in this format on page 138 in the 
book I coauthored with Linda B. Swindling,  The Consultant ’ s Legal Guide. 
Keep a file of all your proposals. You’ll be surprised to see the quality in 
each improve. In the future, you may even be able to use sections from 
one proposal for another.
Q u i c k
TIP
 Track Your Clients 
  “ Track my clients? ”  you might be asking,  “ Why? I don ’ t have any yet! ”  But you will! 
And with all the balls you will need to keep in the air, it ’ s never too soon. Start track-
ing clients with the first contact you make. You will be surprised at how easily you 
forget what one client said or when you promised to follow up with a telephone call. 
 Completing the eight - step marketing plan in this chapter ensures that you 
have thought through how you will get the word out about your services. It will 
help you stay focused and committed to ongoing marketing of your services.

 Tips to Become a Better Marketer 
 Remember that your business depends on your ability to continually bring in new 
business. Here are a few tips to become better at marketing. Attend to those that 
make sense for you. 
•  Learn to spot an opportunity when you hear it. Then grab it with gusto, and 
do something about it! 
•  Before you call on a prospective client, obtain a copy of the organizational 
chart listing all key people, and learn something about the organization ’ s 
history and current culture. 
•  Develop name recognition within your industry by speaking at conferences, 
writing articles, and volunteering for your professional organization. 
•  Listen, listen, listen. Listen to what your potential clients say as well as what 
they do not say during a marketing call. 
•  Stay in touch with people as they move from one job to another, and turn 
reconnecting into a marketing opportunity. 
•  Develop relationships with those people whom you believe will be the next 
leaders of the organization. 
•   Market all the time. Make marketing a mind - set. 
•   Buy and read my book  Marketing Your Consulting Services for hundreds of 
other ideas as practical as these.

 In this chapter you will 
•   Identify a plan to take care of your mental and physical health 
•   Establish a plan to manage your time 
•   Establish good habits for managing a business 
•   Establish a plan to balance your life 
•   Develop a personal ethics statement for operating your business  
 Take Care of Your Health 
 Many people I meet think of consulting as an exciting, high - powered career: flying 
from coast to coast, meeting with publishers in San Francisco and executives in New 
York City, staying at the Madison in Washington, D.C., or the Ritz Carlton in Dallas, 
eating at a coffee shop in Seattle. I am paid well, dress well, land large contracts, and 
hobnob with the influential. But that ’ s only the first layer. 
 My friends know what my life is really like: up at 4:00 a.m. to catch a flight 
for a noon meeting, spending six hours in an airport because of delayed flights, 
canceling dinner plans, and finally arriving home at midnight. It is also about eat-
ing poorly prepared restaurant food, writing proposals until the wee hours of the 
10

morning, and losing a contract due to a technicality. Most of all, it is about long 
hours. 
 You do have the freedom to set your own schedule — but often those hours are 
long. You will make enough money to eat well. And it will take a concerted effort to 
do so when you ’ re on the road. 
 Identify how you will continue to maintain a healthy lifestyle by answering 
these questions: 
 What was your exercise routine before becoming a consultant (or, What is the 
ideal exercise routine you ’ d like to start)? How will you ensure that you get regular 
 exercise? 
 What eating habits do you want to maintain? What new eating habits do you want 
to start? How will you do this while traveling?

 What kinds of things have caused stress for you in the past? What stress reducers 
have you used that work? What is your plan to prevent stress as a consultant? 
 Manage Your Time 
 We all have exactly twenty - four hours in every day. And while we all talk about sav-
ing time, we really cannot. Time continues to march on. We can ’ t save it. We can, 
however, shave time. Here are some time - shaving tips for you. Then we ’ ll explore 
your greatest time waster. 
 The Big Jobs 
 Work on several large projects rather than dozens of small projects. You use a great 
deal of time traveling from one client to another, remembering names, and getting 
up to speed on the project. This means that you must use a marketing strategy that 
ensures that you acquire larger projects rather than smaller ones. 
 Invoice Ease 
 Keep an invoice format on your computer for clients who will incur repeat billings. 
When it ’ s time to bill them, simply complete the date and the invoice amount and 
print it out. 
201

The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
 Tickler Files 
 Keep tickler files by month in your desk drawer or on your computer desktop. Place 
items in them that need attention in each particular month. When you pull the file for 
each month, you will be reminded of what needs to be completed. For example, when 
I pull the May file, I have written items under both personal and business. Personal: 
Annual checkup, call to initiate lawn mowing, and clean air conditioner. Business: 
Renew lease, submit corporation minutes, and pay ASTD dues. On the inside of that 
folder I also have a list of everyone I know who has a birthday in May. 
 As you continue to consult, you will acquire your own time shavers. To truly 
identify how you spend your time, you will need to keep a Time Management Log, 
like the one shown here. The log will give you the data you need to identify where 
you could manage your time better. Keep the log for a week or two. You may be very 
surprised at where your time goes. 
 For example, the last time I kept a time log, I was surprised to learn that when 
I am in the office, I spend almost half of my time on the telephone, either talking or 
calling and leaving messages for people who aren ’ t available. Related to this, I found 
that waiting for someone to return my call was delaying the start of some projects. 
Was it any wonder that I could not get proposals written while I was in the office? 
I initiated two things as a result of reviewing this information. First, I work out of 
my home office when I have large projects such as proposals or writing a book. Sec-
ond, I have my staff tell people when I will be available for phone calls — Thursday 
between 10:00 a.m. and noon, for example. It has shaved quite a bit of time for me 
and I am able to do my priorities in a more timely manner.

 Looking for more time? You ’ ll never find time for everything. You must make 
it. The following list of time management techniques will not be new to you. But 
remind yourself of those that you could practice more diligently. Check the box 
next to the ones you could do better: 
  Set your priorities first thing in the morning or the last thing at night for 
the next day. 
 Do your top A priorities first. 
 Tackle large projects in stages. 
       Identify your best times, that is, your best time for writing, best time to 
make telephone calls, and so forth. 
       Use your waiting and travel time productively: make lists, listen to tapes, 
balance your checkbook. 
 Carry notecards or a small notebook to list ideas or reminders. 
 Handle each piece of paper only once. 
 Have a place for everything. 
 Set deadlines. 
 Make decisions in a timely way. Indecision is a time thief. 
 Always ask,  “ Is this the best use of my time right now? ” 
 Set a schedule, and stick to it. 
 Take short breaks often. 
 Have something to do when you ’ re put on hold. 
 Become a great communicator. 
 Minimize interruptions. 
 As a business owner, time is your most precious resource. Manage it well, and 
guard it jealously. Once it is gone, you will never get it back.

 Establish Good Habits 
 What better time to start new habits — good habits — than when starting a business? 
Good habits will make your business run more smoothly, ensuring you are making 
the best use of your time. They may seem like little things, but they will turn up as 
critical sooner or later. New habits can begin when you want them to begin. Here 
are a few that are worth starting now: 
•  Create a good filing system. Chapter  Seven addressed the good filing habits 
you could initiate. Go back to that chapter, and review them before reading 
about other good habits. 
•   Add copyrights to all original documents. More than once I ’ ve found my 
original work floating around in an organization or being used by another 
consultant. I have always been willing to share, but I like to be asked. If I have 
put my copyright on something, I know there was some effort expended in 
cutting it off, whiting it out, or taping over it. If your integrity is ever ques-
tioned, a dated copyright on your material protects you and your work.  
•  Bill all completed work immediately. One of the best favors you can do for 
your cash flow is to send the invoice to your client within twenty - four hours 
of completing the project. Your bank statement will thank you. 
205
Before you leave this section, pull out your day planner or calendar, and 
do a quick assessment on how you have spent your time so far this week. 
What does it tell you? Are you doing the things that will get you to the 
goals you identified in Chapter Two? What changes might you make? Do 
you have any bad habits that will be difficult to overcome? For example, 
do you like to talk on the phone, do you spend more time with the daily 
crossword puzzle in the morning than you want, or do you procrastinate 
when faced with big projects?
Q u i c k

•  Make follow - up with clients your top priority. Seems logical, doesn ’ t it? You 
will be surprised at how many things can come between you and a simple 
return telephone call. Time gets away from me in the afternoon. All too soon 
it ’ s 3:30, whoops! 4:30 on the East Coast — too late to return that call. Don ’ t 
let it happen. 
•  Date everything. Someday you will look through a file, find just what you 
wanted, and pat yourself on the back for a good filing system, only to find 
out that the survey was dated August — that ’ s it. Just  “ August. ” August what? 
The most important number has been left off. It ’ s happened to me many 
more times than I care to mention. 
 What good habits do you want to start with this business? List them here: 
 Balance Your Life 
 One of the most challenging aspects of being a consultant is finding balance. While 
I do not profess to have the answer, I do have some suggestions to offer. 
206

207
Surviving the First Year
 Identify Any Imbalance 
 Identify what seems to be out of balance in your life. How do you know? Geoff Bell-
man, author of  The Consultant ’ s Calling  (2002), uses this exercise in his sessions. 
List three things you value most in your life. Write them here: 
  1.  
  2.  
  3.  
 Now scan your checkbook and your calendar. Do your checkbook and calendar 
indicate that those are the most valuable things in your life? If not, determine what 
you can do about it. Write your ideas here. 
 Make Your Own Rules 
 Make up rules that help you maintain your balance. Create rules that help put your 
business in perspective. Tell yourself,  “ If it ’ s not done by 6:00 p.m., it can wait until 
tomorrow. ”  I sometimes spend too much time fretting about a decision on the 
207

208
The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
horizon that won ’ t occur for days, weeks, or months. I have learned to put it out of 
my mind by setting a date with myself:  “ I ’ ll think about that on November 13, ”  and 
then I do. Perhaps your rule is,  “ My number one business rule is to spend Saturday 
morning with my children. ” 
 What rules can you make to help you add more balance to your life? List two 
here: 
  1.  
  2.  
 Enjoy the Doing 
 Don ’ t overload yourself so much that you miss the fun in the doing. If you like 
consulting, enjoy all of it. Much of the pleasure is in the doing. 
 Are you enjoying what you are doing? How will you ensure that you enjoy all of it?  
 Take Time Off 
 It ’ s important to take a break from your business. Go on a vacation. Go to a day spa. 
Spend an afternoon reading a book. Visit a state park. Take your niece on a picnic. 
Go for a walk around the block.

 Take Advantage of Being Your Own Boss 
 If you work at home, find ways and times to get away from it all. Go for a walk; work 
out at the gym a couple of days each week; eat lunch in your backyard. If you work in 
an office, stay home a couple of days each month and work on your deck. 
 How can you take advantage of being your own boss? 
 Manage Your Balance 
 Issues of balance are more acute during transitions. So if you are going 
through your transition to consulting, you should know what to expect. 
 How might balance shift initially in the various areas of your life, and what do 
you want to do to maintain balance? 
 Social? 
 Family?

 Spiritual?

 Did You Hear the One About the Consultant  . . . ? 
Developing a Personal Ethics Statement 
 These days there are almost as many consultant jokes as lawyer jokes. As a consul-
tant, your principles are always on the line. What do you stand for? 
 Begin to identify a list of the ethical standards you will uphold as a consultant. 
This list will grow as your business grows. Your ethics should be those things you 
feel deeply about and believe are the foundation of who you are. 
 You might create ethical statements around some of the following: 
•  Kinds of projects you will accept 
•  How you use your time 
•  The quality of your work 
•  Kinds of organizations you will work with 
•  Delivery of services 
•  How you treat your clients 
•  Continuous improvement issues 
•  Goals for your clients 
•  Work standards 
•  Pricing 
•  How you deal with expenses 
•  Anything else you feel strongly about 
 Begin your statement of ethics here. Transfer it to a place where you will see it regu-
larly. Update it as you and your business grow. 
 Although this book focuses on developing a consulting practice, you must be cer-
tain to work toward a balanced life as well.

 Assess Your Progress 
 Congratulations! You ’ ve made it though your first year of consulting. And if you are 
reading this chapter, you must be considering moving forward. Great! 
 Let ’ s assess your progress and plan your next steps. Take some time to answer 
the following questions, which address your first year in consulting. 
 Is consulting all that you had dreamed it would be? Why or why not?

The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
 How satisfied do you think your clients are? How do you know? 
 How successful have you been financially? 
 How much fun are you having? 
 Now compare your responses to some of these thoughts: 
  Is consulting all that you dreamed it would be?  People often see consulting as a 
dream job. You most likely have learned the realities of the business. Travel isn ’ t 
as glamorous as it first appears. Working at home without someone to talk to gets 
216

217
So, Now What? Year Two and Beyond
lonely, and clients who don ’ t pay their bills in a timely manner can wreak havoc on 
your savings account. All in all, though, it is a great way to make a living. You have 
freedom and flexibility to do it your way. Your first year is always the most difficult. 
There is so much to learn! I hope you made some money and had some fun too. 
  How satisfied do you think your clients are? How do you know?  If this is to 
 continue to be your profession, you need lots of very satisfied customers who 
will continue to use you, will recommend you to other clients, and will sing your 
praises. You have probably had conversations with many of them asking about your 
services and what you could do better. Stay in touch with all of these clients. Create 
mailing lists — electronic, as well as a postal mail list — so that you can run labels 
easily to keep them informed of what you are doing. These clients will be your cus-
tomer base for the rest of the time you are in business. Some will use you again and 
again. Some will refer you over and over to many others. 
  How successful have you been financially?  How are you doing? You should be 
able to begin to pay back some of those loans you took out during year one. If not, 
it might be time to take a hard look at your numbers. Are expenses higher than 
you anticipated? Is that due to not having all the data for good estimates? Or are you 
being more extravagant than a start - up company should be? In either case, there is 
an important lesson for you. If expenses are not higher, is income lower than you 
projected? Why is that? How would you rate your marketing efforts? Are you mar-
keting  “ all the time ” ? You need to make money to stay in business. 
  How much fun are you having?  Or, as my friend Pam says,  “ Are we having fun 
yet? ”  Remember my comment in Chapter  One :  “ We should not get up to go to 
work in the morning. We should be able to get up and go to play! ”  Consulting can 
be play. The transition to get there may be difficult for everyone involved. Are you 
still going through some of the transition trials? If so, do you see an end in sight? 
Are the people around you having fun too? Do you hear pride in their voices when 
they discuss what you are doing? Pay attention to that balance because it ’ s critical. 
Is consulting as much fun as you expected?

 Plan Your Next Steps 
 Spend time thinking about your next steps. Let ’ s examine them from your profes-
sional perspective, your financial perspective, and your personal perspective. 
 Professional 
 You will most likely learn more during your first year of consulting than at almost any 
other time in your life. This past year has also been a time that tested your capabilities 
as they have never been tested before. Go back and read Chapter  One  in this guide. 
You might be surprised at the new meaning that all of those words have now. 
 What do you still need to learn this year about running your business? Do you need 
to know more about organizing yourself and your office? If you knew more about 
marketing, would that task be more fun? How about finance? Are you as good at 
crunching those numbers and knowing what they are telling you? How about pro-
cess improvement? Do you know how to determine the root cause when something 
goes wrong and address that to prevent it from occurring again? How are your 
administrative skills? Thinking about getting some help so that you can be more 
productive on other things? What is your plan for learning what you need? 
219

220
The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
 You owe it to your clients to stay on top of all that is happening in the field. What did 
you do this past year to maintain your skills, knowledge, and expertise? What will you 
do next year? What professional organizations will you join? What professional 
 journals will you read? What conferences will you attend? 
 How well have you maintained your network of professionals for support and 
growth? What can you do this next year to give your network a boost? 
 Financial 
 Take a good look at your numbers for the past year and determine the following: 
•  Was your income as high as you projected? 
•  Were your expenses at the level you projected? 
•  Did you have lots of highs and lows over the year? 
•  Were you able to pay yourself the salary you planned? 
220

221
So, Now What? Year Two and Beyond
 Profit 
 Profit is the reason businesses exist, and it doesn ’ t just happen; you must plan for 
it. (Remember your business plan?) As a good business owner, you should plan to 
have more profits than if you simply put that same investment away and let it grow 
interest. How much is a good profit? Since you can probably make 10 percent inter-
est by investing your money, that is a place to begin. 
 You should consider your first year in business a smashing success if you were 
able to pay yourself the salary you intended. Your second year, however, should find 
you planning for a profit. Your goal should be to pay yourself a good salary and in 
addition begin to have a 10 to 30 percent profit on top of that every year. Profit is 
what is left over after all the expenses are paid. You will pay taxes on that profit. 
 How do you begin to manage your business to increase profits? There are 
many things that go into the formula. To increase profits you can: 
•  Increase the number of billable days 
• Increase the price of your services 
•  Decrease expenses 
 You also must consider the following: 
 • If you increase your price, will you continue to sell as much? 
•  How will your clients respond to a higher price? 
•   Could you increase quality or the value added for a client to justify a higher price?  
•  How do your prices compare now to your competitors ’ prices? 
 Review Your Niche 
 How did you do with your marketing this year? Could you have done more to get 
the word out about you and the services you offer? Perhaps you should broaden 
your niche. How could you do that? Here are some ways: 
•  You could broaden the services and products you offer to existing clients. 
•  You could attract new customers — perhaps broadening the customer base 
niche that you have defined. 
221

222
The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
•  You could expand your line of products and services. Any of the following 
could become legitimate consulting profit centers: 
•  Write a newsletter for profit (rather than as a marketing tool) .
•  Sell CDs or DVDs of your presentations. 
•  Write and sell a book, though my experience is that you must self - publish 
to truly make money. 
•  Host public seminars. 
•  Produce and sell directories. 
•  Become a public speaker. Join the National Speakers Association (NSA) if 
this is one of your choices. 
 In the end, there are really only two things you can do differently to change 
your financial situation: 
•  Bring in more income. 
•  Allow fewer expenses. 
 But you have a multitude of ways to do both. 
 Although first - year businesses rarely produce a profit, you should plan for a 
profit during your second year. How will you increase profits next year? 
 Personal 
 How well have you taken care of yourself? How well did you take care of your men-
tal and physical health? Were you able to get the same exercise that you enjoyed 
before you became a consultant? How ’ s your stress level? Were you able to keep all

So, Now What? Year Two and Beyond
the balls in the air and still feel sane? How ’ s the diet? If you had a home office, were 
you able to resist the refrigerator? What are your plans for next year? 
 How did you do at managing your time? Only worked a few weekends? That ’ s great. 
Did you take a family vacation this year? If not, are you planning one soon? 
 Have you been able to maintain a balance? Have you found time for friends, family, and 
hobbies, in addition to time for work? Would you change that balance if you could? 
223

The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
 Have you enjoyed the benefits of being your own boss? Perhaps you were able to 
 attend your daughter ’ s first dance recital at three in the afternoon. Perhaps you 
were able to work ten to midnight when no one bothers you and sleep in the next 
day. Perhaps you ’ ve been able to read your professional journals in the neighbor-
hood park. Perhaps you ’ ve been able to spend all afternoon reading business books 
and sipping coffee in your local bookstore. Can you take greater advantage of the 
benefits of being your own boss next year? 
 Have you seen how the financial gains can support you and your family? Did you 
provide all the benefits that you would have had if you were someone ’ s employee? 
If not, this is the time to review them and decide what you want to do. Did your 
retirement contribution suffer because you were starting your business? Now is the 
time to boost that up.   
224

225
So, Now What? Year Two and Beyond
 Bring It All Together 
 I ’ ve presented several new directions for you to consider. How do you bring it all 
together? First go back to Chapter  Two  and examine your goals. Are you closer to 
your goals than you were a year ago? Have your goals changed? How will new or 
adjusted goals affect your consulting business? Explain here. 
 Assuming you will continue your consulting business, begin to complete the fol-
lowing questions and tasks. Check off each as you complete it: 
 Review all of your financial statements. Examine your revenue projections for 
next year, your budget, and your expense records. What changes will you make 
for next year? 
 Evaluate your cash flow situation. Do you bill immediately on completion of a 
project? Do your clients pay you in a timely manner? If this is less than satisfac-
tory, develop a process that will increase the chances of their paying you faster. 
Describe the process you will use next year.

The Consultant’s Quick Start Guide, Second Edition
 Review your pricing structure. Should you charge more? Less? Should you have 
different levels of pricing for different clients? For different services? Should 
you expand your services or your products? Make a decision about your pricing 
structure for next year. 
 Review your business plan. Although you should have referred to it regularly 
throughout the year, now study it more carefully. Are you wiser about your 
competition than you were last year? What do you still need to learn? Rate 
your progress on your goals. What new goals will you set for next year? 
 Review your relationship with your accountant, attorney, banker, and insurance 
representative. Are you satisfied? What services would you like that you are not 
receiving? Is it time to meet with any of them to evaluate services? What changes 
do you want next year?

So, Now What? Year Two and Beyond

 Review your client relationships. Are your clients beginning to refer you to other 
clients? Have you completed all projects with high marks of satisfaction? If you 
had any difficulties, are you satisfied that you have dealt with the root cause to 
ensure it doesn ’ t occur again? What will you do differently next year? 
 Review your marketing plan. Did you achieve your goals? What will you change 
for next year? Will you increase your marketing budget? What clients can you 
tap for referrals? How will you market your business differently next year? 
 Review the location of your office. Are you still satisfied? Running out of room? 
Wearing out your welcome at home? Is your business intruding on your home 
life? Is your home life intruding on your business? Is the image of working out 
of your house an issue for your clients? For you? If you move, how will you 
 ensure a smooth transition? Where will your office be located next year?

 How about employees? Are you considering hiring them now? Who? To fulfill 
what roles? Where will they work? Where will you find them? When will you 
bring them in? Will they be full time or part time? Will they be employees or 
subcontractors? Be sure to check the Internal Revenue Service ’ s independent 
contractor guidelines and discuss this with your attorney. How will you make 
this a reality next year? 
 Look far out to five or ten years from now. What do you see yourself doing? How 
will your consulting practice look at that time? How and when will you leave the 
business? Sell it? Leave it to your child? Slip out the back door? What can you do 
next year to move in the direction of your future ten years from now? 
 Did you take care of yourself this year? Remember that your business is nothing 
without you. You are the business. How well did you manage your time, deal with 
stress, take care of your health? How well did you balance your life? What will 
you do differently next year?

So, Now What? Year Two and Beyond
 This chapter has been a review of your progress to date. It should have given 
you reason to pause and consider what you did well, what needs improvement, and 
what you might do differently next year. 
 Consulting is a challenging yet rewarding profession. You will work harder 
than you ever have before, yet love the work more than any other. It can be risky, 
yet the payoffs are worth it. 
 If you ’ ve worked your way through this Quick Start Guide, you ’ ve  “ wished on 
paper, ” and now you have a plan!

Pfeiffer Publications Guide
This guide is designed to familiarize you with the various types of Pfeiffer  publications. 
The formats section describes the various types of products that we publish; the method-
ologies section describes the many different ways that content might be provided within 
a product. We also provide a list of the topic areas in which we publish.
FORMATS
In addition to its extensive book-publishing program, Pfeiffer offers content in an array of 
formats, from fieldbooks for the practitioner to complete, ready-to-use training packages 
that support group learning.
FIELDBOOK Designed to provide information and guidance to practitioners in the midst of 
action. Most fieldbooks are companions to another, sometimes earlier, work, from which its ideas 
are derived; the fieldbook makes practical what was theoretical in the original text. Fieldbooks 
can certainly be read from cover to cover. More likely, though, you’ll find yourself bouncing 
around following a particular theme, or dipping in as the mood, and the situation, dictate.
HANDBOOK A contributed volume of work on a single topic, comprising an eclectic mix 
of ideas, case studies, and best practices sourced by practitioners and experts in the field.
 
An editor or team of editors usually is appointed to seek out contributors and to evalu-
ate content for relevance to the topic. Think of a handbook not as a ready-to-eat meal, but 
as a cookbook of ingredients that enables you to create the most fitting experience for the 
occasion.
RESOURCE Materials designed to support group learning. They come in many forms: a 
complete, ready-to-use exercise (such as a game); a comprehensive resource on one topic 
(such as conflict management) containing a variety of methods and approaches; or a col-
lection of like-minded activities (such as icebreakers) on multiple subjects and situations.
TRAINING PACKAGE An entire, ready-to-use learning program that focuses on a 
particular topic or skill. All packages comprise a guide for the facilitator/trainer and a 
workbook for the participants. Some packages are supported with additional media—such 
as video—or learning aids, instruments, or other devices to help participants understand 
concepts or practice and develop skills.
• Facilitator/trainer’s guide Contains an introduction to the program, advice on how 
to organize and facilitate the learning event, and step-by-step instructor notes. 
The guide also contains copies of pre sentation materials—handouts, presentations, 
and overhead designs, for example—used in the program. 

• Participant’s workbook Contains exercises and reading materials that support the 
learning goal and serves as a valuable reference and support guide for participants in 
the weeks and months that follow the learning event. Typically, each participant will 
require his or her own workbook.
ELECTRONIC CD-ROMs and web-based products transform static Pfeiffer content into 
dynamic, interactive experiences. Designed to take advantage of the searchability, auto-
mation, and ease-of-use that technology provides, our  e-products bring convenience and 
immediate accessibility to your workspace.
METHODOLOGIES
CASE STUDY A presentation, in narrative form, of an actual event that has occurred 
inside an organi zation. Case studies are not prescriptive, nor are they used to prove a point; 
they are designed to develop critical analysis and decision-making skills. A case study has 
a specific time frame, specifies a sequence of events, is narrative in structure, and contains 
a plot structure—an issue (what should be/have been done?). Use case studies when the 
goal is to enable participants to apply previously learned theories to the circumstances in 
the case, decide what is pertinent, identify the real issues, decide what should have been 
done, and develop a plan of action.
ENERGIZER A short activity that develops readiness for the next session or learning event. 
Energizers are most commonly used after a break or lunch to stimulate or refocus the group. 
Many involve some form of physical activity, so they are a useful way to counter post-lunch 
lethargy. Other uses include transitioning from one topic to another, where “mental” distanc-
ing is important.
EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING ACTIVITY (ELA) A facilitator-led intervention that 
moves participants through the learning cycle from experience to application (also known 
as a Structured Experience). ELAs are carefully thought-out designs in which there is a defi-
nite learning purpose and intended outcome. Each step—everything that participants do 
during the activity—facilitates the accomplishment of the stated goal. Each ELA includes 
complete instructions for facilitating the intervention and a clear statement of goals, sug-
gested group size and timing, materials required, an explanation of the process, and, where 
appropriate, possible variations to the activity. (For more detail on Experiential Learning 
Activities, see the Introduction to the Reference Guide to Handbooks and Annuals, 1999 
edition, Pfeiffer, San Francisco.)

GAME A group activity that has the purpose of fostering team spirit and togetherness in 
addition to the achievement of a pre-stated goal. Usually contrived—undertaking a desert 
expedition, for example—this type of learning method offers an engaging means for partici-
pants to demonstrate and practice business and interpersonal skills. Games are effective for 
team building and personal development mainly because the goal is subordinate to the pro-
cess—the means through which participants reach decisions, collaborate, communicate, and 
generate trust and understanding. Games often engage teams in “friendly” competition.
ICEBREAKER  A (usually) short activity designed to help participants overcome initial 
anxiety in a training session and/or to acquaint the participants with one another. An ice-
breaker can be a fun activity or can be tied to specific topics or training goals. While a useful 
tool in itself, the icebreaker comes into its own in situations where tension or resistance 
exists within a group.
INSTRUMENT A device used to assess, appraise, evaluate, describe, clas sify, and sum-
marize various aspects of human behavior. The term used to describe an instrument depends 
primarily on its format and purpose. These terms include survey, questionnaire, inven-
tory, diagnostic, survey, and poll. Some uses of instruments include providing instrumental 
feedback to group members, studying here-and-now processes or functioning within a 
group, manipulating group composition, and evaluating outcomes of training and other 
interventions. 
 
Instruments are popular in the training and HR field because, in general, more growth 
can occur if an individual is provided with a method for focusing specifically on his or her 
own behavior. Instruments also are used to obtain information that will serve as a basis for 
change and to assist in workforce planning efforts. 
 
Paper-and-pencil tests still dominate the instrument landscape with a typical 
package comprising a facilitator’s guide, which offers advice on administering the 
instrument and interpreting the collected data, and an initial set of instruments. 
Additional instruments are available separately. Pfeiffer, though, is investing heavily in 
e-instruments. Electronic instrumentation provides effortless distribution and, for larger 
groups particularly, offers advantages over paper-and-pencil tests in the time it takes to 
analyze data and provide feedback.
LECTURETTE A short talk that provides an explanation of a principle, model, or process 
that is pertinent to the participants’ current learning needs. A lecturette is intended to 
establish a common language bond between the trainer and the participants by provid-
ing a mutual frame of reference. Use a lecturette as an introduction to a group activity or 
event, as an interjection during an event, or as a handout.

MODEL A graphic depiction of a system or process and the relationship among its ele-
ments. Models provide a frame of reference and something more tangible, and more easily 
remembered, than a verbal explanation. They also give participants something to “go on,” 
enabling them to track their own progress as they experience the dynamics, processes, and 
relationships being depicted in the model.
ROLE PLAY A technique in which people assume a role in a situation/  scenario: a cus-
tomer service rep in an angry-customer exchange, for example. The way in which the role 
is approached is then discussed and feedback is offered. The role play is often repeated 
using a different approach and/or incorporating changes made based on feedback received. 
In other words, role playing is a spontaneous interaction involving realistic behavior under 
artificial (and safe) conditions.
SIMULATION A methodology for understanding the interrelationships among com-
ponents of a system or process. Simulations differ from games in that they test or use a 
model that depicts or mirrors some aspect of reality in form, if not necessarily in content. 
Learning occurs by studying the effects of change on one or more factors of the model. 
Simulations are commonly used to test hypotheses about what happens in a system—often 
referred to as “what if?” analysis—or to examine best-case/worst-case scenarios. 
THEORY A presentation of an idea from a conjectural perspective. Theories are useful 
because they encourage us to examine behavior and phenomena through a different lens.

nization development and meeting the educational needs of training and human resource
