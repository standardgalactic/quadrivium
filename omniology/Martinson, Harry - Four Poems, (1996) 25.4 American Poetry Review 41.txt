JOHANNES 
EDFELT: 
Johannes 
Edfelt (1904- 
) is a poet, translator, and essayist. 
He has been a member 
of 
the Swedish Academy since 1968, and served on its Nobel Committee from 1974 to 1989. 
His poems from six decades are collected in Ekolodning (Echo Sounding). In 1989, 
Bonniers 
published 
Folieslagare 
(Companions), 
an anthology 
of his translations 
of poets 
such as H?derlin, 
Rilke, Baudelaire, 
Yeats, 
and Whitman. 
Closing Down the Railroad 
The rails and sleepers of the narrow-gauge 
railroad are long gone. The 
embankment 
will soon be overgrown with common plantain, 
dandelion, 
bindweed 
and pigweed; 
and anything more 
redundant 
than the aban 
doned 
station house and the railway signal, that one-armed 
spectre, is 
hard to imagine. The last handcar 
stands in a shed on its three wheels col 
lecting a layer of dust; the station-master's 
whistle 
is rusting in a corner, 
and if you could hear the weeds grow, you could also hear the moth gorge 
itself on the once flamboyant 
signal flag, now in a closet and unused 
for 
many 
years. 
Drill at Nathanya 
As strange as it would be to encounter a five-legged zebra on the street 
was 
it to see in the park at Nathanya, 
the new city on the coast of Israel, 
that man 
in his elegant khaki-colored 
suit with the camera on his chest, 
halting at every tenth step that he took, clicking his heels and bellowing 
some commands 
in German, while his right arm, like a semaphore, 
struck 
out in a salute, fatally reminiscent 
of the one that at one time was pre 
scribed in the country that thought itself solidly established 
for a thousand 
years. One, two, three . . . ten steps, then, click?he 
stood at attention and 
roared out a corporal's 
commands. 
It was not long before with your inner 
eye you saw him with his exterior completely transformed: it was no longer 
in a khaki-colored 
suit that he drilled but in the striped rags of the concen 
tration camp; and behind the unfortunate 
figure rose the smoke from the 
chimneys of the gas ovens, thick and black against 
the ash-gray heavens. 
HARRY 
MARTINSON: 
Harry Martinson 
(1904-1978) 
is considered 
one of the foremost nature poets 
of Sweden. 
His years at sea as a deckhand 
became 
a source 
of much 
of his subject matter 
in 
books such as Cape Farewell (1934); Flowering Nettle (1935); Passad (Trade Winds, 1945); 
and his epic poem Aniara (1956). In 1974 he shared the Nobel Prize for literature 
with 
Eyvind Johnson. 
Winter Piece 
Delicate 
ermine tracks 
cross lightly 
in eights on the winter snow 
there where a hidden 
ice-brook with its white fur roof 
winds 
forward, 
there where the swirling water had scooped out 
a rippling bowl, 
the otter drinks from the ice-eye. 
When 
the children in red woolen 
caps come 
to hear the singing of this polar roof, 
the otter digs into his cave 
and watches 
their eyes through chinks in the ice. 
The Henhouse 
The hens, arriving early from the day's pickings, 
circle a few times around the henhouse 
floor 
and arrange themselves 
in the current pecking order. 
Only when this is made 
clear 
do they leap up to the roost. 
Soon they're all seated 
in rows around the rooster.

He makes 
a stab or two at sleeping 
but there will be no sleep for a while. 
The hens fuss and shove. 
With 
peck and cawkle, he must quiet them down. 
Then there is a shifting and settling: 
one of the hens tries to remember the latest 
worm she caught, 
but the memory 
is already 
fading, 
on its way down her crop. 
Another 
hen, on the edge of sleep, recalling clearly 
the rooster's prowess, 
rolls her eyes heavenward, 
her fluttering eyelids shutting out the world. 
Tussock 
The tussock soaks up the sun 
and quietly and slowly expels 
the frost from its earth-body. 
It spurs on its growth with spring sighs of accumulated 
warmth. 
The tongues and edges of the nearest 
snowdrifts 
shrink visibly 
in the spring gale. 
The drippings 
from the roof begin to mark 
time in the barrel. 
Peonies 
Summer grew, broadened 
out; 
thickened 
into positive 
clumps. 
Dark-red 
farm peonies 
bulged 
in the rain. 
When 
they opened 
their firm-knotted rag balls, she came by, 
the lusty queen. 
She looked for heavy bouquets, 
luxuriant repasts 
for the senses. 
The greenery was wet. Life-wet was 
the summer-saga: 
She had prepared 
only for life, not for autumn. 
Deep 
in her flesh defiantly she knew 
that in time Death 
would wave 
to her 
with his banner of hay. 
ARTUR 
LUNDKVIST: 
Artur Lundkvist 
(1906-1991) 
was 
a short story writer, novelist, essayist, 
translator, 
and 
poet. His book G/?d, published in 1928, established him as the strongest force in Swedish 
modernist poetry. In 1991, Four Walls Eight Windows published his book Journeys in 
Dream 
and Imagination 
(translated 
by Ann B. Weissmann 
and Annika 
Planck, with an 
introduction by Carlos 
Fuentes). 
Melville, America 
i 
He had spent his youth at sea, had read 
the ocean's 
books, 
leafed through islands' 
leaves, waded 
through the whale's 
brain, felt the heat of love's cheek. 
The sails breathed 
in his chest like albatross 
wings 
while he lived shut up in a house amid stifling trees? 
with a woman 
as tough as a beached 
boat 
in a landlocked 
love without waves 
or depths. 
His 
thoughts darkened 
before the red eye of the night lamp, 
the morning's 
birds numbly touched their brass 
tongues. 
The world's wailing 
he bore within himself, a bellowing 
from oceans 
and sunken peaks. The horizon 
revealed not a single sail. And 
in vain he sought 
the traces of a man's 
feet, broad as the leaves of waterlilies. 
Why 
did dust form on the lagoons of temptation? 
Why 
did he see fires far off between 
tree trunks, 
and the whale's 
giant fin against 
the sky when 
it dived 
to suck giant squid from the caverns of the deep, 
and a mad man with breakers 
around his forehead? 
aboard 
a death-ship 
rattling with dry laurel? 
O love deep-sunken 
like a white tombstone 
or like a sail unfurling its unwritten poem! 
II 
Boots marked 
by the teeth of wild beasts, 
teeth that had killed a stag beside 
the ruin, 
river disappearing 
forever into the mountain 
and 
skin goose-pimpled 
under the tattooer's 
gaze: 
a man with his umbilical 
cord in the sea, in quest of 
the stone of reality, 
threatened by the whale-oil-barrel 
pulpit, and weighed 
down by 
a petrified maternal 
bosom. 
Oh, shipwrecked, 
to live on beloved 
comrades' 
flesh salted by 
sea water, 
and then to be punished 
by rescue on a deserted 
island with 
pepper-grass 
and sickening eggs, 
thrown out into his endless memory 
of oceans, 
lured by 
merciless 
distances 
and hurricanes, 
where man was doomed 
to hang fluttering from mast 
or tentpole, 
worn to a rag by the wind, 
more and more enslaved 
by victories 
over nature! 
Outside 
of time, cleft between dark and light, with the 
salt-throb of the ocean 
in his blood, 
he was 
the ocean rider, helpless 
on land like the albatross, 
his wings uselessly 
trailing, 
a harpooner 
on the lookout for original roots and original sin, 
Leviathan 
of beginnings, 
hunting whales 
breathing 
in the sea with lungs like blood-surging 
forests, 
relegated 
to dark and depth but forced always 
to return to light 
and air. 
His was a Greek 
love, nowhere domiciled, 
a dark-skinned 
wayfarer 
with coils of wet greenery around his limbs, 
his truth was 
impossibility, 
his dream madness, 
a crying voice 
from the fellowship of the damned: 
a dove seized by rage, oblivious 
of fear, and everything 
magnified 
as at sunset, 
an ocean rider who cursed fire, with the white scar carved 
by lightning's 
thrust along his body, 
rebelling against 
the elements, against 
the fatherhood of nature, 
the god of snow, being all powerful on its throne of skeletons, 
in a battle against 
the mountain 
of white myth, against 
the 
slavery which 
left his hunger unsatiated, 
cannibalistic, 
an outcast 
among his sons, in fear of drowning, his sex eaten 
by fish. 
Circling 
the world's 
navel, racing over the ocean, his life 
existed before birth, not beyond death, 
but he gave 
in to the pressure, 
the traitor within him, the grafted 
dread, the soured mother's 
milk, 
he betrayed 
his damnation, 
lost his truth, his ocean, his 
darkness 
and his struggle, 
became 
the man who had gone ashore, brotherless, 
among 
sisters 
disguised, 
forbidden, witches 
averting 
their sex, 
choked in this life, whitewashed 
with lime and snow, 
victim for a sacrificial offering, for a murdered 
brother 
made 
divine by treason, 
I 
and he lost his manly voice, a eunuch of silence, 
but wheels 
continued 
to crush horizons 
and thighbones 
and 
I distances were annihilated by fire that exploded in captivity.
