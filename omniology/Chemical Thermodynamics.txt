Introduction

Introduction
In this Chapter, we quickly review some basic deﬁnitions and concepts from thermodynamics. We
then provide a brief description of the ﬁrst and second laws of thermodynamics. Next, we discuss the
mathematical consequences of these laws and cover some relevant theorems in multivariate calculus.
Finally, free energies and their importance are introduced.
1.1
Basic concepts
1.1.1
State function versus path function
A state function is a function that depends only on the current properties of the system and not on the
history of the system. Examples of state functions include density, temperature, and pressure.
A path function is a function that depends on the history of the system. Examples of path functions
include work and heat.
1.1.2
Intensive property versus extensive property
An extensive property is a characteristic of a system that is proportional to the size of the system.
That is, if we double the size of the system, then the value of an extensive property would also
double. Examples of extensive properties include total volume, total mass, total internal energy, etc.
Extensive properties will be underlined. For example, the total entropy of the system, which is an
extensive property, will be denoted as ¯S.
An intensive property is a characteristic of a system that does not depend on the size of the system.
That is, doubling the size of the system leave the value of an intensive property unchanged. Examples
of intensive properties are pressure, temperature, density, molar volume, etc. By deﬁnition, an inten-
sive property can only be a function of other intensive properties. It cannot be a function of properties
that are extensive because it would then depend on the size of the system.
1.2
Brief review of thermodynamics
1.2.1
The ﬁrst law of thermodynamics
The ﬁrst law of thermodynamics is simply a statement of the conservation of energy. Energy can take
on a variety of forms, for example kinetic energy, chemical energy, or thermal energy. These different
forms of energy can transform from one to another; however, the sum total of all the types of energy
must remain constant.

Introduction
Let’s apply the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics to a closed system (i.e. a system that can exchange heat
and work with its surroundings, but not matter). The ﬁrst law for a closed system can be written as
d¯U = δQ −δW + · · ·
(1.1)
where ¯U is the internal energy of the system, δQ is the heat (thermal energy) transferred to the system,
and δW is the work performed by the system. Other forms of energy may contribute to the energy
balance, such as kinetic energy or potential energy (e.g., from a gravitational or electrostatic ﬁeld).
1.2.2
The second law of thermodynamics
The second law of thermodynamics formalizes the observation that heat is spontaneously transferred
only from higher temperatures to lower temperatures. From this observation, one can deduce the
existence of a state function of a system: the entropy ¯S. The second law of thermodynamics states
that the entropy change d¯S of a closed, constant-volume system obeys the following inequality
d¯S ≥δQ
T
(1.2)
where T is the absolute temperature of the system, and δQ is the amount of heat transfered to the
system. A process will occur spontaneously in a closed, constant-volume system only if Eq. (1.2)
is satisﬁed. For a reversible process, the equality is satisﬁed; for an irreversible process, the entropy
change is greater than the right-hand side of the relation.
Note that the second law of thermodynamics is unique among the various laws of nature in that it
is not symmetric in time. It sets a direction in time, and consequently there is a distinction between
running forward in time and running backwards in time. We can notice that a ﬁlm is being played in
reverse because we observe events that seem to violate the second law.
1.3
The fundamental equation of thermodynamics
Now consider a closed system that can alter its volume ¯V . In this case, the work performed by the
system is δW = pd¯V . Combining the ﬁrst and the second laws of thermodynamics for a closed
system (i.e. inserting the inequality in Eq. (1.2) into Eq. (1.1)), we obtain
d¯U ≤Td¯S −pd¯V
for constant N
(1.3)
For any spontaneous change (process) in the system, the inequality given in Eq. (1.3) will be satisﬁed.
The equality will be satisﬁed only in a reversible process.
An isolated system is a system that does not exchange work δW = 0, heat δQ = 0, or matter
dN = 0 with its surroundings. Consequently, the total internal energy and volume remain constant;

Introduction
that implies that d¯U = 0 and d¯V = 0. Substituting these relations into Eq. (1.3), we ﬁnd that
processes occur spontaneously in an isolated system only if the entropy does not decrease. In this
case,
d¯S ≥0
(1.4)
Note that in an isolated system, every spontaneous event that occurs always increases the total entropy.
Therefore, at equilibrium, where the properties of a system no longer change, the entropy of the
system will be maximized.
For a system where entropy and volume are held ﬁxed (i.e. d¯S = 0 and ¯V = 0), a process will occur
spontaneously if
d¯U ≤0
at constant ¯S, ¯V , and N
(1.5)
For a reversible process, where the system is always inﬁnitesmally close to equilibrium, the equality in
Eq. (1.3) is satisﬁed. The resulting equation is known as the fundamental equation of thermodynamics
d¯U = Td¯S −pd¯V
at constant N

Introduction
1.4
The calculus of thermodynamics
From the fundamental equation of thermodynamics, we can deduce relations between the various
properties of the system. To see this, let’s consider a function f with independent variables x and y.
The differential of f (i.e. the total change in f) can be written as:
df =
∂f
∂x

y
dx +
∂f
∂y

x
dy
(1.7)
The ﬁrst term represents the change in f due to changes in the independent variable x, and the second
term representce changes due to the independent variable y. Note that Eq. (1.7) is just a generalization
of a ﬁrst order Taylor series expansion to a function of two variables.
If we consider the internal energy of the system ¯U to be a function of the variables ¯S and ¯V , then
taking f →¯U, x →¯S, and y →¯V , we ﬁnd
d¯U =
∂¯U
∂¯S

¯V
d¯S +
∂¯U
∂¯V

¯S
d¯V
(1.8)
Comparing Eq. (1.8) with the fundamental equation of thermodynamics Eq. (1.6), we can make the
identiﬁcations

¯V

(1.9)
∂¯U


¯S
= −p
(1.10)
Therefore, we see that the temperature and pressure of the system can be related to derivatives of its
internal energy.
For most functions, the order of differentiation does not matter. That is

We will encounter more of these kind of relations later on.
There are three additional relations that need to be mentioned. These relations are useful in converting

(1.13)
To determine the other two relations, let’s consider a function of three variables that is constrained to
be equal to zero. That is
f(x, y, z) = 0.
This deﬁnes a two-dimensional surface embedded in a three-dimensional space. The above equation
can be interpreted as deﬁning the functions:
x = x(y, z)
y = y(x, z)
z = z(x, y).
Each of these functions can be expanded in terms of its respective independent variables

the dx and dz must vanish. For the dx coefﬁcient, we ﬁnd

Introduction
1.5
Open systems
We can extend Eq. (1.6) to open systems (i.e. systems in which the number of moles N can vary) by
including a term called the chemical potential μ. Mathematically, this quantity represents the increase
in the internal energy when a small amount of material is introduced to the system at constant total
entropy and volume:
μ =
 ∂¯U
∂N

¯S,¯V
(1.21)
The fundamental equation of thermodynamics can then be written as
d¯U = Td¯S −pd¯V + μdN
(1.22)
Let’s determine what the chemical potential is. To do this, we rewrite all total quantities in terms of
molar properties. For example, the total internal energy can be written as ¯U = NU, where U is the
molar internal energy of the system, and N is the total number of moles in the system. Substituting

Introduction
these relations into the fundamental equation, we ﬁnd
d(NU) = Td(NS) −pd(NV ) + μdN
NdU + UdN = NTdS + TSdN −NpdV −pV dN + μdN
NdU = N(TdS −pdV ) −(U + pV −TS −μ)dN
dU = TdS −pdV −1
N (G −μ)dN
(1.23)
where in the last line, we have introduced the deﬁnition of the molar Gibbs free energy G ≡U +
pV −TS.
The molar internal energy U is an intensive property of the system; therefore, it should be independent
of extensive properties of the system, in particular, the total number of moles in the system N. In
order for this to be true, the chemical potential μ must be equal to the molar Gibbs free energy G. In
otherwords:
μ ≡G
(1.24)
Note that this derivation is restricted to pure substances. For multicomponent systems, we need to
generalize this relation. This will be done later.
1.6
Legendre transforms and free energies
The natural variables of the internal energy ¯U are the entropy ¯S, volume ¯V , and total number of moles
N of the system. In many situations, however, these variables are not convenient.
We can easily arrive at a new function that has different natural variables by performing a Legendre
transform. For example, to arrive at a new state property that posesses the independent variables T
and V , we deﬁne the Helmholtz free energy ¯A as:
¯A ≡¯U −T ¯S
(1.25)
Inserting this relation into Eq. (1.3), generalized to open systems, we ﬁnd
d¯U ≤Td¯S −pd¯V + μdN
d(¯A + T ¯S) ≤Td¯S −pd¯V + μdN
d¯A ≤−¯SdT −pd¯V + μdN
(1.26)
From this equation, we see that for a system with the temperature, volume, and total number of moles
held ﬁxed (i.e., dT = 0, d¯V = 0, and dN = 0), a process is spontaneous if it decreases the Helmholtz
free energy.

Chemical Thermodynamics
 
15 
Introduction
In addition, at equilibrium where the equality holds, we ﬁnd
d¯A = −¯SdT −pd¯V + μdN
(1.27)
From this expression, we see that the natural variables of the Helmholtz free energy ¯A are the tem-
perature, volume, and total number of moles of the system.
Similarly, if we deﬁne the Gibbs free energy ¯G ≡¯U −T ¯S + p¯V , then the fundamental equation of
thermodynamics becomes
d¯G = −¯SdT + ¯V dp + μdN
(1.28)
The Gibbs free energy is minimized for a system at constant temperature, pressure, and total number
of moles. The Gibbs free energy is important because in most experiments the temperature and
pressure are variables that we control. This will become useful to us later when we consider phase
equilibria.
The corresponding equation for the enthalpy ¯H ≡¯U + p¯V is
d¯H = Td¯S + ¯V dp + μdN
(1.29)
As we have seen, free energies such as the internal energy and Gibbs free energy are useful in that
they tell us whether a process will occur spontaneously or not. A process in which the requisite free
energy decreases will occur spontaneously. A process in which the free energy increases will not
occur spontaneously. This does not mean that the process cannot happen; we can force the process
to occur by performing work on the system. Therefore, we see that free energies are useful to us,
qualitatively, in that they tell us the direction in which things will naturally happen.
Free energies also provide us with quantitative information about processes. The change in the free
energy is equal to the maximum work that can be extracted from a spontaneous process, or in the case
of a non-spontaneous processes, the minimum amount of work that is required to cause the process
to occur.

Introduction
Free energies also have an additional, fundamental importance. Once the mathematical form of the
free energy of a system is known in terms of its natural independent variables (e.g., the Gibbs free
energy as a function of T, p, and N), then all the thermodynamic properties of the system can be
determined. In the remainder of the course, we will be learning how to both develop approximate
models for the free energy and how to use these models to estimate the thermodynamic behavior of
various systems.

Single component systems

Single component systems
In this Chapter, we describe the basic thermodynamic properties of single component systems. We
begin with a qualitative description of their general phase behavior. Then, we discuss the mathemati-
cal relations that govern this behavior.
2.1
General phase behavior
Figure 2.1 shows the pressure-temperature projection of the phase diagram for a general one-component
system. Depending on the temperature and pressure, the system can exist in either a solid, liquid, or
vapor phase. Lines separate the various phases. On the lines, two phases coexist. The line separating
the vapor and liquid phases is known as the vapor pressure curve. On crossing this curve, the system
will transform discontinuously from a liquid to a vapor (or vice-versa). At high temperatures, the va-
por pressure curve ends at a critical point. Beyond this point, there is no real distinction between the
vapor and liquid phases. By going around the critical point, a liquid can be continuously transformed
into a vapor.
The line separating the solid and liquid phases is known as the melting or freezing curve. The line
separating the solid and vapor phases is known as the sublimation curve. The point where the vapor
pressure curve, the melting curve, and the sublimation curves meet is the triple point. At these
conditions, the solid, liquid, and vapor phases can simultaneously coexist.
In Figure 2.2, we show the temperature-density phase diagram for a general pure substance. As
with the pressure-temperature diagram, the temperature-density phase diagram is divided by various
curves into vapor, liquid, and solid phases. Outside these curves, the system exists as a single phase.
Inside these curves, multiple phases coexist. For example, if a system is prepared at a state corre-
sponding to point A in the diagram, it will divied into a vapor phase, with density ρ(v), and liquid
phase, with density ρ(l). From the phase diagram, we can also determine the relative amounts of the
coexisting phases. Let’s consider a system consisting of N total moles that are separated into a liquid
phase that occupies a volume ¯V (l) and a vapor phase that occupies a volume ¯V (g). From a mole
balance, we have
N = ρ(l)
¯V (l) + ρ(g)
¯V (g)
ρ(¯V (l) + ¯V (g)) = ρ(l)
¯V (l) + ρ(g)
¯V (g)
(ρ(l) −ρ)¯V (l) = (ρ −ρ(g))¯V (g)
¯V (l)
¯V (g) = ρ −ρ(g)
ρ(l) −ρ
(2.1)
where ρ = N/(¯V (l) + ¯V (g)) is the overall density of the system. Equation (2.1) is known as the lever
rule. It allows us to compute the relative amounts of the two-coexisting phases.

Single component systems

The dashed-line represents the triple point. Anywhere along the dashed-line, the vapor, liquid, and
solid phases can simultaneously exist.
2.2
Conditions for phase equilibrium
Now let’s derive the mathematical conditions for equilibrium between two coexisting phases. We
consider an isolated system that is separated into two phases, which we label A and B. The volume
occupied by each phase can change; in addition, the both phases can freely exchange energy and
material with each other. Because the system is isolated, the total energy ¯U, the total volume ¯V ,
and the total number of moles N in the system must remain constant. This leads to the following
relations:
¯U(A) + ¯U(B) = ¯U
=⇒
d¯U(A) = −d¯U(B)
(2.2)
¯V (A) + ¯V (B) = ¯V
=⇒
d¯V (A) = −d¯V (B)
(2.3)
N (A) + N (B) = N
=⇒
dN (A)= −dN (B)
(2.4)
where ¯U(i) is the total energy of phase i, ¯V (i) is the total volume of phase i, and N (i) is the total
number of moles in phase i.

The total entropy of an isolated system at equilibrium is maximized. Therefore, we have

The change in the total entropy of the system is given by the sum of the entropy change in phase A
and the entropy change in phase B. This leads to

The quantities d¯U(A), d¯V (A), and dN (A) on the right-hand side of Eq. (2.7) can be chosen arbitrarily.
From Eq. (2.6), we know that the left-hand side of Eq. (2.7) must equal zero. The only manner in
which to guarantee the equality between the two sides of Eq. (2.7) is if coefﬁcients of the d¯U(A),
d¯V (A), and dN (A) terms are each equal to zero. As a result, this implies the relations:
T (A) = T (B)
p(A) = p(B)
μ(A) = μ(B)
(2.8)
Therefore, we ﬁnd that the temperatures, pressures, and chemical potentials are equal for coexisting
phases in equilibrium. We will later extend this derivation to multicomponent system.
One interesting point to note is that the labels A and B which we used to derive Eqs. (2.8) do not
have to refer to different phases. For example, A and B can refer to different parts of a one phase
system. Therefore, Eqs. (2.8) can be interpreted as stating the the temperature, pressure, and chemical
potential of a system at equilibrium are uniform (N.B., we did not include the inﬂuence of external
ﬁelds, such as gravitional or electrostatic ﬁelds).
2.3
The Clapeyron equation
In this section, we derive the Clapeyron equation. This equation relates changes in the pressure to
changes in the temperature along a two-phase coexistence curve (e.g., the vapor pressure curve or the
melting curve). Note that the condition for equilibrium between two phases is given by
μ(A) = μ(B)
G(A) = G(B)
dG(A) = dG(B)
−S(A)dT + V (A)dp = −S(B)dT + V (B)dp
dp
dT = S(A) −S(B)
V (A) −V (B)
(2.9)
This is one form of the Clapeyron equation. It relates the slope of the coexistence curve to the entropy
change and volume change of the phase transition.

Entropy is not directly measureable, and, therefore, the Clapeyron equation as written above is not
in a convenient form. However, we can relate entropy changes to enthalpy changes, which can be
directly measured. At equilibrium, we have
μ(A) = μ(B)
G(A) = G(B)
H(A) −TS(A) = H(B) −TS(B)
S(A) −S(B) = 1
T (H(A) −H(B))
(2.10)
Thus, the entropy change of a phase transition, which is not directly measureable, can be determined
from the enthalpy change of the phase transition, which is directly measureable.
Substituting this relation into Eq. (2.9), we ﬁnd

H(A) −H(B)
T(V (A) −V (B))

This is the more commonly used form of the Clapeyron equation.

Multicomponent systems
In this section, we examine the thermodynamics of systems which contain a mixture of species.
First, we generalize the thermodynamic analysis of the previous section to multicomponent systems,
deriving the Gibbs phase rule. Then we describe the general phase behavior of binary and ternary
mixtures.
3.1
Thermodynamics of multicomponent systems
3.1.1
The fundamental equation of thermodynamics
In this section, we extend the results of the previous lectures to multicomponent systems. All that
needs to be done is to deﬁne a chemical potential for each species α in the system
d¯U = Td¯S −pd¯V +

μαdNα
(3.1)
where μα is the chemical potential of component α. From this, we see that
μα ≡
 ∂¯U
∂Nα

¯S,¯V,Nα′̸=α
(3.2)
Physically, μα is the change in the internal energy of the system with respect to an increase in the
number of moles of species α, while holding all number of moles of all other species constant.
The other forms of the fundamental equation of thermodynamics can be similarly generalized by
performing the Legendre transform:
d¯A = −¯SdT −pd¯V +

d¯G = −¯SdT + ¯V dp +

Because the system is isolated, we have the following
¯U(A)+¯U(B)= ¯U

where ¯U(i) is the internal energy of phase i, ¯V (i) is the volume of phase i, and N (i)
α is the number of

For an isolated system at equilibrium, the total entropy is maximized. Stated mathematically, we have

we have the temperature, pressure, and chemical potentials of each species are equal in each phase.

intensive variables (e.g., temperature and pressure). For a phase with ω components, ω −1 mole
fractions are required to specify the composition. Therefore, a total of ω + 1 intensive variables are
required to specify the state of a single phase.
For a system with π phases, there are a total of (ω + 1)π unknowns. However, not all of these are
independent. The conditions for phase equilibrium (see Eqs. (3.8)) give us (ω + 2)(π −1) equations
that must be satisﬁed between each of the phases. The difference between the number of unknowns in
the system and the number of constraints (or equations) is equal to the number of degrees of freedom
f in the system.
f = (ω + 1)π −(ω + 2)(π −1)
= 2 + ω −π
(3.9)
This is known as the Gibbs phase rule. It tells us the number of variables f that must be speciﬁed in
order to ﬁx the (intensive) state of the system.

Binary mixtures
3.2.1
Vapor-liquid equilibrium
The Gibbs phase rule for a binary mixture simpliﬁes to
f = 4 −π
(3.10)
The maximum number of degrees of freedom that a system can have is given when there is only one
phase present (i.e., π = 1). For a binary mixture, we ﬁnd that there are at most 3 degrees of freedom.
This means that we can represent the state of binary mixture using a three dimensional diagram. An
example of such a diagram is given in Fig. 3.1, which is for mixtures of methane and ethane.
The key feature of this phase diagram is a solid body in the center of the ﬁgure. Within this solid
body, the system exists as a two-phase mixture, with a coexisting liquid and vapor phases. Above this
body, the system exists as a single liquid phase; below this body, the system is a single vapor phase.
The upper surface (marked by red points) that bounds the body is the locus of bubble points (i.e., the
points at which bubbles begin to appear in a liquid). The lower surface (marked by green points) is
the locus of dew points (i.e., the points at which droplets begin to appear in a vapor).

The points C1 and C2 are the critical points of pure methane and ethane, respectively. The line
connecting these two points, which is the intersection of the bubble point and dew point surfaces, is
the critical locus. This is the set of critical points for the various mixtures of methane and ethane. The
black curve connecting points A and C1 is the vapor pressure curve of pure methane, and the violet
curve connecting points B and C2 is the vapor pressure curve of pure ethane.
We can represent Fig. 3.1 in a two-dimensional ﬁgure by taking various projections. The blue enve-
lope is a horizontal cross-section of the two-phase body; this is a Txy diagram of the methane-ethane
mixture taken at constant pressure. The brown envelope is a vertical cross-section of the solid body,
taken at constant temperature; this is a pxy diagram.
In Fig. 3.2, we show the pressure-temperature view of the phase diagram for binary mixtures of
methane and ethane. The point C1 represents the critical point of pure methane, and the point C2
represents the critical point of pure ethane. The curve connecting the points A and C1 is the vapor
pressure curve for pure methane; the curve connecting points B and C2 is the vapor pressure curve
for pure ethane. The dotted curve connecting the points C1 and C2 is the critical locus. The critical
points of the mixtures, where the coexisting liquid and vapor phases become identical, lie on this
critical locus.
For a one component system, the bubble point and the dew point are the same and lie along the vapor
pressure curve; however, this is not necessarily the case for a mixture. Within envelopes contained

between the vapor pressure curves of the pure components, a mixture consists of a coexisting vapor
and liquid phases. The upper part of the envelop (the solid curve with ﬁlled symbols) is the bubble
point curve; the lower part of the envelop (the dashed curve with open symbols) is the dew point
curve. Different envelopes correspond to different mixture compositions.
In Fig. 3.3a, we present the Txy diagram for binary mixtures of cyclohexane and toluene at a pressure
of 1 atm, which is below the critical pressure of both pure species. Point A denotes the boiling
temperature of pure toluene, and point C is the boiling temperature of pure cyclohexane. Connecting
these two points are two curves that form the two-phase envelope. The upper curve (with the open
symbols) is the dew point curve, and the lower curve (with the ﬁlled symbols) is the bubble point line.
Above the two-phase envelope, the system is a vapor, and below the envelope, the system is a liquid.
Within the envelope, the system separates into a coexisting vapor and liquid phase. The composition
of the phases is given by the dew point curve and the bubble point curve. For example at point E
(mole fraction zα), the system splits into a vapor phase with a composition corresponding to point
D (mole fraction yα) and a liquid phase with a composition corresponding to point B (mole fraction
xα). The ratio of the total moles of the liquid phase N (l) to the total moles of the vapor phase N (g) is

given by the lever rule:
zαN = xαN (l) + yαN (g)
zα(N (l) + N (g)) = xαN (l) + yαN (g)
N (l)
N (g) = zα −yα
xα −zα
(3.11)
where N = N (l) + N (g) is the total number of moles in the system.
In Figure 3.3b, we show the pxy diagram for binary mixtures of cyclohexane and toluene at 50◦C,
which is below the critical temperature of both species. Point A is the boiling pressure of pure toluene,
and point C is the boiling pressure of pure cyclohexane. Connecting these two points are the bubble
point (upper) and dew point (lower) curves. Above the bubble point curve, the system is entirely in
the liquid phase, while below the dew point curve, the system is in the vapor phase. Between these
two curves, the system separates into a coexisting liquid and vapor phase. The lever rule, described
previously for the Txy diagram, also applies to the pxy diagram and can be used to determine the
relative proportions of these phases.

Now let’s consider the variation of the Txy diagram of a binary mixture with pressure. In Figure 3.4a,
we show the Txy diagram for mixtures of methane and ethane. At moderately low pressures, we have
the standard Txy diagram, which touches the temperature axis at the boiling temperature of each
of the pure species. As the pressure increases, the two-phase envelope gradually moves to higher
temperatures, due to the fact that boiling temperatures increase with pressure. However, when the
pressure of the system becomes higher than the critical pressure of methane (46.0 bar), the two-phase
envelope no longer touches the temperature axis at xmethane = 1. As the pressure further increases
beyond the critical pressure of ethane (48.8 bar), then the two-phase envelope also detaches from the
temperature axis at xmethane = 0.
In the systems that we have examined so far, the bubble point and the dew point of the mixture vary
monotonically with the composition. This is the case for ideal systems. However, for very non-ideal
systems, there may be a maximum or a minimum in the bubble and dew point curves. This is the case
for azeotropic systems. An example of a system that exhibits a low-boiling azeotrope is a mixture of
n-heptane and ethanol, which is shown in Figure 3.5. For this type of system, both the bubble and
dew point temperature curves have a local minimum at the same composition. At this composition,
these two curves meet. This point is known as the azeotrope. At the azeotrope, the composition of the
coexisting liquid and vapor phases are identical. In this case at the azeotrope, the boiling temperature

of the liquid is lower than the boiling temperature of either pure components. The corresponding
bubble and dew point pressure curves have a maximum at the azeotrope (see Fig. 3.5b).
For a high boiling azeotropic system, the bubble and dew point temperature curves meet at a maxi-
mum in the Txy diagram. Mixtures of nitric acid and water form exhibit a high boiling azeotrope;
this system is shown in Fig. 3.6.
3.2.2
Liquid-liquid equilibria
When two liquids are mixed together, they do not always form a single, homogenous liquid phase. In
many cases, two liquid phases are formed, with one phase richer in the ﬁrst component and the other
phase richer in the second component. The classic example of a system that exhibits this behavior is
a mixture of oil and water.
A typical Txy diagram for a system that demonstrates liquid-liquid phase separation is given in
Fig. 3.7, which is for mixtures of phenol and water. Outside the curve, the mixture exists as a single,
homogeneous liquid phase. Inside the curve, the system exists as two separate, coexisting liquid
phases. Consider the point A, which lies inside the curve. In this case, the system phase separates

into two liquid phases, one with composition x′
1 and the other with composition x′′
1. The relative
amounts of the two phases can be computed using the lever rule, as described previously.
The maximum of the liquid-liquid phase envelope and is known as the critical point of the mixture.
Above the critical temperature (i.e., the temperature at the critical point), the system exists as a single
liquid phase. Below the critical temperature, the system can split into two coexisting liquid phases,
depending on the overall composition.
The basic reason why liquid-liquid phase separation occurs is that the attractive interactions between
different molecules are weaker than the attractive interactions beween similar molecules. As a result,
similar molecules prefer to be near to each other and than to dissimilar molecules. The consequence
of this at a macroscopic level is the formation of two liquid phases.

Vapor-liquid-liquid equilibria
In Figure 3.8, we combine the high temperature and low temperature Txy phase diagrams for a system
with a low boiling azeotrope. At high temperatures, the system is a vapor. At lower temperatures,
it condenses to become a liquid. Below the critical temperature, liquid can separate to form two

coexisting liquid phases.
As the pressure of the system decreases, the boiling temperature decreases, in general. Therefore, we
expect the vapor-liquid coexistence envelope to drop to lower temperatures as the pressures decrease.
Changes in pressure, however, do not have a strong inﬂuence on the phase behavior of liquids. As a
result, we do not expect the liquid-liquid phase envelope to change much with pressure. Consequently,
we expect that at a low enough pressure, the vapor-liquid coexistence curve will intersect the liquid-
liquid coexistence curve. When this occurs, we can have vapor-liquid-liquid equilibria, which is
shown in Figure 3.9.

40%, 40%, 20% mixture of components 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
3.3
Ternary mixtures
In this section, we consider the phase behavior of systems with three components. The Gibbs phase
rule for a ternary mixture is
f = 5 −π
(3.12)
A ternary system can have at most four degrees of freedom, which occurs when there is only one
phase present (i.e., π = 1). At a given temperature and pressure, only the composition of a ternary
system needs to speciﬁed to ﬁx its state.
In this case, the phase diagram is typically represented on an equilateral triangle, such as the one
shown in Figure 3.10. The corners of the triangles represent the pure components. The upper corner
is pure 1; the lower left corner is pure 2; and the lower right corner is pure 3. For a general point
within the triangle, the mole fraction of a species is equal to the ratio of the distance of the point from
the corresponding corner to the height of the triangle. Therefore, the sides of the triangle represent
binary mixtures.
Some typical phase behavior that can be exhibited by ternary mixtures is shown in Fig. 3.11. Let
us consider a situation where binary mixtures of component 1 and component 2 are only partially
miscible, where two coexisting liquid phases may be formed: one rich in 1 and the other rich in
2. This is represented by the base of the ternary phase diagram shown in Fig. 3.11a. In addition,
let us assume that components 1 and 3 are completely miscible and components 2 and 3 are also
completely miscible. For this case, one might expect that if enough of component 3 is added to the
system, then components 1 and 2 can be made to mix with each other, due to their mutual solubility
with component 3. This is type I phase behavior.

A type II phase diagram, shown in Fig. 3.11b, corresponds to a situation where components 1 and
3 are completely miscible, but both components 1 and 2 and components 2 and 3 are only partially
miscible.
Finally, type III phase behavior is shown in Fig. 3.11c. In this case, the various binary mixtures of
the three components are each only partially miscible. The shaded triangle in the center of the phase
diagram is a region where three phases are in coexistence with each other. Systems with a composition
which lies within this shaded triangle will split into three separate phases; the composition of each
of these phases corresponds to one of the corners of the triangle. The composition of the individual
phases will not vary with the system’s location within the triangle (i.e., its overall composition);
however, the relative amounts of each of the phases will.

The ideal solution model

The ideal solution model
In many situations, we need to predict the properties of a mixture, given that we already know the
properties of the pure species. To do this requires a model that can describe how various components
mix. In mathematical terms, this means that we need to relate the Gibbs free energy of a mixture to
the Gibbs free energy of the various pure components. One of the simplest models that achieves this
is the ideal solution model. In this lecture, we present the ideal solution model. Then we apply this
model to describe vapor-liquid equilibria, and as a result, derive Raoult’s law.
4.1
Deﬁnition of the ideal solution model
For an ideal solution, the Gibbs free energy ¯G deﬁned as:
¯G(T, p, N1, N2, . . . ) =

α
Nαμ◦
α(T, p) + RT

α
Nα ln xα
(4.1)
where T is the absolute temperature of the system, p is the pressure of the system, R is the ideal
gas constant, Nα is the number of moles of component α, xα is the mole fraction of component α,
and μ◦
α(T, p) is the molar Gibbs free energy of pure component α (recall that for pure systems, the
molar Gibbs free energy is equal to the chemical potential). The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of
Eq. (4.1) represents the Gibbs free energy of the system if its components were unmixed. The second
term represents the contribution due to the entropy of mixing.
In all calculations involving the ideal solution model, we assume that we know the molar Gibbs free
energy of each of the pure species as a function of temperature and pressure. Mathematically, this
means that know the form of the functions μ◦
α(T, p). Physically, this means that we know everything
about the thermodynamics of the pure species.
Once we know the Gibbs free energy of a system as a function of temperature, pressure, and compo-
sition, we know everything about its thermodynamics. For example, the total volume of the system
¯V can be derived from the Gibbs free energy:
¯V =
∂¯G

T,Nα

NαV ◦
α
(4.2)
where V ◦
α is the molar volume of pure species α, and we have used the relation V ◦
α = (∂μ◦
α/∂p).
The total volume is equal to the sum of the volumes of the pure components. Therefore, there is no
change of volume on mixing for an ideal solution.

α
Nα ln xα
(4.3)
where S◦
α is the molar entropy of pure component α, and we have used the relation S◦
α = −(∂μ◦
α/∂T).
Unlike the case for volume, the total entropy of the mixture is not the same as the sum of the entropies
of the unmixed systems. In fact, due to the second term in Eq. (4.3), the entropy increases upon mix-
ing.
The total enthalpy ¯H of the system is given by
¯H = ¯G + T ¯S

(4.4)
where H◦
α is the molar enthalpy of pure α, and we have used the relation H◦
α = μ◦
α + TS◦
α. In this
case, we see that the total enthalpy of the system is the same as the sum of the enthalpies of the pure
components. No heat is absorbed or released upon mixing an ideal solution.
The chemical potential of species α is given by
μα(T, p, x2, x3, . . . ) =
 ∂¯G
∂Nα

T,p,Nα′̸=α
= μ◦
α(T, p) + RT ln xα
(4.5)
In an ideal solution, we see that the chemical potential of a species depends on its mole fraction and
not directly on the composition of the other components in the system. Also, we see that mixing
causes the chemical potential of each component to decrease.
4.2
Derivation of Raoult’s law
Now we will use the ideal solution model to develop a mathematical description of vapor-liquid
equilibrium in a multicomponent solution. We will make the assumption that we have a system that
is separated into a coexisting vapor and liquid phase. The vapor phase will be assumed to behave like
an ideal gas, while the liquid phase will be assumed to behave as an ideal solution.

The ideal solution model
The basic condition for equilibrium between phases is
μv
α(T, p, y2, y3, . . . ) = μl

(4.6)
where μv
α is the chemical potential of component α in the vapor phase, μl
α is the chemical potential
of component α in the liquid phase, yα is the mole fraction of component α in the vapor phase, and
xα is the mole fraction of component α in the liquid phase.
Since the liquid phase behaves as an ideal mixture, we have

is the molar volume of pure α in the
liquid phase. If we assume that the volume of the liquid is nearly independent of pressure, then
Eq. (4.7) becomes:

Partial molar properties
In Chapter 4, we examined the properties of ideal solutions. Many properties of an ideal solution do
not change on mixing. For example, the volume of a mixture is equal to the sum of the volume of
the original unmixed solutions. In this situation, it is straightforward to assign how much volume is
occupied by each component in the system — it is simply the volume occupied by components in
their unmixed state.
For a general system, however, the volume, as well as other properties, is not additive. That is, the
volume of a mixture is not equal to the sum of the volumes of the individual pure components. In
this situation, it is not clear how to assign how much volume is occupied of each species. One logical
manner to do this is through the use of partial molar properties.
In this Chapter, we deﬁne partial molar properties and describe their application. We then discuss
their relationship with the change of properties of a system on mixing. Finally, we examine the
graphical representation of partial molar properties for binary mixtures.
5.1
Deﬁnition
In general for any extensive property ¯X of a system, we deﬁne a partial molar property of component
α as
¯Xα ≡
 ∂¯X
∂Nα

T,p,Nα′̸=α
,
(5.1)
where Nα is the number of moles of species α, T is the temperature, and p is the pressure of the
system. Physically, the partial molar quantity ¯Xα corresponds to the change of the property ¯X with
the addition of a small amount of component α, while holding constant the temperature, pressure, and
number of moles of all other species. Note that partial molar properties are intensive and, therefore,
do not depend on the system size.
Examples of partial molar properties include the partial molar enthalpy ¯Hα, which is deﬁned as
¯Hα ≡
 ∂¯H
∂Nα

T,p,Nα′̸=α
,
(5.2)
and the partial molar volume ¯Vα, which is deﬁned as
¯Vα ≡
 ∂¯V

T,p,Nα′̸=α
.

we see that the chemical potential is equal to the partial molar Gibbs free energy.
5.2
Relationship between total properties and partial molar properties
Any extensive property of a system can be written in terms of its partial molar quantities. Recall that
an extensive property is a property that scales proportionally with the size of the system. If the system
doubles in size, then value of the extensive property should double. If the size of the system increases
by a factor t, then the value of the extensive property should increase by a factor t. For example,
taking X to be the volume V , then we expect the total volume of the system ¯V to increase by a factor
t if the number of total moles in the system are increased by a factor t, holding the composition of the
system ﬁxed. This feature can be expressed mathematically as
t¯X(T, p, N1, N2, . . . ) = ¯X(T, p, tN1, tN2, . . . )
(5.5)
Taking the derivative of both sides of the Eq. (5.5) with respect to t, while keeping all other variables
constant, yields
¯X(T, p, N1, N2, . . . ) =

¯X(T, p, N1, N2, . . . ) =

Nα ¯Xα
(5.6)
The value of any extensive property of a system is equal to the sum of the partial molar properties
of each component multiplied by the amount of each component in the system. Therefore, we can
“divide” the property of a mixture , such as the volume or enthalpy, between its individual components
according to their partial molar properties.
One important example of this, which we will utilize later, is the Gibbs free energy G. In this case, the
total Gibbs free energy ¯G can be expressed in terms of the chemical potentials μα of each component
(partial molar Gibbs free energy)
¯G(T, p, N1, N2, . . . ) =

Nαμα
(5.7)
By dividing both sides of Eq. (5.6) by N, the total number of moles in the system, we ﬁnd that molar
properties are similarly related to partial molar properties

(5.8)
where xα is the mole fraction of component α.

Partial molar properties
The derivative of a molar property with respect to xα can also be written in terms of partial molar
properties. To demonstrate this, let us consider that an extensive property ¯X is a function of T, p,
mole numbers Nα. We can express its differential as
d¯X =

Properties changes on mixing
Often when pure components are mixed together to form a solution, the properties of the overall
system change. For example, if we mix a quantity of pure liquid ethanol with pure liquid water, the
volume of the ﬁnal mixture has a slightly smaller volume than the sum of the volumes of the original
pure liquid. This system has a negative volume change on mixing. If a solution of concentrated
sulfuric acid is mixed with pure water, then a large amount of heat is released because the enthalpy of
the mixture (at equilibrium) is lower than the sum of the enthalpy of the unmixed components. This
system has a negative enthalpy of mixing.
To characterize this change, the property change on mixing Δ¯Xmix is deﬁned as the difference be-
tween the property of the mixture and the properties of the pure components:
Δ¯Xmix = ¯X −

α
NαX◦
α
=

α
Nα( ¯Xα −X◦
α)
(5.11)
where X◦
α is the molar property of pure α. If the property increases on mixing, then Δ¯Xmix is
positive; if the property decreases on mixing, then Δ¯Xmix is negative.
Similarly, the molar change of a property on mixing ΔXmix is given by:
ΔXmix =

α
xα( ¯Xα −X◦
α)
(5.12)
5.4
Graphical representation for binary systems
The relations derived in this section provide us a means to easily extract the partial molar properties
of a system from a graph of the corresponding molar property with repect to composition. A generic
plot of the variation of a molar property of a binary mixture with composition is given by the solid
line in Fig. 5.1. When x2 = 0, the system consists only of component 1, and the value of the molar
property should be equal to the molar property of pure component 1 X◦
1. Likewise, when x2 = 1,
the system consists only of component 2, and the value of X should be equal to X◦
2. The variation of
a molar property of an unmixed system composed of pure 1 and pure 2 is given by the thick dashed
line in Fig. 5.1.
The distance between the thick dashed line and the solid line represents the difference between a
molar property of the mixture and that of the unmixed system. This difference is equal to ΔXmix.
Now consider a line that is tangent to X (i.e., the solid line) at the composition x2 = x◦
2. This is
denoted by the thin dashed line in Fig. 5.1. The intercept of the tangent line at x2 = 0 and x2 = 1 are
equal to ¯X1 and ¯X2, respectively; that is, the intercepts of the tangent line are equal to the partial molar
properties of the system at a given composition. To demonstrate this, let’s determine the equation for

= ¯X1(x◦

(5.13)
where ¯Xα(x◦
2) is the value of the partial molar property of component α at x2 = x◦
2, and we have
used Eq. (5.8). Note that the partial molar properties ¯X1 and ¯X2 are usually functions of composition
(i.e., x2). The slope of the tangent line can be obtained from Eq. (5.10)

(5.14)

2) −¯X1(x◦
2).
Knowledge of both the value of the tangent line at a point and its slope allows us to write the equation

= ¯X1(x◦
2) + [ ¯X2(x◦

(5.15)
From Eq. (5.15), we see that when x2 = 0, the tangent line has a value equal to ¯X1(x◦
2), and when
x2 = 1, it has a value equal to ¯X2(x◦
2). This is shown graphically by the thin dashed line in Fig. 5.1.

V = x1V ◦

(5.16)
where V ◦
1 and V ◦
2 is the molar volume of pure species 1 and 2, respectively. Therefore, ΔV mix = 0
for an ideal solution. Similarly, the molar enthalpy H is given by
H = x1H◦
1 + x2H◦
2
(5.17)
where H◦
1 and H◦
2 is the molar volume of pure species 1 and 2, respectively. Therefore, ΔHmix = 0
for an ideal solution.

Partial molar properties
Equations (5.16) and (5.17) correspond to a straight line connecting the molar properties of the pure
components (e.g., the thick dashed line in Fig. 5.1). In this case, we see that the partial molar volumes
and partial molar enthalpies of each species are equal to the respective molar quantities in the pure
state. We expect ideal behavior when the ﬂuids that are mixed consist of similar molecules.
Most solutions do not exhibit ideal behavior, and the actual curve corresponding to the variation of the
molar volume or enthalpy of the mixture deviates from a straight line (e.g., the solid line in Fig. 5.1).
When the curve for the molar volume lies above the ideal mixture line, the system expands upon
mixing; when the curve lies below the line, the system contracts. In the case of the molar enthalpy, a
curve that lies above the ideal mixture line corresponds to the system that absorbs heat (e.g., mixing
lead bromide and water); a curve that lies below the line corresponds to the system releasing heat
(e.g., mixing sulfuric acid and water). This non-ideal mixing in the case of the molar enthalpy is
the principle used in cold packs and heat packs. We will develop mathematical models to describe
non-ideal mixtures. We use partial molar properties in more detail later.

Nonideal solutions
In Chapter 4, we developed the ideal solution model, which enables the estimation of the properties
of mixtures from knowledge of the thermodynamic behavior of the pure species. While the ideal
solution model does provide accurate predictions for mixtures of relatively similar substances, many
systems do exhibit substantial deviations from the ideal solution model.
In this chapter, we present methods for mathematically describing the properties of non-ideal solu-
tions — mixtures that deviate from the ideal solution model.
6.1
Deviations from Raoult’s law and the activity coefﬁcient
As discussed in Chapter 4, the vapor-liquid equilibrium between an ideal gas and an ideal liquid
solution is governed by Raoult’s law:
yαp = xαpvap
α (T),
where yα is the mole fraction of component α in the vapor phase, xα is the mole fraction in the liquid
phase, p is the pressure of the system, and pvap
α (T) is the vapor pressure of pure component α at the
system temperature T.
Raoult’s law states that the partial pressure of a species in the vapor phase is proportional to the mole
fraction of the species in the liquid phase. The constant of proportionality is the vapor pressure of the
pure species. Mathematically, this expressed as
pα = xαpvap
α (T).
(6.1)
This equation is plotted as the solid line in Fig. 6.1.
For most systems, Raoult’s law is not obeyed. If we actually measure the partial pressure of a given
component above a mixture as a function of its mole fraction, it will most often deviate from a straight
line. For example, see the dashed and dotted lines in Fig. 6.1. In order to characterize the deviations
from Raoult’s law, we deﬁne the activity coefﬁcient for component α, which is denoted by γα, as:
γα =
pα
xαpvap
α (T).
(6.2)
Note that in general, the activity coefﬁcient depends on the temperature, pressure, and composition
of the system. If the system obeys Raoult’s law, γα = 1. When γα > 1, the system is said to
exhibit positive deviation from Raoult’s law, and when γα < 1, the system is said to exhibit negative
deviation from Raoult’s law.
Although Raoult’s law is not a good approximation for many systems, there are two points at which

it is exact: (i) at xα = 0, where the partial pressure of α must equal zero, and (ii) at xα = 1, where
the partial pressure of α must be equal to pvap
α (T). From condition (ii), combined with Eq. (6.2), the
activity coefﬁcients must obey: γα →1 as xα →1.

Modiﬁed Raoult’s law
As mentioned previously, many systems show signiﬁcant deviations from Raoult’s law. There are
even some solutions, such as azeotropic mixtures, that are not even qualitatively described by Raoult’s
law. By rearranging the deﬁnition of the activity coefﬁcient γα (see Eq. (6.2)), Raoult’s law can be
generalized to apply to a wider class of mixtures:
yαp = xαγαpvap
α (T).
(6.3)
This equation is known as the modiﬁed Raoult’s law.
Raoult’s law was derived under the assumptions that the vapor phase behaved as an ideal gas and

that the liquid phase behaved as an ideal solution. In this section, we will relax the assumption that
the liquid behaves as an ideal solution to derive the modiﬁed Raoult’s law, given in Eq. (6.3). If we
re-examine the derivation of Raoult’s law, we ﬁnd that we can arrive at the modiﬁed Raoult’s law if
the chemical potential of the liquid phase can be written as:
μl
α(T, p, x2, x3, . . . ) = μ◦,l
α (T, p) + RT ln xαγα
(6.4)
where μ◦,l
α (T, p) is the chemical potential of pure component α. Note that we can divide the chemical
potential into an ideal contribution μid
α , given by the ideal solution model, and a non-ideal contribution
(or excess) μex
α , which is directly related to the activity coefﬁcient:
μα(T, p, x2, x3, . . . ) = μid
α (T, p, x2, x3, . . . ) + μex
α (T, p, x2, x3, . . . ),
(6.5)
where
μid
α (T, p, x2, x3, . . . ) = μ◦,l
α (T, p) + RT ln xα,
(6.6)
and
μex
α (T, p, x2, x3, . . . ) = RT ln γα(T, p, x2, x3, . . . ).
(6.7)
In general, an excess property Xex is deﬁned as the deviation of a property from its ideal solution
value:
Xex(T, p, x2, x3, . . . ) = X(T, p, x2, x3, . . . ) −Xid(T, p, x2, x3, . . . )
(6.8)
Substituting the expression for the chemical potential given in Eq. (6.4) into Eq. (5.7), we ﬁnd that
the Gibbs free energy of a non-ideal solution can be written as:
¯G =

Empirical activity coefﬁcient models
In order to perform quantitative thermodynamic calculations using the Gibbs free energy for a non-
ideal solution (see Eqs. (6.9)–(6.11)), we need explicit expressions for the activity coefﬁcients. A few
empirical expressions that are typically employed are:
• two-sufﬁx Margules
ln γ1 = Ax2
2
ln γ2 = Ax2
1
Gex
RT = Ax1x2
• three-sufﬁx Margules
ln γ1 = [(A + 3B) −4Bx2]x2

ln γ2 = [(A −3B) + 4Bx1]x2

RT = [A + B(x1 −x2)]x1x2

The parameters A, B, and C in the above models are, in general, functions of temperature and
pressure, but are independent of composition. These parameters are typically obtained by ﬁtting
experimental data. Given the parameters of these activity coefﬁcient models, we can predict all the
thermodynamic properties of the system.

The Gibbs-Duhem equation
Not all the chemical potentials (and therefore, the activity coefﬁcients) in a mixture are independent
of each other. They are all related to one another through the Gibbs-Duhem equation. To derive this
equation, we start with the fundamental equation of thermodynamics for the Gibbs free energy, which
can be written as
d¯G = −¯SdT + ¯V dp +

This relation is known as the Gibbs-Duhem equation. Dividing both sides of the equation by the total
number of moles in the system, we ﬁnd that the Gibbs-Duhem equation can also be written as

α
xαdμα = −SdT + V dp
(6.14)
The Gibbs-Duhem equation provides a relation between the chemical potentials of each of the chem-
ical species in a given phase. At constant temperature and pressure, this relation simpliﬁes to

The chemical potential can be written in terms of the activity coefﬁcient (see Eq (6.4)). Subsituting

where in the last line we have used the relationship 
α dxα = 0. This equation provides a rela-
tionship between the activity coefﬁcients of all of the components in a system. Therefore, not all
the activity coefﬁcients in a system are independent. If we know the activity coefﬁcients for all but
one of the components in a mixture, we can determine the unknown activity coefﬁcient by using the
Gibbs-Duhem equation. We demonstrate this for a binary system.
Suppose we know the activity coefﬁcient of component 1 γ1 as a function of composition. Then, we
can determine the activity coefﬁcient of component 2 γ2:

Azeotropic systems

For a binary mixture, the modiﬁed Raoult’s law can be written as

Stability
In this Chapter, we consider the mathematical and geometric properties of the free energy of a system
which govern its thermodynamic stability. In regions where the free energy satisﬁes the conditions
for stability, the system remains in a single phase; however, if these conditions are violated, then the
system can phase separate into two or more coexisting phases. We then discuss how the conditions
for stability on the free energy leads to conditions on the value of the parameters in activity coefﬁcient
models. Finally, we derive the mathematical equations for the coexistence between two liquid phases.
7.1
Introduction
A system at constant temperature, pressure, and mole numbers tries to decrease its Gibbs free energy.
At equilibrium, the Gibbs free energy of the system is minimized.
In Fig. 7.1, the solid line represents the variation of the molar Gibbs free energy of a mixture as a
function of composition. The thick dashed line represents the variation of the molar Gibbs free energy
of a completely unmixed system, with one phase consisting of pure component 1 and the other phase
consisting of pure component 2. The distance between the solid line and the dashed line denotes the
Gibbs free energy change on mixing. Because the solid line always lies beneath the dashed line, the
system possesses a lower Gibbs free energy when mixed than when separated and, therefore, prefers
to be mixed. If the opposite were true, then the system would prefer to be phase separated.
The solid line in Fig. 7.2 represents the molar Gibbs free energy of mixture that becomes unstable.
The thick dashed line, as in Fig. 7.2, represents the molar Gibbs free energy of a completely unmixed
system. The solid line always lies beneath the dashed line, and so the mixture will not phase separate
to form two completely demixed phases. However, consider the line joining the points A and B,
which lies beneath the solid line. The line AB represents the molar Gibbs free energy of a system
that is separated into two phases, one with composition x′
2 and the other with composition x′′
2. This
partially demixed system has a lower Gibbs free energy than the fully mixed system (solid line), and,
therefore, a mixture which is at a composition between x′
2 and x′′
2 will spontaneously demix to form
these two, coexisting phases. Another point to note, is that because the tangent line at x′
2 and x′′
2
coincide, the chemical potentials in each of the two corresponding phases are identical, which is the
criterion for phase equilibrium.
In general, a mixture is unstable when
∂2G
∂x2
2
< 0
(7.1)
Graphically, this means that the Gibbs free energy is concave down with respect to x2 (e.g., see the
solid line in Fig. 7.2 between x′
2 and x′′
2). In this situation, any line that connects two points on the
curve will lie below the curve, and thus the mixture will want to phase separate.

An ideal solution is never unstable and will always remain as a single phase mixture. To prove this,
we need to demonstrate that ∂2Gid/∂x2
2 is always positive. For a binary mixture, the molar Gibbs
free energy of an ideal solution is given by
Gid = x1μ◦
1 + x2μ◦
2 + RTx1 ln x1 + RTx2 ln x2

solution model is always stable.

To model a mixture that phase separates into two coexisting liquid phase, we need to add non-ideal
terms (activity coefﬁcients) to the ideal solution model. As an example of this, we examine the
stability of the two-sufﬁx Margules model, which has a molar Gibbs free energy of

Solid-liquid equilibrium
8.1
Introduction
At atmospheric pressure, water will freeze at 0◦C. If a solute is added to water, then the mixture will
freeze at a lower temperature. This is known as freezing point depression and occurs with any general
mixture. Using a model for the activity coefﬁcients, we can quantitatively predict the magnitude of
this effect.
8.2
Phase behavior
To demonstrate the general freezing behavior of a binary mixture, we present the solid-liquid phase
diagram for systems of ethanol and water at 1 atm in Fig. 8.1. The solid line with the ﬁlled symbols
is the freezing curve of water in the mixture. Above the curve the solution is completely liquid;
below the curve, it is a liquid mixture coexists with solid water (i.e., ice). At this pressure, pure water
freezes at 273.15 K. As ethanol is added to the solution, the temperature at which ice begins to form
in gradually decreases.
The dotted line with the open symbols on the right side of the diagram is the freezing curve of
ethanol in the mixture. As one passes downward through this curve, solid ethanol precipitates from
the solution. Note that the temperature at which ethanol begins to freeze decreases as the amount
of water in the solution increases. Therefore, we see that the addition of impurities decreases the
freezing temperature of a substance. This phenomena is known as freezing point depression.
The point where the two freezing curves intersect with each other is called the eutectic point. This is
the lowest temperature at which a binary mixture can remain in liquid without either of its components
precipitating.
Finally, we note that below the dotted line in Fig. 8.1 the system exists as two coexisting solid phases:
one consisting of pure ice, and the other composed of pure solid ethanol. The relative amounts of
these two phases is given by the lever rule.
8.3
Conditions for equilibrium
In this section, we derive the equation that governs the shape of the freezing curve. Let’s consider the
freezing of a species in a general multicomponent mixture. We make the assumption that the solid
phase consists of pure component α. At equilibrium, the chemical potential of the solid phase is the

ΔGα, then we could use Eq. (8.1) to predict the freezing temperature T of the mixture.
One method to approximate the function ΔGα is by using a Taylor series expansion around the
temperature Tm, the melting temperature of pure α at pressure p. This yields

ΔGα(Tm, p) = 0

Therefore, the ﬁrst term of the Taylor series expansion in Eq. (8.2) vanishes.
From the fundamental equation of thermodynamics, we arrive at

where ΔSα is the molar entropy change of freezing. From the relation G = H −TS, we can relate
the entropy change of freezing to the enthalpy of freezing ΔHα, which is the heat released by the
system when it transforms from a liquid to a solid:
ΔGα(Tm, p) = ΔHα(Tm, p) −TmΔSα(Tm, p)

Gas solubility and Henry’s law

Gas solubility and Henry’s law
In order to describe vapor-liquid equilibria, we have been using Raoult’s law (see Eq. (6.1)) or the
modiﬁed Raoult’s law (see Eq. (6.3)). One of the required inputs to the modiﬁed Raoult’s law is the
vapor pressure pvap
α (T) of each component α in the pure state; this is the pressure below which pure
liquid α will begin to boil (or vaporize) at a given temperature T. However, the vapor pressure of a
substance is only deﬁned at temperatures below its critical temperature. Above the critical temper-
ature, the vapor pressure is undeﬁned (recall that the vapor pressure curve terminates at the critical
point). Therefore, Raoult’s law and the modiﬁed Raoult’s law are only applicable if the critical tem-
peratures of all the components in the system are above the system temperature.
This presents difﬁculties when we want to examine the solubility of gases, such as oxygen which has a
critical temperature of Tc = 154.59 K and nitrogen which has a critical temperature of Tc = 126.21 K,
in liquids. The critical temperature of these gases are well below ambient temperatures. For these
systems, another approach is required to determine the conditions for vapor-liquid equilibrium.
9.1
Henry’s law
Let’s consider a binary mixture of carbon dioxide and hexane at a temperature of 393.15 K. The
critical temperature of hexane is 507.5 K, which is higher than the system temperature, so pure liquid
hexane can exist as a liquid. The critical temperature of carbon dioxide is 304.2 K, which is lower than
the system temperature. Consequently, pure carbon dioxide does not possess a vapor-liquid transition
at this temperature, and its vapor pressure is undeﬁned. Raoult’s law cannot be applied to this system.
In Fig. 9.1, we plot the variation of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide with the mole fraction of
the gas dissolved in a liquid mixture of carbon dioxide and hexane. When xCO2 = 0, the system
consists solely of hexane, and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide is zero. The vapor space consists
entirely of hexane at its vapor pressure. As the concentration of carbon dioxide dissolved in the liquid
phase increases, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the vapor phase also increases. However,
for xCO2 > 0.7, the liquid phase no longer exists; above this mole fraction, the system is a one phase
vapor (or gas) mixture.
For this system, we cannot apply Raoult’s law, as the vapor pressure of carbon dioxide is undeﬁned
because the system temperature is above its critical temperature. To overcome this difﬁculty, for each
component that has a critical temperature below the system temperature, we replace Raoult’s law with
Henry’s law, ﬁrst proposed by J. W. Henry in 1800 to empirically describe the solubility of gases:
pα = Kα(T)xα,
(9.1)
where Kα(T) is known as the Henry’s law constant.
The Henry’s law constant is equal to the slope of the partial pressure of component α at inﬁnite

mixture is low. Kα(T) plays analogous role as the vapor pressure in Raoult’s law (see Eq. (6.1)).

Even if a component has a vapor pressure at the system temperature (i.e., its critical temperature is
greater than the system temperature), we still may prefer to use Henry’s law instead of Raoult’s law.
This is usually done for components that are very dilute, where Henry’s law becomes more and more
accurate.
If we compare Henry’s law and the modiﬁed Raoult’s law, then we ﬁnd that Henry’s law can be

Equations of state
An equation of state (EOS) provides a relation between the pressure, temperature, volume, and com-
position of a system. Typically, this is given as an explicit function of temperature, molar volume,
and composition p = p(T, V, x2, x3, · · · ). One example is the ideal gas law, where the pressure is
given by
p = RT
V
(10.1)
where R is the universal gas constant.
Real materials have much more complicated equations of state. In this chapter, we present other
equations of state that are used to model real systems and demonstrate how to use them to determine
various thermodynamics properties from them.
10.1
The principle of corresponding states
The properties of different ﬂuids are in general quite different from each other. In Fig. 10.1, we plot
the liquid-vapor coexistence curves for a variety of ﬂuids. However, Guggenheim observed that if
the properties of a certain class ﬂuids are plotted in terms of reduced variables, variables divided by
their critical values, the data can be collapsed onto a single curve, independent of the identity of the
ﬂuid. This can be seen on the right plots in Fig. 10.1. This collapse of the properties is known as the
principle of corresponding states.
This observation implies that the thermodynamic properties of all materials are given by a single,
“universal” function, independent of the identity of the material. For example, deﬁning the compress-
ibility factor Z as
Z = pV
RT ,
(10.2)
the principle of corresponding states implies that
Z = Z(Tr, pr)
(10.3)
where Tr = T/Tc is the reduced temperature, pr = p/pc is the reduced pressure, Tc is the critical
temperature of the material, and pc is its critical pressure.
Guggenheim observed that this principle actually holds very well for many simple ﬂuids, ﬂuids com-
posed of molecules that are roughly spherical. However, in general, this principle does not hold for
an arbitrary ﬂuid, in particular, for polar ﬂuids, such as water, and for ﬂuids composed of highly
non-spherical molecules, such has n-hexane.
Pitzer noticed that as the molecules in a ﬂuid begin to elongate and deviate from a spherical shape,

the slope of the vapor pressure curve increased in magnitude. In order to quantify this effect, Pitzer
deﬁned the accentric factor ω as
ω = −1 −log10
pvap(T = 0.7Tc)
pc
(10.4)
For spherical molecules, ω is approximately equal to zero.
This generalized principle of corresponding states implies that the compressibility factor of a ﬂuid
can be expressed as
Z = Z(Tr, pr, ω)
(10.5)
Various approximations for this function have been developed in the literature and are presented
in standard reference texts. Therefore, given this function, we can determine the thermodynamic
behavior of a compound from knowledge of its critical temperature, critical pressure.

The van der Waals equation and cubic equations of state
The basic assumption in deriving the ideal gas equation of state is that the interactions between the
molecules that compose the gas are negligible. At very low densities, where the average distance
between molecules is extremely large compared to the range of the intermolecular interactions (or
size of a molecule) and collisions between molecules occur only rarely, this assumption is fairly good.
However, for moderately dense gases, this assumption begins to breakdown, as collisions between
molecules become more and more frequent. In the case of liquids, this assumption is completely
erroneous, as intermolecular interactions dominate the properties of the liquid.
To account for the ﬁnite size of molecules in the system. If we consider molecules to be of volume b,
then the actual volume available to the system is approximately V −b. Therefore, we replace V in
the ideal gas equation of state with V −b. In addition, at large distances, the molecules in a gas exert
an attractive interaction between each other due to dispersion forces. The van der Waals equation
of state, which accounts for both the short-ranged repulsions and long-ranged attractions between
molecules, is given by
p =
RT
V −b −a
V 2
(10.6)
A schematic plot of the variation of the pressure with volume, as predicted by the van der Waals
equation of state, at various temperatures is given in Fig. 10.2. At temperatures above the critical
temperature, the pressure-volume variation is monotonic and qualitatively similar to that of an ideal
gas (see dotted-line). At temperatures below the critical temperature, the pressure-volume curve be-
gins to oscillate, exhibiting a “van der Waals” loop (see dashed-line). This behavior is unphysical, but
represents the vapor-liquid transition, and should be replaced by the solid line. The precise location
of the solid line is given by the Maxwell construction.
When the temperature is equal to the critical temperature, the pressure-volume curve exhibits a point
with the inﬂection (concavity) of the curve changes sign. This occurs at the critical point, where we
have:

Equations of state for mixtures
Thus far, we have only been considering single component systems. One method of extending an
equation of state to mixtures is by making the parameters a and b a function of composition. This
is done through the application of mixing rules. For example, we can deﬁne the parameter b of the
mixture as
b =

α
yαbα
(10.20)
where bα is the b parameter for pure α, and yα is the mole fraction of α in the system.
Similarly, we can deﬁne the parameter a of the mixture as
a =

α,α′
yαyα′aαα′
(10.21)
where aαα′ = (1−kαα′)(aαaα′)1/2, aα is the a parameter of pure α, and kαα′ is the binary interaction
parameter between species α and α′. The binary interaction parameter kαα′ is a purely empirical
parameter that is used to obtain better agreement between the predictions of the equation of state and
experimental data. Typical values of the parameter are given in Table 2.

Thermodynamics from equations of state
Equations of state relate the pressure, temperature, volume, and composition of a system to each
other. In this Chapter, we show how to determine other thermodynamic properties of the system
from an equation of state. In a typical equation of state, the pressure is given as an explicit function
of temperature, volume, and composition. Therefore, the “natural” variables are the temperature,
volume, and composition of the system. That is, once given the volume, temperature, and composition
of the system, the pressure is readily calculated from the equation of state.
Once one of the free energies of a system is known as a function of its natural variables, then all
the other thermodynamic properties of the system can be derived. For these equations of states, the
Helmholtz free energy is the relevant quantity. In the following, we demonstrate how to determine
the Helmholtz free energy from an equation and then proceed to show how to derive other properties
from it.
11.1
The residual Helmholtz free energy
The free energy that has temperature, volume, and mole numbers as its natural variables is the
Helmholtz free energy. Before we stated that once the Gibb’s free energy of a system is known as a
function of temperature, pressure, and mole numbers ¯G(T, p, N1, N2, . . . ), all the thermodynamics
of the system are known. This is equivalent to the statement that once the Helmholtz free energy is
known as a function of temperature, volume, and mole numbers of the system ¯A(T, V, N1, N2, . . . ),
all the thermodynamics of the system are known. The fundamental equation of thermodynamics can
be written in terms of the Helmholtz free energy as
d¯A = −¯SdT −pd¯V +

Given and equation of state, we can determine an explicit expression for the Helmholtz free energy
from the fundamental equation of thermodynamics. At constant temperature and mole numbers, we
have
d¯A = −pd¯V

By integrating both sides of this equation from a total volume ¯V1 to a total volume ¯V2

Fugacity
An ideal gas is an ideal solution. Thus, the chemical potential of species α in an ideal gas mixture at
temperature T, pressure p, and species mole fractions y1, y2,. . . is given by
μig
α (T, p, y1, y2, . . . ) = μ◦,ig
α (T, p) + RT ln yα
(11.16)
where μ◦,ig
α (T, p) is the chemical potential of pure α.
The difference in the chemical potential of an ideal gas at pressure p and mole fractions y1, y2, . . . and
an ideal gas at pressure p′ and mole fractions y′
1, y′
2,. . . is given by
μig
α (T, p, y1, y2, . . . ) = μig
α (T, p′, y′
1, y′
2, . . . ) + RT ln yαp
y′αp′
= μig
α (T, p′, y′
1, y′
2, . . . ) + RT ln pα
p′α
(11.17)
Note that we have made use of the relation In analogy with ideal gases, we deﬁne the fugacity of a
real gas as
μα(T, p, y1, y2, . . . ) = μα(T, p′, y′
1, y′
2, . . . ) + RT ln fα(T, p, y1, y2, . . . )
fα(T, p′, y′
1, y′
2, . . . )
(11.18)
where fα is a function of temperature, pressure, and the system composition.
The fugacity coefﬁcient φα is deﬁned as
φα = fα
pα
= fα
yαp
(11.19)
This gives us the difference between the chemical potential of the system and the chemical potential
of an ideal gas at the same temperature, pressure, and composition. That is:
μα(T, p, y2, y3, . . . ) −μig
α (T, p, y2, y3, . . . ) = RT ln φα
(11.20)
The residual chemical potential is equal to the difference between the chemical potential of the system
and the chemical potential of an ideal gas at the same temperature, molar volume, and composition.
The difference given in Eq. (11.20) is between the system and an ideal gas at the same temperature,
pressure, and composition. This is not the same as the residual chemical potential. However, the
two quantities are related. If we consider an ideal gas with the same molar volume as the system, its
pressure will be equal to p′ = RT/V , which will, in general, not be equal to the actual pressure p of

(11.21)

α (T, p′ = RT/V, y2, y3, . . . ) + RT ln Z
(11.22)
where Z is the compressibility factor of the system. Substituting this expression in to Eq. (11.20), we
ﬁnd:
RT ln φα = μα(T, p, y2, y3, . . . ) −μig
α (T, p, y2, y3, . . . )
= μα(T, p, y2, y3, . . . ) −μig
α (T, p′, y2, y3, . . . ) −RT ln Z
= μres
α (T, p, y2, y3, . . . ) −RT ln Z
(11.23)
Therefore, given an equation of state, we can use Eq. (11.23) to obtain an expression for the fugacity
coefﬁcient of a system.
11.3
Vapor-liquid equilibrium with a non-ideal vapor phase
Raoult’s law assumes that the liquid phase is an ideal solution and the vapor phase is an ideal gas.
With an equation of state, such as the van der Waals equation of state, the vapor phase can now
described more realistically, and we do not need to make the ideal gas assumption. In this situation,
the chemical potential of the vapor phase
μα(T, p, y2, . . . ) = μ◦

If the vapor phase is ideal, then the fugacity coefﬁcients are equal to one, and we see that Eq. (11.25)
becomes the modiﬁed Raoult’s law that we have derived previously.
We do not need to apply an activity coefﬁcient for the liquid phase. In fact, we can, in principle, apply
the equation of state to determine the thermodynamics of both phases. In this case, we have

Chemical reaction equilibria
In this section, we discuss the thermodynamics of systems undergoing chemical reactions. First we
derive the conditions for equilibrium. Then, we generalize the Gibbs phase rule for reacting systems.
Afterwards, we examine the calculation of the and introduce the equilibrium constant. Finally, we
examine the inﬂuence of pressure and temperature on chemical reaction equilibria.
12.1
Conditions for equilibrium
Let’s consider a system that initially contains N (0)
N2 moles of nitrogen, N (0)
H2 moles of hydrogen, and
N (0)
NH3 moles of ammonia. This system can undergo the following reversible chemical reaction:
N2 + 3H2 ⇌2NH3
(12.1)
where nitrogen and hydrogen react to form ammonia, or ammonia can decompose to form nitrogen
and hydrogen.
If the reaction proceeds forward by ξ moles (i.e., ξ moles of nitrogen combine with 3ξ moles of
hydrogen combine to form 2ξ moles of ammonia), then, from a mole balance, the number of moles
of each species in the system is given by
NN2 = N (0)
N2 −ξ
NH2 = N (0)
H2 −3ξ
NNH3 = N (0)
NH3 + 2ξ
(12.2)
The quantity ξ is known as the extent of reaction. If the system does not react, then the extent
of reaction equals zero (i.e., ξ = 0), and the mole numbers are equal to their initial value (i.e.,
Nα = N (0)
α ). If the reaction proceeds backwards (i.e., ammonia decomposes into nitrogen and
hydrogen), then ξ has a negative value.
Note that the coefﬁcient in front of the extent of reaction in the second term on the right side of
Eqs. (12.2) is known as the stoichiometric coefﬁcient for the component in the reaction. For a general
reaction, we have
Nα = N (0)
α
+ ναξ
(12.3)
where να is the stoichiometric coefﬁcient for component α in the reaction. The stoichiometric coef-
ﬁcient is positive for products of the reaction, and it is negative for the reactants of the reaction. The
absolute value of the stoichiometric coefﬁcient of a component is equal to the numerical value of its
coefﬁcient in the reaction. For example, in the reaction given in Eq. (12.1), we have
νN2 = −1,
νH2 = −3,
νNH3 = 2

Chemical reaction equilibria
From Eq. (12.3), we directly relate the changes of the number of moles of species α with the change
in the extent of reaction:
dNα = ναdξ
(12.5)
For an isolated system where the total energy and volume are constant (i.e., d¯U = 0 and ¯V = 0), the
total entropy is maximized at equilibrium; therefore, we must have d¯S = 0. The change in entropy
of a system with respect to changes in the energy, volume, and number of moles of each species is
given by (see Eq. (3.1))
d¯S = 1

(12.6)
where we have used Eq. (12.5) to relate changes in the mole numbers to the extent of reaction.
In order to ensure that d¯S = 0, the coefﬁcient of the dξ term must equal zero. Consequently, the
criterion for chemical reaction equilibrium is

α
ναμα = 0
(12.7)
for each chemical reaction that takes place in the system.

Chemical reaction equilibria
12.2
The phase rule for chemically reacting systems
Because the presence of chemical reactions introduces additional constraints on a system, we need
to reconsider the Gibbs phase rule. In the absence of chemical reactions, the number of degrees of
freedom f in a system is given by
f = 2 + ω −π
where ω is the number of components, and π is the number of phases.
For a system with chemical reactions, there is one addition equation (see Eq. (12.7)) for every in-
dependent chemical reaction in the system. The presence of chemical reactions, therefore, imposes
constraints on a system, which decrease its degrees of freedom. The phase rule now becomes:
f = 2 + ω −π −r
(12.8)
where r is the number of independent reactions.
12.3
Gas phase reactions
Now we discuss how to calculate the equilibrium composition of a reacting non-ideal gas mixture. In
order to use Eq. (12.7), we need an expression for the dependence of the chemical potential of each
species in the system with its composition. In general, this can be expressed as (see Sec. 11):
μα(T, p, y2, y3, . . . ) = μig,◦
α (T, p0) + RT ln yαφαp
p0
(12.9)
where μig,◦
α
(T, p) is the chemical potential of pure α in an ideal gas state at temperature T and
pressure p, and p0 is a reference pressure (typically taken to be either 1 atm or 1 bar). Inserting this
expression for the chemical potentials into the condition for chemical reaction equilibrium Eq. (12.7),
we ﬁnd

α (T, p0) is the Gibbs free energy of reaction.
The equilibrium constant and the Gibbs free energy of reaction are independent of the composition
and pressure of the system but are dependent on the temperature of the system and the choice of the
reference pressure. The greater the value of the equilibrium constant (which corresponds to more
negative values of the Gibbs free energy of reaction), the further the reaction proceeds to completion.
Given a value for the equilibrium constant and the pressure of the system, Eq. (12.10) can be solved
to determine the equilibrium composition of the system. In the next section, we discuss how to
determine the value of the equilibrium constant.
12.4
The standard Gibbs free energy of formation
In order to determine the equilibrium constant, we need to be able to compute the Gibbs free energy
of reaction ΔGrxn. This is dependent on the quantities μig,◦
α
(T, p0) — the chemical potential of pure
species α in an ideal gas state at temperature T and pressure p0. These can be directly related to the
standard Gibbs free energy of formation.
The standard Gibbs free energy of formation of a compound is deﬁned as the Gibbs free energy
change for the reaction of forming one mole of the compound from its constituent elements in their
standard state at a temperature of 25◦C and a pressure of 1 bar (or 1 atm). The standard state of an
element is its stable form at 25◦C and 1 bar. For example, the standard state for oxygen is the form
O2 in the (ideal) gas state, the standard state for bromine is in the liquid state, and the standard state
for carbon is in the form of graphite. The standard Gibbs free energy of formation of elements in their
standard state at 25◦C and 1 bar is deﬁned to be zero. Tabulations of values for the standard Gibbs
free energy of formation for a broad range of compounds can be found in standard references, such
as the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics or Perry’s Handbook of Chemical Engineering, or
on online resource, such as the NIST Chemistry webbook (http://webbook.nist.gov). The
standard enthalpy and Gibbs free energy of formation are listed in Table 3.

and p = 1 bar.

Chemical reaction equilibria
The Gibbs free energy of the reaction in Eq. (12.1) can be obtained from Table 3
ΔGrxn(25◦C, 1 bar) = 2(−16.45) −1(0.00) −3(0.00) = −32.9 kJ mol−1,
From this, we can compute the corresponding value of the equilibrium constant.
Tables of the standard Gibbs free energy of formation allow the calculation of the equilibrium constant
at standard conditions (i.e., T = 25◦C and p = 1 bar). However, in most situations, we require
the equilibrium constant at other conditions. In the next section, we discuss how to estimate the
equilibrium constant at other temperatures.
12.5
The inﬂuence of temperature
Often, we want to know how the equilibrium constant depends on temperature to determine the opti-
mal conditions to perform a reaction. To determine this, we need to know how ΔGrxn/(RT) changes
with temperature. The variation of the Gibbs free energy with temperature is given by

(12.12)
which leads to

(12.13)
Therefore, we ﬁnd that the Gibbs free energy of reaction can be obtained directly from the enthalpy

(12.14)
In order to utilize this equation, we need to know how the enthalpy of reaction varies with temperature.
One approximation is to assume that the enthalpy of reaction is approximately independent of tem-
perature. We can now perform the above integration with respect to T ′ to obtain:

components involved in the reaction.
With this expression for ΔGrxn, the corresponding expression for the temperature dependence of the
equilibrium constant is:

For an exothermic reaction, where ΔHrxn(T0, p) < 0, an increase in temperature will lead to a
decrease in the equilibrium constant, thereby shifting the reaction to the reactants side. For an en-
dothermic reaction, where ΔHrxn(T0, p) > 0, an increase in temperature will lead to an increase in
the equilibrium constant, thereby shifting the reaction to the products side.
