Encapsulation: “Preparing & passing the data by any Upper layer 
to the layer below it, is called Encapsulation”
(Means, going from the application layer all the way down to the physical layer)
Decapsulation: “Decoding data while going Upwards from the 
physical layer till application layer is called decapsulation”
What is TCP/IP Model ???
“TCP/IP Model is a standardised Reference Framework for conceptualising data 
communications between networks”
Relevant RFC: RFC1122
Also called ’Internet Model’ or ‘DoD Model’

TCP/IP Model – Cheat sheet (ATech)
Protocols at each TCP/IP Layer
Devices at each TCP/IP Layer
Important Ports on Transport Layer
OSI Model Vs TCP/IP Model
OSI Model
TCP/IP Model
Mostly used for reference purposes only
Practical Model in use today
Released in 1984 by ISO
Released in 1970s by DARPA
Each layer participates in Error Handling
Only Transport Layer handles Errors
Not so simple Model (7 Layers)
Simple Model (4Layers only)
Session Layer does Connection Management
Transport Layer does Connection Mgmt
Data Formatting is done by Present. Layer
Data Formatting is done by Application Layer
Uses Horizontal Approach
Uses Vertical Approach
---
Trans Layer uses 3WHS + Sliding Windows
Transport Layer is Connection Oriented
Trans Layer can be Connection Oriented or not
Netw Layer can be Connection Oriented or not
Network Layer is always Connectionless
Services & protocols are clearly defined
Services & protocols are not clearly separated
A protocol independent Model
A Protocol dependent Model
Hosts do not handle network operations
Hosts participate in most network protocols
