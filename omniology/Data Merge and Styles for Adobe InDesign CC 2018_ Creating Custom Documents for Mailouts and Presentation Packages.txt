Acknowledgments
For their patience and advice, I would like to thank the following people, without whom 
I could never have written this book. My parents encouraged me to read large computer 
textbooks that would one day inspire me to write my own books. My Dad reviewed the 
first draft before I sent a proposal. My program coordinator, Raymond Chow at Langara 
College, gave me the chance to teach evening courses when others would not give me 
that opportunity or believe that I had anything worthy to contribute. My printing boss, 
Eddie, at Pender Copy, Ltd., inspired and encouraged me to write this book that he 
thought every graphic designer should read. At Apress, I would like to thank Natalie and 
Jessica for showing me how to lay out a professional textbook and pointing out even when 
you think you’ve written it all there’s still more to write. Thanks also go to Jim Markham 
and the technical reviewer Logan West for taking the time to test my files and their 
encouraging comments. Thank you also to the rest of the Apress team for printing this 
book and making my dream a reality. I am truly grateful and blessed.

Introduction
Welcome to the first step in an exciting journey I’ve called Data Merge and Styles for 
Adobe InDesign CC 2018. In the seven chapters that follow, you will discover that you can 
harness the power of Adobe InDesign’s Data Merge and Style panels. Whether you’re 
creating custom mailings or working on other mail-merge needs, you can familiarize 
yourself with this powerful InDesign panel in this in-depth, step-by-step guide. This 
book shows you how to easily create, edit, and print data merged documents that match 
specific branding and style guidelines.
You’ll learn how to use Microsoft Excel to create a faster workflow and quickly turn 
your Adobe InDesign CC 2018 files into printer-ready files. In this book, we’ll also look at 
how to apply paragraph and character styles to your text and how you can alter formatting 
using Global Regular Expressions Print (GREPs).
With Data Merge and Styles for Adobe InDesign CC 2018 as your guide, you’ll learn 
how to save time and money by mastering all the peculiarities and powerful features of 
Adobe InDesign Data Merge. By the end of this book, you’ll be able to streamline your 
workflow and avoid using Microsoft Word’s mail merge and back-and-forth edits.
What You’ll Learn
• 
Chapter 1: Build a custom workspace for all your Data Merge 
projects.
• 
Chapter 2: Build a numbering sequence for tickets using 
paragraph styles.
• 
Chapter 3: Create single-record data merges for single-page and 
multipage documents that include paragraph styles.
• 
Chapter 4: Create single-record data merges with, text, images, 
and QR codes that includes paragraph styles.
• 
Chapter 5: Build a double numbering sequence for tickets and 
information cards with multiple Data Merge records.

CHAPTER 1
Introduction: Creating a 
Workspace
Welcome to working with Data Merge and Styles in Adobe InDesign.
In 2005 when I started working with a print house as a freelance graphic artist, some 
of the clients that the owner of the print house and I worked for had to print various 
mailings for communication and corporate events. In the past, I had created labels for 
our clients using Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word Mail Merge. However, there were 
instances where I had to lay out some of the artwork in Adobe InDesign or the client 
supplied only a PDF of the artwork. Working with these graphics in Microsoft Word along 
with a Mail Merge did not always produce the desired results. Often, I only had few hours 
to create the custom file that consisted of more than 100 pages. There was little time to 
experiment with a new layout in Word and setup of the Excel data when it was formatted 
incorrectly. I took some time, therefore, to learn the features of InDesign Data Merge 
and found that it was very much like the Mail Merge in Word. Over the years, my printing 
boss and I have had many clients ask us to create data merged files for their mailings and 
corporate events. The following chapters detail some of the main uses for Data Merge, but 
I am sure that after you have read this book you will be able to find additional ways to use 
the Data Merge within your company.
■
■Note  There are no Assignment files for this chapter.
Table 1-1 is an example of two custom cover letters where data from the Microsoft 
Excel file was either added via a Mail Merge in Microsoft Word or via the Data Merge 
Panel in Adobe InDesign. The data from the Excel file is shown in bold and italics for 
comparison purposes.

Chapter 1 ■ Introduction: Creating a Workspace

If you are new to Adobe InDesign CC, I would recommend that you read Adobe 
InDesign CC Classroom in a Book by Kelly Kordes Anton and John Cruise. Please note that 
although this book can teach you the basics of Adobe InDesign and some layout styles, it 
does not address Data Merge in any detail.
Note that this book does not address the creation of electronic publications (ePUB) 
in InDesign CC, although you could use the Data Merge feature in the process of a layout 
for a custom book or file, as you will see in later chapters. You will also be reviewing many 
of the options of the Paragraph and Character Styles panels as they relate to the Data 
Merge. However, those options that do not relate to the Data Merge or specifically to 
ePUB creation will be skipped over.
If you have used InDesign for several years and want to learn how to use the Data 
Merge panel efficiently for your next printing project, then I am sure that you will find this 
book to be very helpful.
As a review, let’s begin by setting up the Adobe InDesign CC 2018 program and our 
workspace.
■
■Note   Adobe InDesign’s Data Merge has been included in the program since version 
CS2. Although you might be able to complete most of the tutorials within this book with an 
older version of InDesign, the screen shots that you view might be different than what you 
see in your program. I recommend that you update to the latest version of InDesign CC with 
your Creative Cloud subscription.

Cleaning Up Your Workspace:
Open Adobe InDesign CC 2018
If you use Adobe InDesign every day like I do, your interface might have become a bit 
cluttered. Let’s start by cleaning it up. Refer to Figure 1-1.
Table 1-1.  Data Merge Example of a Letter

Vancouver, BC V3Q 9R7
Dear Mary, Welcome to the sales 
convention, in your presentation package 
you will find ….

Chapter 1 ■ Introduction: Creating a Workspace
3
In the upper right corner of the InDesign interface you will find the Workspaces as in 
Figures 1-1 and 1-2. Alternativelty, from the menu, you can go to Window ➤ Workspaces. 
Currently I am using the Essentials workspace, but you might be using a different one.
For this lesson, let’s begin by resetting the workspace. From the Essentials drop-down 
menu, select Reset Essentials, as shown in Figure 1-2.
Figure 1-1.  The InDesign CC interface with a closeup of the menu for altering the 
workspace. Currently it is set to Essentials.

Chapter 1 ■ Introduction: Creating a Workspace

As displayed in Figure 1-3, the workspace is now considerably cleaner.
Figure 1-2.  The Essentials drop-down menu has Reset Essentials selected
Figure 1-3.  The InDesign workspace is now cleaned up and ready for your next project

Chapter 1 ■ Introduction: Creating a Workspace
5
■
■Note   If you select other workspaces, none of the workspaces contain the Data Merge 
panel. You will create a new workspace for that shortly so that you can use it for all the 
chapters in this book.
Create a New Document
From the File menu, choose New ➤ Document, as shown in Figure 1-4.
Figure 1-4.  Use the File menu to create a new document
InDesign has a new panel so that you can easily choose to create a custom layout for 
print, web, or mobile or one of the document presets within the software. It also allows 
you to buy or use free templates others have created, as shown in Figure 1-5.
Figure 1-5.  The New Document dialog box with its assorted options

Chapter 1 ■ Introduction: Creating a Workspace
6
For this book, you will focus on the Print tab and a new blank letter document.
Clear the Facing Pages check box, as you will be mostly working with a single-sheet 
layout.
Click Create, and a new document will appear as displayed in Figure 1-6.
Figure 1-6.  A new document appears in the InDesign interface ready for you to work with
■
■Note   If, for some reason, you clicked Save Document Preset while naming your 
document by mistake and saved the preset, refer to Figure 1-7.

Chapter 1 ■ Introduction: Creating a Workspace
7
You can remove the preset. Close the New Document dialog box and then under File ➤ 
Document Preset ➤ Define, click Delete and click OK to remove it. Click OK again to exit the 
dialog box. Refer to Figures 1-8 and 1-9.
Figure 1-7.  Clicking Save Document Preset causes this message to appear. If you don’t 
want to save this, click Cancel before continuing

Chapter 1 ■ Introduction: Creating a Workspace
8
Figure 1-8.  To remove unwanted document presets, click Delete

Optional: Removing Custom Page Sizes
Likewise, you might have custom page sizes that you want to remove so that they don’t 
appear in the New Document Setting dialog box.
Go to File ➤ Document Setup to open the dialog box shown in Figure 1-10.
Figure 1-10.  The Document Setup dialog box
Figure 1-11.  From Document Setup dialog box Page Size drop-down menu, click Custom ….
As shown in Figure 1-11, from the Page Size drop-down menu, select Custom ….

Chapter 1 ■ Introduction: Creating a Workspace
10
In this case I have one custom page size that I don’t require anymore. You might have 
none, want to keep the ones you have, or create new ones, so this step is optional. Select 
the custom page size, click Delete, and then click OK to close the Custom Page Size dialog 
box (see Figure 1-12).
Figure 1-12.  Remove a custom page size by selecting it and clicking Delete
Now let’s adjust our preferences.
Setting Up Your Preferences
From the Main Menu go to Edit ➤ Preferences ➤ General.
■
■Note   You will only be adjusting specific preferences for this book.
General Tab
On the General tab, make sure that the Show “Start” Workspace When No Documents Are 
Open check box is cleared. Because you want to open the new dialog box only when you 
decide to create a new file. Otherwise, leave the other settings as shown in Figure 1-13.

Chapter 1 ■ Introduction: Creating a Workspace
11
Interface Tab
Now click the Interface tab, which allows you to alter the color of an InDesign layout. 
Because I work in a printing environment, I prefer a neutral gray so that I can view colors 
as true as possible to print. A layout of black or white can strain the eyes and affect how 
you interpret color. You can also choose to have the pasteboard match the theme color.  
I usually leave the other settings at their defaults, but you can adjust how your cursors and 
gesture options react for tool tips. Panels settings affect how the panels will float, open, 
and display. Options also adjust display performance for graphics. Refer to Figure 1-14.
Figure 1-13.  Reviewing the General tab in the Preferences dialog box

Chapter 1 ■ Introduction: Creating a Workspace
12
You can leave the following tabs set at the program defaults:
• 
UI Scaling: User Interface Display
• 
Type: Type Options, Drag and Drop Editing, Smart Text Reflow
• 
Advanced Type: Character Setting, Input Method Options, 
Missing Glyph Protection, Default Composer, Type Contextual 
Controls
• 
Composition: Highlight and Text Wrap
Units & Increments Tab
Click the Units & Increments tab. For my Ruler Units Horizontal and Vertical settings, 
I will be using inches. If you prefer to use points and picas or some other unit of 
measurement, feel free to set this later. Otherwise leave the settings at the default, as 
shown in Figure 1-15.

Chapter 1 ■ Introduction: Creating a Workspace
14
Grids Tab
The settings I am using for the Grids tab are shown in Figure 1-16. Grids are nonprinting. 
If for some reason the color of the grid clashes with your artwork on screen, making the 
grids difficult to see, you can change it here in the Baseline Grid and Document Grid 
sections.
Figure 1-16.  Reviewing the Grids tab of the Preferences dialog box
Guides & Pasteboard Tab
I left my setting at the default, but like the grids, if the guides visually clash with your 
artwork on screen, making it difficult to see, you can change it here in the Color section. 
You can also adjust various smart guide settings and pasteboard options, as shown in 
Figure 1-17.

Chapter 1 ■ Introduction: Creating a Workspace
15
Let’s skip over a few more tabs and leave them at the default settings:
• 
Dictionary: Language, Hyphenation, User Dictionary
• 
Spelling: Find and Dynamic Spelling
• 
Autocorrect: Options and Language
• 
Notes: Assorted Options for the Notes tool
• 
Track Changes: Show, Change Bars
• 
Story Editor Display: Text display and cursor options
Display Performance Tab
Display performance relates to how graphics display in an InDesign file while you are 
working on the document. Leave these settings at the default of Typical (see Figure 1-18) 
so that you can see the graphic but it does not show in high resolution, using up a lot of 
Figure 1-17.  Reviewing the Guides & Pasteboard tab of the Preferences dialog box

Chapter 1 ■ Introduction: Creating a Workspace
16
processing power. If you need to preview a specific graphic, right-click it and select High-
Quality display from the drop-down menu shown in Figure 1-19. Only that graphic will 
display in high resolution, and not the others. You will look at this function in more detail 
in later chapters.
Figure 1-18.  Reviewing the Display Performance tab of the Preferences dialog box

Chapter 1 ■ Introduction: Creating a Workspace
17
Appearance of Black Tab
Because you will be working in a printing environment, it is important to make sure that 
your blacks display accurately. Set the On Screen and Printing/Exporting options to Display 
All Blacks Accurately and Output All Blacks Accurately, respectively (see Figure 1-20). Rich 
Black is made up of 100% cyan, 100% magenta, 100% yellow, and 100% black.
Figure 1-19.  Adjusting display performance for specific images outside of the Preferences area

Chapter 1 ■ Introduction: Creating a Workspace
18
Black is simply 100% black, so its overall color appears duller. On screen when 
previewing the file, it is important to be aware of the difference, otherwise you might get 
unexpected results when the file goes to print.
Skip over the final three tabs:
• 
File Handling: Document Recovery Data, Saving InDesign Files, 
Snippet Import, Links
• 
Clipboard Handling: Clipboard and Pasting options
• 
Publish Online: Leave this setting cleared
When done, click OK to exit the Preferences dialog box and save your changes.
Figure 1-20.  Reviewing the Appearance of Black tab of the Preferences dialog box

Chapter 1 ■ Introduction: Creating a Workspace
19
■
■Note   If your preferences become corrupted or you need to set them to the defaults, 
according to Adobe Help make sure to do the following:
For Windows, start InDesign, and then press Shift+Ctrl+Alt. Click Yes when asked if you 
want to delete preference files.
For Mac OS, while pressing Shift+Option+Command+Control, start InDesign. Click Yes when 
asked if you want to delete preference files.
Continue Setting Up the Workspace
So far, you have been using the InDesign Menu bar to adjust your program settings. You 
will now begin to set up a workspace that you will use for the next chapters in this book 
on the topic of Data Merge.
Currently, your interface will look something like Figure 1-21 if you have chosen the 
Essentials workspace as your starting point.
Figure 1-21.  The current layout of the Workspace area in InDesign CC

Chapter 1 ■ Introduction: Creating a Workspace

Begin by adjusting the workspace, first removing and then adding various panels to 
the left and right that you will be using throughout the book.
From the Menu bar, go to the Window drop-down menu shown in Figure 1-22. There 
you will find a list of all the panels that can display in InDesign. For this book, I talk about 
specific ones that you will use for Data Merge.
Figure 1-22.  The Window menu shows all available panels. The (>) leads you to other 
panels that are grouped under that menu name

Libraries removed
When a panel is open on the screen, it will be marked with a check mark. When not 
open, it not be checked. Select and clear the CC Libraries setting. Window ➤ CC Libraries 
is now removed from the display, as you will not be using this panel. Refer to Figure 1-23.

With your mouse, click the upper handle and drag it to the right side so it becomes 
undocked and floats over the pasteboard. Click the small upper arrows in the tool to 
expand the tool to two rows, which makes the color selection easier to adjust for fill and 
stroke. Note that if it displays horizontally, you might have to click the arrows again to 
toggle through the layout options. The screen should look something like Figure 1-25.

Layers Panel
The Layers panel, shown in Figure 1-31, shows how many layers the document has, 
similar to this setting with Photoshop and Illustrator. Layers can be hidden by turning 
off the eye or locked and unlocked by clicking the square next to the eye. When a layer is 
editable it will have a pen on the layer. A locked layer is indicated by a strikethough on the 
pen icon. If there is an object or frame on the layer selected, the small square on that layer 
will be filled. Layers can have sublayers so that you can organize your artwork and drag it 
with your mouse up or down.

Summary
In this chapter, you reviewed how to clean up InDesign, adjust some preference settings, 
and create a custom Data Merge workspace that you will be using for the remainder of 
the book. Along the way you also did a quick review of the panels that you can use to 
complete Data Merge projects. Many of the panels are explored in further detail as you 
progress through the chapters. However, if there are any panels you are unsure about, 
make sure to review them in Adobe InDesign CC Classroom in a Book, mentioned earlier 
in the chapter.

CHAPTER 2
Working with Paragraph 
Styles to Create Sequential 
Numbering
Project: Creating a Raffle Ticket Layout for Print
■
■Note   If you want to work along in this lesson or review the result, download your 
Chapter 2 files from http://www.apress.com/9781484231586. Work with the file with the 
label “Start.” The file with the label “End” and the PDFs are the final result.
InDesign CC has several panels that you can use for styling text and images. For this 
chapter, you will be focusing on using the Paragraph Styles panel (see Figure 2-1) and 
its Bullets and Numbering tab to create sequential numbers for some raffle tickets. In 
addition, you will work with the Pages, Layer, and Align panels to complete your layout. 
Refer to Figure 2-2.

Working with Pages, Layers, and the Selection 
Tools
If you have created printing layouts before, you will remember that for small items like tickets 
you can have more than one item on a sheet. The amount on the sheet is referred to by the 
number and then “up.” For example, three-up means three of the same items laid out on one 
sheet of paper, ten-up is ten items on one sheet, and so on. Each of the items is surrounded 
by crop marks evenly laid out around the item so that when the print contractor prints the 
item, they know where to cut (see Figure 2-3). This way each item is to the exact same size.
Figure 2-3.  An example of a three-up and a ten-up layout. The crop marks have been 
exaggerated here for viewing purposes.

Chapter 2 ■ Working with Paragraph Styles to Create Sequential Numbering
56
Sometimes some of the graphic will go beyond or into the crop mark area. This 
excess area is known as the bleed. When the card is cut out of the paper it makes it appear 
that the graphic runs from edge to edge of the card rather than leaving some white border 
around the card, as shown in the example in Figure 2-4.
Figure 2-4.  If you want to have your design have the color run to the edge, you need to add 
bleed so that it slightly overlaps the crop marks. The dotted edge represents the cut item. 
If you don’t add bleed, you will have a white edge, which might not be the effect you were 
trying to achieve.
This tutorial assumes that you know something about crop mark layout; however, 
feel free to refer to my examples in the chapter folders as a guide if you are unsure.
■
■Note   If you are working with a CMYK document make sure to set the crop marks you 
create to the color swatch of [Registration] (100 C 100 Y 100M 100K). You can do that under 
Window ➤ Color ➤ Swatches (F6). Using your Selection tool (V), select the crop marks 
stroke and select Registration from the list. Refer to Figure 2-5.

Chapter 2 ■ Working with Paragraph Styles to Create Sequential Numbering
57
Unless you are creating an all-black-and-white project, do not choose black, as this will 
only show the crop marks on the black plate. You need there to be a color on the other 
cyan, magenta, and yellow plates so that whether printing with an offset press or color 
laser printer you can see if the device is having any alignment issues and adjust the printer 
setting accordingly.
If you are creating your own custom layout, check with the print house you are working 
with to determine if they require you to add any additional printer marks to your page.  
For this lesson, you will assume that you are doing the printing in house on your color laser 
or inkjet printer.
Figure 2-5.  The Tools panel and Swatches panel are used to set the color of the crop marks 
to the color of [Registration]

Download the Chapter 2 zip folder from this link: ****. There you will find the files 
you need for this project.
Consistency is important when all tickets are to be the same. However, for raffle 
tickets you need custom numbers. Typing numbers from 1 to 100 might be easy, but what 
if you must type 1 to 1000? What if the numbering is 0001 to 1000, or includes a break 
like 1000 to 3000. What if the client changes the numbering style at the last minute? How 
could you type all these numbers without making errors? What if you only have an hour 
to work on the project? The point is you can’t do this on your own on a short deadline. 
Don’t panic; with a little advance work in InDesign, you can do the job quickly. The 
following sections show you how.
Open Adobe InDesign CC
To begin, open InDesign CC 2018. If you have not already set up your workspace, make 
sure to go back to Chapter 1 and review on the procedure for creating a workspace for the 
Data Merge. Otherwise select Data Merge Workspace or Reset Data Merge Workspace 
from the InDesign drop-down menu now, as shown in Figure 2-6.
Figure 2-6.  Set or reset your workspace to Data Merge Workspace to begin the project
If you were beginning the files from scratch, you would choose File ➤ New 
Document (see Figure 2-7) and begin laying out the tickets that you might have created in 
Photoshop or Illustrator.

Chapter 2 ■ Working with Paragraph Styles to Create Sequential Numbering
59
However, for this chapter, choose File ➤ Open for the document (Raffle_10_up-
Start.indd) in the Chapter 2 folder that contains the ticket design layout I have already 
created.
In my example, Figure 2-8 is a screen shot of my tickets that are ten-up on a sheet 
with crop marks. They are ready to have numbers added.
Figure 2-7.  You can set up the size of a new print product in the New Document dialog box

The raffle tickets are 3.5 × 2 inches, business card size. A larger view of one of the 
tickets is displayed in Figure 2-9. I have left a space for my raffle number.
Figure 2-8.  Ten-up layout of raffle tickets

Chapter 2 ■ Working with Paragraph Styles to Create Sequential Numbering

■
■Note  The graphics and crop marks are on the Master Page A-Master and not on page 
one. I will explain why I did this later in the chapter. For now, stay on page one.
Working with the Layers
Go to Window ➤ Layers. The layout is nearly complete. It has two layers in the Layer 
panel, as shown in Figure 2-10. The CropMarks layer contains the printer’s marks so that 
they will know where to cut the tickets later, and the Text layer contains the background 
image and text.
Figure 2-9.  A close-up of a raffle ticket

Chapter 2 ■ Working with Paragraph Styles to Create Sequential Numbering
62
You will now create a new layer for the raffle numbers. Click Create New Layer at 
the bottom of the Layers panel and double-click it to rename or choose New Layer from 
the side menu option on the top right and open the Layer Options dialog box, shown in 
Figure 2-11.
Figure 2-11.  The Layer Options dialog box allows you to give the layer a name and set 
another layer color
Figure 2-10.  Currently the Layer panel has two layers. The New Layer button is located 
at the bottom of the panel to the left of the trash can icon. Alternately, you can choose New 
Layer from the menu in the upper right of the panel.

Chapter 2 ■ Working with Paragraph Styles to Create Sequential Numbering
63
Double-click the new layer and name it Numbering, as in Figure 2-11. Click OK to 
close the Layer Options dialog box. Keep the Text and CropMarks layers locked so you 
don’t move an item by accident. Make sure to drag the Numbering layer to the top of the 
list if it is not already there, as shown in Figure 2-12, and leave it unlocked so you can edit 
it in the next step.
Figure 2-12.  The new layers has been added to the Layers panel and moved to the top of 
the list
Working with the Selection Tool
On the new Numbering layer, with your mouse, draw and drag out a text box with the 
Type tool near the word Number: on the first ticket in the upper left; this will be the first 
raffle number. You can resize the box with the Selection Tool (V) if you think it is too large 
or too small (see Figure 2-13).

Figure 2-13.  Use the Type tool to create a text box next to the Number: text on your first 
raffle ticket in the upper left of the page

Chapter 2 ■ Working with Paragraph Styles to Create Sequential Numbering
65
Do not type into the text box yet. First, you will create the Numbering style using 
Paragraph Styles. Click somewhere on your pasteboard so that no text is selected.
Working with the Paragraph Styles Panel and 
Dialog Box
Click Window ➤ Styles ➤ Paragraph Styles. Create a new style by clicking the New 
Paragraph Style icon at the bottom right of the Paragraph Styles panel. Alternately you 
can choose New Paragraph Style from the upper right menu in the panel, as shown in 
Figure 2-14.
Figure 2-14.  To create a new paragraph style, either click the Create New Style button to 
the left of the trash can or select New Paragraph Style from the upper right menu
Double-click Paragraph Style 1 and rename it Numbering Style on the General tab of 
the Paragraph Style Options dialog box as shown in Figure 2-15.

Chapter 2 ■ Working with Paragraph Styles to Create Sequential Numbering
66
General Tab
The General tab allows users to change the Style Name. You can also choose if the style is 
based on another currently used style from the drop-down menu. Otherwise, when you 
press the Enter key to create a paragraph break, the next style will be something else in 
the Paragraph Styles list. You can also add a keyboard shortcut to make it easier to apply 
options. The Style Settings box provides an overview of all the settings that have been 
applied collectively on other tabs within this dialog box. (This area might look slightly 
different depending on what styles you choose.) For now, leave the as Based On: setting 
set to [No Paragraph Style] and the Next Style setting set to [Same style].
Now move down to the Bullets and Numbering tab of the Paragraph Style Options 
dialog box.

Figure 2-16.  The Bullets and Numbering tab of the Paragraph Style Options dialog box. 
Settings are defaulted to None until you choose Bullets or Numbers.
Bullets and Numbering Tab
The Bullets and Numbering tab deals with list styles, levels, the formatting of the numbers 
and their positioning, and whether they are bullets or numbers. Refer to Figure 2-16.

Chapter 2 ■ Working with Paragraph Styles to Create Sequential Numbering
68
You can see the default setting for numbering here. Let’s make some changes, as 
shown in Figure 2-17.
Figure 2-17.  Using the default Numbering Style settings in the Bullets and Numbering tab 
of the Paragraph Style Options dialog box
	
1.	
Change the List Type to Numbers
	
2.	
Change the Numbering Style Format to 001, 002, 003 or 0001, 
0002, 0003, whichever you prefer.
	
3.	
Next you need to make a few more adjustments. Under 
Numbering Style, the Number setting will originally have the 
code ^#.^t. This makes the normal bullet apply the order of 
001., 002., 003., and so on, along with text. You want only the 
numbers, so just remove .^t, leaving ^# as shown in Figure 2-18. 
You can find more of these symbols in the drop-down list to the 
right of the Number field to adjust space and level. You will see 
more examples of this code in Chapter 6.

Chapter 2 ■ Working with Paragraph Styles to Create Sequential Numbering
69
	
4.	
Leave the Mode setting at Continue from Previous Number, so 
that the number is unavailable.
■
■Note  If you need to start from 101, for example, change the number to start at 101. 
Switch the Mode setting back to Continue from Previous Number to make it unavailable. 
This refreshes the numbering so that the cycle will continue after 100. We’ll look at that in 
detail later.
There is one last thing to change. Under the List Type drop–down, there is another 
drop-down called List. Choose New List, as shown in Figure 2-19.

Name the new list Numbers. Make sure both available options are selected, as shown 
in Figure 2-20. This will ensure that the numbers will continue to generate in successive 
order no matter how many you need.

Other Optional Settings
Other tab options within the Paragraph Style Options dialog box that you could also 
adjust for your tickets include the following:
Advanced Character Formats Tab
On the Advanced Character Formats tab, shown in Figure 2-27, you can adjust the 
Horizontal Scale and Vertical Scale of the font. If you need it to be shaped a certain way, 
you could also adjust the skew if you wanted the number to look faux italic, for example.
Figure 2-27.  The Advanced Character Formats tab of the Paragraph Style Options dialog box
Indents and Spacing Tab
If you prefer the numbers to be aligned right or centered rather than the default of left, 
you can adjust that on the Indents and Spacing tab. You can also create a custom indent, 
as shown in Figure 2-28.

Chapter 2 ■ Working with Paragraph Styles to Create Sequential Numbering

Adobe InDesign CC Classroom in a Book.
Adding Your Sequential Numbers to the Layout
With your black arrow Selection Tool (V) and arrow keys on your keyboard, move the text 
box around if you don’t like the placement. You have now numbered the first ticket, as 
shown in Figure 2-29. However, there are still nine more on the sheet.
Figure 2-28.  The Indents and Spacing tab of the Paragraph Style Options dialog box

Chapter 2 ■ Working with Paragraph Styles to Create Sequential Numbering
77
With the Selection Tool (V), select the text box and hold down the Alt/Option Key 
to drag with your mouse a new copy of the text box for the ticket on the upper right 
side. When you drop it in the correct location, you will see that the number in the new 
duplicated box has changed to 002, as displayed in Figure 2-30. You might need to use the 
Align tools to make sure the numbers are balanced.
Figure 2-29.  The first number has been styled for the page
Figure 2-30.  After Alt + Mouse drag with the Selection Tool, you now have 2 linked 
numbers in the sequence

Chapter 2 ■ Working with Paragraph Styles to Create Sequential Numbering
78
The Align Panel
Go to Window ➤ Object & Layout ➤ Align (Shift + F7). This panel allows you to align 
selected text boxes or objects in set rows or columns. When you shift two or more selected 
boxes with your Selection Tool (V), while they are still selected, you can click the Align 
Top Edges icon, shown in Figure 2-31, and those items will be aligned by the top of their 
rectangular frame.
Figure 2-31.  Use the Align Panel to align the text boxes if they are not level with each other
Continue to Alt/Option Drag with the Selection Tool until all the tickets on the page 
are numbered 001 to 010. You have now completed one page of tickets. Make sure to use 
the Align panel to make sure the boxes are aligned and appear as shown in Figure 2-32.

The Pages Panel
In this example, you want 100 tickets. That means you need ten sheets or spreads because 
ten sheets of ten-up tickets results in 100 tickets.
You can continue the count by selecting the page or spread. Click Window ➤ Pages 
to open the Pages panel. This panel, shown in Figure 2-33, shows a thumbnail of all the 
pages in the document. Currently there is only one.
Figure 2-33.  The Pages panel displays the one page and the crop marks and graphics that 
are on the master page (A-Master)
In this case, my graphics and crop marks are in A-Master. I did this so that if I needed 
to change my backgrounds I could easily do so in one area rather than making the change 
to each page. If you need to enter the A-Master, double-click the A-Master Icon in the 
Pages panel. To exit, click Page 1 in the Pages panel. Your Numbering Layer items should 
not be in the A-Master, but only on Page 1 for now.
Make sure you are on Page 1 and not in the A-Master by double-clicking on Page 1 
Icon.
Right-click the page thumbnail and choose Duplicate Spread, as shown in Figure 2-34.

Chapter 2 ■ Working with Paragraph Styles to Create Sequential Numbering
81
Now you have 2 pages. Page 2 starts at number 011 and ends at 020.
Rather than just selecting one spread at a time and choosing Duplicate Spreads, you 
can hold down Shift, click both spreads, and choose Duplicate Spreads, as displayed in 
Figure 2-35. This makes two more spreads, so you have a total of four, now up to number 040.
Figure 2-34.  Duplicating a spread in the Pages panel duplicates a page in the document
Figure 2-35.  Duplicating a spread by selecting more than one at a time speeds up the process

Chapter 2 ■ Working with Paragraph Styles to Create Sequential Numbering
82
Again, you can hold down Shift and click each one, repeating the same process and 
bringing you to a total of eight pages or 80 tickets.
You can press Shift and click the last two pages and select Duplicate Spreads. You 
should now have a total of 100 tickets or 10 sheets or spreads. At this point you could print 
the sheets out yourself or create a PDF of the file and send it to your local printer for them 
to print for you.
■
■Note   If you create too many spreads, select the ones at the end you don’t want and 
click Delete Spread. You will see a warning, as shown in Figure 2-36. Click OK and the 
unwanted spread will be deleted.
Figure 2-36.  A warning that appears when you delete a page that contains content
Using Paragraph Styles to Continue Numbering 
from a New Number (Optional)
You can continue to use Paragraph Styles when you need more tickets for the same event.
Right before the event you might find out that you need to print 100 more tickets, 
bringing the count to 200. Do you have to create duplicates of more spreads or pages? 
No, all you need to do is start at the next numbering sequence. Without any text boxes 
selected, in the Paragraph Styles panel,select Numbering Style. Refer to Figure 2-24.
Go again to the Bullets and Numbering tab. Change the Mode setting to Start At and 
type 101 into the text box on the right (see Figure 2-37).

Chapter 2 ■ Working with Paragraph Styles to Create Sequential Numbering
83
Next, change the Mode setting back to Continue from Previous Number to make the 
number unavailable, as seen in Figure 2-38.
Figure 2-37.  On the Bullets and Numbering tab of the Paragraph Style Options dialog box, 
alter the number in the Mode setting to Start at and add a new number
Figure 2-38.  On the Bullets and Numbering tab of the Paragraph Style Options dialog box, 
alter the Mode setting to Continue from Previous Number to lock the new number in place. 
Stay in the dialog box and preview it until complete.

Chapter 2 ■ Working with Paragraph Styles to Create Sequential Numbering
84
Wait a few seconds for the numbers to recalculate with the Preview check box 
selected in the Options dialog box. Once you have previewed the file, click OK to exit the 
Paragraph Styles dialog box. The numbers should now range from 101 to 200, as shown in 
Figure 2-39.
Figure 2-39.  The last numbered ticket in the sequence
When done you can print the file or make a PDF for your printer.
Importing Styles from other InDesign Documents
Once you have created this numbering style you can import and modify it in other 
InDesign CC documents for other projects. This saves time because there’s no need to 
repeat all the steps again.
In your new document, open the Paragraph Styles panel. From the upper right side 
menu, select Load Paragraph Styles, as shown in Figure 2-40.
Figure 2-40.  From the menu in the Paragraph Styles panel, select Load Paragraph Styles

Chapter 2 ■ Working with Paragraph Styles to Create Sequential Numbering
85
Locate the file that contains your Numbering Style and click Open in the Open a File 
dialog box. You will then see the Load Styles dialog box. Select only the Numbering Style 
from the list and click OK, as shown in Figure 2-41.
This will load the Numbering Style into your new document (see Figure 2-42) and 
you can now use it in your own project when you apply it to your text box and press Enter 
to start the numbering sequence.

Creating the Final PDF for Print
After you have saved your file, you might want to print it out directly from InDesign or 
create a PDF that you will e-mail to your print house.
To create a PDF, go to File ➤ Print and choose the following settings. On the General 
tab of the Print dialog box, set the settings shown in Figure 2-43.
Figure 2-43.  The General tab of the Print dialog box

Figure 2-45.  The Marks and Bleed tab of the Print dialog box
On the Marks and Bleed tab, because I created my own custom layout, I will 
leave this set to the defaults with the All Printer’s Mark check box cleared, as shown in 
Figure 2-45. Please check with your print house to see if they recommend any alternate 
adjustments here.

Chapter 2 ■ Working with Paragraph Styles to Create Sequential Numbering
89
On the Output tab make sure that Color is set to Composite CMYK and that the Text 
as Black check box is cleared, as shown in Figure 2-46. Otherwise, leave everything at the 
defaults.
Figure 2-46.  The Output tab of the Print dialog box

On the Graphics tab, set Send Data to All, because you want the images to be of 
decent quality. Under Font, set Download to Complete and PostScript should be set to 
Level 3, as depicted in Figure 2-47.
Figure 2-47.  The Graphics tab of the Print dialog box

Chapter 2 ■ Working with Paragraph Styles to Create Sequential Numbering
91
I generally leave the Color Management tab (see Figure 2-48) at the default settings 
and let InDesign determine the colors. However, your print house might have different 
settings they want you to use, so check with them.
Figure 2-48.  The Color Managment tab of the Print dialog box

Chapter 2 ■ Working with Paragraph Styles to Create Sequential Numbering

95
In the Printing Preferences dialog box, select High Quality Print or Standard from the 
Default Settings drop-down list shown in Figure 2-54. High quality will give you a larger 
file, but the graphics will look clearer. Standard will give you a smaller file size, but the 
graphics might appear fuzzy. Test to see which option works best for your layout.
Figure 2-54.  Choose a default setting in the Printing Preferences dialog box
Leave the other settings as is and click OK to close this dialog box. You will be 
returned to the Print dialog box shown in Figure 2-55.

Adobe Acrobat DC Distiller will now start creating the PDF. 
Saving the PDF
Save the file in the desired location in your folder with a name reflecting the range of 
ticket numbers; for example, Raffle_10up_End_1_100 in Figure 2-57. This signifies tickets 
1 to 100. You might have a different range. If you created another range later, giving the 
PDF a numbering like 101_200 will help you keep the various sets organized in case you 
need to send this new file to your printer at the last minute and they need to know what 
range this is.

Chapter 2 ■ Working with Paragraph Styles to Create Sequential Numbering
97
Click Save. The PDF will be created and you can open it in Adobe Acrobat DC Pro to 
review and e-mail later.
Summary
In this chapter, you looked at how you can use Paragraph styles to enhance the layout of 
your ticket numbering. Although each of the numbers was different, each one still had a 
consistent look and coloring that coordinated with the layout. You also did not have to 
type out each number manually, which saved you time. In Chapter 5 you will revisit the 
raffle ticket again and see how you can add two sets of custom numbers and names using 
the Data Merge and you will look at another way in InDesign to se tup and create a PDF.
Before you can do this, though, you need to understand how to use the Data Merge 
panel. In the next chapter, you will first look at how to create a single merge record for a 
presentation letter for a mailing or conference.

Creating a Single Merge 
Record Using the Data 
Merge Panel
Project: Creating the Presentation Letter for  
Your Mailing
■
■Note   If you want to work along in this lesson or review the result, download your 
Chapter 3 files from http://www.apress.com/9781484231586. Work with the file with the 
label “Start.” The file with the label “End” and the PDFs are the final result.
The ability to number tickets is useful, but another handy tool is the Data Merge panel. 
As mentioned earlier, it is like the Mail Merge section of Microsoft Word. In InDesign, you 
might have created the layout for a one-page presentation letter for a folder. Within the 
layout of text, you will have set areas that will change like the name of the person or their 
address. In this chapter, I will show you how to achieve this using the Data Merge panel.
Working with the Data Merge Panel
To access the Data Merge panel, go to Window ➤ Utilities ➤ Data Merge. Like other 
panels, it has a shortcut menu on the right side. As you go through this lesson and the next 
chapters, you will look at each of the parts in this panel, which is shown in Figure 3-1.

Chapter 3 ■ Creating a Single Merge Record Using the Data Merge Panel

Open Adobe InDesign CC
To begin, open InDesign CC 2018. If you have not already set up your workspace, make 
sure to go back to Chapter 1 and review the information on creating a workspace for the 
Data Merge. Otherwise, select the Data Merge Workspace or Reset Data Merge Workspace 
from the InDesign drop-down menu now, as shown in Figure 3-2.
Figure 3-1.  The Data Merge panel and its menu options
Figure 3-2.  The Data Merge Workspace shown on the workspace’s drop-down menu
If you were beginning the files from scratch, you would choose File ➤ New 
Document and begin laying out the text and graphics that you might have created in 
Photoshop or Illustrator. However, for this chapter, choose File ➤ Open to open the 
document (Presentation_Start_1.indd) in the Chapter 3 folder, which is the file that 
contains the layout I have already created.

Chapter 3 ■ Creating a Single Merge Record Using the Data Merge Panel
101
Creating a Spreadsheet in Excel and Saving It as 
a CSV File for InDesign
To create custom text for a cover letter, you need a document that you created in InDesign 
and a .csv file that was created in Microsoft Excel. InDesign cannot use .xlsx or Excel 
extensions, so files must be only comma-delimited (.csv) or tab-delimited (.txt) files.  
If you have an Excel file already created, you need to convert it to a .csv file.
A comma-delimited file is separated by commas when viewed in text form in a 
program like Notepad++. For example:
FirstName,LastName,Age
Jackie,Smith,40
Mary,Jones,45
Let’s explore how to do that. Open your Excel spreadsheet, Employee_List.xlsx.  
In your case, it might have been created from a database or you migh have typed it 
yourself. Make sure on you have clear headings for each column on the first line, as 
shown in Figure 3-3.
Figure 3-3.  The Excel spreadsheet with all of the fields filled in
Click File ➤ Save As, and select CSV (comma delimited), as shown in Figure 3-4.  
Do not save it as a CSV UTF-8 file, as this format will not work.

Chapter 3 ■ Creating a Single Merge Record Using the Data Merge Panel
102
Click Save. You might get a warning from Excel, like the one shown in Figure 3-5. 
Click OK.
Figure 3-4.  Choose CSV (Comma delimited)(*.csv)from the list of choices
Figure 3-5.  Warning that this file does not support certain features anymore
The file should now be saved as a .csv file. Close the CSV file in Excel.

Chapter 3 ■ Creating a Single Merge Record Using the Data Merge Panel
103
■
■Note  Be sure that if your names have special character accents that they do not get 
removed; for example, French names like Philippe Pétain.
If this happens, when you go to Save as, click the More Options link (refer to Figure 3-6).
Figure 3-6.  When you save the file, click the More Options link
Figure 3-7.  Choose Tools ➤ Web Options before saving the file
Enter the name you want to give the file and choose CSV (Comma delimited) as the 
file type.
In the Tools drop-down menu, select Web Options, as shown in Figure 3-7.

Chapter 3 ■ Creating a Single Merge Record Using the Data Merge Panel
104
If this is not set to this type of encoding this can affect whether accents are removed. 
Make sure to check this so your conference guests are not upset when the see their names 
in print.
Next, click OK to exit the Excel Web Options dialog box. The file should now be 
named EmployeeList_2.csv. Click Save. The accent on the name should now be retained 
in the CSV file. Close Excel and any of its open files.
Laying Out the InDesign File Cover Letter
In InDesign CC, have the PresentationStart_1.indd file open to view. This cover letter 
is shown in Figure 3-9.
Figure 3-8.  The Web Options dialog box
Click the Encoding tab and make sure the Save This Document drop-down list is set 
to Unicode (UTF-8), as shown in Figure 3-8.

Chapter 3 ■ Creating a Single Merge Record Using the Data Merge Panel
105
You should save a copy of this file before you begin the Data Merge in case you need 
to go back and practice again. Click File ➤ Save As PresentationMerge_1.indd, and save 
the file in your Chapter 3 folder.

Go to Window ➤ Utilities Data ➤ Merge. With the Data Merge panel open, select Select 
Data Source from the shortcut menu on the right side, as shown in Figure 3-10.
Figure 3-10.  In the Data Merge panel, select Select Data Source
Locate the Employee_List_2.csv file in your folder and click Open. All the headings 
that were in the original Excel file will appear in the CSV file and be connected via the 
Data Merge panel, as displayed in Figure 3-11.

Chapter 3 ■ Creating a Single Merge Record Using the Data Merge Panel
107
The Data Merge panel now lists the cells you can use for your merge.

■
■Note   If you aren’t sure if you have a space between the first and last names, you can 
use Type ➤ Show Hidden Characters (Ctrl+Alt+I) to see if there is a space, as displayed in 
Figure 3-16.
After you are done, select Type ➤ Hide Hidden Characters and continue with the lesson.
Previewing, Updating, and Removing the Data 
Source
To see if the names are displaying correctly, check Preview in the lower left area of the 
Data Merge panel, as shown in Figure 3-17.
Figure 3-16.  The first and last name have a space between them indicated by a blue dot 
when shown in Hidden Character mode
Figure 3-17.  Using the Preview check box and arrows to review the names

Chapter 3 ■ Creating a Single Merge Record Using the Data Merge Panel
111
You can then use the lower arrows in the panel to see the first name, previous name, 
next name, and last name. You can even type in the number of any record you choose. 
Use the Preview function to scroll through using the arrows to determine if all the names 
are appearing correctly.
At some point in your own project, you might notice a name or address is wrong. Go 
back to the original Excel file, open it in Excel, and correct the mistake. Resave the file as a 
new CSV file with the same name as mentioned in the earlier steps.
To refresh, you must now select Update the Data Source or you could remove it 
entirely (select Remove Data Source) and then Select Data Source again. In this case, 
select Update Data Source, as shown in Figure 3-18.
Figure 3-18.  In the Data Merge panel, select Update Data Source when information in the 
CSV changes so that the changes will be reflected in InDesign
After you update the file, you can recheck the Preview again to make sure the update 
has taken effect when you review the record.
Creating a Single Merge Record Document for a 
One-Page File
Once you’re happy with the results, it’s time to make a merged document of multiple 
letters. To do so, choose Create Merged Document from the panel. Refer to  
Figures 3-19 and 3-20.

The same button icon is found next to the data source file name.
When you select Create Merged Document or click the Create Merged Document 
button, the Create Merged Document dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 3-21.

Chapter 3 ■ Creating a Single Merge Record Using the Data Merge Panel
113
The Records Tab
On the Records tab, in this case, you are going to select All Records. If you don’t want to 
print everything, you could choose Single Record or Range to print a selected range of 
records.
Leave the Records per Document Page set to Single Record. Multiple records would 
be used when you have more than one record name on a page, as you’ll see in Chapter 5.
Use the Generate Overset Text Report with Document Creation check box to specify 
that a Text Overset Report will generate if some text was more than the box could hold. 
If this is the case, you might need go back to the file to adjust the size of the box to hold 
the text or adjust the Paragraph or Character styles of the font, as you will see in a later 
chapter.
You can also add images through the Data Merge so you can be alerted if the images 
are missing. You will look at this area in more detail in Chapter 4.

If there are images, you can control how they will appear on the Options tab, shown 
in Figure 3-23. For now, leave these settings at their defaults. You’ll look at this area in 
Chapter 4.

Chapter 3 ■ Creating a Single Merge Record Using the Data Merge Panel
115
Once you’re done, click OK to start the merge process. Give InDesign time to create 
the new merged document if you have a lot of records. If all is working, you should see the 
message shown in Figure 3-24 and a new document with the file name and a -1 on the end.
Figure 3-23.  The Options tab of the Create Merged Document dialog box
Figure 3-24.  The Data Merge File is created and an alert is generated to let you know that

Click OK. You should now have one page for each record created, in this case 12 
pages, as displayed in Figure 3-25.
Figure 3-25.  There are 12 pages in the merged file and this file is not connected to the Data 
Merge panel
Note that this newly created file is not connected to the Data Merge panel and is 
ready for print. If you need to run the merge again for some reason, delete this file and 
run the merge again from the original file, Presentation Merge_1.indd.
You can save this new file, even edit it, and print it or make a PDF to send to your 
print house.

Chapter 3 ■ Creating a Single Merge Record Using the Data Merge Panel
117
Creating a Final PDF for Print or Export to PDF
If you are creating the file for your print house, I would recommend that you first create 
the InDesign file. If you find overset text, correct it and follow the steps that I outlined in 
Chapter 2 for setting up the Print dialog box for a PDF file. However, if you discover no 
overset text, you can reach a similar Print dialog box another way. Use the Data Merge 
panel and select Export to PDF, as shown in Figure 3-26.
Figure 3-26.  Use the Data Merge panel to export a file to a PDF
This will open the same Create Merged Document dialog box again, shown in 
Figure 3-27

■Note  If you choose to use this method of creating a PDF for your files in Chapter 2, you 
can access this same dialog box through File ➤ Export, and choose the file type PDF (Print). 
Find the location to which you want to save the file and then click OK. This will bring up 
the same dialog box shown in Figure 3-28. Although both methods work well, they do not 
contain the same tabs. For example, the Setup tab is found in Chapter 2. Choose the method 
that fits your workflow for PDF creations.

On the General tab, the only area you cleared was Bookmarks. Make sure that Adobe 
PDF Preset is set to [High Quality Print]. The settings on the other tabs should be left 
at their defaults. However, for your project you might want to adjust other tabs such as 
these:
• 
Compression: Setting for images.
• 
Marks and Bleeds: Crop marks and printer marks.
• 
Output: This controls color and the Ink Manager.
• 
Advanced: Fonts and OPI.
■
■Note   Do not adjust the Security tab because adding a password might prevent the PDF 
from printing. Leave this area alone. If you send a PDF file with a printing restriction to your 
local printer and they do not know the password, they cannot print the file. For a printing 
project, applying password settings to this area wastes time.
When you are done, click Export. You will be asked where to save the file. Find the 
appropriate folder and call the file PresentationMerge_1a.pdf, as shown in Figure 3-29. 
Click Save.
Figure 3-29.  Save the file as a PDF
InDesign will again alert you that no overset text was generated with the message 
shown in Figure 3-30.

121
Click OK, and the PDF will appear in Adobe Acrobat DC for you to review all 12 
records.
Single Merge Record Documents That Are More 
Than One Page
In some cases, a presentation letter might be on two or more pages, and you might 
want to separate these letters to send as an e-mail to each client later. Is there any way 
to do this?
Yes, there is. Open the file PresentationMerge_2.indd. In this case, the letter is two 
pages long and there is another Data Merge record of the first name somewhere on page 2, 
as indicated in Figure 3-31.
Figure 3-30.  If no overset text was generated you will see this message

So how do you now make each file separate so that you can e-mail or mail them to 
the correct person? Close the file without saving it.
Go back to PresentationMerge_2.indd. In the Data Merge panel, again choose 
Export to PDF, as displayed in Figure 3-35.

Chapter 3 ■ Creating a Single Merge Record Using the Data Merge Panel
126
The Create Merge Document dialog box will open again. Adjust your Record settings 
and click OK. The Export Adobe PDF dialog box will open. Click Export as you saw earlier.
Save your file as PresentationMerge_2a.pdf and click Save. Click OK for the overset 
text alert and a PDF with 24 pages will be created in Adobe Acrobat DC Pro.
Now you can print the PDF either as one long document in Adobe Acrobat using File 
➤ Print, or you can extract the letters as individual files.
In Adobe Acrobat DC, while your PDF is open go to Tools ➤ Organize Pages Tool. 
Refer to Figure 3-36.
Figure 3-35.  Select Export to PDF
Figure 3-36.  In Adobe Acrobat you can use the Organize Pages tool to extract or split records

Choose Split by: Number of pages: 2 pages and check the settings in the Output 
Options dialog box. I left mine at the default settings, but you might want to alter the 
labeling for your files, as shown in Figure 3-40.
Figure 3-40.  Output Options dialog box for the Split tool
Figure 3-41.  Alert that the PDF document has been split
Click OK if you made changes or click Cancel to simply exit if you made no changes.
Click the Split button. This will split each record so you will have 12 PDF files, one for 
each record. You will receive a notification like the one shown in Figure 3-41. Click OK.

Chapter 3 ■ Creating a Single Merge Record Using the Data Merge Panel
129
The original PDF file will still be intact. You can close it and exit Adobe Acrobat DC. 
However, in your file folder you will find 12 documents with endings of Part1 to Part12. 
You can rename these PDFs in your file folder or leave the names as is and e-mail the files 
to your clients.
Summary
In this chapter, you looked at how you could create single merge record documents for a 
presentation letter, whether it be a one-page or multipage letter. You used the Data Merge 
panel to add, preview, update, and remove a data source. Finally, you also looked at how 
to print, export, and separate pages in Adobe Acrobat DC Pro.
In the next chapter, you will look at how you can add images from a Data Merge.
■
■Note  In my CSV file, I also have fields like e-mail and phone number, although these 
field values are fictitious. If you are sending the CSV to a printer outside of your company, 
remember that this information could be considered confidential and could be valuable to 
cyberthieves. A good tip to remember is if you are not planning to include the data in your 
merge, you should do one of three things:
•	
Delete it from your CSV first before you e-mail it to the print house.
•	
Print the document yourself on your printer in house.
•	
Only send a final PDF file that does not contain any extra 
information to your print house.

CHAPTER 4
Creating a Single Merge 
Record with Images Using 
the Data Merge Panel
Project: Creating a Product Sheet from Your  
CSV File
■
■Note   If you want to work along in this lesson or review the result, download your 
Chapter 4 files from http://www.apress.com/9781484231586. Work with the file with the 
label “Start.” The file with the label “End” and the PDFs are the final result.
In the last chapter, you learned how to work with text in a data merge. However, in some 
cases if you are creating a product sheet of data or profile sheet for each of your top 
salespeople who will be at the convention, you need to be able to include images in your 
data merge. Let’s look at how you can do that.
Open InDesign CC
To begin, open InDesign CC 2018. If you have not already set up your workspace, make 
sure to go back to Chapter 1 and review the information on creating a workspace for the 
Data Merge. Otherwise select the Data Merge Workspace or Reset Data Merge Workspace 
from the InDesign drop-down menu now, as shown in Figure 4-1.

Chapter 4 ■ Creating a Single Merge Record with Images Using the Data Merge Panel
132
If you were beginning the files from scratch, you would choose File ➤ New 
Document and begin laying out the text and graphics that you might have created in 
Photoshop or Illustrator. However, for this chapter, choose File ➤ Open to open the 
document (Product_Start_1.indd) in the Chapter 4 folder, which is the file that contains 
the layout I have already created.
In this document, I have put the nonchanging elements in the Master Page A-Master 
in the Background layer and locked it, as displayed in Figures 4-2 and 4-3. I will put the 
Merge by itself on a layer named Data Merge. Although I could put this area in the Master 
area as well, I prefer to keep it outside on page 1 so I can easily access it.
Figure 4-1.  The created Data Merge Workspace that you use to lay out a project
Figure 4-2.  Thumbnail of the current page you will be working on. On page 1 some 
elements can be found in the Master Page A-Master

Chapter 4 ■ Creating a Single Merge Record with Images Using the Data Merge Panel
133
Make sure that you start on page 1 and not on the Master Page. Refer to Figure 4-2.
Adding Paragraph Styles to the Data Merge
Click on the pasteboard area to ensure that none of the text is selected, then click 
Paragraph Styles in the docking station on the right to open the Paragraph Styles panel 
shown in Figure 4-4.
Figure 4-3.  The unchanging images and text are placed on the background layer and 
locked. The Data Merge elements are on their own layer on page 1 so you can easily access 
them while you edit the document
Figure 4-4.  The current styles are listed in the Paragraph Styles panel

Chapter 4 ■ Creating a Single Merge Record with Images Using the Data Merge Panel
134
Notice that there are several paragraph styles already created for the document. 
However, when you highlight the text in the text box with the text tool, including the 
Name, Example, Hardness, and Description fields, this shows the default value of [Basic 
Paragraph], as shown in Figure 4-5.
Let’s create a style for your Data Merge text that is based on the Description 
Headings style so that the text will line up evenly.
While the text is still highlighted, click the Create New Styles button highlighted in 
Figure 4-6.
Figure 4-5.  Currently the text that will be connected to the Data Merge is set to [Basic 
Paragraph] in the Paragraph Styles panel

Chapter 4 ■ Creating a Single Merge Record with Images Using the Data Merge Panel
135
Select the new Paragraph Style 1 that was just created, and shown in Figure 4-7, and 
double-click to open the Paragraph Style Options dialog box.
Figure 4-6.  While the text is still selected, click the Create New Style button
Figure 4-7.  The newly created style is highlighted and ready to rename

Chapter 4 ■ Creating a Single Merge Record with Images Using the Data Merge Panel
136
On the General tab of the Paragraph Style Options dialog box, rename the new style 
Data Merge Styles, as shown in Figure 4-8. Also change the Based on setting from No 
Paragraph Style to Description Headings. This way the text will have the same spacing as 
the Description Heading style and you don’t have to enter all the information again  
(see Figure 4-9).
Figure 4-9.  Notice how the Merge text is now altered based on an earlier style
Figure 4-8.  The General tab of the Paragraph Style Options dialog box

Chapter 4 ■ Creating a Single Merge Record with Images Using the Data Merge Panel
137
For more details on the Paragraph Style Options General tab, review Chapter 2.  
You will now make a few changes on other tabs.
Click the Basic Character Formats tab. Change the Font Style to Regular, as depicted 
in Figure 4-10. For more details on the Basic Character Formats tab, review Chapter 2.
On the Indents and Spacing tab, shown in Figure 4-11, settings have already been 
taken care of because you based the style on the Description Headings style, so you don’t 
need to make any changes to the Space After setting because the baseline of both styles is 
now the same. For more details on using the Indents and Spacing tab, review Chapter 2.
Figure 4-10.  The Basic Character Formats tab of the Paragraph Style Options dialog box

Chapter 4 ■ Creating a Single Merge Record with Images Using the Data Merge Panel
138
Finally, you will make one change on the Character Color tab and change the 
Character Color setting to a dark blue, as shown in Figure 4-12. For more details on using 
the Character Color tab, review Chapter 2.
Figure 4-11.  The Indents and Spacing tab of the Paragraph Style Options dialog box

Chapter 4 ■ Creating a Single Merge Record with Images Using the Data Merge Panel
139
When you are done, click OK to close the Paragraph Style Options dialog box. Your 
text should look like that shown in Figure 4-13.
Figure 4-12.  The Character Color tab of the Paragraph Style Options dialog box

Chapter 4 ■ Creating a Single Merge Record with Images Using the Data Merge Panel

Next you are going to create the Data Merge.
■
■Note   If you do not know how to convert a Microsoft Excel file to a CSV (comma-
delimited) file for InDesign, review Chapter 3.
Adding Image Fields in the Data Source File
Normally when you add an image to a page, you would draw a frame with a frame tool. 
While the frame is selected, go to File ➤ Place (or press Ctrl+D) to locate the image in a 
folder. Once you have selected the image you want to use, click Place, and the image will 
appear in the frame. This process is shown in Figure 4-14.
Figure 4-13.  The final text result after it is styled along with the newly created style in the 
Paragraph Styles panel

Chapter 4 ■ Creating a Single Merge Record with Images Using the Data Merge Panel
141
By adding image fields to the data source file, you can allow different images to 
appear on each merged record. For example, when you merge documents that include 
information from various companies, you can include an image of each company’s logo, 
salesperson, or product as part of the merge. However, in this case the image is set in-line 
as part of the text rather than a separated graphic. Therefore, it must be included as part 
of a text box rather than a frame. As you can see in Figure 4-15, I have created two text 
boxes in my file: one that will house the image and another that will contain text.
Figure 4-14.  An image of some crystals appears inside of an image frame when placed

Chapter 4 ■ Creating a Single Merge Record with Images Using the Data Merge Panel
142
You can look at the Excel file mineral_list1 I created. Currently it has an area where 
you will need to add links for the photos.
At the beginning of the data field name, type an “at” symbol (@) to insert text or paths 
that refer to image files. The @ symbol is required only in the first line; subsequent lines 
should include the image paths. Paths, which are case-sensitive, must follow the naming 
conventions of the operating system in which they are stored.
If you get an error message when you type the @ symbol at the beginning of the  
field, type an apostrophe (') before the @ symbol (e.g., '@Photos) to validate the function. 
Some applications, such as Microsoft Excel, reserve the @ symbol for functions, so  
I would recommend you do this if you are starting with an Excel file or working in Excel 
on the file.
Tables 4-1 and 4-2 give examples of how you could add images depending on what 
format or folder they are in.
Figure 4-15.  The Data Merge image will appear in-line in the text box frame

Chapter 4 ■ Creating a Single Merge Record with Images Using the Data Merge Panel
143
As you can see, InDesign can accept many image formats, including JPEG, GIF, 
Photoshop files, TIFFs, and so on. You must make sure that you write the correct link and 
file format.
In my example, you will find all the images for this project in the data_images folder 
and they are all JPEG files.
So, for example, you might type in Windows: C:\DataMergeProject\Chapter4\
Project3\data_images\cs_bladed.jpg. Add each correct name line under that in the  
@ Photos column.
After you are done typing the links, make sure to save the file as in Chapter 3 as a 
.csv file.
■
■Tip   Window ➤ Links panel
You can use InDesign to view the path of an image on your operating system. Insert an 
image in an InDesign document, and then use the Links panel to view the image’s location. 
With the image selected, select Copy Info ➤ Copy Full Path from the Links panel menu. 
You might need to edit the path after you paste it in your data source. This technique is 
especially useful for images on a server. Refer to Figure 4-16.

■Note  In Windows, you can also right-click on the link in your folder in File Explorer, 
select Copy Address and edit it in the .csv file.
After you have saved the .csv file with the new links, return to InDesign to start the 
Data Merge.
Figure 4-16.  You can temporarily place an image on a page if you need to copy the path 
link. This will speed up the process of typing if you have a number of images in that folder

145
Starting the Data Merge
Go back to your Product_Start_1.indd file. In the Data Merge panel, select Select Data 
Source, as shown in Figure 4-17.
Locate the file mineral_list.csv and click Open, as shown in Figure 4-18.
You will notice a new Photos icon, as shown in Figure 4-19.
Figure 4-17.  In the Data Merge panel, select Select Data Source

Chapter 4 ■ Creating a Single Merge Record with Images Using the Data Merge Panel
146
With your Type tool, highlight the text where the photo should be, as depicted in 
Figure 4-20, and then in the Data Merge panel click the Photos icon.
The icon will appear like Figure 4-21 in Normal mode, which shows the same 
viewing settings as used in Figure 4-20.
Figure 4-19.  The Photos link has a corresponding Photos icon. However, you will still 
require the text tool to link it in the text box

148
Likewise, you can select the Image icon or text in the Data Merge panel and drag it 
into an empty frame as displayed in Figure 4-23.
When the image is visible in Preview mode you can also adjust the display 
performance to check the resolution as shown in Figure 4-24. For now, leave this setting 
set to Typical Display.

Select the Preview check box in the Data Merge panel to see if the image is 
appearing.
■
■Note   For your own file, you might receive the alert shown in Figure 4-25 regarding a 
missing or incorrectly linked image.
Make sure to go back into your Excel file and make any necessary corrections. Resave 
it as a .csv file and then close the file.
In InDesign, select Update Data Source, as shown in Figure 4-26.
Preview the file again and you should see the first image if everything is correctly 
linked.

Adjusting the Data Merge Text
After you have previewed each page using the arrows, you might notice that some of the 
text in the description area is hyphenated, as displayed in Figure 4-29. You might not want 
this to occur in your text.
Figure 4-28.  The data appears on the first page of document, and you can preview each 
page using the Data Merge panel and its arrows

Chapter 4 ■ Creating a Single Merge Record with Images Using the Data Merge Panel

To change this hyphenation setting, click with your Selection tool somewhere on the 
pasteboard. With no text selected, double-click Data Merge Styles in the Paragraph Styles 
panel, shown in Figure 4-30, to open the the Paragraph Style Options dialog box.
The Hyphenation Tab
On the Hyphenation tab of the Paragraph Style Options dialog box, shown in Figure 4-31, 
clear the Hyphenate check box (see Figure 4-32).

We have not yet explored the Hyphenate tab. If you want to leave the Hyphenate 
check box selected, you can also adjust the following settings.
• 
Words with at Least _ letters: Set how many letters a word should 
have before it hyphenates.
• 
After First _ letters: The minimum number of letters at the start of 
a word after which it can be broken by a hyphen. For example, if 
this is set to 3, the word mineral would be hyphenated this way: 
min-eral.
• 
Before Last _ letters: The minimum number of letters at the end of 
a word before which it can be broken by a hyphen. For example, 
if this is set to 3, the word mineral would be hyphenated this way: 
mine-ral.
• 
Hyphen Limit _ hyphens: This sets the maximum number of 
times a word can be hyphenated. If this is set to 0, hyphens are 
unlimited.
• 
Hyphenation Zone: This setting determines the amount of 
white space allowed at the end of a line of unjustified text before 
hyphenation begins. This only works when you use the Single-line 
Composer with unjustified text.
• 
Better Spacing–Fewer Hyphens range: To alter the balance 
between these settings, you can move the slider.
• 
Hyphenate Capitalized Words: If this check box is cleared, 
capitalized words will not be hyphenated.
• 
Hyphenate Last Word: If this check box is cleared, the last word in 
a paragraph will not be hyphenated.
• 
Hyphenate Across Column: If this check box is cleared, a word 
will not be hyphenated across a column, frame, or page.
For more details on hyphenation settings, see https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/
using/text-composition.html.
Click OK to close the Paragraph Style Options dialog box and your text should not 
hyphenate, as shown in Figure 4-33.

Chapter 4 ■ Creating a Single Merge Record with Images Using the Data Merge Panel
155
As you can see, Data Merge and Paragraph styles can work together. Any change to 
any tab of the Paragraph Style Options dialog box will affect the text that is displayed in 
the Data Merge.
Content Placement Options
In the Data Merge panel, in the drop-down menu, select Content Placement Options, as 
shown in Figure 4-34. This opens the Content Placement Options dialog box shown in 
Figure 4-35.

• 
Fit Images Proportionally: This is the default setting. It maintains 
an image’s aspect ratio, but scales the image to fit within the frame 
(see Figure 4-37).

Chapter 4 ■ Creating a Single Merge Record with Images Using the Data Merge Panel
157
• 
Fit Images to Frames: The image is scaled so that its aspect ratio is 
the same as the frame (see Figure 4-38).
Figure 4-38.  The crystal image shown using the Fit Images to Frames setting
Figure 4-37.  The crystal image shown using the Fit Images Proportionally setting
• 
Fit Frames to Images: The image size is maintained, but the frame 
size is adjusted to match it. The frame could shrink or grow, 
depending on the image size (see Figure 4-39).
Figure 4-39.  The crystal image shown using the Fit Frames to Images setting

Chapter 4 ■ Creating a Single Merge Record with Images Using the Data Merge Panel
158
• 
Preserve Frame and Image Sizes: The image is placed at its 
current size in the frame. If it is too large, it will be cropped by the 
frame (see Figure 4-40).
• 
Fill Frames Proportionally: The image’s width or height fills the 
frame. If any area is larger, it is cropped (see Figure 4-41).
Figure 4-40.  The crystal image shown using the Preserve Frame and Image Sizes setting
Figure 4-41.  The crystal image shown using the Fill Frames Proportionally setting
• 
Center in Frame: The center of the image and frame are aligned 
(see Figure 4-42).

Chapter 4 ■ Creating a Single Merge Record with Images Using the Data Merge Panel
159
• 
Link Images: When selected, this setting creates a link or file path 
to the current image. If this check box is cleared, the image data 
will be embedded in the InDesign document.
• 
Remove Blank Lines for Empty Fields: When selected, this setting 
removes paragraph returns that are inserted for empty fields. This 
is often used for mailing with optional address fields. It ignores 
soft returns. If there are any characters or spaces on a line, that 
line is not deleted.
• 
Record Limit per Document: This setting assigns the maximum 
number of records for a merged document. When this limit 
is reached, a new document is created to hold the remaining 
records. You can only use this option when Single Records is 
selected on the Records tab.
• 
Page Limit per Document: This setting determines the maximum 
number of pages for each document. When this limit is reached, 
a new document is created to hold the remaining pages. You can 
only use this option when Multiple Records is selected on the 
Records tab.
Note: because we are using a single record in this project you 
will not see this option in the current dialog box.
Leave the Fitting setting at Fit Images Proportionally and leave the Center in Frame 
check box cleared. When done, click OK to close the Content Placement Options  
dialog box.

■Note   If you try to change these options and click OK while you are in Preview mode in 
the Data Merge panel, you will see the warning shown in Figure 4-43. Click OK and clear the 
Preview check box, and then check Preview mode again to see the change.
Any change that you make to the size of one image in the Data Merge affects the display of 
them all. Therefore, when you are sizing your photos in Adobe Photoshop, make sure that 
they all have the same size (e.g., 3 inches by 4 inches) before you link them. Any image that 
is a slightly different proportion could result in unwanted display results, such as a cropped 
or a fuzzy image. Be consistent with your layout when using images in the Data Merge.

■Note   You might get an alert like the one shown in Figure 4-49 indicating that no 
overset text was created. Click OK.
The file will open in Adobe Acrobat DC for you to view. Make sure to go back and 
save your InDesign file with the Preview cleared in the Data Merge panel. Otherwise you 
will see the alert shown in Figure 4-50. Click OK and follow the instructions.
Can I Use Object, Table, and Cell Styles as Part of 
My Data Merge?
Currently only Paragraph and Character styles can be used in Data Merge text. However, 
you can apply Object styles to a frame or table that could be on the Template layer, as I did 
in my example. I placed a drop shadow around my frame and saved it in the Window ➤ 
Styles ➤ Object Styles panel, as shown in Figure 4-51. In the Object Style Options dialog 
box, shown in Figure 4-52, just make sure that the text boxes for your Data Merge are 
transparent and cover an area within your frame or table. When you create your merged 
PDF, if done correctly it will look as though the image is within the object frame or table.

For a tables, you can create a text box, and then, while your cursor is inside the 
menu, choose Table ➤ Insert Table.
To insert a data fields into grouped items, table cells, or nested boxes, drag the image 
field onto the target. Refer here to Figure 4-53.
Tables and cells can be useful if, let’s say, you must include more than one image on 
a page. For example, perhaps a salesperson has several awards or logos that need to be 
displayed with his or her name.
Earlier in your mineral list .csv file, you created a column heading called ‘@Photos. 
You can create second column heading called ‘@Photos2. In this column, you can create 
a new list of links and select this new data source.
Figure 4-54 shows what that looks like in the Data Merge panel and in the table cells. 
See the file Table_Example_2Photos.indd.

You can also create a second column of names for this second set of pictures. You 
will be doing that with numbers in Chapter 5.
Adding a QR Code in the Date Merge
You can also add QR codes either as graphics or as text with the .csv file.
• 
Plain Text: Type this as you would any other text. Example: Hello 
Friend
• 
Web Hyperlink: Example: URL: http://www.google.com

To create a column for the QR code, I named the heading of the column #Qrcode. 
You must always use a pound sign (#) before the heading. This tells the Data Merge to 
generate a QR code in the same way as using Menu Object ➤ Generate a QR Code.
QR codes act like images in the Data Merge panel and you can adjust their content 
placement options as you would for any other image.
For an overview on Data Merge and QR code formats you can also view https://
helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/data-merge.html.
The blog post at https://indesignsecrets.com/data-merge-qr-codes-explained.php  
also gives a nice overview on how to use QR codes on business cards for e-mails.
Summary
In this chapter, you explored how to add images and QR codes to your InDesign files via 
the Data Merge panel. You also discovered that Paragraph styles can be use be used to 
alter the appearance of text that is part of Data Merge. Finally, like any other PDF file, 
these files can be exported as PDFs to Adobe Acrobat DC Pro.
In the next chapter, you are going to look at how to create multiple merge records 
using the Data Merge panel.

■Note  If you want to work along in this lesson or review the result, download your 
Chapter 5 files from http://www.apress.com/9781484231586. Work with the file with the 
label “Start.” The file with the label “End” and the PDFs are the final result.
For the last several chapters we have looked at merging single records. Now we will look 
at multiple merge records. Much of what we have learned in the earlier lessons can be 
applied to multiple merges when it comes to setting up your .csv files. However, the 
layout for the file in Adobe InDesign CC is a bit more challenging.
Open InDesign CC
To begin, open InDesign CC 2018. If you have not already set up your workspace, make 
sure to go back to Chapter 1 and review the information on creating a workspace for the 
Data Merge. Otherwise, select the Data Merge Workspace or Reset Data Merge Workspace 
from the InDesign drop-down menu, as shown in Figure 5-1.

Chapter 5 ■ Creating a Multiple Merge Record Using the Data Merge Panel
172
If you were beginning the files from scratch, you would choose File ➤ New 
Document and begin laying out the text and graphics that you might have created in 
Photoshop or Illustrator. However, for this chapter, choose File ➤ Open to open the 
document (Raffle_10upMerge_start.indd) in the Chapter 5 folder, which is the file that 
contains the layout I have already created.
The Data Merge Panel
The final thing you can do with Data Merge is create a multiple merge (see Figure 5-2). 
This is like working with labels in Microsoft Word.
Multiple merges can sometimes be tricky in regard to text placement, but otherwise 
they are the same as single records. Use only one Master Page if you are planning on 
doing a multiple merge. Only work with one page in a multiple merge, as more than one 
page will confuse the program. If you have pages that are not part of the merge, keep 
them separate and combine them at the print stage or in Adobe Acrobat DC Pro as a PDF 
later.
Figure 5-1.  The Data Merge Workspace that you use for all your projects in this chapter
Figure 5-2.  The Data Merge Workspace panel also allows you to create multiple merges

Chapter 5 ■ Creating a Multiple Merge Record Using the Data Merge Panel
173
Creating Double Custom Numbering for Your  
CSV File
You’ll use the same Employee_List_2.csv file as you did in the previous lesson.
If you do not know how to convert your Microsoft Excel file to a .csv file, review 
Chapter 3.
The .csv file you are using has custom numbering, Employee Number, that was 
typed into an Excel file. That file was then converted to a .csv file. If you would prefer 
to use sequential numbering, read the section “Final Thoughts and Using Sequential 
Numbering” later in this chapter.
As in Figure 5-3, make sure to select your data source and set the text that will be part 
of the merge in your InDesign document.
This time you’ll work on another raffle ticket file that uses employee names and 
numbers instead, with a rip-away area, as shown in Figure 5-4.
Figure 5-3.  Select Select Data Source from the Data Merge panel menu

Chapter 5 ■ Creating a Multiple Merge Record Using the Data Merge Panel
174
There are two Employee Number fields, one horizonal and one vertical. However, 
because they are both part of one multiple merge record, they will yield the same number, 
as you will see shortly. You do not need to create two separate columns in your .csv file 
for numbers unless you plan to have two different number types.
■
■Note   The crop marks are on their own layer, Cropmarks, again on the A-Master Master 
Page and that layer is locked. The image and text is on another layer called Text on page 1 
(see Figure 5-5).
Figure 5-4.  The raffle ticket with the date merge layout
Figure 5-5.  The two layers in the current open document. Currently you are working on 
the Text layer

Chapter 5 ■ Creating a Multiple Merge Record Using the Data Merge Panel
175
Also in the Paragraph Styles panel, I have applied two styles, one to horizontal black 
text and another to the vertical white text on the red background, as shown in Figure 5-6. 
The white style is based on the black style; only the color is different. Review Chapter 4 if 
you are not sure how to create this setting.
On the Text layer, using the Selection tool (V), select all the items and select Object ➤ 
Group or press Ctrl+G or Command+G.
Group the items you want to have part as of the merge as one unit and do not leave 
them as separate items. You will know that they are a group because a dotted line will run 
around the group when it is selected, as shown in Figure 5-7.
Figure 5-6.  Two styles have been created for the text: one is for white text and the other is 
for black text

176
■
■Note   Do not be concerned if you see an error message at the bottom left of your 
InDesign console, as shown in Figure 5-8. This is referring to overset text, which will not 
show up once you preview the merge. Sometimes the column heading from the .csv file 
is longer than the actual content or text box, so when Preview is not selected in the Data 
Merge panel you might see this error, but you can ignore it for now.
Figure 5-7.  With the Selection tool, all the items on the text layer have been grouped so 
that that they will move as one unit during the multiple data merge

ignore this error for now because you are not in the Data Merge panel Preview mode

Chapter 5 ■ Creating a Multiple Merge Record Using the Data Merge Panel
177
Working with the Layers and Pages Panels 
(Review)
As mentioned earlier, you only need one item on the page. If you have crop marks they 
need to be on your Master Page so they don’t move with the rest of the multiple merge 
and make sure to lock this layer. Remember, anything you don’t want to move must be on 
your Master Page in a separate layer and locked. In my case it is on A-Master, as displayed 
in Figure 5-9.
As you saw earlier, I put my grouped merge on its own layer called Text.
Creating a Multiple Merge Record Layout
Preview the merge using the arrow icons at the bottom of the Data Merge panel, shown in 
Figure 5-10, to check for overset. If there is none, continue with the lesson.
Figure 5-9.  The images and the text that will be merged should now all be grouped on the 
Text layer and on Page 1

Next, select Create Merged Document from the Data Merge panel shortcut menu, 
shown in Figure 5-11.
On the Records tab of the Create Merged Document dialog box, shown in Figure 5-12, 
for the Records per Document Page drop-down list, select Multiple Records.

Also select the Preview Multiple Record Layout check box.
You can use the arrows for the Page field to move through the record layout and see 
how many multiple records appear on one page. However, you will only be able to view 
one page of records, not the entire document.
On the Multiple Record Layout tab, shown in Figure 5-13, adjust the following 
settings.
Figure 5-13.  The Multiple Record Layout tab of the Create Merged Records dialog box

Chapter 5 ■ Creating a Multiple Merge Record Using the Data Merge Panel
182
In the Margins section, click the Link icon. You can unlink the margins for your own 
custom layout. The settings for Top, Bottom, Left, and Right margins should all be set to 
0.5 inches.
In the Layout of Records section, there are two Arrange By options:
• 
Rows First: This option will move the data left to right.
• 
Columns First: This option will move the data up and down.
Also in the Layout of Records section, there are two settings for Spacing.
• 
Between Columns: This is set to 0.5 inches.
• 
Between Rows: This is set to 0 inches.
Multiple records can be tricky to conform exactly to crop mark margins, so this 
might have to be adjusted later in the final merged document. Watch your preview as you 
adjust, and try to get as close as you can with your file so you get the desired ten records 
on the page. The data can be arranged by columns or rows, and then you can make 
adjustments between the columns and rows.
For this example, you will leave the settings on the Options tab of the Create Merged 
Document dialog box at their defaults, as displayed in Figure 5-14. However, as you saw in 
Chapter 4, if you added images or QR codes to your Data Merge, this might be an area you 
would want to adjust.

Chapter 5 ■ Creating a Multiple Merge Record Using the Data Merge Panel
183
When done, click OK. Give InDesign time to generate the new file. If everything is 
okay, you will get a message indicating that no overset text was generated, as shown in 
Figure 5-15.
Figure 5-14.  The Options tab of the Create Merged Records dialog box

You can now view a new merged document with all the records, displayed in 
Figure 5-16.

185
In my case, because I had 12 names, two names went onto the next page as this is 
a ten-up layout. The rest of the page was blank except for the crop marks on the Master 
Page, as shown in Figure 5-17.
Keep this in mind: If you have not created enough names for the last page, you might 
need to create some blank tickets at the end, after the merge is created, or add more 
names to the .csv file and redo the merge.
Figure 5-17.  Page 2 of your generated merged record. There are only two records on this 
page and the rest is blank

186
Creating the Final PDF for Print
If you’re happy with the merge, you can save it and make final adjustments. Print the file 
or save it as a PDF for your printer as described in Chapter 2.
Alternately you could export the Data Merge file to PDF. Review Chapter 3 if you’re 
not sure how to do this. On the Data Merge panel shortcut menu, select Export To PDF, as 
shown in Figure 5-18.
In the Export To PDF dialog box, click Export.
Save the file as Raffle_10_upMerge_End1b.pdf in the desired location and click Save, 
as shown in Figure 5-19.
Through this method you might get the warning shown in Figure 5-20 about overset 
text. However, it is only seeing it with Preview mode set in the off state, so click OK.
Figure 5-18.  On the Data Merge panel shortcut menu, select Export To PDF

187
Now a report will be generated as you left this setting selected on the Records tab.
In the Overset Text Report dialog box, shown in Figure 5-21, click Close and ignore 
this next message, as it is still referring to the Preview mode in an off state.
With either method you will now be able to review your PDF in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
■
■Note   As with single merges, you can add images or QR codes to multiple records. 
Check out the Mineral_Cards10up_MergeEnd.indd file I created using the mineral images 
shown in Figure 5-22.

Final Thoughts and Using Sequential Numbering
You might have noticed that in my numbering on the raffle ticket I used random 
employee numbers rather than sequential numbers in Chapter 2.
You can create sequential numbering in MS Excel and later change it to a .csv file.
Select the first cell, A2, in the range that you want to fill. Right-click the cell and select 
Format Cells, as shown in Figure 5-23.
Figure 5-22.  An example of multiple records that could be used for info or business cards

Chapter 5 ■ Creating a Multiple Merge Record Using the Data Merge Panel
189
In the Format Cells dialog box, shown in Figure 5-24, set the Category to Custom and 
Type to 000. Click OK to exit the Format Cells dialog box.

190
The number 1 will now look like the display in Figure 5-25.
In the next row, cell A3, add a 2 and give it the same format of Custom, as shown in 
Figure 5-26.
Now press Shift and mouse click to select both cells. Use the green handle to drag 
downward until you have created enough numbers. If you need more, make sure to select 
all number cells before dragging on the green handle again to create more rows. Refer to 
Figure 5-27.

Chapter 5 ■ Creating a Multiple Merge Record Using the Data Merge Panel
191
If you need the numbers twice for some reason, as displayed in Figure 5-28, you 
can select the numbers in the column and copy and paste them into the next column. 
However, in most cases you will only need one set that you can add twice via Data Merge 
in InDesign.
Figure 5-27.  A column of sequential numbers

Chapter 5 ■ Creating a Multiple Merge Record Using the Data Merge Panel
192
Save the file as a .csv file, as in Chapter 3, and close the file. You can check if the 
numbering sequence has been retained in NotePad++  (see Figure 5-29). However, do not 
open the .csv file again in Excel or the formatting will be lost and you will need to create 
a new .csv file.
Now if you have a ticket that requires sequential numbering along with names, you 
know how to create this type of file for your Data Merge.

Can I Make Calculations with Expression Fields 
Like Word?
Microsoft Word with Excel can make extra math calculations with the data from a mail 
merge using expression fields. However, you cannot accomplish this in InDesign without 
advanced knowledge in GREPS and scripting. If you have custom calculations, you could 
choose the Word method or make the adjustments to your calculations using formulas in 
your Excel file first and save the data as a .csv for InDesign CC.

Summary
In this chapter, you discovered how to place multiple records on one page for a Data 
Merge. As with single data merges, it is possible to use Paragraph styles to style the 
resultant Data Merge text. You also saw that you can add numbering, images, and QR 
codes to multiple merges.
In the next chapter, you will be looking at how to use Character styles and Paragraph 
style GREPS to alter your text further when you encounter differences in information, 
such as employee titles and price changes.

In Chapter 2, you briefly looked at how an expression such as ^# could affect the way 
numbers format in a ticket numbering list. You also discovered at the end of Chapter 5 
that unlike Microsoft Word, you could not make calculations with expression fields. You 
need to use Microsoft Excel to perform complex math formulas and then convert the data 
to a .csv file, which can be viewed in InDesign via Data Merge. However, what if after 
all your work, like in Figure 6-1, you still want certain words like personal titles or price 
ranges to display differently?

Chapter 6 ■ Working with Character and Paragraph GREP Styles with the Data Merge Panel

This is the power of GREP styles!
What Are GREPs?
In InDesign, this acronym stands for global/regular expressions/print. There are many 
web sites and books written on the topic. People who design web sites will know of them 
as Regular Expressions (RegExp). I even talk about Regular Expressions for formatting 
and validation in my book Enhancing Adobe Acrobat DC Forms with JavaScript. GREPs 
are a type of a program language that scans a specified file or files line by line, returning 
lines that contain a pattern. From an InDesign point of view, here are some links you can 
look at to become familiar with GREPs:
• 
https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/find-change.html
• 
https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/drop-caps-nested-
styles.html
• 
http://indesignsecrets.com/topic/using-grep-to-select-a-

you-can-use.php
• 
http://indesignsecrets.com/6-cool-things-you-can-do-
with-grep-styles.php
• 
http://indesignsecrets.com/resources/grep
After viewing these links, you might have concluded that GREPs are powerful 
for formatting. However, if you aren’t familiar with programming language, it can be 
complicated and confusing. You are right. I think becoming an expert at all things GREPs 
would take years to master. Thankfully, everything starts with small steps, so let’s try a few 
things. For this lesson, let’s first apply it to some table place cards for an event.
Open Adobe InDesign CC
To begin, open the InDesign CC 2018. If you have not already set up your workspace, 
make sure to go back to Chapter 1 and review the information on creating a workspace 
for the Data Merge. Otherwise, select the Data Merge Workspace or Reset Data Merge 
Workspace from the InDesign drop-down menu, as shown in Figure 6-2.
Figure 6-1.  Titles and prices changing color

Chapter 6 ■ Working with Character and Paragraph GREP Styles with the Data Merge Panel
197
If you were beginning the files from scratch, you would choose File ➤ New 
Document and begin laying out the text and graphics that you might have created in 
Photoshop or Illustrator. However, for this chapter, choose File ➤ Open to open the 
document (Table_Cards_Start.indd) in the Chapter 6 folder, which is the file that 
contains the layout I have already created (see Figures 6-3 and 6-4).
Figure 6-2.  The InDesign workspace that you will be using for this chapter
Figure 6-3.  Table card example

Chapter 6 ■ Working with Character and Paragraph GREP Styles with the Data Merge Panel
198
In this case I have created a four-up layout of some table cards. When the cards are 
folded, the guests name will be on the front and the back of the folded card.
File Setup Review
The Layers panel (Window ➤ Layers) reveals that there are two layers. The CropMarks 
layer contains the crop marks and folding lines. The lines are found on the Pages panel 
(Window ➤ Pages) in the A-Master. Refer to Figure 6-5.
Figure 6-4.  Table cards that can be four-up on a sheet for an event

Chapter 6 ■ Working with Character and Paragraph GREP Styles with the Data Merge Panel
199
I added the crop marks to the Master Page as in Chapter 5, because you are going to 
create a multimerged record and you do not want the marks to move with the other items. 
I then locked the CropMarks layer (see Figure 6-5).
The Text Data Merge layer contains the Data Merge text and background.
Using the Selection tool (V), draw a marquee around all the items and select Object ➤ 
Group or Ctrl+G or Command+G and group them as one object so that it will move as 
one item in the Data Merge (see Figure 6-6). If you don’t do this, the front and back of the 
table card might display two different names.

Master page and in the CropMarks layer

As you can see, a Data Merge is already set up in Figure 6-7. You have selected my data 
source (Employee_List_project5.csv) from the Data Merge drop-down menu.

Adding Paragraph and Character Styles
For this example, you have applied two Paragraph styles. Go to Window ➤ Styles ➤ 
Paragraph Styles, and see Figure 6-9.
Name is the field for the first and last name of the guest and Title is for the guest’s job 
title. In your own personal project, you could use a company name or an organization 
instead.
In this case you want to apply distinct colors to the job titles. When you cycle through 
you only get one color that was applied using the Character Color setting in the Paragraph 
Style Options dialog box shown in Figure 6-10. How can you alter that?

Currently the Character Styles panel contains no styles other than the default of 
[None]. Character styles are useful when you need a letter, word, or sentence somewhere 
within a paragraph to be a unique style or color. Here is an example:
Do Not Open this File!
The word not has been bolded and made red. If you created this style as a Paragraph 
styles and not as a Character style, it would look like this:
Do Not Open this File!
Notice that the whole paragraph becomes bolded and red, which might not be what 
you want.
With no text selected, click Create New Style at the bottom of the Character Styles 
panel, shown in Figure 6-12. Alternatively, you can use the drop-down menu in the upper 
right corner of the Character Styles panel to create a new Character style.

General Tab
On the General tab of the Character Style Options dialog box, change the Style Name to 
Red Text, as shown in Figure 6-14.
Leave all the other settings at their defaults.
In the General section, Based On should be set to [None] as you don’t currently 
have any other styles to base the current Character style on. If you did you could select 
a style from the drop-down menu. You can use the Shortcut field if you want to create a 
keyboard shortcut to apply the style.
Style Settings provides an overview of all the style options applied; currently, there 
are none. However, this will change by the time you are finished with this dialog box.

Character Color Tab
Click the Character Color tab shown in Figure 6-15. Inside the Character Color section, 
change the color to a red. This is a very similar layout to the Paragraph Style options.
You can adjust the fill and stroke color of your characters as well as the tint, if the fill 
will overprint.
For the stroke, you can also adjust the Weight setting, if the stroke will overprint, 
Miter Limit, and Stroke Alignment.
At this time, on this tab, you will only change the color.

Basic Character Formats Tab
Click the Basic Character Formats tab to view this area, shown in Figure 6-16. Note this 
area is very like the Paragraph styles options in the Basic Character Formats section.
If you were concerned that a specific word or phrase would hyphenate or overset 
during the merge, you could change the font size and select the No Break check box in the 
Basic Character Formats section. Select the No Break check box, and otherwise leave this 
area at its default settings.
• 
Font Family: Choose a font family.
• 
Font Style: This can be set to bold or italic.
• 
Size: This setting determines the font size.
• 
Leading, Kerning, and Tracking: These settings adjust the font 
spacing.
• 
Case: This can be set to Small Caps or All Caps.
• 
Position: This can be set to Subscript or Superscript.
• 
You can use the remaining check boxes to choose if the font will 
be underlined, will have ligatures, will have no break, or will have 
a strikethrough.

Other Options in the Character Styles Dialog Box
You might find the Advanced Character Formats tab useful for Data Merge.
Advanced Character Formats Tab
You can adjust the Vertical Scale, Horizontal Scale, Baseline Shift, and Skew settings for 
the text if you need to create a faux italic font. This tab, shown in Figure 6-17, is like the 
one found in the Paragraph styles.
You will leave the other tabs at their default settings, as they do not apply to this 
project. Click OK and close the Character Style Options dialog box for now.
You will now have the new style, Red Text, added to the list, as shown in Figure 6-18.

You will now create three more Character styles: Blue Text, Green Text, and  
Yellow Text.
With the Red Text Character style still selected, from the drop-down menu select 
Duplicate Style, as shown in Figure 6-19.
On the General tab of the Duplicate Style dialog box (see Figure 6-20), change the 
Style Name setting to Blue Text. From the Based On list box, select Red Text to keep any 
other formatting line breaks.

Repeat the earlier steps for green and yellow text. Make sure to change the style 
name, base it on Red Text, and change the Character Color setting.
■
■Note  In your own project if you find yellow to be too light, feel free to choose another 
color or, as shown in Figure 6-23, add a thin black stroke around the text.

You should now have the four Character styles shown in Figure 6-24.
Applying Character Styles to a Specific Pattern or 
Word Using Paragraph Style GREPs
Most people, when they use Character styles, highlight a section of text within a 
paragraph and then apply a Character style. Although this method is good for simple 
documents, it does not allow you to change the color of the text during the Data Merge, if 
the wording changes. Data Merges are all about conformity and customization, so you do 
not apply Character styles in the way I just described. Instead, you select the base style of 
[None] for all the text in this file, as shown in Figure 6-25.
Figure 6-25.  While no text is selected, in the Character Styles panel, select [None]
Figure 6-24.  Four styles are now available in the Character Styles panel

Using this method, you can ensure that a certain word won’t break, is appears in 
bold type, or appears in colored type. Here in the Titles Paragraph style that you applied 
to your Titles line, you can make various titles of people appear in distinct colors.
Click New GREP Style, shown in Figure 6-28. This opens the dialog box shown in 
Figure 6-29.

In the To Text text box, enter the name of the title that comes from the .csv file you 
want to affect. For this example, use the title CEO, as shown in Figure 6-31.
■
■Note   There are many other GREP combinations to choose from under the @ symbol 
(see Figure 6-32). Not all will work with Data Merge, but it’s good to experiment. See the 
links on the first page of this tutorial for details on each GREP. Also, check out Table 6-1 at 
the end of this chapter.

The result is shown in Figure 6-33.
Figure 6-33.  All the styles have been applied on the GREP Style tab

Chapter 6 ■ Working with Character and Paragraph GREP Styles with the Data Merge Panel
219
If you don’t like a GREP that was created, you can select it and click Delete. The 
up and down arrows on the right side allow you to reorder your styles. If you rename a 
Character style in the Character Styles panel, it will automatically rename itself here so 
you do not need to update.
You can create a new style from the Apply Style drop-down list. Select New Character 
Style, as shown in Figure 6-34, to open the Character Style Options dialog box.
This new style can later be accessed in the Character Styles panel. When you are 
done, click OK to close the Paragraph Styles menu.
Now take a moment to click Preview in the Data Merge panel. Notice when you sort 
through the Data Merge the titles of each person display in different colors, as shown in 
Figure 6-35.
Figure 6-34.  Create a new Character style directly from the GREPs Style tab

Chapter 6 ■ Working with Character and Paragraph GREP Styles with the Data Merge Panel
220
The Graphic Designer title did not change color because you did not give that name 
a style. Likewise, if a title had been misspelled in the .csv it would have remained at the 
default color. This is an effective way of prechecking for errors in your Data Merge.
You’ll adjust one more Paragraph Styles panel tab in this file before you finish the 
Data Merge.

Drop Caps and Nested Styles Tab
Suppose that you liked the black outline that appeared around the yellow text and you wanted 
this outline for all the titles. You could go into each Character style and make this change or 
you could use the Drop Caps and Nested Styles tab of the Paragraph Style Options dialog box.
With no text selected, double-click the Title style in the Paragraph Styles panel and 
click the Drop Caps and Nested Styles tab shown in Figure 6-36.
Figure 6-36.  Double-click on the Paragraph style Title and click the Drop Caps and Nested 
Styles tab

Chapter 6 ■ Working with Character and Paragraph GREP Styles with the Data Merge Panel
222
The Drop Caps and Nested Styles tab allows you to add a drop cap style to the 
beginning of a paragraph with a specific Character style. You can also select the Align the 
Left Edge and Scale for Descenders check boxes shown in Figure 6-37.
The Nested Styles section allows you override other styles with additional parts of 
other styles for words or phrases of varying lengths.
Click New Nested Style, as shown in Figure 6-38.

Chapter 6 ■ Working with Character and Paragraph GREP Styles with the Data Merge Panel
223
Select the Yellow Text Character style and make sure that it goes through two words 
by entering the number in the field, as shown in Figure 6-39. Use this setting because all 
the titles have at least two words and you want the outline to go around all the words in 
the title.
■
■Note   In the Through drop-down list, you can choose either Through or Up to, as shown 
in Figure 6-40.
On the Words drop-down menu, there are a variety of other choices that you could 
use for your own project, such as Letters or Digits. Figure 6-41 shows this menu.

■Note   if you’ve added a nested or line style that you want to remove, select the style 
and click Delete under each area to remove it.
Click OK to close the Paragraph Style Options dialog box. When you preview the 
Data Merge with the Preview check box selected, you should now see the outline applied 
to all titles. Notice in Figure 6-44 that the Graphic Designer title is now yellow because it 
had no GREP style applied and this nested style has overridden it.
Now you will prepare for the multimerge.

Sometimes in a customized letter there might be an area telling you how much you still 
owe on a bill or a credit card or how much you should make for a minimum payment 
before the interest rate goes up next month.
In this example, I show you how to style the font in distinct colors using number 
ranges and GREPs styles.

Table styles affect the outer styling of the table, whereas Cell styles affect the inner 
styling of the table.
The table by itself does not play any part in the Data Merge, other than I dragged the 
Data Merge fields shown in Figure 6-55 into the table.
Previewing the Styles with the Data Merge Panel
I applied a style to each field called Owe Text and Min Payment Text (see Figure 6-56). 
You will style the Owe Text with color and number ranges.

Now you want to alter the <<OwePrice>> field. You will use the same colors in a 
different combination. However, this time you will use actual GREPs to alter the range. 
You have ensured that when your price is negative it is shown in blue (they owe nothing) 
and when it is positive it displays in red (they owe someone money).
In the Paragraph Styles panel, select the Owe Text style, as shown in Figure 6-61.
Click the GREP Style tab and enter the two new GREP styles shown in Figure 6-62.
• 
For Red Text, To Text: \$\d+\.\d\d
• 
For Blue Text, To Text: \$\-\d+\.\d\d

Chapter 6 ■ Working with Character and Paragraph GREP Styles with the Data Merge Panel
241
Here’s a brief explanation of the code. Although it would take several hours to 
explain all GREPs, the ones I used in the example mean this.
Example: $1000.00
\means an escape to the next symbol, in this case $. You need to do this for the code 
to work because the $ by itself in some cases has an alternate meaning. Refer Table 6-1 at 
the end of the chapter.
\d means digit or a number. For example, to type 5\d would be a number between 50 
and 59.
\d+ means a length of digits or number, but you don’t know how many; it could be a 
$1.00, $10.00, $1000.00, and so on. Whatever is coming from the Data Merge, we’re ready.
\. means the decimal point; for example, $6.96.
\- is for a negative number. If a negative number is detected in the Data Merge, those 
numbers will appear in blue because you owe nothing and it will count as a credit on your 
next payment later.
So is that all you need to alter numbers? Well, not really. You can get even more 
technical if you want to.
Check out the next file: PriceMerge_End_2.indd. This file is basically the same 
except I’ve added a few more options to the Owe Price style for you to consider. Refer to 
Figure 6-64.
Figure 6-64.  Alternate options for styling various ranges of text in a Data Merge

Chapter 6 ■ Working with Character and Paragraph GREP Styles with the Data Merge Panel
242
Look at these examples:
• 
\$(7-9)\d\.\d\d: Ranges from $70.00 to $99.99 could be another 
color.
• 
\$6\d\.\d\d: Ranges from $60.00 to 69.99 could be one color.
• 
\$(0-5)\d\.\d\d: Ranges from $10.00 to $59.99 could be another 
color.
• 
\$(0-9)\.\d\d: Ranges from $0.00 to $10.00 could be another color. 
Note that this slightly overrides another GREP.
• 
\$(?<=[\D])[0-9]\d{2,3}\.\d\d: This is for 2,3 digit numbers like 
$100.00 or $1000.00, by adding the {3} and {2} can affect which 
larger numbers will be affected.
If you’re just working with numbers such as percentages or decimals, you don’t need 
to use the dollar sign; just leave it out like this:
\d+\.\d\d
Here are some other examples:
• 
[6-9]\d|[\d]{3,}: This will style the numbers from 60 and up. This 
GREP code is a combination of two codes with an IF condition 
using a pipe sign (|).The second part, [\d]{3,}, will select all the 
digits with a minimum of three digits.
• 
[6-9]\d: Any digit from 6 to 9 followed by any digit. This code 
will select and search all the numbers starting with 6 and going 
through 9.
However, keep in mind that this code will also search and select the numbers in 
between bigger numbers, therefore, you must look for the numbers that are not preceded 
by a digit:
• 
(?<=[\D])[1-4]\d
• 
(?<=[\D])5\d
• 
(?<=[\D])[6-9]\d
Similarly, if you want to restrict your search to a two-or three-digit search string, you 
can add an additional code, like {1} or {2} or {3}:
• 
(?<=[\D])[1-4]\d{2}
• 
(?<=[\D])5\d{2}
• 
(?<=[\D])[6-9]\d{1}

Summary
In this chapter, you learned about styling your Data Merge text with Paragraph and 
Character styles. You also incorporated GREP styles either as a word or a combination of 
metacharacters.
As you can, see GREPs can be complicated, but they can also be powerful styling 
tools for Data Merges or any InDesign project.
I hope that the chapters and projects I have provided in this session have been 
helpful.
The concluding chapter includes some troubleshooting tips and a quiz to test your 
knowledge of what you have learned in the previous chapters.

CHAPTER 7
Troubleshooting
In this chapter, you’ll look at a few troubleshooting tips to ensure that your InDesign Data 
Merge project runs smoother and conclude with a quiz to test your knowledge.
■
■Note   If you want to work along in this lesson or review the result, download your 
Chapter 7 files from http://www.apress.com/9781484231586.
Putting Data Merge Fields on the Master Page
Throughout the book you might have noticed that two items on the Data Merge panel 
shortcut menu remained unavailable, as displayed in Figure 7-1: Update Content in Data 
Fields and Show Log of Update Results.
Figure 7-1.  Note the two items in the menu that have remained unavailable

Chapter 7 ■ Troubleshooting
250
As mentioned, when you work with the Data Merge panel and you correct something 
in the .csv file, you can select Update Data Source.
When a data source is added the Data Merge panel, that same link will also show up 
in the Links panel, shown in Figure 7-2.
To retain that link into the merged document, when you select Create Merged 
Document (e.g., Letter1-1.indd). You need to place your Data Merge field in a text 
box on the A-Master template (see Figure 7-3). Otherwise when you perform the merge, 
the data will still appear in the document but the original link will be lost, as shown in 
Figure 7-4.
Figure 7-2.  The Links panel lists all the files that are linked, including .csv files

Chapter 7 ■ Troubleshooting
251
■
■Note  In the lessons, I kept my Data Merge field on page 1 because I wanted the data 
merge to be accessible and not to interfere with stationary items on the Master page. 
However, if you find putting your data on a layer in the A-Master works better for your 
workflow, feel free to use this method to access the unavailable items in the created merged 
file, as shown in Figure 7-5.
Figure 7-3.  In this example, rather than on page 1 even the data merge is added to the 
A-Master page
Figure 7-4.  The link is broken in the merge document if the Data Merge fields are not 
on the Master page when the merged document is created. Regardless, the data will still 
appear in the merge file

Chapter 7 ■ Troubleshooting
252
If you kept the data fields on the Master page, location shows up as an A rather than 
a number like 1. When the merged document is created, you will notice that besides 
the link being maintained, you can now select Update Content in Data Fields, shown in 
Figure 7-6.
If for some reason the data in your original .csv has changed and you select this 
menu item, you will receive the alert shown in Figure 7-7.
Figure 7-5.  Whether you choose to keep the Data Merge fields on the A-Master or on page 1 
you can stil keep them on a separate layer
Figure 7-6.  The Update Content in Data Fields item is now available in the newly merged 
document

Chapter 7 ■ Troubleshooting
253
If you have not altered anything other than some text in a field, click OK. Otherwise 
I would recommend going back to the original Data Merge file, selecting Update Data 
Source, and creating a new merged document.
You will also notice that in this merged document, whether Preview is turned on or 
off in the Data Merge panel, there will be a [ ] bracket around the fields, as depicted in 
Figure 7-8. This is to show that the link is still being maintained.
The Show Log of Update Results check box is also selected for the merged document. 
If this is selected, after you click OK to the Update Content in Data Fields, your computer 
might ask if you want to view the log. As shown in Figure 7-9, find an app like Notepad or 
Notepad++ and click OK.
Figure 7-7.  The alert that appears when Update Content in Data Fields is selected
Figure 7-8.  Notice that because the fields are on the A-Master in the merged file, the 
brackets around the fields indicate they have maintained their links

Chapter 7 ■ Troubleshooting
254
Figure 7-9.  Find a program in which you can view the log. I chose Notepad because it is 
just text

Chapter 7 ■ Troubleshooting
255
You will be able to view the log in your text editor and it will read something like this:
Log of Update Data Fields.
Document Name:  Letter-1
Date of update: 2017-08-02
Data Source:    Numbering_Sequence.csv
There were no changes to the data source.
Or you might see:
Log of Update Data Fields.
Document Name:    Letter-1
Date of update:   2017-08-02
Data Source:      Numbering_Sequence.csv
Modified records: 1
Details:
Record 2 (key = autokey2) was modified.
If you don’t want to see the log each time, make sure to clear this check box.
■
■Note   Although I find this method does work okay for a single record merge with more 
than one text box, in the case of trying to merge multiple records, I did find that it acted a 
little buggy. Some of the records seemed to lose their brackets afterward when I updated 
the merged document. For multiple merges, I would recommend that you keep the merged 
text on page 1 rather than the A-Master. You will not be able to access the Update Content 
in Data Field option on the menu, but if you are exporting to PDF as in Chapter 5, this should 
make only a minor difference. You can always go back to the original Data Merge file and 
select Update Data Source and then select Export to PDF again.
Also putting your Data Merge fields on the A-Master will not work in the case of single 
records where the Data Merge fields might be on two or more pages, such as a longer letter 
or a booklet.

Chapter 7 ■ Troubleshooting
256
■
■Tip   If you plan to put your Data Merge fields on a Master page, be aware that you 
should clear the Facing Pages check box when you create a new document, as shown in 
Figure 7-10.
If you do not clear this check box and you place your data on the left-hand page in the 
master rather than the right, the data merge will not show up because page 1 is always 
the right page. Therefore, to avoid confusion when you create a new file that will be a Data 
Merge, always clear the Facing Pages check box. That way only one sheet will show up for 
the A-Master page. Refer to Figures 7-11 and 7-12.
Figure 7-10.  Clear the Facing Pages check box when creating a file for the Data Merge

Chapter 7 ■ Troubleshooting
257
Additional Troubleshooting Tips
If your field in the .csv file contains a comma, as in MyCompany, Ltd., be aware that this 
might in some cases cause InDesign CC to think that this is another field rather than a 
comma that is part of the text field. If this does happen, go back to the .csv file and put 
double straight quotes around the word like this: "MyCompany, Ltd." Resave the file, and 
then it should be recognized as one field.
Figure 7-12.  If you select the Facing Pages check box when you create the InDesign 
document and put your date on the A-Master as in the left image, be aware what the result 
will be when you create a merge document: Only data on the right appears and you lose the 
left data
Figure 7-11.  How the Pages panel should appear when you start creating a Data Merge 
project

Chapter 7 ■ Troubleshooting
258
On the Options tab of the Create Merge Document dialog box, do not set the Record 
Limit per Document or Page Limit per Document settings to one page, as this could 
slow down the program or cause it to crash. Rather, it is better to leave it at a reasonable 
number like 20 or 50 or leave these check boxes cleared (see Figure 7-13) and then 
separate the files in Adobe Acrobat DC Pro as you saw in Chapter 3.
If you have created several merged records and exported them as PDFs at separate 
times you can easily combine them all later as one file in Acrobat DC Pro.
Simply select all the records in your Chapter 7 folder, right-click and on the shortcut 
menu select Combine Files in Acrobat, as shown in Figure 7-14.
Figure 7-13.  For single record (top) or multiple records (bottom), either leave the limits per 
document settings cleared to run the full merge or set a reasonable range

Chapter 7 ■ Troubleshooting
259
Acrobat will then open and allow you to combine all the files. Just drag with your 
mouse to reorder if you must adjust the order and then click Combine in the upper right 
as displayed in Figure 7-15.
Figure 7-15.  Combine your files in Adobe Acrobat using the Combine Files tool
Figure 7-14.  Combine your files in Adobe Acrobat

Chapter 7 ■ Troubleshooting
260
Acrobat will combine the files into one document called Binder, and then you can 
rename and save this file in your folder as one PDF file.
