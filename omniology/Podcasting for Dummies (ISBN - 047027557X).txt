About the Authors
Tee Morris is an instructor at EEI Communications, based out of the Washington 
DC/Virginia/Maryland metro area, and he teaches various applications in graphic 
design and video editing; he also teaches Podcasting for Government and 
Corporate Business. When he isn’t working as a freelance artist and instructor, 
Tee writes science fiction and fantasy. Tee’s writing career began with his 2002 
historical epic fantasy, MOREVI The Chronicles of Rafe & Askana, published by 
Dragon Moon Press. His other works include MOREVI’s highly anticipated sequel, 
Legacy of MOREVI: Book One of the Arathellean Wars, and Billibub Baddings and 
The Case of The Singing Sword, a spoof of both fantasy and hard-boiled detec-
tive novel that received an Honorable Mention for ForeWord Magazine’s Book 
of the Year and was a finalist for the Independent Publisher’s Best Science 
Fiction and Fantasy. It was the podcast of his debut novel that led to this 
team-up with Evo Terra in Podcasting For Dummies.

In “real life,” Chuck Tomasi is an IT Manager for Plexus Corp., a contract 
electronics company headquartered in Neenah, Wisconsin. He’s also a devoted 
husband and proud father of two beautiful girls. As for his alter ego . . . Chuck 
was bitten hard by the podcasting bug (there’s an understatement). He was 
so eager to get started in late 2004 that he made a few tweaks to his self-written 
blog software and had the feed ready to go. Since then, one podcast has grown 
to four distinctly different shows. Freestyle, a personal insight in to the pod-
caster’s life, Gmail Podcast, a collection of short tips on Google’s mail appli-
cation, Radio Yesterday, a collection of old time radio shows, and Technorama, 
a light-hearted geek show that was named a finalist in the 2007 Parsec Awards 
in two categories. All of Chuck’s productions can be found at www.chuckchat.
com. As if he weren’t busy enough, he graciously offers his talents to other 
podcasters in the form of audio production, technical assistance, writing for 
Podcast User Magazine (podcastusermagazine.com), and speaking 
engagements such as podcaster meetups, multimedia classes, and the New 
Media Expo. When people talk about podcasting with passion, Chuck’s enthu-
siasm comes to mind. To top things off — by strange coincidence — both 
Chuck and Evo have license plates in their respective states that read PODCAST.
Learn more about Chuck at his Web site: www.chucktomasi.com.

Evo Terra is the poster child for Type A personalities the world over. Evo is a 
washed-up musician, tree-hugging herbalist, heretical-but-ordained minister, 
talk-radio personality, advertising executive and technology innovator, all 
wrapped up in one single-serving package. In the podcasting world, Evo tends 
to infect others with the podcasting bug, from budding show hosts to the 
people behind the scenes finding new uses for podcast technologies. 
He is the man behind helping authors podcast their works to the masses at 
Podiobooks.com.
Evo currently resides in Phoenix, Arizona with his wife Sheila and his son NJ. 
Neither of which have a podcast. Yet. 

Authors’ Acknowledgments
Due to the complexity of the issue and the incredible growth in the community, 
it would be impossible to properly express our thanks to all the parties who 
were of great help with this book. So with that . . .
To our wives, Donna, Sheila, and Natalie: Thanks for not strangling us for our 
constant “Oh! We’ve got to add that to the book!” moments. We deeply appre-
ciate the averted gazes of death when we answered that no, unfortunately we 
would not be coming to bed and that yes we did realize it was three o’clock 
in the morning.
To the podcasters that provided not only inspiration, but also camaraderie 
and friendship along the way. Through listening to you all and talking to 
many, you served as a constant reminder of why we were pouring our hearts 
and souls into this text. 
Finally, a special nod to Michael R. Mennenga for passing along that e-mail on 
October 12, 2004, that opened a door to a world of time-shifting, kick ass mystic 
ninjas, and science fiction and fantasy geeks around the world interested in 
what we have to offer.

Foreword
S
o you want to start a podcast? Well, good news! Everyone that has ever 
started a podcast has found fame, fortune, and success. Hollywood calls 
with infinite interest, ad nauseam, at all the new and original projects that are 
out there. Celebrities fall all over themselves to make appearances on podcasts, 
just waiting for the beckon call of the shows’ hosts. Awards are awarded, 
parties are partied, and recognition and praise are rained down on you daily.
Really? No, it isn’t really like that, but we can dream can’t we?
I’ll be the first to tell you that it isn’t all cotton candy clouds and graham 
cracker streets, but what you can expect is, if you stick with it and make 
something that is interesting or entertaining, people will come. It takes time 
to build, but a podcast can be much more than just a cold or stoic mp3 and 
an RSS feed sitting on a server. They are seeds, seeds for a community.
Podcasting introduced me to individuals, cultures, and personal experiences 
from all over the world as a podcaster and as a listener. People that I 
wouldn’t have otherwise met, from online friends to others I have met in per-
son and consider true friends (starting with the guys that wrote this book), 
all wound up connecting with me through this exciting medium.
Also expect your venture into podcasting to be a personal learning experi-
ence, not just a social one. I have found that by being yourself, being honest, 
and opening up to your listeners that these complete strangers will relate to 
you and become engaged. Those listeners will (generously) give you feed-
back. When you do start to get feedback from listeners, they will routinely 
present you with a new perspective on subjects you talk about, confirm 
things you already know, and even take you into directions you never 
considered. 
There is a lot that you will not expect in your new podcasting adventure and 
that is where this book comes in. Podcasting For Dummies is written by three 
lovable and knowledgeable dummies who have been down that long and 
winding road. They will help you side step and overcome hurdles that will 
ultimately enable you to have fun podcasting . . . and that is what it’s all 
about. That, you can expect.
* Personal Note: As is evident in the pages that follow, I have taught Tee, Evo, 
and Chuck a lot about podcasting, and it shows. Wax on, Wax off.

Introduction
M
aybe you’ve been casually surfing the Web or perusing your newspaper 
when the word podcasting has popped up. Steadily, like a building wave 
that would make champion surfers salivate with delight, the term has popped up 
again and again — and your curiosity continues to pique as the word podcasting 
echoes in your ears and remains in the back of your mind as a riddle wrapped in 
an enigma, super-sized with a side of fries and a diet soda to go.
Podcasting For Dummies, 2nd Edition, is the answer to that super-sized riddle-
enigma combo, and it even comes complete with a special prize. Beginning 
with the question at the forefront of your mind — What is podcasting? — this 
book takes you through the fastest-growing technological movement on the 
Internet. By the time you reach the end of this book, the basics will be in 
place to get you, your voice, and your message heard around the world — 
and you can even have a bit of fun along the way.
About This Book
“So what are you up to, Tee?”
“I’m currently making a podcast of my first novel, a swashbuckling tale that 
carries our heroes . . .”
“Uh . . . what is a podcast?”
Asked by best friends and lifetime technologists, this question continues 
to crop up over and over again, immediately after the word podcast lands in a 
casual conversation. Just the word podcasting carries an air of geekiness about 
it — and behold, the habitual technophobes suddenly clasp their hands to their 
ears and run away screaming in horror lest they confront yet another technical 
matter. Too bad. If they only knew how technical it really isn’t. When you peel 
back the covers and fancy-schmancy tech-talk, it’s a pretty simple process to 
make your own podcast. You just need someone pointing the way and illumi-
nating your path.
This is why we’re here: to be that candle in the dark, helping you navigate a 
world where anyone can do anything, provided they have the tools, the drive, 
and the passion. You don’t need to be a techno-wizard or a super-geek — you 
need no wad of tape holding your glasses together, and your shirt tail need 
not stick out from your fly. Anyone can do what we show you in this book.

Podcasting For Dummies, 2nd Edition
Anyone can take a thought or an opinion, make an audio file expressing that 
opinion, and distribute this idea worldwide. Anyone can capture the attention 
of a few hundred — or a few thousand — people around the world through 
MP3 players hiding in computers, strapped around biceps, jouncing in pockets, 
or hooked up to car stereos.
Anyone can podcast.
Podcasting, from recording to online hosting, can be done on a variety of budgets, 
ranging from frugal to Fortune 500. You can podcast about literally anything — 
including podcasting for its own sake. As blogging gave the anonymous, the 
famous, the almost-famous, and the used-to-be famous a voice in politics, 
religion, and everyday life, podcasting adds volume and tone to that voice.
Podcasting is many things to many people — but at its most basic, it’s a 
surprisingly simple and powerful technology. What it means boils down to 
a single person: you. Some liken it to radio (at least online radio), but it can 
do — and be — so much more. Podcasting is a new method of communication, 
transmitting your voice and its message around the world without using public 
airwaves, connecting the Global Village in ways that the creators of the Internet, 
RSS, and MP3 compression would probably never have dreamed. It is the 
unique and the hard-to-find content that can’t find a place on commercial, 
college, or public access radio.
You’re about to embark on an exciting adventure into undiscovered territory, 
and here you will find out that podcasting is all these things and so much more.
How to Use This Book
Podcasting For Dummies, 2nd Edition, should be these things to all who pick up 
and read it (whether straight through or by jumping around in the chapters):
 
 A user-friendly guide in how to listen, produce, and distribute podcasts
 
 A terrific reference for choosing the right hardware and software to put 
together a sharp-sounding podcast
 
 The starting point for the person who knows nothing about audio edit-
ing, recording, creating RSS feeds, hosting blogs, or how to turn a com-
puter into a recording studio
 
 A handy go-to “think tank” for any beginning podcaster who’s hungry for 
new ideas on what goes into a good podcast and fresh points of view
 
 A really fun read
There will be plenty of answers in these pages, and if you find our answers too 
elementary, we give you plenty of points of reference to research. We don’t claim

 Introduction
to have all the solutions, quick fixes, and resolutions to all possible podcasting 
queries, but we do present to you the basic building blocks and first steps for 
beginning a podcast. As with any For Dummies book, our responsibility is to 
give you the foundation on which to build. That’s what we’ve done our level 
best to accomplish: Bestow upon you the enchanted stuff that makes a pod-
cast happen.
This book was written as a linear path from the conceptualization stages to 
the final publication of your work. However, not everyone needs to read the 
book from page one. If you’ve already gotten your feet wet with the various 
aspects of podcasting, jump around from section to section and read the 
parts that you need. We provide plenty of guides back to other relevant chap-
ters for when the going gets murky.
Conventions Used in This Book
When you go through this book, you’re going to see a few Ô symbols, the 
occasional ➪, and even a few things typed in a completely different 
style. There’s a method to this madness, and those methods are conven-
tions found throughout this book.
When we refer to keyboard shortcuts for Macintosh or Windows, we desig-
nate them with (Mac) or (Windows). For Mac shortcuts, we use the funky 
cloverleaf symbol, (found on the Command key) and the corresponding 
letter. For Windows shortcuts, we use the abbreviation for the Control key 
(Ctrl) and the corresponding letter. So the shortcut for Select All looks like 
this: Ô+A (Mac) / Ctrl+A (Windows).
If keyboard shortcuts aren’t your thing and you want to know where the com-
mands reside on menus, we use a command arrow (➪) to help guide you through 
menus and submenus. So, the command for Select All in the application’s menu is 
Edit➪Select All. You first select the Edit menu and the Select All.
When we offer URLs (Web addresses) of various podcasts, resources, and 
audio equipment vendors, or when we have you creating RSS feeds for pod-
catchers such as iTunes, iPodder, or iPodderX, we use this particular 
typeface.
Bold Assumptions
We assume that you have a computer, a lot of curiosity, and a desire to pod-
cast. We could care less about whether you’re using a Mac, a PC, Linux, Unix,

Podcasting For Dummies, 2nd Edition
or two Dixie cups connected with string. (Okay, maybe the two Dixie cups 
connected with string would be a challenge; a computer is essential.) In 
podcasting, the operating system just makes the computer go. We’re here to 
provide you tools for creating a podcast, regardless of what OS you’re running.
If you know nothing about audio production, this book can also serve as a 
fine primer in how to record, edit, and produce audio on your computer, as 
well as accessorize your computer with mixing boards, professional-grade 
microphones, and audio-engineering software that will give you a basic look at 
this creative field. You can hang on to this book as a handy reference, geared 
for audio in podcasting. Again, our book is a starting point, and (ahem) a fine 
starting point at that.
With everything that goes into podcasting, there are some things this book is 
not now, nor will ever be, about. Here’s the short list:
 
 We’re not out to make you into an übergeek in RSS or XML (but we give 
you all you need to make things work — even get you iTunes-ready).
 
 We figure that if you get hold of Audacity, GarageBand, Audio Hijack Pro, 
Soundtrack, or Audition, you can take it from there (but we give you 
overviews of those programs and a few basic editing examples).
 
 We’re not out to teach you how to use an MP3 player such as an iPod, an 
iRiver, or a Zen Micro product.
For that matter, to dispel one of the biggest misconceptions of podcasting, 
you will not be told to run out and get an iPod. You do not need an iPod to 
podcast — or to listen to podcasts for that matter.
If you are looking for a terrific start to the podcasting experience, then — in 
the words of the last knight guarding the Holy Grail in Indiana Jones and the 
Last Crusade — “You have chosen wisely.”
How This Book Is Organized
The following sections give you a quick overview of what this book has to 
offer. And yeah, we’re going to keep the overview brief because we figure 
you’re anxious to get started. But the fact that you’re reading this passage 
also tells us you don’t want to miss a detail, so here’s a quick bird’s-eye view 
of what we do in Podcasting For Dummies.

5
 Introduction
Part I: Podcasting on a 
Worldwide Frequency
Part I goes into the bare-bones basics of how a podcast happens, how to get 
podcasts from the Internet to your computer, and how to host a podcast 
yourself — ending up with a few places online that offer podcast feeds you 
can visit to sample the experience and (later on) to let the world know “Hey, 
I’ve got a podcast, too!”
Part I also helps you pick out the best hardware and software you need to 
start podcasting.
Part II: The Hills Are Alive with 
the Sound of Podcasting
Consider this part of the book Inside the Actor’s Studio — part Tech TV, and 
part WKRP (with your host, Dr. Johnny Fever . . . boooouuugaaar!!!). This is 
where we offer some techniques the pros use in broadcasting. Podcasting 
may be the grass-roots movement of homespun telecommunications, but 
that doesn’t mean it has to sound that way (unless, of course, you want it to 
sound that way). From preshow prep to setting your volume levels to the 
basics of audio editing, this is the part that polishes your podcast.
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great 
Recording of Your Voice. Now What?
The audio file you’ve just created is now silently staring at you from your 
monitor (unless you’re listening to it on your computer’s music player, in 
which case it’s just defiantly talking back at you!), and you haven’t a clue what 
your next step is. We cover the last-minute details and then walk you through 
the process of getting your podcast online, finding the right Web-hosting pack-
ages for podcasts, and getting a good working handle on the RSS and XML used 
in podcast feeds.

Podcasting For Dummies, 2nd Edition
Part IV: Start Spreadin’ the 
News about Your Podcast
“I wanna beeee a part of it. Podcasting, babeeeee . . .
If I can get on Daily Source,
Then I’ll have no remorse for pod—cast—in . . . podcasting . . .”
Sorry. Sinatra moment.
Anyway, you have the podcast recorded, edited, and online, but now you 
need to let people know you have this great podcast just waiting for them — 
and that’s what we explore in Part IV. With the power of publicity — from 
free-of-charge word-of-mouth (arguably the most effective) to investment in 
Google AdWords (arguably the most coverage for your dollar), you have a 
wide array of options to choose from when you’re ready to announce your 
presence to the podcasting community.
Part V: Pod-sibilities to 
Consider for Your Show
The question of why one should podcast is as important as how to podcast. 
We cover some basic rationales that many folks have for sitting behind a 
microphone, pouring heart, soul, and pocket change into their craft each and 
every day, week, or month. These questions have no right or wrong answers, 
but our hope is that this part offers pointers to convey you safely through 
the thought process behind podcasting.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Perhaps the toughest chapters to write were these: the For Dummies trademark 
Part of Tens chapters. So don’t skip them because we’ll be über-miffed if you fail 
to appreciate how hard we busted our humps to get these chapters done!
Right — so what do we give you in our Part of Tens? We give you a list of the 
ten people who made (and/or currently make) podcasting the hottest com-
munications trend to come down the pike since the invention of the Internet. 
We also offer suggestions for the beginning podcaster — such as what kind of 
podcasts should be on your MP3 player, just to give you an idea of what’s out 
there, how they sound, and how you can benefit from them. Finally, our Part 
of Tens closes with the great debate: Podcasting versus Radio. Is radio dead? 
Is podcasting just another fad? Read . . . and then you decide.

 Introduction
About the Companion Podcast
In some cases, a For Dummies book comes with a companion Web site hosted 
by the good people at www.dummies.com. This book comes with a companion 
podcast. Go to your browser and surf to www.dummies.com/go/podcasting
fd and follow the instructions to get free weekly audio commentary from Tee 
Morris and Chuck Tomasi about concepts in this book explored in greater detail, 
from the difference between good and bad edits, when too much reverb is too 
much, and the variety of methods you can use to record a podcast.
Icons Used in This Book
So you’re trekking through the book, making some real progress with devel-
oping your podcast, when suddenly these little icons leap out, grab you by 
the throat, and wrestle you to the ground. (Who would have thought pod-
casting was so action-packed, like a Connery-Bond movie, huh?) What do all 
these little drawings mean? Glad you asked. 
 
When we’re in the middle of a discussion and suddenly we have one of those 
“Say, that reminds me . . .” moments, we give you one of these tips. They’re 
handy little extras that are good to know and might even make your podcast 
sound a little tighter than average.
 
If the moment is more than a handy little nugget of information and closer to a 
“Seriously, you can’t forget this part!” factoid, we mark it with a Remember icon. 
You’re going to want to play close attention to these puppies. 
 
Sometimes we interrupt our train of thought with a “Time out, Sparky . . .” 
moment — and this is where we ask for your completely undivided attention. 
The Warnings are exactly that: flashing lights, ah-ooga horns, dire portents. 
They’re reminders not to try this at home because you’ll definitely regret it.
 
These icons illuminate the “So how does this widget really work . . . ?” moments 
you may have as you read this book. The Technical Stuff icons give you a 
deeper understanding of what the wizard is doing behind the curtain, making 
you all the more apt as a podcaster. But if you want to skip the nitty gritty 
details, that’s perfectly fine, too.

Podcasting For Dummies, 2nd Edition
Where to Go from Here
At this point, many For Dummies authors say something snappy, clever, or 
even a bit snarky. We save our best tongue-and-cheek material for the pages 
inside, so here’s a more serious approach. . . .
We suggest heading to where you’re planning to record your podcast, or just 
plant yourself in front of a computer, and start with Chapter 1 where you’re 
given a few links to check out, some suggestions on applications for down-
loading podcasts, and directories to look up where you can find Tee’s and 
Chuck’s (many) podcasts, and other podcasts that can educate, inspire, and 
enlighten your ears with original content.
Where do we go from here? Up and out, friends. Up and out . . .

epending on who’s describing it, podcasting is either 
taking the world by storm or providing an interest-
ing diversion. If neither of those, it falls somewhere in 
between. Whatever it is, we like it, and we think you will 
too. In this first part, we peel back the covers and go 
beyond the hype to talk about what this technology is and 
exactly what you need to do to become involved with it — 
from soup to nuts.

ometimes the invention that makes the biggest impact on our daily lives isn’t 
an invention at all, but the convergence of existing technologies, processes, 
and ideas. Podcasting may be the perfect example of that principle — and it’s 
changing the relationship people have with their radios, music collections, books, 
education, and more.
The podcasting movement is actually a spin-off of another communications 
boom: personal Weblogs, commonly referred to as blogs. Blogs sprang up 
right and left, providing non-programmers and designers a clean, elegant 
interface that left many on the technology side wondering why they hadn’t 
thought of it sooner. Everyday people could chronicle their lives, hopes, dreams, 
and fears, and show them to anyone who cared to read. And oddly enough, 
people did care to read — and still do.
Podcasting combines the instant information exchange of blogging with audio 
and video files that can be played on a computer or portable media device. 
When you make your podcast publicly available on the World Wide Web, you are 
exposing your craft to anyone with a computer and a broadband Internet con-
nection. To put that in perspective, some online sources report the global online 
population is over 1.2 billion users. In the United States, broadband connections 
are now more popular than dialup among the 235 million Internet users. And to 
top it all off, portable players are surging in popularity, with over 22 million adult 
owners.
This chapter is for the consumers of the content (the audience) and those 
who make the content (the podcasters) alike. We cover the basic steps to 
record a podcast and lay out the basics of what you need to do to enjoy a 
podcast on your media player.

Par t I: Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency 
If you’re starting to get the idea that podcasting is revolutionary, ground-
breaking, and possibly a major component of social upheaval, great. But not 
all podcasts are so deep. In fact, many of them are just plain fun!
Deciding Whether Podcasting Is for You
Technically speaking, podcasting is the distribution of specially encoded mul-
timedia content to subscribed personal computers via the RSS 2.0 protocol. 
Whew! Allow us to translate that into common-speak:
Podcasting allows you to listen to stuff you want to hear, whenever and 
wherever you want.
Podcasting turns the tables on broadcast schedules, allowing the listener to 
choose not only what to listen to, but also when. And because podcasts are 
transferred via the Internet, the power to create an audio program isn’t lim-
ited to those with access to a radio transmitter. 
The simplest reason to podcast is that it’s just plain fun! We’ve been podcast-
ing since the beginning, and we’re still having a blast, continuing to get out 
messages to our worldwide audiences and challenging ourselves with new 
tricks and techniques in creating captivating media. So, yeah, for the fun of it. 
Heck of a good reason.
The following sections cover other reasons podcasting is probably for you.
You want to deliver audio 
content on a regular basis
Sure, you can include audio content in your blog if you have one. Many bloggers 
record audio segments and insert them as links into the text of their blog posts. 
Readers of the blog then download the files at their leisure. However, audio blogs 
require the readers to manually select the content they want to download. What 
sets podcasting apart from blogging is that podcasting automates that process. 
A listener who subscribes to your podcast is subscribed to all of your content, 
whenever it’s available. No need to go back to the site to see what’s new!

13
 Chapter 1: Get ting the Scoop on Podcasting
You want to reach beyond 
the boundaries of radio
In radio, the number of people who can listen to a show is limited by the power 
of the transmitter pumping out the signal. Podcasting doesn’t use radio signals, 
transmitters, or receivers — at least not in the classic sense. Podcasts use the 
World Wide Web as a delivery system, opening up a potential audience that 
could extend to the entire planet.
No rules exist (yet, anyway) to regulate the creation of podcast content. In 
fact, neither the FCC nor any other regulatory body for any other government 
holds jurisdiction over podcasts. If that seems astounding, remember that 
podcasters are not using the public airwaves to deliver the message.
 
Just because the FCC doesn’t have jurisdiction, you’re not exempt from the 
law or — perhaps more importantly — immune to lawsuits. You’re personally 
responsible for anything you say, do, or condone on your show. Additionally, the 
rules concerning airplay of licensed music, the distribution of copyrighted mate-
rial, and the legalities of recording conversations all apply. Pay close attention to 
the relevant sections in Chapter 4 to avoid some serious consequences. When it 
comes to the legalities, ignorance is not bliss.
What’s in a name, when the name is podcasting?
As with most items that make their way into 
the conventional lexicon of speech, the pre-
cise origins and meaning behind podcasting 
are somewhat clouded. Although the domain 
podcast.com was originally registered back 
in 2002 (nothing was ever done with it, as far 
as we know), and Ben Hammersley suggested 
that and many other terms in February 2004 
(www.guardian.co.uk/media/2004/
feb/12/broadcasting.digital
media), it’s generally accepted in the podcast 
community that the first person to use the term 
as a reference to the activity we now know as 
podcasting was Dannie Gregoire on September 
15, 2004 (http://groups.yahoo.com/
group/ipodder-dev/message/41). 
Although some assert the name has conno-
tations to the popular iPod device created by 
Apple, Dannie didn’t have that in mind when 
the phrase was coined. Regardless of the inten-
tions, the term has been backronymed (that is, 
treated like an acronym and applied to a variety 
of plausible existing meanings). Of all the pos-
sibilities, we prefer Programming On-Demand 
casting (not broadcasting), which shortens 
nicely to podcasting. But of course, you can 
choose whichever one makes sense to you.
Granted, the podcasting phenomenon was in 
part fueled by the wildly popular iPod portable 
media device, but no evidence suggests that the 
two were related when the name was coined. 

14
Par t I: Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency 
 
Narrowcasting (the practice of delivering content to a select group) distinguishes 
podcasting from traditional forms of broadcast communication, such as radio. 
Where a radio station broadly casts its signal to anyone who happens to be 
within the radius of the signal, podcasts narrowly cast content to people who 
have made the overt decision to listen.
You have something to say
As a general rule, podcasters produce content that likely holds appeal for only 
a select group of listeners. Podcasts start with an idea, something that you have 
the desire and knowledge, either real or imaginary, to talk about. Add to that a 
bit of drive, do-it-yourself-ishness, and an inability to take no for an answer. The 
point is to say what you want to say, to those who want to hear it.
Podcasts can be about anything and be enjoyed by just about anyone. The 
topics covered don’t have to be earth-shattering or life-changing. There are 
a few rules and guidelines in common practice, but there may be times when 
you find it necessary to bend the rules. (That can be a lot of fun in itself!)
Some of the most popular podcasts are created by everyday people who sit 
in front of their computers for a few nights a week and just speak their minds, 
hearts, and souls. Some are focused on niche topics; others are more 
broad-based.
You want to hear from your listeners
We’ve heard more than one podcaster comment on the fact that they get, 
well . . . comments. Podcast listeners are more likely to provide feedback for 
the podcasts they listen to than radio show listeners are likely to e-mail their 
thoughts to the show host. That’s probably traceable to the personal nature 
of a podcast. Podcasts offer their listeners — and makers — more control, 
options, and intimacy than traditional broadcast media can. Of course, the 
radio is much harder to talk back to than a computer with an Internet 
connection and e-mail.
 
When you ask for feedback, you’re likely to get it — and from unusual places. 
Because geography doesn’t limit the distance your podcast can travel, you 
may find yourself with listeners in faraway and exotic places. And this feed-
back isn’t always going to be “Wow, great podcast!” Listeners will be honest 
with you when you invite feedback.

15
 Chapter 1: Get ting the Scoop on Podcasting
Creating a Podcast
There are two schools of thought when it comes to creating a podcast: The “I 
need the latest and greatest equipment in order to capture that crisp, clear sound 
of the broadcasting industry” school of thought, and the “Hey, my computer came 
with a microphone, and I’ve got this cool recording software already installed” 
school of thought. Both are equally valid positions, and there are a lot of 
secondary schools in-between. The question is how far you’re willing to go.
But allow us to dispel a few misconceptions about podcasting right off the 
bat: You’re not reprogramming your operating system, you’re not hacking 
into the Internal Revenue Service’s database, and you’re not setting up a 
wireless computer network with tinfoil from a chewing gum wrapper, a shoe-
string, and your belt — regardless of whether MacGyver showed you how. 
Podcasting, as mentioned earlier, is not rocket science. In fact, here’s a quick 
rundown of how you podcast:
 
1. Record audio and convert it to a download-friendly format.
 
2. Create a simple but specialized text file that describes your audio file.
 
3. Upload everything to the Web.
Yes, yes, yes, if it were that simple, then why is this book so thick? Well, 
we admit that this list does gloss over a few details, but a podcast — in its 
most streamlined, raw presentation — is that simple. The details of put-
ting together a podcast start in Chapter 2 and wrap up in Chapter 7; then 
Chapters 9, 10, and 12 walk you through all the geek-speak you need to 
accomplish the podcast.
Looking for the bare necessities
You need a few things before starting your first podcast, many of which you 
can probably find on your own computer:
 
 A microphone: Take a look at your computer. Right now, regardless of 
whether you have a laptop or desktop model, Windows or Macintosh, 
your computer probably has a microphone built into it — or a jack for 
plugging in an external mic, and maybe even an included external mic 
packaged somewhere with the manuals, cables, and such.
 
 Position the microphone in a comfortable spot on your desk or table. 
If you’re using a laptop, it should be somewhere on your desk that 
allows for best recording results without hunching over the computer 
like Young Frankenstein’s Igor (That’s EYE-gor.) Check the laptop’s 
documentation to find out where the built-in microphone is located in 
the unit’s housing.

 Usually the built-in microphone in a laptop is located close to the edge 
of the keyboard or near the laptop’s speakers. Some models tuck it in at 
the center point of the monitor’s base. 
 
 Recording software: Check out the software that came with your computer. 
You know, all those extra CDs that you filed away, thinking, “I’ll check 
those out sometime.” Well, the time has arrived to flip through them. 
You probably have some sort of audio-recording software loaded on 
your computer, such as RecordIt (PC) or GarageBand (which comes 
pre-installed with many new Macs).
 
 If you don’t already have the appropriate software, here’s a fast way to 
get it: Download the version of Audacity that fits your operating system 
(at http://audacity.sourceforge.net), shown in Figure 1-1. (Oh, 
yeah . . . it’s free.)
 
 An audio card: Make sure your computer has the hardware it needs to 
handle audio recording and the drivers to run the hardware — unless, of 
course, you have a built-in microphone.
 
 Some desktop computers come with a very elementary audio card built 
into the motherboard. Before you run out to your local computer vendor 
and spring for an audio card, check your computer to see whether it can 
already handle basic voice recording.
For tips on choosing the right mic and audio accessories, be sure to check 
out Chapter 2. Chapter 3 covers all the software you need.

Recording your first podcast
When you have your computer set up and your microphone working, it’s 
time to start recording. Take a deep breath and then follow these steps:
 
1. Jot down a few notes on what you want to talk about.
 
 Nothing too fancy — just make an outline that includes remarks about 
who you are and what you want to talk about. Use these notes to keep 
yourself on track.
 
 All this — checking your computer, jotting down notes, and setting up 
your recording area — is called preshow prep, discussed in depth in 
Chapter 4 by other podcasters who have their own ways of approaching 
preshow prep (all of which can give you some starting points).
 
2. Click the Record button in your recording software and go for as long 
as it takes for you to get through your notes.
 
 We recommend keeping your first recording to no more than 20 minutes. 
That may seem like a lot of time, but it will fly by.
 
3. Give a nice little sign-off (like “Take care of yourselves! See you next 
month.”) and click the Stop button.
 
4. Choose File➪Save As and give your project a name.
 
 Now bask in the warmth of creative accomplishment.
Compressing your audio files
Nearly all portable media devices and computers can play MP3 files as a 
default format. Some play many other formats, but MP3 is used as a common 
format. If your recording software has the ability to output straight to MP3 
format, your life is much simpler. In Audacity’s case, you need to download 
an add-on file. If you can’t export directly to MP3, check out Apple iTunes at 
www.apple.com/itunes. (The iTunes window is shown in Figure 1-2.) It 
does many things for the podcaster, including converting a wide variety of 
audio file formats to MP3. Yes, it’s from Apple, but the Apple folks made sure 
to create a version for Windows also.
After you install iTunes, follow these steps to convert your audio file:
 
1. Choose File➪Add File to Library.
 
 Or you can press Ô+O (Mac) or Ctrl+O (Windows).
 
2. Browse for the audio file you want to convert and then click Open.
 
 Your file is now in the iTunes Library.

4. Choose Advanced➪Convert Selection to MP3.
 
 Your file is converted to the MP3 format. Figure 1-3 shows the progress 
screen that indicates your file is being converted.
 
The default file format for iTunes file import is AAC. If your menu doesn’t have 
a Convert Selection to MP3 option, go to iTunes Preferences (File➪Preferences 
on a Mac, or Edit➪Preferences in Windows), under the Advanced tab, 
Importing tab, and change the Import Using option to MP3 Encoder. The 
Settings should be at least Good Quality (128 kbps). Now your files will be 
imported and converted to MP3.
Congratulations — you just recorded your first audio podcast! Easy, isn’t it? 
This is merely the first step into a larger world, as Obi-Wan once told Luke.
Transferring your audio to the Web
An audio file sitting on your desktop, regardless of how earth-shattering the 
contents may be, is not a podcast. Nope, not by a long shot. You have to get 
it up on the World Wide Web and provide a way for listeners’ podcatcher 
software to grab that tasty file for later consumption.

Figure 1-3:

If you already have a Web server for your blog, company Web site, or personal 
site, this process can be as easy as creating a new folder and transferring your 
newly created audio file to your server via your FTP client of choice.
If that last paragraph left you puzzled and you’re wondering what kind of 
mess you’ve gotten yourself into . . . relax. We don’t leave you hanging out in 
the wind. Chapter 10 covers everything you need to know about choosing a 
Web host for your podcast media files.
 
Note that we called your audio a podcast media file. Podcasting isn’t just about 
audio. On the contrary, you can podcast any sort of media file you like, even 
video. Although this book focuses on audio files, you can use all the tips we 
give here to handle other types of media files.
After you post the media file, you need to create a specially formatted text 
file, known as an RSS file (Really Simple Syndication), explained in detail in 
Chapter 12, and move it up to your Web server. This file describes where to 
find the media file you just placed on your Web server. This is your podcast 
feed. People who listen to your podcast can subscribe to your show by plac-
ing a link to this podcast feed in their podcatching client.
Yes, we know . . . this sounds really complicated. But we assure you it’s not. 
Some hosting companies such as LibSyn (www.libsyn.com) specialize in 
taking the technological “bite” out of podcasting so you can focus on creating 

20
Par t I: Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency 
your best-sounding show. With LibSyn (shown in Figure 1-4), moving your 
audio files to the Web server is as simple as pushing a few buttons, and the 
creation of the RSS 2.0 podcast feed and even the accompanying Web page 
are automatic.
If you want to take more control over your Web site, podcast media files, and 
their corresponding RSS 2.0 feed, look at Chapters 10 and 12. In those pages, 
we walk you through some essentials — not only how to upload a file but 
also how to easily generate your RSS 2.0 file using a variety of tools.

Grabbing listeners
With media files in place and an RSS 2.0 feed ready for podcatcher consump-
tion, you’re officially a podcaster. Of course, that doesn’t mean a lot if you’re 
the only person who knows about your podcast. You need to spread the 
word to let others know that you exist and that you have something pretty 
darn important to say.
Creating show notes
Before you pick up a bullhorn, slap a sandwich board over yourself, and start 
walking down the street (virtually, anyway), you have to make sure you’re des-
criptive enough to captivate those who reach your Web site. First, you’re going to 
want to describe the contents of your show to casual online passers-by in hopes 
of getting them to listen to what you have to say.

21
 Chapter 1: Get ting the Scoop on Podcasting
 
You can easily glance at a blog and get the gist of a conversation, but an audio 
file requires active listening to understand, and it’s quite difficult to skim. In 
effect, you’re asking people to make an investment of their time in listening to 
you talk, read a story, or play music. You need some compelling text on a Web 
page to hook them.
Descriptions of podcast episodes are called show notes, and they’re designed 
to quickly showcase or highlight the relevant and pertinent contents of the 
audio file itself. A verbatim transcript of your show isn’t a good idea, but we 
do recommend more than simply saying “a show about my day.” Chapter 11 
discusses ways to create your show notes and offers tips and tricks to give 
them some punch. (Refer to Figure 1-4 for an example of what show notes 
look like on a Web browser.)
Getting listed in directories
When you have a ready media file and a solid set of show notes, you’re ready 
to take your podcast message to the masses. You can get listed on some 
directories and podcast-listing sites, such as iTunes, Podcast Alley, Podcast 
Pickle, Zune Marketplace, and Digg.com (explained later in this chapter). 
Potential listeners visit literally dozens of Web sites as they seek out new 
content, and getting yourself listed on as many as possible can help bring in 
more new listeners to your program.
 
A huge listener base is a double-edged sword: More demand for your product 
means more of a demand on you and the resources necessary to keep your 
podcast up and running. We recommend working on your craft and your skills, 
as well as getting a good handle on the personal and technological require-
ments of podcasting, before you embark on a huge marketing campaign. When 
you’re ready, Part IV has more details about marketing.
Part IV spends a lot of time talking about the various ways you can attract 
more listeners to your show and ways to respond to the ideas and feedback 
that your listeners inevitably provide. Many podcasters are surprised at the 
sheer volume of comments they receive from their listeners — but when you 
consider how personal podcasting is (compared to traditional forms of media 
distribution), that’s really not surprising at all.
Catching a Cast with Your 
Podcatching Client
So you have the MP3 file, some XML, and accompanying show notes. You’re 
all set, but ask yourself, “How do podcasts get from the Web to my computer?” 
To access all this great, new content, you need a podcatcher, an application 
that looks at various RSS feeds, finds the new stuff, and transfers it from the 

22
Par t I: Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency 
Internet to your computer automatically. In this section, we take a look at 
some of the different podcatching clients available for your listening/viewing 
needs.
 
You may think you need an iPod for all kinds of reasons, but you really don’t 
need one to podcast. Allow us to state that again: You do not need an iPod 
to listen to or create a podcast. As long as you have an MP3 player — be it an 
application on a Mac, an application on a PC, or a portable device you can 
unplug and take with you — you possess the capability to listen to podcasts. 
Depending on the MP3 player, you may even be able to create your podcast 
on the device as well — but to listen, all you need is a device that can play 
audio files.
The catcher that started it all: Juice
Juice (shown in Figure 1-5) started life as a product called iSpider, then was 
branded as iPodder, and later became iPodder Lemon. In November 2005, as 
if searching for a new identity in the community, the package was rebranded 
as Juice. It was inspired by a script written by Adam Curry (yes, the former 
MTV VJ and no, we’re not kidding). It promotes itself as an open-source (free 
to use) application that downloads audio files from RSS feeds of your choice 
directly to your Mac or PC. You can then sync your portable player with your 
computer’s media player, and now you’re podcasting-on-the-go.

 Chapter 1: Get ting the Scoop on Podcasting
Download Juice from http://juicereceiver.sourceforge.net. After 
you install it, subscribing to feeds is a simple process. Follow these steps if 
you don’t have a specific podcast in mind:
 
1. Click the Podcast Directory tab.
 
 Juice comes preloaded with a variety of the more popular directories of 
podcasts.
 
2. Navigate through the directory structure.
 
 Click the name of the directory to see the choices offered. In some 
cases, you may need to click through to a subdirectory to see additional 
podcasts.
 
3. Double-click the name of a podcast.
 
 You can also single-click the name of the podcast and then click the Add 
button near the top.
 
4. Click Save.
That’s it! You’ve just subscribed to your first podcast with Juice.
Of course, you don’t have to navigate through the list of podcasts. Follow 
these steps if you have a specific podcast in mind:
 
1. Click the Subscriptions tab.
 
2. On the Subscriptions panel, click the little green button with a plus 
symbol on it.
 
 The Add a Feed window opens.
 
3. On your favorite podcast Web site, look for a small icon, typically 
orange, that says RSS, RSS 2.0, or something similar.
 
 
 The icon may not even say RSS, but simply be a symbol like the one in 
the margin.
 
4. Right click the icon to copy the link location.
 
5. Paste the copied information into the URL field of the Add a Feed 
window.
 
 Or, type it in — just be very careful with your typing! If you get it wrong, 
you won’t get your downloads.
Congrats! You now know how to use Juice to subscribe to any podcasts you 
happen to come across in the future.

The 800-pound gorilla called iTunes
With the launch of iTunes version 4.9 in June 2005, podcasting went from 
what the geeks were doing in the basement of the Science Building to the 
next wave of innovation on the Internet (which was, of course, developed by 
the geeks in the basement of the Science Building). As always, a step into the 
mainstream market brought some dismay; the hardcore, independent pod-
casters considered this a sad day for podcasting as corporate entities (spon-
sored by Disney, ESPN, BBC, and so on) dominated the iTunes Music Store 
podcast directory (shown in Figure 1-6). What about the indie podcasts — 
the ones that started it all? Would they be forgotten? Go unnoticed? Languish 
unsubscribed? Well, at first, it seemed that many of the original groundbreak-
ers that the podcasting community knew and loved (The Dawn and Drew 
Show, Career Opportunities, The Catholic Insider, GrammarGirl) might get lost 
in the stampede. But not yet, as it turns out.
Apple’s iTunes (available for download at www.itunes.com) works as a pod-
catching client. It lends an automatic hand to people who don’t know where 
to find aggregators, where to find blogs that host podcasts, and which pod-
cast directories list the shows that fit their needs and desires — now they 
too can enjoy a wide range of podcast choices.

The Apple

25
 Chapter 1: Get ting the Scoop on Podcasting
With iTunes, podcasting reached into the mainstream markets around the 
world. (And if that doesn’t make you go “Wow!” consider this: On August 4, 
2005, iTunes launched in Japan. Within four days, the iTunes Music Store had 
1 million downloads. Sony’s own MP3 download service averages less than 
500,000 downloads a month.) Instead of dealing with third-party applications, 
Apple iTunes is a one-stop shop for all your podcasting needs.
It gets even better: Subscribing to a podcast with iTunes is just as easy, if not 
easier than with Juice. Follow these steps to do so:
 
1. In the iTunes Music Store, click the Podcasts link located in the top 
section of the left column.
 
 You can also click the Podcasts icon on the top left of the main iTunes 
screen and the Podcast Directory icon in the lower right. Or search for 
a podcaster or a podcast using the Search bar in the upper-right of the 
iTunes interface.
 
2. Find the podcast of your choice.
 
 You can do that by 
 
• Clicking the Browse link to browse through all the podcasts in 
iTunes
 
• Searching by clicking the Power Search link
 
 Both of these links are located in the Quick Links section on the right 
side of the Podcasts page in the iTunes Music Store.
 
3. When you get to the podcast page (and available podcasts) in iTunes, 
click the Subscribe button.
 
 If you’re using iTunes for the first time to subscribe to a feed, you get a 
confirmation message. You can select the Do Not Ask About Subscribing 
Again option to avoid this message.
After your podcast finishes downloading, you can find the new episodes by 
going to the Podcasts section in the left column of iTunes. The new episodes 
are marked to let you know that you have fresh content waiting for you, and 
iTunes remembers where you left off in a podcast if you pause or zip over to 
another podcast or playlist. 
Options, options, and more options
Of course, everyone’s tastes and styles are different, and there are plenty 
more options for podcatching clients. Maybe you’re using Mac, Windows, or 
an entirely different operating system. Maybe you don’t want to install any 

26
Par t I: Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency 
new software on your system, or maybe you just like to be different. Hey, 
that’s okay! You too can be a podcast listener:
 
 Doppler: Designed exclusively for the Windows platform, Doppler (http://
dopplerradio.net) has a strong contingent of dedicated users who are 
perfectly happy with the features it offers. Additionally, it seems to be a 
pretty rock-solid piece of software, and it’s available for free.
 
 Songbird: Songbird (www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Audio/
Audio-Players/Songbird.shtml) is another Windows-only application 
that takes an interesting approach to podcatching (and music) with its 
Web browser look and feel. The default interface is a bit dark, but it can 
be customized if you have a little savvy with that sort of thing. Although the 
software is stable, it was a bit confusing at first to subscribe to podcasts — 
a little digging through the help provides two options. The product idea is 
sound, but needs a little maturity as of this writing.
 
 Podcast Ready: In some ways, Podcast Ready (http://podcastready.
com) is similar to iTunes. It combines simple-to-use software and an 
easy-to-use Web interface to find and download podcasts. Using a book-
marked link, you can quickly subscribe to podcasts via Podcast Ready’s 
site from any Web page with an RSS feed. Using MyPodder software, you 
can sync your Podcast Ready subscription list with your iPod. MyPodder 
is available for Windows, Mac OSX, Linux, and more, and is available to 
download right from the Podcast Ready site.
 
 Zune Marketplace: Zune Marketplace (http://zune.net) is the com-
panion software to the Zune portable media device. The marketplace 
contains lots of choices for music and podcasts. It is currently available 
only for Microsoft Windows — which makes sense because Microsoft 
makes the Zune. Using categories or a search, you can quickly find con-
tent that interests you. Many podcasters have the Zune icon on their Web 
sites to make it easy to get their content with a single click of the mouse.
 
 PodNova: PodNova (http://podnova.com) is a service that tracks 
podcast content, yet doesn’t require you to download any software to 
your desktop. You have the option to download some software so files 
can be transferred to your MP3 player, but it’s nice to know that some 
services don’t require this step. The service is pretty intuitive with a 
decent search and allows you to set up lists of your favorite shows so 
you can keep them handy.
 
This is only a starting point for getting access to podcasts. Any attempt at a 
comprehensive list here would be instantly obsolete. Podcasting continues to 
grow in popularity, and new podcatching clients and players are coming out 
all the time. Don’t think podcast listening is limited to your computer or MP3 
player — you can even listen to podcasts on your phone or TiVo. 

27
 Chapter 1: Get ting the Scoop on Podcasting
For more information and product comparisons, we suggest heading over to 
PodcatcherMatrix (http://podcatchermatrix.org) and exploring more 
podcatching clients. Bottom line: At this point, you should easily be able to 
subscribe to the podcasts of your choice.
Quest for Podcasts
Now that you have your podcatching client, it’s time to take a good listen to 
what’s happening in the podcasting community. If you’re going to podcast 
(and with you picking up this book, it’s a safe assumption that the interest is 
strong), it’s a good idea to take a look around the podcasting community and 
see what other podcasters are doing. 
Many podcatching clients have internal directories of podcasts, and you can 
access their listings from another directory or listing site maintained elsewhere 
on the Internet. Other aggregators maintain their own lists based on how many 
listeners have used their podcatcher to subscribe to particular shows.
We give you a few other places to get started in the following sections — 
directories, podcast-listing services, and even podcast-specific search 
engines. (Check out the various sources mentioned in Chapter 18 as well.) So 
where are these directories? Fire up your browser and, as Edgar Winter says, 
“Come on and take a free ride. . .”
 
There are so many directories for podcasts that Rob Walch of Podcast411 has 
put together a “directory of directories” (http://podcast411.com/page2.
html). As of this writing, 161 different directories are listed!
iTunes
For the time being, iTunes is king of the hill when it comes to podcast direc-
tories. The directory includes not only show information, searchable in a myriad 
of ways, but also the ability to listen to specific episodes, subscribe to a podcast 
with one click, visit the show’s Web site, leave comments, and see the podcast 
picks of other people who share an interest in the show you’re viewing — and 
all that is tied in to the same free, friendly software you use to sync your iPod! 
When your podcast gets legs and starts running, and it comes time to post 
your name in the directories, make sure you put iTunes near the top of the 
list. From a public relations standpoint, it’s pretty impressive to say “My pod-
cast is listed in Apple iTunes.” Many Web sites even have a link directly to 
their iTunes podcast page and one-click subscription. You have to admit, the 
people at Apple are always trying to make things simpler.

28
Par t I: Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency 
Podcast Pickle
Gary Leland and the crew at Podcast Pickle (http://podcastpickle.com) 
take a slightly different approach for listeners to find the podcasts they’re look-
ing for. Their best innovation, in our opinion, is the Favorites listing. Rather 
than rely on voting as a measure of popularity, the Pickle allows registered 
members to mark as many shows as they like as their favorites. The more 
people who have marked a show as Favorite, the higher up on the Favorites 
list a podcast is. And unlike Podcast Alley’s fairly unwavering top 10 list, Podcast 
Pickle periodically takes its top ranked podcasts and moves them to the “Hall 
of Fame” to allow others to show up in the top listing. A neat idea!
Yes, it’s a lot like a popularity contest; you have no way to judge how well 
you might like a show just because a bunch of other people do. That’s why 
Podcast Pickle also allows you to browse by category or search for relevant 
keywords that mean something to you. Like Podcast Alley, it also has an 
active forum section where you can see what other folks are saying about a 
particular podcast before you subscribe.
Podcast Alley
Podcast Alley (http://podcastalley.com) quickly became the first place 
to boast, brand, and generally beat your chest about your show. With incred-
ibly active forums, detailed descriptions of podcasts, and individual episodes — 
plus the majority of all podcasters clamoring to get their listeners to “VOTE FOR 
ME ON PODCAST ALLEY THIS MONTH!” — it’s no wonder that Podcast Alley is 
one of the most active podcast listing and ratings service to date.
Zune
Apple has the iPod and Microsoft has the Zune (www.zune.net). Like many 
things before, Microsoft wasn’t the first to the table when it came to podcast-
ing. The company took a “wait and see” approach for the first couple years, 
but eventually got on board with its Zune product family. As of now, the Zune 
is supported only on Windows platforms.
Like the iPod, the Zune supports audio — including podcasts — and video. 
Although you can’t search for podcasts from the main Web page, you can search 
from within the Zune software. Click the Podcasts link in the Marketplace section 
in the upper left of the screen to get started searching and subscribing.

Digg.com
Digg.com is a site originally known for its innovative way of getting news to the 
masses by having its news stories get noticed by peer selection, a process they 
call digging. In 2006, a podcast directory was added to the mix (www.digg.com/
podcasts). As more people digg a show (or episode), the more popular it gets 
and the higher it moves in the digg.com list. That’s right, Gracie — another popu-
larity contest. Like other sites, digg.com has its share of “fanboys” of certain shows 
that garner the lion’s share of the diggs that can leave some pretty good content 
unnoticed. As a directory, its information is well laid out and pretty easy to find.
Other Podcast Resources
It goes without saying that this book is a snapshot in time, and you will likely 
want to keep up on the latest news and information of the podcasting world. 
We have a few suggestions to get you started. Perhaps, as you gain experi-
ence in podcasting, you’ll share some of your pearls of wisdom with the com-
munity by contributing back to the vast universe of podcasting that many 
people like to call the podosphere. We recommend trying out these:
 
 Blogger and Podcaster Magazine: If you’re looking for a great resource 
of information from the people who live and breathe new media, look to 
Blogger and Podcaster Magazine (http://bloggerandpodcaster.
com). Founded in 2007, the online magazine uses a graphical reader 
application that makes you feel like you’re reading a real magazine! You 
can also pick up audio clips — and yes, it’s even available in a print ver-
sion sent to your door.
 
 Podcast User Magazine: Podcast User Magazine (http://podcastuser
magazine.com) is a monthly PDF publication exclusively about pod-
casting. As producer Paul Nichols says, “[it] is precisely what it says on 
the tin — a magazine about podcasting.” The publication is targeted at 
everyone from the professional producer to the complete novice. Topics 
cover a wide spectrum, including business, education, news, reviews, 
tips, and tricks from the veteran podcasters.
 
 New Media Expo: Some have compared podcasting to a religion. As in 
many religions, podcasters are drawn to a central gathering place. The 
New Media Expo (www.newmediaexpo.com), or NME, is the annual 
“Mecca” for podcasters and one of our favorite podcast gatherings. Started 
by Tim and Emile Bourquin in 2005, the expo is a great way to network 
with other podcasters, vendors, and attend focused conference sessions. 

30

If you’re watching your budget, there’s a fee to attend the conferences, 
but the expo floor is free of charge. Of course, like many cons and expos, 
a lot of the fun happens after hours. In 2008, the New Media Expo moved 
from sunny southern California to “sin city,” Las Vegas. (Just remember — 
what happens at the NME, stays at the NME.)

N
ow that you’re effectively hip as to what podcasting is and what it’s all 
about, you need to start building your studio. This studio can come in 
a variety of shapes, sizes, and price tags. What you’re thinking about doing — 
podcasting — is like any hobby you pursue. If it’s something to pass the time, 
then keep your setup simple. A modest setup with little to no investment is 
ideal if you want to see whether you like playing with audio. If, on the other 
hand, you find yourself tapping into a hidden passion or (even better) talent, 
you might want to upgrade to the audio gear that’s bigger, better, and badder 
than the basics.
If you suddenly decide you — yes, you — have a message you want to share, 
your next plan of action will be one of two options: picking up a digital 
recorder, reading the instruction manual, and then downloading some free 
audio-editing software; or watching the DIY Network for methods of sound-
proofing the basement and looking at industry-standard equipment that 
might require some extra homework to master.
This is the beauty of podcasting. In the long run, it doesn’t matter whether 
your podcasting studio is an iPod with a plug-in microphone or comprised 
of the latest mixing boards, audio software, and recording equipment. Both 
approaches to podcasting work and are successfully implemented on a variety 
of podcasts.
So which one works best for what you have in mind? That’s what we take a 
look at in this chapter, discussing the options, advantages, and disadvan-
tages of each setup.

order of business is to find the right mic. If you already have a microphone 
built into your laptop (and you don’t mind starting out basic), you can just 
download Audacity (described in Chapter 3) and take advantage of the fact 
that it’s free. That’s all there is to it! (For openers, anyway.)
However, if your desktop computer didn’t come with a mic (or you’re just not 
happy podcasting Quasimodo-style), you’re going to want to shop around. 
While microphone shopping, consider the following criteria:
 
 What’s your price range? In many cases, especially with “cheap” mics, 
you get what you pay for in quality of construction and range of capabili-
ties. You want the most affordable model of microphone that will do the 
job for you and your podcast.
 
 Do you plan to use the mic primarily in the studio or on location? A 
high-end shockmounted model isn’t the best choice for a walk in the 
park, and a lapel mic might not provide you with the quality of sound 
expected for an in-studio podcast. Before you purchase your mic, con-
sider your podcasting location needs.
 
 There are many different types of microphones and microphone connec-
tions (or jacks). Some mics are meant to plug in to mixers, some directly 
to your computer’s USB port, and still others to portable recorders. If 
you’re thinking of starting with an inexpensive mic, you may not be able 
to plug it in to your “upgraded” rig later on. Depending on your needs, 
you may find yourself upgrading more than just your microphone down 
the road.
 
 What do you want this mic to do? Record sound? Yeah, okay, but what 
kind and in what surroundings? Some mics offer ease of handling for 
interviews. Some are good at snagging specific outdoor sounds. Others 
may be better at capturing live music. You need to consider multipur-
pose mics, guest mics, and on-location recording devices, or any kind of 
condition your podcast provides for you.
Even after narrowing your options, there are so many microphones on the 
market. After a while, the manufacturers, makes, and models all start to give 
you that kind of brain-freeze you get when you eat ice cream too quickly. The 
sections that follow give you the lowdown on the mic that’s right for your 
budget and even make a few sound recommendations along the way. 
 
Say, did you know there’s a companion podcast for this book? Yeah, it’s 
Podcasting For Dummies: The Companion Podcast. In Season Two, Tee hosts 
several episodes concerning microphones, including one where he and pod-
caster Phil Rossi (http://philrossi.net) test four mics, comparing and

Mics on the cheap
Most of the economical microphones on the market use USB (Universal Serial 
Bus) hookups. Figure 2-1 shows two types of USB plugs, which you may have 
used for attaching a digital camera or an MP3 player. You can go online to 
any of the computer equipment retailers and type USB microphones in their 
respective search engines. Make sure you include USB, because a search for 
microphones can bring up many more alternatives, including video cameras, 
high-end mics (which we talk about next), and other devices that might be 
way out of your budget.
 
You don’t have to sacrifice your retirement fund to get started with a USB 
microphone. Prices start under $20 for a simple desktop microphone. The 
phase “you get what you pay for” doesn’t always apply in podcasting either. 
We’ve heard some pretty amazing sounds out of very inexpensive microphones.
When shopping for microphones, you’ll hear a lot of terminology like omnidi-
rectional and unidirectional. These multisyllabic words may look cool to type 
and are impressive to say, but when you read them or they’re spoken to you, 
they can be a little intimidating. In the next two sections, we demystify these 
terms and explain how effective these various mic types are for podcasting.

Omnidirectional mics
Most microphones that come preinstalled in laptops are omnidirectional — 
they pick up sounds from all directions at once. The iPod accessory iTalk 
Pro (from Griffin Technologies, priced at around $50 on www.griffin
technology.com/products/italkpro) is an omnidirectional microphone. 
Omnidirectional mics pick up your voice, along with the television in the 
background, the traffic outside, the rustling of clothes, the ceiling fan . . . 
basically, if it makes noise and is within range of the mic, it’s recorded.
Although omnidirectional mics are ideal for sound-seeing tours such as Tokyo 
Calling (http://tokyocalling.org) or CitizenReporter.org with Bicyclemark 
(http://citizenreporter.org/category/audio/), they may not be ideal 
for all in-studio podcasting because they don’t capture your sound in detail — 
even when your mouth is so close that your lips brush against the mic’s screen. 
They tend to add a sharp, tinny quality to your voice and cut out on harsh, 
sudden sounds such as consonants (especially ps and ts). That’s partly because 
basic omnidirectional mics vary widely in quality and partly because of the 
limits imposed by their construction. The built-in models, for instance, are 
sometimes crammed into leftover nooks in their devices, where they’re 
awkward to use and can pick up internal noise. 
One omnidirectional desktop mic that we recommend is the eMic (www.gembird.
us/html/emic.htm). It currently retails for about $16 and is compatible with 
both Mac and Windows platforms. There are also omnidirectional mics that come 
with headphones. Logitech’s ClearChat Pro (headset), priced at $50, offers 
you the ability to record and monitor yourself as you do so.
One advantage headsets have over a desktop microphone is that your mouth 
is always the same distance away from the actual part of the microphone that 
picks up sound. If you’re an animated podcaster like your authors, this may 
be useful. On the other hand, they can be very sensitive to breathing sounds. 
If the mic boom is in the wrong position, the slightest breath from your 
mouth or nose will sound like an F5 tornado.
 
Although purchasing a USB headset is a monetary plus because you’re getting 
both headphones and mic together with one purchase, this isn’t all you need 
to monitor yourself as you record. To self-monitor your recording, you need 
software that offers you an on-screen mixer, a mixing board, or the option to 
monitor the incoming audio signal.
Installation for these inexpensive investments is a breeze. Find a USB port on 
your Mac or PC, plug in your new headset or microphone, and set up your 
audio preferences in your recording software. You’re ready for recording.

Unidirectional mics
Unidirectional mics, unlike their omnidirectional brethren, pick up sound from 
only one direction: the direction they’re pointing in. What makes unidirec-
tional mics a good choice for podcasting is in how they by design filter out 
surrounding sounds, reproducing only the sound directed to it. For in-studio 
podcasting, interviews, and quality recording, unidirectional microphones 
are the best option.
If you want to know exactly what a unidirectional mic is and what it can do, take 
a look at the Brian DePalma film, Blow Out. John Travolta plays a Foley Artist, a 
guy who collects random sound effects and then enhances them for particular 
moments in whatever film he’s working on. One night, he takes a stroll through 
the park with a gun microphone, a unidirectional mic that picks up only sounds 
located where it is pointing. This microphone is so particular that it concentrates 
on recording along the line of sight — so it records not only the sound of a tire 
blowing out, but also the gunshot that causes it to happen. 
If you’re out shopping for a unidirectional microphone, watch for the term 
cardioid. It relates to the pattern and sensitivity of the microphone. It’s also 
one of those buzzwords that will make you sound more intelligent!
Investing in a high-end mic
Say, however, you really want a cleaner sound for your podcast, and the $50 
(or cheaper) microphones just aren’t cutting it for you. As you shop, you see 
mics ranging in price from an  inexpensive $70 and reaching up to $3,600! (No, 
you’re not seeing a typo involving an extra zero.) So what defines a microphone? 
Price? Manufacturer? Look?
What truly defines a microphone is how you sound in it and how it reproduces 
the sound coming in. Based on how mics work, prices vary, but as you can 
see from our recommendations, plenty of high-quality microphones that are 
out there can pick up nuances and details and still remain in the range of 
affordability.
 
When you purchase a higher-end microphone, keep in mind that you probably 
will receive no additional cables for hook up, a jack that does not fit into your 
computer, and no stand. That’s because you’re upgrading to professional 
equipment. The manufacturer is assuming that you already have the tools, 
bells and whistles, and extra do-dads to make this mic work for you. For the 
lowdown on what accessories you need to hook up your new mic to your 
computer, check out the “Accessorize! Accessorize! Accessorize!” section 
later in this chapter.

Par t I: Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency 
Remember those three questions a few pages back? Question #2 — Do you 
plan to use the mic primarily in the studio or on location? — helps narrow 
your search even more for the microphone that’s the right investment for 
you. At this level, there are two kinds of mics you will hear people talk about: 
dynamic and condenser mics. 
 
Although dynamic microphones are marketed more for on-location recording 
and condenser mics are considered best for in-studio recording, these aren’t 
fast-and-hard rules for what mics should be used where. Sometimes, podcast-
ers use condensers in outdoor settings, and some podcasters prefer the sound 
of dynamic mics in studio over condensers. When picking a microphone, you 
want a mic that not only suits your needs but also makes you sound good. 
Really good.
Dynamic mics
Dynamic mics are what you see everywhere from speaking engagements to 
rock concerts. In fact, when someone mentions the word “microphone,” the 
image that comes to mind is probably a dynamic microphone. These mics 
work like a speaker in reverse. Sound entering a dynamic mic (by speaking 
directly into it) vibrates a diaphragm (a small plate) attached to a coil. This 
is located within proximity of a magnet, and the vibrations that this Wile E. 
Coyote setup makes create a small electric current. When this signal runs 
through a preamp or mixer, the original sound is re-created. This system 
sounds complicated (and if you’ve ever looked inside of a microphone, it is), 
but the internal makeup of dynamic microphones is such that they can take a 
lot of incoming signal and still produce audio clearly. They’re also rugged in 
build so they can be manhandled.
If you have a podcast that’s “out in the field” or if you’re recording on the 
street and want to be able to surrender the mic to guests and subjects with-
out worry, look no further than the Shure SM58 (pictured in Figure 2-2). This 
mic has been in use for over 40 years and is considered the industry stan-
dard for its durability and reliability. Podcasters picking it up for $100 love it 
for its affordability.
Condenser mics
When podcasting happens in studio and you’re looking for the subtleties and 
nuances of the human voice in your recording (the more detail you get, the 
better!), you may want to shop for studio condenser microphones. The anat-
omy of a condenser microphone is very different from a dynamic one. In the 
condenser, a diaphragm (similar to the dynamic’s) is suspended in front of a 
stationary plate that conducts electricity. As a signal enters the microphone, 
the air between the diaphragm and the plate is displaced, creating a fluctuating 
electrical charge. Once given a bit more power (phantom power, which is 
explained later in this chapter), the movement becomes an electrical repre-
sentation of the incoming audio signal.

A Shure-fire investment
Remember the opening of The Blues Brothers? 
Jake (John Belushi) turns to Elwood (Dan 
Aykroyd), after looking over the “new used” car 
his brother is driving, and asks him what hap-
pened to their Cadillac. “I traded it,” Elwood 
replies, “for a microphone.” Jake leans forward, 
a little stunned. “You traded the Bluesmobile for 
a microphone?!?” Then, on reflection, he nods. 
“All right, I can see that.” There are differences 
between the economic $20 USB microphones 
and the more expensive dynamic and con-
denser microphones, and there are even bigger 
differences between the $100 microphones and 
the $700 microphones.
The Shure SM7B was the first industry micro-
phone Tee ever had in Imagine That! Studios. 
This was a microphone that, for its price, could 
easily cover two mixers and two high-end 
microphones, and this was a dynamic micro-
phone, a kind of microphone that Tee wasn’t 
accustomed to working with in studio. He had 
recorded with this mic before though, in loca-
tions such as the Washington D.C. WJFK and 
NPR affiliates in the DC-metro area. Now, it was 
in his studio, and after his first recording project, 
Tee understood — with the mic’s clarity and 
exceptional performance — exactly why Shure 
microphones are referred to as “the industry 
standard” when it comes to recording equip-
ment, be it in-studio or on location recording.
Microphones can definitely be an investment, 
worth the trade-in of a car in Jake and Elwood’s 
case. What you invest in a microphone will 
reflect in the quality of its sound. For Tee, the 
investment was the right one. But is such an 
investment right for you? Be sure that you and 
your podcast are ready for this kind of studio 
asset. Ask other podcasters what they use, try 
out microphones if vendors allow for such test 
drives, and take your time before making such 
an investment.

This set-up sounds very delicate, doesn’t it? Guess what — it is! This is why 
condenser mics are transported in padded cases; they’re not really built for 
hand-held use and are best used in a studio application (as shown in Figure 2-3) 
versus an on-location kind of podcast. If manhandled or jostled around, plates 
can be knocked out of whack or damaged, causing problems in the pick-ups. 
The advantage to this delicate setup is that condenser mics are far more 
sensitive to sound, and they pick up a wider spectrum of audio. These 
microphones are so sensitive to noise around them that some come with 
shockmounts — spring-loaded frames that “suspend” the mic when attached 
to a microphone stand, providing better reception while reducing any noise 
or vibration from your microphone stand. Think of a shockmount as a shock 
absorber for your mic.
Tee is a big fan of the AKG Perception Line. Shown in Figure 2-3 as part of 
Farpoint Media’s Draco Vista Studios’ setup, the Perception 100 is a fan-
tastic investment for $100, and it can also come bundled with mixer boards 
(discussed later in this chapter) and even in economical two-packs from 
online vendors like BSW (www.bswusa.com). With each higher model of 
Perception, cost and features go up, but the quality sound that the AKG line 
captures remains the same.

Studio condenser mics
Microphone vendors are noting the popularity of podcasting, and now USB 
Studio Condenser microphones are becoming more and more prevalent. 
Samson Technologies (www.samsontech.com) was the first to produce such 
a microphone — the C01U. For less than $90, podcasters can now record 
studio condenser microphone quality audio and need only a USB port to 
power and connect the mic. The C01U (and the all-encompassing Recording 
Pak shown in Figure 2-4) was the predecessor to other USB condenser mics 
like the Blue Snowball, and the Marshall MXL 990 USB.
The phantom (power) of the podcast
You might notice that condenser mics (such 
as the Perception 100 described in this chap-
ter) are phantom powered — their connection 
to the mixer provides them with all the power 
they need. Portable condenser mics use bat-
teries to get their kick, but when they start to 
die, so does your recording quality. (A word to 
the wise: Always check your mic’s battery level 
before you interview and have fresh batter-
ies on hand.) Because phantom power comes 
from the mixing board (in the studio) through 
the cable connecting to the mic, it supplies a 
constant boost. No battery worries.

The clear advantage of working with USB microphones is you no longer need 
the audio card, the mixer, or any of the go-betweens once considered essential 
for connecting audio gear to a computer. With USB condenser microphones, 
the audio signal now has a direct connection to the computer. It makes your 
podcast production extremely portable.
Two drawbacks of USB microphones are in their latency and expandability:
 
 Latency is the slight echo you hear in your voice as you record. This is 
your computer trying to re-create the signal in real time for monitoring 
purposes. The recording itself will sound fine, but as you’re monitoring 
yourself, you may hear yourself echoing, and the echo may progres-
sively get worse the longer you record one session, depending on your 
computer’s performance. A faster computer can reduce the latency but 
likely not resolve it completely. You can side-step the latency problem 
by disabling the recording application’s monitor.
 
 The other problem is expandability. Hooking up four C01Us to a hub 
can be possible for multitrack recording, but doing so requires fairly 
advanced multitrack recording software which is beyond the scope of 
this book. USB condenser microphones are great for solo podcasters, 
especially ones who travel a lot, and USB condensers are quick and easy 
to set up and figure out.

41
 Chapter 2: Get ting the Gadgets That Make a Podcast Go
 
High end is relative. Professional recording studios can spend hundreds of dollars 
on a single microphone. Fortunately, the MP3 format isn’t so finicky. For this 
book, we’re defining high-end microphones as those ranging from $100 to $150.
Podcasts Well with Others: 
The Mixing Board
If you’re looking to have more people in studio or you want to entertain 
guests on your podcast, you need more than just a really good microphone. 
(Otherwise there will be the passing back and forth of a mic, and that’ll get 
distracting after a while.) You also need inputs for more microphones and 
full control over these multiple microphones.
 
Along with a good microphone (and probably a microphone stand, discussed 
later in the “Accessorize! Accessorize! Accessorize!” section), you will want to 
invest in a mixing board. What a mixing board (or mixer) does for your pod-
cast is open up the recording options, such as multiple microphones, record-
ing acoustic instruments, and balancing sound to emphasize one voice over 
another or balance both seamlessly.
You see mixers at rock concerts and in “behind the scenes” documentaries 
for the film and recording industry. They come in all shapes and sizes; Figure 2-5 
shows the Alesis MultiMix8 FireWire. At $300, you might feel like you’re sink-
ing a sizable chunk of change into it. (Other Multimix USB options include the 
sans-iPod option MultiMix8 for $150.) After doing the math, this mixer does com-
pare to others, so you might be coming out ahead in the financial investment.
 
Before you take your mixer out of its packing, make sure you have room 
for it somewhere on the desk or general area where you intend to podcast. 
Something you’ll want to consider is how close you want to be to the mixer. 
An ideal reach for your mixer is a short one. Whether it’s you recording your-
self or balancing the levels of those around you, clear off a section within a 
relaxed reach. You’ll be happier because of it.
The anatomy of a mixing board
The easiest way to look at a mixing board is as if you’re partitioning your 
computer into different recording studios. But instead of calling them studios, 
these partitions are called tracks.

Figure 2-5:

Mixer, a

mixing

A mixing board provides mono tracks and stereo tracks, and you can use any 
of those tracks for input or output of audio signals. No matter the make or 
model, mixing boards are outrageously versatile. If you’re podcasting solo or 
with a friend, you can hook up two mics so you won’t have to huddle around 
the same microphone or slide it back and forth as you take turns speaking — 
nobody wants that. Multiple microphones are the only way to go when you 
and your friends gather around to record. The real advantage of the mixer is 
that it allows you to adjust the audio levels of those multiple inputs indepen-
dently so they sound even.
You may also be wondering about all those wacky knobs on a mixing board. 
Some of the knobs deal with various frequencies in your voice and can 
deepen, sharpen, or soften the qualities of your voice, and perhaps even help 
filter out surrounding ambient noise (which is the sound of an empty room 
because even in silence, there is noise). The knobs on the mixing board that 
are your primary concern are the ones that control your volume or levels, as 
the board labels them. The higher the level, the more input signal your voice 
gains when recording. If one of your tracks is being used for output, the level 
dictates how loud the playback through your headphones is.
 
Heavy-metal legends Spinal Tap may prefer sound equipment that “goes to 11,” 
but cranking your mixing board way up and leaving it that way won’t do your 
podcast much good. The best way to handle sound is to set your levels before 

43
 Chapter 2: Get ting the Gadgets That Make a Podcast Go
podcasting. That’s what’s going on when you see roadies at a concert do a mic 
check. The oh-so-familiar “Check One, Check Two, Check-Check-Check . . .” 
is one way of setting your levels, but a better method is just rambling on as if 
you were podcasting and then adjusting your sound levels according to your 
recording application’s volume unit (VU) meter. For more on setting levels, 
hop to Chapter 6 for all the details.
Hooking up a mixer to your computer
Now that you have your desk cleaned off (mind the dust bunnies!) and a 
perfect place for the mixer, set your mixer where you want it. And then make 
certain you can see the following items:
 
 Your USB or FireWire mixer
 
 A power supply
 
 A USB or FireWire cable
 
 A CD of drivers
 
Before hooking up the new mixer, check the manufacturer’s Web site for any 
downloads (new drivers, upgrades to firmware, patches, and so on) needed 
to make your digital mixing board work. The drivers on the CD — if a CD is 
included or if drivers are needed — may be out of date. If you do see any 
recent updates on the manufacturer’s Web site, download them and have 
them on standby.
USB and FireWire mixers are so similar in setup that we can give the same 
steps for both kinds of mixers. Regardless of where you fall in the Mac/PC 
debate, you can follow these steps to hook up your mixer board:
 
1. Shut down your computer.
 
2. Connect the power supply to the back of the mixer and to an available 
wall socket or power strip.
 
3. Find an available USB or FireWire port and plug your mixer-
appropriate cable into the computer.
 
 If your computer’s ports are maxed out, we recommend investing in a 
PCI card that gives your computer additional USB or FireWire ports. We 
recommend against running your digital mixer through a hub because 
that might create latency issues and/or affect the quality of the audio. 
 
 A direct connection between your mixer and computer is the best.
 
4. Plug the USB or FireWire cable into the back of your mixer. 
 
5. Connect your input devices (microphones, headphones, monitors, and 
the like) to the mixer.

44
Par t I: Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency 
 
6. Power up your mixer by turning on the Main Power and the 
Phantom Power switches. See Figure 2-6.
 
7. Start your computer.
 
8. From the manufacturer’s CD, install any drivers your USB/FireWire 
mixer may need.
 
 Follow the instructions according to the manufacturer’s enclosed docu-
mentation. Restart your computer if necessary.
 
 Most USB and FireWire audio hardware works just fine on Macs without 
the need for driver installation, but check your audio hardware manuals 
just to be safe.
Analog versus digital
So you decide to go mixer shopping and you 
see a lot of these mixers going for $40 or $50, 
and in some cases offering more inputs than the 
$300 Multimix we recommend here at half the 
cost. What gives?
Before making this “too good to be true” deal, 
check the details of this inexpensive mixing 
board. The model may be an analog mixer as 
opposed to Alesis’ MultiMix models, Behringer 
Xenyx series, or Yamaha’s MW-USBs, which 
are digital mixers. Digital mixers connect 
directly to the computer either via FireWire 
or USB ports. The inexpensive analog mixers 
connect with a computer through another 
audio interface, most commonly an audio card. 
Almost all computers have an audio input that 
you can plug your analog mixer into. If you don’t 
have one or if you want a little better quality, 
you can find audio cards starting around $100. 
Admittedly, add-in cards have to be installed, 
which you can either do yourself or pay some-
one to do for you. Once the card is working, you 
need RCA cables to plug into the audio card, as 
well as adapters for the RCA cables to connect 
to the right mixer board inputs. Now comes the 
time investment in figuring out how everything 
(audio card, mixer, and cables) hooks up.
With digital mixers, you plug it into an available 
USB or FireWire port. That’s it.
In the case of mixers, you do get what you pay 
for. Cheaper mixers often have inferior audio 
output because of cheap pre-amps or other 
components. They often are poorly constructed 
and don’t last as long. For something that sits on 
the desk, it’s amazing how much abuse a mixer 
can take. That’s not to say all analog mixers are 
cheap or that you can’t find a quality analog 
mixer, just that digital mixers are considerably 
less hassle to install and offer some enhanced 
functionality like recording multiple inputs to 
multiple tracks in your recording software — 
trust us here, that’s powerful stuff when it 
comes time to edit.
We mention that digital mixers can be attached 
with either USB or FireWire. Choices, choices, 
choices . . . is there no end to this podcasting 
buffet? FireWire, or IEEE 1394 as the geeks call 
it, is generally a bit more expensive, but is less 
error-prone and tends to put less load on your 
computer’s CPU than USB. On the other hand, 
your computer may not come with a FireWire 
port, requiring an add-in card — yes, more 
money to consider.

And that’s it! You’re ready to record with your USB or FireWire mixer. Now 
with headphones on your head and some toying around, you can set levels 
on your mixer good for recording. 
 
Before filing away the reference manual that came with your mixer, be sure 
you know how things work. Buttons like the “Mix to Control Room” suddenly 
make sense to you as opposed to being “that button that needs to be down 
when I record”. Getting a grasp of how things work on your mixer only makes 
you a better podcaster, so keep that reference manual close by and set aside a 
few pockets of time to clock in some reading time with it.
Accessorize! Accessorize! Accessorize!
A microphone and a mixing board are just the beginning when it comes to 
putting together your audio suite. You now need to add the final touches, as 
Martha Stewart would no doubt tell you if she were helping you with this pro-
cess. Now when it comes to accessories, Martha might make suggestions like 
a doily for the mic stand or a sweet, hand-knitted cover for the mixer. When 
we talk about accessories, we have something different in mind. Here are 
some optional add-ons that can help you produce a rock solid podcast:
 
 Headphones: Some of the best advice in podcasting comes from our 
Technical Editor, accomplished podcaster and producer Steve Eley (www.
escapepod.org): Invest in a nice pair of headphones. Headphones help 
you monitor yourself as you speak. That may seem a little indulgent, but 
by hearing your voice, you can catch before playback any odd trip-ups, 
slurred words, or missed pronunciations.

The G-Track: The best of both worlds
So far we’ve been talking about microphones 
and mixers as being two separate entities, but 
Samson Technologies — the same people 
behind the ultra-portable C01U Recording Pak — 
decided to take the audio equivalent of chocolate 
and peanut butter and combine them into one 
sweet device: The G-Track, shown in the figure.
This microphone is a lot more than just a studio 
condenser mic. The G-Track has inputs built 
directly into the mic for an additional audio 
source (labeled as “Instrument” but it can really 
be for any audio input) and for headphones. 
With the mic’s basic interface, you can now mix 
in secondary audio with little to no crossbleed 
from whoever is on the mic. All this, and the 
microphone is completely USB-powered, the 
latency kept at a minimum as the headphone 
jack is closer to the signal than a computer’s or 
mixer’s headphone jack. The G-Track is a com-
pletely portable studio condenser mic solution; 
and for a podcaster into music, mixing, or simply 
on-the-go, this mic’s potential can really get the 
audiophile’s creative juices going. To hear the 
G-Track in action, listen to the second season 
of Podcasting For Dummies: The Companion 
Podcast, featuring Phil Rossi on guitar and his 
opinion on this mic’s potential from the musi-
cian’s perspective.

 We suggest you invest in good headphones before you spend a lot of 
money on a better mic, or else you won’t know how good the microphone 
is. Good headphones are nice to have for monitoring, but really show 
their value during the editing and mastering process.
 
 Another advantage with headphones is they have better sound quality than 
your computer’s speakers as well as reduce ambient noise around you if 
you purchase what are called closed-ear headphones. Keep it simple for your 
first time out with a pair of the Sennheiser HD202 closed-ear headphones 
for around $20. These headphones end in a 1/8-inch jack but come with an 
adaptor that makes them a 1/4-inch stereo male jack (as shown in Figure 2-7), 
plugging directly into your mixing board. For more on headphones, how to 
shop for them, and the different kinds out there, check out Expert Podcasting 
Practices For Dummies, by Tee Morris, Evo Terra, and Ryan Williams. 
 
 There are those Bose Noise Cancelling stereo headphones you see adver-
tised on television for $300, promising the highest quality for audio listening. 
Note, we say listening. Not recording and editing. Any headphones you 
see listed as noise-cancelling are going to be terrific for listening to 
audio, but those headphones aren’t the best for recording and editing. 
You want to be able to hear the noise that these headphones cancel out 
so that you can eliminate it before a word is recorded. The best noise 
reduction and elimination happens before and during recording, not 
afterward. For podcast production, stick with closed-ear headphones 
sans the noise-cancelling feature.
 
 Cables: As mentioned in the “Investing in a high-end mic” section earlier 
in the chapter, your newfangled microphone may arrive without any 
cable — and buying the wrong cable can be easy if you don’t know jack 
(so to speak). So check the mic’s connector before you buy. With many 
high-end mics, the connectors aren’t the typical RCA prongs or the 1/4-inch 
jack shown in Figure 2-7; instead, you use a three-prong connection: a 3-pin 
XLR male plug. It connects to a 3-pin XLR female plug, as shown in Figure 2-8.

Zoom H2: Podcasting-on-the-go
The idea of “portable podcasting” had a lot 
of limits hemming it in at one time, ranging 
from how mobile the studio could be to figur-
ing out the ideal conditions for a small, built-in 
condenser mic to the audio’s overall quality. 
Then in 2006, Samson Technologies (www.
samsontech.com) introduced the Zoom 
H4, an impressive (if not intimidating-looking) 
portable recorder-player-mixer that raised the 
bar for portable podcasting. It was thought 
nothing could beat it . . . until Samson rose to 
this challenge in 2007 with the Zoom H2 — a 
lightweight, unobtrusive, all-in-one solution for 
portable-podcast recording.
As the iRiver was considered the must-have por-
table recording device in 2005, so now is the H2 
Zoom, seen everywhere at the 2007 Podcast & 
New Media Expo. It comes as no surprise this 
device is from Samson that, since the unveiling 
of the C01U, has aggressively targeted podcast-
ers looking to keep their productions portable. At 
$200, the H2 records directly to SD Media (up to 
4GB) or to your computer with its built-in micro-
phone, a microphone capable of 90°, 180°, or full 
360° Surround Sound pickup. The H2 can record 
directly to MP3 format (in a variety of bitrate com-
pressions), to WAV format (also in a variety of 
bitrate settings), and in a multi-track format. 
Fitting in the palm of your hand, the recorder 
also offers a Line In and External Mic Input and 
an easy USB interface with your computer. This 
unit makes a great portable rig or startup unit 
for the beginning podcaster.

 To plug a microphone into your mixer, you want to specify a 3-pin XLR-
to-XLR male-to-female cord; the female end connects to the mic, the 
male end to the mixer. These cables begin at $9 and work their way up, 
depending on the length of the cord and quality of the inputs.
 
 Microphone stands: On receiving the microphone and possibly its 
shockmount, you may notice the attachment for a mic stand . . . but no 
mic stand comes with your new mic. It’s your responsibility to provide 
one, and although that may sound like an easy buy, your options for mic 
stands are many, each with their advantages. 
 
 A simple desktop mic stand can run you around $10 and is the most basic 
of setups. When shopping for the right height and make, you’ll notice 
other stands like a boom mic stand around the $100 range. 
 
 The type of mic stand that is best for you depends on what you want it 
to do and how you want to work around it. With the inexpensive desktop 
stand, you’re all set and ready to go without the extra hassle of position-
ing and securing a boom stand to your desk. The boom stand, though, 
frees up space on your desk, allowing for show notes and extra space for 
you to record and mix in. Consult your budget and see what works for you. 
 
 Pop filters and windscreens: Go to any music store (Radio Shack, Guitar 
Center, and so on) and ask for pop filters and windscreens, which are both 
shown in Figure 2-9. Both devices can help soften explosive consonants 
(percussive ones like B and P) during a recording session. A windscreen 
can also reduce some ambient room noise. Using both on one mic could 
be overkill, but these are terrific add-ons to your microphones.

 Creating an RSS feed
 Finding a host for your podcast
A
fter you have your recording equipment in place, plugged in, and running, 
it’s time to take a look at audio-editing software packages. These are 
the applications that help you take that block of audio marble and chisel the 
podcast that is hidden within it.
As with digital photo editors, DVD-authoring software, and word processors, 
software for audio comes in all sizes and all costs, ranging from free to roughly 
an entire paycheck (or three). Like any software package, the lower the cost, 
the simpler the product and the easier it is to understand, navigate, and use for 
recording. However, as the software grows more complex (and expensive), the 
features that offer advantages for pro-level work become abundantly clear. In 
this chapter, we run down some of the audio recording/editing software that 
might be right for you.
For when you have your show recorded and cleaned up, we also explore options 
for you to share your masterpiece with the rest of the rest of the world. The real 
power of podcasting is the ability for listeners to subscribe to a “feed” and get 
your show automatically delivered to their computer rather than download it 
manually from your Web site. The piece that makes all this magic happens is the 
RSS feed. We introduce you to some software to help you manage your feed here 
and dig into the details in Chapter 12.
 
When you have software and hardware in place, test your setup to make sure 
everything works. Take a look at your application’s preferences so that your 
sound input and output are going through your mixer, bring up the volume on 
the channel on the mixing board that your microphone is connected to, and 
then listen to yourself through your headphones.

Budget-Friendly Software
Whoever said “you can’t get something for nothing” didn’t know about pod-
casting. It’s amazing what kind of product you can turn out with little or no 
monetary investment.
Audacity: Who says you can’t 
get something for nothing?
Audacity (shown in Figure 3-1) is a piece of software that quickly became a 
podcaster’s best friend. It’s easy to see why: It’s free and simple to use. It’s 
available for downloading at http://audacity.sourceforge.net.
Designed by volunteers who simply wanted to “give back to the Internet” 
something cool, Audacity is designed for a variety of audio capabilities such 
as importing, mixing, editing, and exporting audio. For podcasters, it’s become 
the must-have tool for recording voice straight off a computer. It’s also com-
patible with Windows, Macintosh, and Linux. (We want to send a big thank you 
to the volunteers who went out of their way to show that yes, software can be 
made available for any platform, provided the creators are driven enough to 
make it happen!)
But what can a free piece of software do? Well, for openers, Audacity . . .
 
 Records live audio through microphones or mixer channels
 
 Can record up to 16 channels at once
 
 Imports various sound formats for editing and remixing
 
 Exports final projects to WAV, AIFF, AU, and MP3s
 
 Grants the user unlimited Undo and Redo commands
 
 Can create an unlimited number of audio tracks
 
 Removes static, hiss, hum, and other constant background noises
 
 Offers a wide variety of effects to manipulate your audio (and these 
effects are expandable via third-party plug-ins)
 
 Records at an audio quality of up to 96 kHz
 
Make sure you access the right URL. Remember that the Web site for Audacity 
is http://audacity.sourceforge.net and not www.audacity.com. If 
you happen to enter the latter address in your browser, you find yourself at 
Audacity, Inc., a Seattle, Washington–based janitorial service.

Cakewalk’s Pyro for the PC: 
Podcasting is so HOT!
Audacity is an excellent piece of software for the basics, but what if you desire 
more control over the capabilities and features of your audio-editing package? 
Are you looking for more recording options, additional audio filters, built-in 
multitrack recording, and pre-recorded music loops? (Gads, what some 
people will do to set a mood or a tone for a podcast.) 
Pyro (http://cakewalk.com/Products/Pyro) is part of the consumer 
line of audio software offered by Cakewalk. If your computer has the horse-
power and the hard drive space, you can buy Pyro and directly download it 
for around $20. If you prefer a hard copy of the software, though, you can also 
make that happen for a few dollars more (around $30, if you’re counting). And 
just so you know, Pyro is available only for Windows.
Pyro (shown in Figure 3-2) offers its users some serious goodies:
 
 Record audio from a microphone or other media (CD, LP, cassette, or 
Internet audio stream).
 
 Display and edit beat-by-beat with audio waveform displays.
 
 Pro-grade audio engineering tools included: DeClicker, DeClipper, DeNoiser, 
Loudness Maximizer, Reverb, and other post-production effects.
 
 Support for MP3, WAV, and WMA files.

Pyro allows users to record, edit, mix, and produce audio compositions, whether 
it is an original score for your podcast, a continuous music mix, or just you and 
your own personal soundtrack. Between its easy audio-editing features and 
Cakewalk’s collection of original audio samples (called Cakewalk Loops), it’s 
a breeze to set your own themes and special effects.
GarageBand: Moby in your Mac!
Pyro is an economic audio package for the PC user looking to go beyond 
Audacity, but what about Mac users? For people in the minority of the com-
puter world, it’s always a frustration to hear software developers say, “No, 
we won’t be making this product available for Mac users.” Sometimes Mac 
users seem to be denied the coolest toys and utilities because they just 
aren’t offered for the Mac operating system (maybe a penalty for thinking dif-
ferently, but still . . .).
Apparently Steve Jobs and his crew heard about this injustice, and shortly 
after the iPod took off, there came a gem that made it more than cool to be a 
Mac user — especially one who’s into podcasting. Mac-using podcasters call 
this gem GarageBand.
With hundreds of music loops that can easily switch from one instrument to 
another, GarageBand (shown in Figure 3-3) makes royalty-free music easy to 
compose. Many of the loops are editable and, with a bit of tweaking, can set 

55
 Chapter 3: Building Your Podcast’s Digital Workstation
the right mood for your podcast. With the release of iLife ’08, GarageBand has 
a few new additions (and one blessed repair) to enhance its initial version:
 
 Multitrack recording supports simultaneous tracks recording independent 
audio sources all in one recording session.
 
 With the Multi-Take feature, you can now do multiple readings or 
segments and save them as separate files. Then you can pick which one 
you want for the final.
 
 You can see a display of the music, with actual notation, in real time.
 
 You can choose to record your podcast as a Music Composition (Old 
School podcasting with GarageBand) or take advantage of the extra 
features available in the Podcast mode; note the extra track at the 
top in Figure 3-3.
 
 You can save the recordings as loops in the GarageBand library.
 
Upgrading from older versions of GarageBand means purchasing the complete 
iLife package, starting at $79.99. There is no separate upgrade for GarageBand, 
but the good news is that the new GarageBand also includes the latest versions 
of iPhoto, iTunes, iMovie, iWeb, and iDVD, each of which is a terrific application 
in its own right.

Par t I: Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency 
GarageBand’s most appealing asset is its hundreds of sampled instruments 
available in loops. You can easily edit and splice together these loops with 
other loops to create original music beds of whatever length you choose. Pre-
recorded beds range from Asian drum ensembles to Norwegian Folk Fiddles 
to Blues Harmonica; these ensembles are easily incorporated with editable 
loops of Classic Rock piano, Southern Rock, or Emotional Piano reminiscent 
of films like Love Story and Sense and Sensibility.
GarageBand also provides a capability — with many (not all) of the samplings — 
to create your own musical theme. Sure, some instruments may sound better 
than others, but you might — with a bit of trial and error — create an original 
melody that serves as the best royalty-free intro and exit for your podcast.
 
If you’re planning to do a bit of composing in GarageBand, be warned. Much 
like working with video in Final Cut, GarageBand is a lot of fun but can easily 
soak up free time that you would normally dedicate to recording. So if you 
need to get in touch with your inner Mozart, set aside a good-size pocket of 
time to put together your desired riffs. You have many options to choose 
from; as with podcasting, it’s best not to rush the process.
GarageBand is easy to tinker with, navigate, and understand within a short 
span of time. Plenty of terrific books are available for mastering all the nuances 
of GarageBand. We cannot praise this application enough — and with expansion 
packs from Apple (called Jam Packs) that add instruments, riffs, and loops to 
your GarageBand and start at $100 each and other loops and special effects 
available from other software vendors (and usually stocked online or at your 
local Apple Store), this unassuming software offers a lot to the podcaster.
WireTap Studio Pro: Recording 
and editing made easier
If you’re not interested in the musicality of GarageBand (or any of the other 
applications offered in iLife), Mac users have another handy application for 
recording podcasts and it comes with a few features not found in Audacity. 
This renegade of audio software is called WireTap Studio Pro (www.ambrosia
sw.com/utilities/wiretap).
What makes WireTap Studio Pro (shown in Figure 3-4) unique is its ability to 
record audio from nearly any source — not only coming in from microphones 
and musical instruments, but also from Internet audio streaming and live 
audio chats from Skype and iChat. WireTap even allows you to mix in music 
from your iTunes libraries!

WireTap sports the familiar features that Audacity, GarageBand, and Pyro 
possess — such as converting analog music to digital; preparing MP3 files 
specifically for podcasting (by adding ID3 tags, setting bandwidth, and so on); 
and supporting audio formats such as WAV, AIFF, and MP3. The latest version 
of WireTap offers some appealing capabilities:
 
 Records incoming audio from microphones or other input devices.
 
 Records and encodes audio into a wide variety of file formats including 
all the popular ones needed for podcasting (AIFF, WAV, MP3, AAC).
 
 Simultaneously records two sources of incoming audio (on a per-
application basis) into separate tracks.
 
 Provides lossless/non-destructive waveform editor.
 
 Provides Apple and Camel Audio digital effects for post-production.
 
 Provides basic MP3 and MPEG-4 Audio ID3 tag editor.
 
 Offers automated options for scheduling recordings.
Retailing for about $70, WireTap Studio Pro is a reliable application for Macintosh 
podcasters and prides itself in being a one-stop shop for podcasting needs. 
It’s a non-Apple product that can record in Apple’s audio-compression formats, 
easily records streaming audio signals that tend to elude other audio-recording 
and -editing software, and also offers editing tools for both audio and ID3 tags 
so you can create the podcast from beginning to end, making it ready for 
upload. Keep a sharp eye on this new player; it’s carving a niche for itself in 
the podcasting community.

The Sky’s the Limit: Big-Budget Software
If you’re lucky enough to have unlimited funds and resources to build your 
podcasting studio, this section on software is for you. A majority of podcasts 
are working on the bare-bones plan, and so far the investment in the equip-
ment we’ve recommended (in Chapter 2) is for a budget of under $500 — 
provided you feel like making an investment in a professional microphone, 
mixing board, or software. 
 
You may hear podcasters say “content is king,” meaning it doesn’t matter how 
good you sound if you don’t have anything to say. What makes a good podcast 
is the same whether you’re on a budget of $0, $500, or $Ridiculous. 
The difference is in the sound you can get. For the corporate entity, govern-
ment agency, or professional organization venturing into podcasting, sound 
quality is crucial as your reputation and experience are now being “socially 
tested.” Do you not bother with the details, or do you raise the quality bar? 
Commercial podcasting demands nothing less than the best in audio quality. 
Depending on your budget and the future of your podcast, you can purchase 
and set up the higher-end audio hardware.
Podcasting is still a new media, but if you want to push its envelope and have 
the bucks, high-end audio software gives you full control over every aspect of 
the audio you’re recording.
Adobe Audition
At one time, a favorite software application was CoolEdit. But when Adobe 
Systems purchased it and repackaged the software as Adobe Audition (shown 
in Figure 3-5), it got even better. Audition (www.adobe.com/products/
audition) is offered as an upgrade (provided that you meet the upgrade 
Sharing with the rest of the class
We’re particularly keen on GarageBand’s 
Preferences, which let you organize your final 
AIFF files in an iTunes playlist. When you’re 
done with that particular recording session 
(what GarageBand refers to as a “song” as 
you’re using the “Old School” approach to pod-
casting), choose Share➪Send Song to iTunes. 
The file is then exported in AIFF and immedi-
ately dropped into the playlist you named in 
GarageBand, where it’s tagged with your name 
(or podcasting ID) and the “album” (which can 
be anything from the show title itself to the air 
date of the show). See Chapter 9 for details on 
adding ID3 tags.

eligibility) at $99 or a full stand-alone version is available at $349. Audition’s 
features are nothing short of awesome:
 
 128 tracks available to the user
 
 Can record 32 different sources simultaneously
 
 Offers 50 digital sound effects to enhance your audio tracks
 
 Provides 5,000 royalty-free loops that can be easily edited and compiled 
to create your own music beds
 
 Offers Surround Encoder for 5.1 surround sound mixing for audio only 
or integration into an Adobe Premiere Pro project
 
 Offers audio restoration tools like Click/Pop Eliminators and Noise 
Reduction that can restore recordings from vinyl and cassette record-
ings; remedy pops, hisses, hums; and fix clipped audio
 
 Offers integrated CD burning for audio 
What makes Audition so appealing to heavily engineered productions such 
as Slice of SciFi (http://sliceofscifi.com) and Murder at Avedon Hill 
(http://pgholyfield.com/maah) is the complete control users have 
over the audio. Audition gives you dominion over pitch, wavelength, time-
stretching, background-noise removal, and Dolby 5.1 stereo output, making it 
a staple in the digital audio industry.
Audition runs exclusively on the Windows platform, but fret not, Mac users. 
There’s an Audition equivalent for you called Soundtrack Pro, and since its 
upgrade to version 2, it’s out to make itself a must-have tool for the profes-
sional podcaster.

Apple Soundtrack Pro
Apple Soundtrack Pro (http://apple.com/finalcutstudio/sound
trackpro) is the up-and-coming software in the industry and one of many 
incredible applications that make up the Apple Final Cut Suite. In its latest 
incarnation, Soundtrack Pro (shown in Figure 3-6) has been given features 
built for Mac-based podcasters:
 
 Supports multitrack recording. 
 
 Displays multiple audio takes in a single window. After you select your 
desired takes, Soundtrack Pro compiles them for a final composite — 
complete with crossfades (the simultaneous fading from one audio source 
into another) — creating seamless playback for the end result.
 
 Copies audio effects and EQ settings from another clip — setting them on 
an audio clipboard for quick access and application or saving them as a 
preset for future use.
 
 Features specific functions for producing podcasts, including audio-only, 
enhanced, and video podcast formats, such as chapter, artwork, and 
URL markers.
 
 Outputs multitrack audio projects into 5.1 surround sound.
 
 Automatically updates any changes made in Final Cut Pro.
Soundtrack Pro sounds like a dream come true, but here’s the reality check: 
It’s no longer a stand-alone purchase. It’s bundled with the Logic Studio for 
around $500 and the Final Cut Suite for a whopping $1,300.

A more economic option for podcasters who want to go beyond GarageBand 
is Logic Express (priced at $200), a digital workstation geared for the modern 
musician. Many of the higher functions of Logic Express focus on composition 
and music arrangement, and the interface is very different from GarageBand 
and Soundtrack Pro (which share enough in common that you can make the 
jump). For its price, though, you can accomplish a lot with it. 
Gluing It Together with RSS
The hardware (mics and mixers) and the software (GarageBand and 
Audacity) are necessary to record audio and create the podcast media file. 
That’s the fun and creative part. But to make your recording a podcast, you 
need to get your hands dirty on the tedious and technical parts and add two 
more three-letter acronyms to your vocabulary: XML and RSS.
 
RSS is a “flavor” of XML. Chapter 12 plunges rather deeply into RSS 2.0, but 
here we give a fast overview of where the RSS 2.0 feed fits into the podcasting 
equation.
It’s all about the <enclosure>, baby
If you already have a blog, you’re probably 
already generating an RSS feed — or have the 
ability to do so. Although podcatching clients 
can read this existing RSS feed, the feed needs 
to include the <enclosure> tag in order for 
podcasting to work.
Dave Winer invented the <enclosure> 
tag in early 2001 for the purpose of embedding 
links to large audio, video, or other “rich media” 
elements into an RSS feed. At the time, Dave and 
Adam Curry were trying to solve the click-and-
wait problems inherent in big files such as audio 
and video. Typically, if a user clicked a link to a 
30MB file, several minutes would drag by before 
the file was completely downloaded to the user’s 
hard drive and was usable. Not a good user expe-
rience, regardless of what’s in the file.
With the advent of the <enclosure> RSS 
element, users could subscribe to places 
where they expected large files as a regular 
occurrence and move the downloading of those 
files to the early hours of the morning, when the 
users were snug in bed and a ten-minute down-
load was no big deal.
Of course, users back then had to be techni-
cally savvy to take advantage of this new RSS 
element. It wasn’t until the summer of 2004 that 
Adam Curry wrote what most consider the first 
podcatching client — a simple, user-friendly 
desktop program that extracted enclosed media 
files from RSS 2.0 feeds called RSS2iPod. And 
behold! Podcasting was born.

62
Par t I: Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency 
We’ve helped dozens of podcasters get started — and in nearly every case, 
the XML/RSS step is the biggest source of confusion. So, to get the basics out 
of the way, XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a language, and RSS (Really 
Simple Syndication) is a file format built on XML. XML’s purpose is to allow 
systems such as computers, network devices, and other gadgets to exchange 
information in a structured format. The RSS file is that bit of information that 
the podcaster publishes so others can use their podcatching software to 
check for new content automatically. 
If that explanation doesn’t do it for you, try this analogy about Star Trek 
geeks and trained monkeys. Consider this: Star Trek geeks (or just STG) know 
everything about their passion in life — Star Trek. Perhaps you’ve seen other 
forms of geekiness expressed toward other public icons — say, Apple com-
puters, the Boston Red Sox, or The Beatles. But you know the type of person 
we’re talking about, right?
As a podcaster, you need a program that acts like a Star Trek geek. Your virtual 
STG has a single job: To boldly know everything there is to know about your 
podcast — and to flip happily into data-dump mode every time someone 
drops by to see what’s new.
And the trained monkey? Well, listeners don’t have time to drop by and 
check on each and every podcaster they want to hear. So the podcast listener 
employs a trained monkey to tell him exactly which Star Trek geeks to check 
with — and how often. When an STG has something new to say, the trained 
monkey comes back to his owner with the specifics. (And they said nobody 
could tie Star Trek, monkeys, and podcasting together. Ha!)
Here the role of the STG is filled by the RSS 2.0 file created by the podcaster — 
and the trained monkey is actually the podcatching client (iTunes, for example) 
used by the listener.
As a podcaster, your job is not only to create your RSS 2.0 file, but also to 
make sure you keep that file updated and current each time you post a new 
podcast media file. Lucky for you (and us too), plenty of software solutions 
make this step a breeze.
Simplify the process and get a blog!
If you’re looking to spend the least amount of time dinking around with your 
RSS feed, look no further than the popular blogging software solutions. Blogs 
are easy to set up, are often free, and ease the process of generating and 
updating of RSS feed by doing it automatically.
You can choose from dozens of blog software packages, each with a variety 
of bells and whistles that are designed to make your updates (including 

63
 Chapter 3: Building Your Podcast’s Digital Workstation
your RSS feed) as easy and/or customizable as possible. For a crash course, 
check out Syndicating Web Sites with RSS Feeds For Dummies and Blogging For 
Dummies (both published by Wiley); they can help you choose which blog 
software might be right for you. Meanwhile, here are a few options:
 
 WordPress (http://wordpress.org): Perhaps the most popular blog-
ging solution in the writers’ eyes, WordPress has many advantages over 
other free blogs. Not only is it easy to install and get running, but it also 
supports podcasting out of the box. When you incorporate the PodPress 
plug-in (available at www.mightyseek.com/podpress), podcasting takes 
on a whole new level of “user friendly” options as podcasts can be dis-
tributed via RSS or played directly through the blog. There are also thou-
sands of WordPress and user-developed templates that can be used as is 
or customized (with a bit of knowledge on how HTML and PHP work) to 
fit your specific look and feel for your podcast. Oh, and it’s free. To make 
incorporation into your Web site seamless, many hosting companies 
like DreamHost (http://dreamhost.com) offer packages that have 
WordPress preinstalled. Figure 3-7 shows the WordPress signup page.
 
 There are two basic options where to put your blog. Unless you’re an 
ubergeek, run your own server farm, load operating systems, handle 
patches, and have a hefty Internet connection, you’re likely to let some-
one else do all that work for you. Prices and products vary. For the pod-
caster, there are two varieties — the non-hosted model blog, where you 
get to choose the blog software, and the hosted model where the choice 
is made for you. In the non-hosted model, sure you get to choose what 
blog software to use, but there is a little more work involved with setting 
it up and maintaining it. In the hosted model, you generally give up some 
of the flexibility for ease-of-use.
 
 Blogger (www.blogger.com): Blogger holds the distinction of being one 
of the most widely used blogging systems. It’s available only in a hosted 
model and is still the de-facto standard for most of the blogging world. 
While free from cost and any setup confusion, Blogger is somewhat lim-
ited in functionality, customizability, and ease in troubleshooting when 
something goes wrong. (In other words, if something does go “boom,” 
you’re at the mercy of Blogger’s tech support.) Although it does allow you 
to create an RSS 2.0 template, it won’t allow you to include the podcast 
media file as WordPress does. Several workaround solutions exist, but 
your Blogger account won’t allow you to podcast without some work.
 
 LibSyn (http://libsyn.com): Don’t be surprised if Liberated 
Syndication turns up quite a lot in this book. LibSyn is a combined blog/
hosting company specifically designed for podcasting. Although it may 
not address all your needs, its ease of use and all-in-one nature should 
not be passed up. Some podcasters choose to use LibSyn as their hosted 
solution, others use it to store their podcast files while their blog is on a 
non-hosted solution somewhere else. Either way, we think LibSyn’s pric-
ing is quite reasonable, starting at $5 per month.

Fine. Do it without a blog.
Blogs are great if you want to include text and other information along with 
your podcast. But if you’re enough of a purist that you want your podcast to 
stand on its own without a supporting Web site, that’s okay, too.
 
A place to put your show notes — and a home for your podcast, where folks 
can get your e-mail address or other pieces of data they may not catch on the 
show — is a really good idea. If you’re confident that you prefer your podcast 
to stand on its own and exist only as an RSS 2.0 file, these options may be 
what you’re looking for. If you’re not sure, we suggest avoiding this route.
Take a closer look at some of these Web sites to provide a home for your 
podcast, sans blog. With these services, your podcast is simply an RSS file 
and an accompanying MP3 file, making show notes, additional comments, 
and hyperlinks a bit of a challenge; but you can podcast without a blog if you 
please, and here’s where you do that:
 
 Hipcast (www.hipcast.com): For $9.95 per month, Hipcast lets you 
record, host, and publish MP3 files, generating a custom RSS 2.0 file 
for you automatically. No blog or hosting company is required. In fact, 
these folks even came up with a way to record and upload your audio 

65
 Chapter 3: Building Your Podcast’s Digital Workstation
file right in your browser — no recording software required. This is a 
great option if you want to test the waters of podcasting without making 
a huge investment of time or money.
 
 Podcastamatic (http://kenwardtown.com/podcastamatic): 
Podcastamatic automates the creation of an RSS 2.0 file based on the con-
tents of a folder on a Web server. It’s not for the technical neophyte, but 
if you already have a Web server and don’t really want to run blogging 
software of any flavor, this is a solid free option.
 
 Once installed and configured on your server, Podcastamatic watches a 
particular folder for new MP3 files you upload. When it detects changes 
to the folder, it generates a new RSS 2.0 file. It even creates or populates 
an HTML page if you so desire.
 
 Feeder (http://reinventedsoftware.com/feeder): Feeder provides 
a simple interface that gives a lot of flexibility to podcasters who already 
maintain an active site. You fill it out, and it cranks out an RSS 2.0 file 
that’s ready to be uploaded to the server. Very easy, full featured, and 
self-contained, it’s popular among many podcasters. It’s for Macs only, 
and it’s a steal at $29.95.
FeedBurner turns any blog into a podcast
Rick Klau and the folks at FeedBurner deserve 
a nod for their dedication to a podcasting 
approach that’s 100 percent For Dummies–
friendly. With a free FeedBurner account, you 
can convert an existing RSS, Atom, or other 
syndication feed to a podcast-ready feed in 
three simple steps:
 1. Sign up for a free FeedBurner account at 
www.feedburner.com.
 2. Burn your existing feed.
 
 Enter the URL of your blog’s feed into the 
easy-to-use interface and select the I Am a 
Podcaster option. Then click the Next button.
 3. Confirm your feed title and address and 
then click the Activate Feed button.
 
 FeedBurner then converts any pod-
cast media file links into an embedded 
<enclosure> element in a new feed, 
provided you link the podcast episode to 
the blog post. (Remember to provide a link 
to the MP3 in the post.)
That’s it! You now have a new podcast-ready 
RSS 2.0 feed.
FeedBurner is now watching your original blog 
feed. The next time you make a post and include 
a link to a media file (MP3, M4V, PDF, . . . what-
ever), your new FeedBurner feed automatically 
does the behind-the-scenes magic necessary to 
get the <enclosure> tag pointing at the file 
you referenced in your post. Although your orig-
inal feed (maybe www.fishingalaska.
com/index.xml) doesn’t change, your new 
FeedBurner feed (perhaps http://feeds.
feedburner.com/FishingAlaska) is 
now podcast-friendly and ready to be served to 
podcatching clients.

Doing it by hand
What’s this about podcasting by hand? Are you crazy? No, seriously — gen-
erating an XML file in RSS 2.0 format isn’t overly difficult, but it’s extremely 
easy to mess up! Sure, you could open Notepad, TextEdit, or any text editor, 
download a few examples, and generate your own code, but we advise 
against it.
However, some code warriors — in the same vein of hand-coding HTML, 
JavaScript, and other markup languages — insist on composing their own 
code from the ground up (you glutton for punishment, you). You’ll want to 
jump ahead to Chapter 12 for an in-depth look at writing a simple RSS 2.0 
feed. We also recommend getting extremely comfortable with Syndicating Web 
Sites with RSS Feeds For Dummies or Beginning XML, 4th Edition (or at least 
keeping a copy of each under your pillow); those books go into more detail 
on these topics.
 
When you finish putting together your home-spun, handmade RSS feed, you’re 
going to want to make sure your is are dotted, ts are crossed, and open state-
ments are closed. Go to Feed Validator at http://feedvalidator.org and 
enter your feed’s URL (not the host blog or site, but the feed itself) and then 
click the Validate button. Feed Validator tells you whether your feed is air-
tight. You can also find the full technical specifications for RSS 2.0 and a few 
answers to questions you may have about RSS.
Finding a Host for Your Podcast
Unless you already have hosting taken care of, you’re going to need a place 
on the Web to put your stuff. You know — your podcast media files, RSS feed, 
and show notes for your podcast. You also need a way to get them up there.
Getting a hosting provider is a breeze, with hundreds of companies all vying 
for your precious, hard-earned money each month. The good news is that all 
this competition has brought down the cost of hosting packages significantly. 
The bad news is that you have to go through a lot of clutter to reach the right 
selection.
This section covers the basic needs for most beginning podcasts and mentions 
a few pitfalls to watch out for. In Chapter 10, we get into the process of actually 
moving your files to your host.
 
Don’t rush into a hosting agreement just yet. We suggest reading the rest of 
this chapter as well as Chapter 10 before forking over your credit card. We 
cover lots of good information that can help you narrow your choices.

67
 Chapter 3: Building Your Podcast’s Digital Workstation
When you’re comparing hosting plans, try not to get bogged down in the number 
of e-mail addresses, MySQL databases, subdomains, and the like. All of those 
features have their own purposes, but as a podcaster, you have only two wor-
ries: how many podcasts the site can hold and how much bandwidth you get.
Size does matter
Podcast media files are big. Unlike bloggers, podcasters eat up server space. 
Where simple text files and a few images take up a relatively small space, 
podcast media files tend to be in the 5MB to 50MB range. And that’s just for 
audio. For video, the size can double.
Here some suggestions for zeroing in on what you need storage-space-wise:
 
 Think about how many podcasts you want to keep online and plan 
accordingly. If you have a plan that isn’t constrained by storage space, 
then you don’t need to worry about it. 
 
 Consider the amount of server space you’ll need to host your blogging 
software, databases, text, and image files. For example, Tee is using well 
over 3GB of space for just one of his podcasts, and not all of that covers 
his media files! Of course, he’s been building his Web site since 2001 and 
didn’t get to that level overnight. (Podcasting did help quite a bit though.)
Podcasters should look for hosting plans that include at least 3GB of stor-
age space. As of this writing, several host providers charge less than $10 per 
month for that much space, and more.
Bandwidth demystified
Of equal importance to storage space is bandwidth, an elusive and often-
misunderstood attribute of Web hosting that is critical to podcasters. Bandwidth 
refers to the online space needed to handle the amount of stuff you push out 
of your Web site every month. The bigger the files, the more bandwidth con-
sumed. Compounding the problem, the more requests for the files, the more 
bandwidth consumed.
For instance, the bandwidth for Farpoint Media’s Slice of SciFi is over 10 tera-
bytes a month — that’s pretty impressive. At the initial launch, the amount 
of information exchanged (read: downloads) was modest, but then people 
started talking. With the rise in popularity (thanks to interviews with people 
like Bruce Campbell, Stargate’s Amanda Tapping, Grant Wilson of Ghost Hunters, 
and star of Star Trek:TNG and Web 2.0 Wil Wheaton), the downloads increased. 

68
Par t I: Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency 
So did the demands on bandwidth. Web hosts, in situations like this, must 
consider when it’s time to allocate a larger bandwidth package to handle a 
show — and that means more cash outlay for you. 
And therein lies the double-edged sword of success. Most podcasters want 
more listeners — and that means more podcatching clients requesting the 
podcast media files. Bottom line: The more popular your show gets, the more 
bandwidth is being consumed every month.
To simplify, pretend that you produce one show each week, and your show 
requires 10MB of bandwidth. You publish the show on Monday, and your 100 
subscribers receive your show that evening. You’ve just consumed 1,000MB 
of bandwidth (100 × 10MB) for that week. But next week, more people have 
found out about your incredibly amazing show, and now you have 200 sub-
scribers. Next Monday, your bandwidth increases to 2000MB, which gets 
added to your previous week’s total to bring you up to 3,000MB. The new lis-
teners were so happy, they also download the previous week’s show, tacking 
on an extra 1,000MB. You’ve just consumed 4,000MB (or 4GB) of bandwidth 
for the month. You still have two weeks to go in the month, and if your num-
bers continue to climb like this, you will be burning through bandwidth (and 
your Web host budget) quickly!
If you want even more detailed math on figuring out bandwidth needs, take 
a look at Chapters 10 and 14. Both offer real-world tips on figuring out what 
your bandwidth requirements might be. As a general rule, though, the longer 
your podcast episodes are, the more bandwidth you will need. If you find a 
plan that offers unlimited bandwidth, the problem is solved. Otherwise, you’ll 
want to try and find a plan that’s high in the gigabytes. If you have a podcast 
that’s both long and popular, start looking at plans that offer 1TB (that’s tera-
bytes) or more.
You have ways to avoid the issue of bandwidth, or at least make it less of a 
concern even if you have large ambitions — as well as files. Chapter 10 talks 
about some podcast-specific and some advanced hosting options. Even if 
you don’t think you’ll have to worry about bandwidth, it’s a section to pay 
close attention to because you’ll likely be more popular — and perhaps more 
wordy — than you think.

along the way.

une to a classical radio station (and when we refer to “classics” here, we 
mean Beethoven and Haydn, not the Beatles and Hendrix) and listen to 
the DJs — oh, sorry, the on-air personalities — featured there. You’ll notice 
that they’re all speaking slowly and articulately, mellowed and obviously relaxed 
by the melodic creations of greats such as Mozart, Wagner, and Joel. (Yes, Billy 
Joel has a classical album — a pretty good one, too!) Although the on-air per-
sonalities of your local classical music station all sound alike, they sound dra-
matically different from the wacky Morning Zoo guys on your contemporary 
hits radio station who sound as if they’re on their eighth cup of espresso.
When you hear people talk about finding your voice in broadcasting, that’s 
what they mean. You come to an understanding of what your average audi-
ence wants (and to some degree, expects), and then you meet that need. This 
chapter helps you develop the voice and personality you want to convey 
when podcasting.
After you discover your voice, you will want to get ready for the show. This 
chapter shows you what to do to prepare for smooth and easy podcasts that 
(one can hope) will be glitch-free during the recording process. Preshow prep 
is not only important, but also essential in making a feed worth catching. Even 
the most spontaneous of podcasts follows a logical progression and general 
direction, remaining focused on the podcast’s intent.

Choosing a Unique Topic for Your Podcast
Before you can think about putting together a podcast, you need to decide 
what topic you want to cover. At the time of this writing, a sample of what 
people were podcasting (according to PodcastAlley.com) — listed by genre 
from most to least common — looked like this:

podcasts going online every day.

73
 Chapter 4: Before You Hit the Record Button . . .
The first thing to understand about podcasts is that this activity isn’t all about 
being “number one” in your chosen podcast genre. Granted, some podcasts 
do vie for top honors on various polls. But instead of worrying about garnering 
ratings (a topic that’s covered in Chapter 13), think about what will make 
your podcast uniquely worth your effort and your listeners’ time. Here are 
some ways you can create a unique podcast:
 
 Study other podcasts. Before you can figure out what will make your 
podcast unique, check out some other podcasts. The best way to find 
out what makes a podcast worthwhile is to subscribe to a few feeds that 
pique your curiosity.
 
 Listen to these feeds for a few weeks (provided they’re weekly) and jot 
down what you like and don’t like about them. From the notes you take, 
you might find your angle. Keep in mind that downloading and listening 
to other podcasts should be educational and constructive, not a raid for 
fodder for your own show.
 
 Don’t steal content, special effects, or content structure from another 
podcast. Approach others’ podcasts as you would someone’s Web 
site. It’s okay to be inspired, as long as you don’t make your podcast a 
carbon copy of your inspiration’s work. When you have your podcast 
up, avoid criticizing another podcast in your own; criticizing someone 
else’s work is no way to better yours. Stay on the pod-sitive side.
 
 Pick a topic you know. Whether you’ve decided to take on the topic 
of music, religion, or technology, the best way to make your pod-
cast unique is to find an angle you’re comfortable with (Polka: The 
Misunderstood Music, Great Travesties of Sports History, Forgotten 
Greats of Science Fiction). There’s also the possibility that your initial 
show may inspire an additional angle so unique that you’ll have to start 
another podcast specifically to address that audience.
 
The content you bring — regardless of what genre it’s in — is unique because 
it is your podcast. It’s your voice, your angle, and your approach to whatever 
intent you pursue. Provided you maintain a high confidence level and genu-
inely enjoy what you’re doing, people will tune in and talk to other listeners 
about what you’re podcasting.
Finding Your Voice
The broadcasting industry might not want to admit to this, but podcasting 
and commercial radio share a lot in common. In the early days of what is now 
a major radio genre, talk shows were reserved for National Public Radio and 
news stations. In general, they were pretty dry and lackluster, bringing their 
listeners the news, weather, and daily topics that affected the world — but 
nothing particularly unusual or exciting.

74
Par t II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 
Then a guy named Howard Stern came along and changed everything in this 
once-tiny niche! You can love him, you can hate him — you can claim to hate 
him when secretly you love him — but Stern completely turned around what 
was considered AM-only programming. Now talk radio is big business. Some 
personalities are just out to entertain (Don & Mike, Ron & Fez); others use it 
to voice their political viewpoints (Rush Limbaugh leaning to the right stereo 
channel while Al Franken favors the left); and then you have the bottom-of-
the-barrel personalities (insert your least favorite on-air loudmouths here) 
who turn you off radio and on to podcasting!
A majority of podcasting is just that: talk radio. Actually, a more accurate 
description would be “homespun talk audio” because radio is broadcast whereas 
podcasting is narrowcast. Each podcast has a different personality and appeals 
to a different market. Finding your voice is one of the most challenging obsta-
cles that you (as a once-and-future podcaster) must clear.
Even if your podcast’s aim is entertainment, you have a message you want to 
convey. That message will influence the voice you adopt for your podcast. 
If you’re podcasting an audio blog about life, its challenges, and the ups and 
downs that you encounter, then maybe a soft tone — relaxed and somewhat 
pensive — would be appropriate. But if you decide to go political — say you’re 
the Angry Young Man who’s fed up with the current bureaucracy — then it’s 
time to fine-tune the edginess of your voice. That’s what you need for a 
podcast of this nature.
After you discover the passion your podcast is centered around (see the preced-
ing section for tips on how to do that), here are some ways to find your voice:
 
 Record your voice and then listen to what it sounds like. It astounds 
us how many people hate listening to their recorded voice. It’s a fear 
akin to getting up in front of people and speaking. When finding your 
voice, though, you need to hear what your current voice sounds like. 
Write a paragraph on your show’s subject. Then read it aloud a few 
times and find a rhythm in your words. Expect the following:
 
• Talking too fast
 
• Swallowing small, one-syllable words like to, in
 
• Ignoring commas, thereby creating one long, run-on thought
 
• Lip-smacking, heavy breathing, and the unavoidable ahs and ums
 
 You can edit out some of these problems (see Chapter 7), but you 
should grow accustomed to hearing your own voice because you’ll hear 
yourself again and again . . . and again . . . during the editing process. 
The more familiar you are with how your voice sounds, the easier time 
you’ll have editing your podcasts before publishing them online.
 
 Play around with the rhythm of your speech. You don’t have to be an 
actor to podcast, but you can apply some basics of acting when you’re 
recording. One of these basics, as one of Tee’s acting professors told 

75
 Chapter 4: Before You Hit the Record Button . . .
him, is to “Make a meal of your words.” This means to play around with 
the rhythm of your speech. When you want to make a point, slow down. 
If you’re feeling a tad smarmy, pick up the pace. Above all, be relaxed 
and make sure you don’t sound too contrived or melodramatic.
 
 Speak clearly. Another simple trick from the acting world to add to your 
arsenal is to open your mouth wider. Many people talk with their mouths 
mostly closed, but by opening up your mouth, you can gain clarity. So, 
when making a meal of your words, it is good manners to chew with your 
mouth open.
 
 Speak with confidence. Speak confidently about your topic. No one is 
going to believe in what you have to say if you don’t believe in yourself. 
It may take a few podcasts to find a groove, or you might hit the ground 
running and have a podcast that immediately takes off. Just speak with 
conviction and allow yourself to shine.
 
 Develop your podcasting personality. After you know what you sound 
like when you record, here’s where you develop your podcasting personal-
ity. Is your persona going to be light, fun, and informal, or something a little 
edgy, jaded? Is your message taking an angle of marketing, politics, or reli-
gion? Or are you podcasting a love of music, science, or your Macintosh? 
Your persona should generally match the theme of your show. If you’re doing 
a show on classical music, a persona of a morning radio DJ probably isn’t 
going to work. If you’re taking a light-hearted look at politics, you may want to 
have a little more levity in your tone and pace than a funeral director.
Deciding Whether You Need
an Outline or Script
What method works best for you? A full script and hours of prep time, or a 
single note card and two clicks of the mouse — one for Record and another 
for Stop? Both approaches work, depending on the podcaster’s personality. It 
could be said that there’s little difference between a writer and a podcaster: 
Some writers prefer to use an outline when putting together a short story or 
novel; others merely take an idea, a few points, and a direction, and then let 
their fingers work across the keyboard.
If you decide to work with a script, it’s a good idea to invest some time into 
preshow prep, simple preparation for what you’re going to say and how 
you’re going to deliver it. Depending on your podcast, though, prep time may 
vary. Here are a couple of examples of how dramatically different prep time 
can be for different podcasting situations:

76
Par t II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 
 
 For his podcast Speaking of Beer, “Charlie the Beer Guy” does very little 
prep — usually just enough to get accurate numbers for the alcohol 
content of his subject. After he does minimal orientation with the guest 
panel, he’s ready to record. You really need to know your subject and 
have good chemistry with your show participants to make a minimal 
plan like this turn in to a good show, but it can work.
 
 On the other side of the spectrum is The Radio Adventures of Doctor Floyd, 
a 10-minute show in the style of old-time radio with a modern, educational, 
comedic spin. Grant Baciocco and Doug Price (see Figure 4-1) have every 
show carefully scripted. Depending on the historical research required, 
Grant can spend anywhere from 1 to 3 hours doing preshow prep. The 
careful scripting comes in real handy when “Doctor Floyd” has celebrity 
actors playing a part in the show.

and that

Preshow prep can range anywhere from jotting a few notes on a napkin to 
writing a complete scripted with full sound effects — regardless of show 
length. So how far should your prep go technically? That depends on what 
your podcast needs. Outlines and scripts will keep you on track with what 
you want to say, serving as roadmaps you use to keep moving smoothly from 
Point A to Point B.

77
 Chapter 4: Before You Hit the Record Button . . .
Whether you’re a napkin scribbler, a script writer, or somewhere in between, 
if you’ve never done any kind of planning like this, the secret to efficient pre-
show prep can be boiled down to three disciplines:
 
 Habit: Many podcasters, especially podcasters emerging from corporate 
offices, prepare for podcasts in the same manner as business presenta-
tions. They jot down essential points on note cards to keep the podcast 
on track, but the points are the only material they write beforehand.
 
 You can easily apply your organizational skills from the workplace to 
the podosphere. For example, C.C. Chapman eats, breaths, and sleeps 
marketing in his day job. He has been able to take this “PowerPoint men-
tality” of speaking for 30–60 minutes based on a few bullet items, and apply 
it to his show. His entire preshow prep for his podcast Managing the Gray, is 
to take listener suggested topics or questions, jot down a few bullet items, 
and run with it. With a collection of ideas and topics gathered between 
podcasts, he begins his one-take recording with a handful of points 
serving as a guideline.
 
 Talent: Some podcasters are truly the Evel Knievels of the podosphere, 
firing up their mics and recording in one take. These podcasters tend 
to have backgrounds in live entertainment, deciding in a moment’s time 
when a change of delivery is required. This is a talent of quick thinking, 
and although it keeps material spontaneous and fresh, it’s a talent that 
must be developed with time.
 
 For example, Dan Klass is the demented mind behind the sharp and sar-
castic podcast, The Bitterest Pill. His show is completely improvised. No 
prep time. Not a list of key points in sight. How can he do this? Dan’s is a 
special breed of bravery: He’s a professional stand-up comedian.
 
 Passion: Passion is a driving force with a majority of podcasters that 
keeps their podcasts spur-of-the-moment. With enough drive, inspira-
tion, and confidence in their message, they keep their prep time to a 
minimum because podcasting isn’t a chore but a form of recreation.
 
 For example, Doctor Who Podshock by Ken Deep, Louis Trapani, James 
Naughton, and a cast of others, is all centered around the Doctor Who 
television series. Their preshow prep can be as much as a couple hours 
of research or as little as five minutes of topic overview and then they 
let their passion for The Doctor, the TARDIS, the Daleks, and more carry 
them through more than an hour of show.

Determining a Length for Your Show
If you’ve been using this chapter to develop your podcast, you’ve made seri-
ous progress by this point in getting your preshow prep done. Now you’re 
ready to podcast, right? 
Well, no. Have you thought about how long your show’s episode is going to 
run? No? Okay then, check out the following sections.
The hidden value of the short podcast
There are many podcasts that run under ten minutes where hosts deliver 
their message and then sign off only moments after you thought they signed 
on. On average — and this is more like an understood average, not really a 
scientific, detailed study of all the podcasts out there — a podcast runs from 
20 to 30 minutes per episode. So what about these 10-minute vignettes? Does 
size matter? Does time matter? (Woah. Deep.) Is there such a thing as too 
short a podcast?
Here are some advantages in offering a short podcast:
 
 Shorter production time: Production time is reduced from a week-long 
project to a single afternoon of planning, talking, editing, and mixing. 
With a quick and simplified production schedule, delivering a podcast 
on a regular basis — say, every two weeks, weekly, or twice a week — is 
easier.
 
 Fast downloads: You can be assured — no matter what specs you 
compress your audio file down to — that your podcast subscribers will 
always have fast and efficient downloads.
 
 Easy to stay on target: If you limit yourself to a running time of less than 
ten minutes, you force yourself to stick to the intent (and the immediate 
message) of your podcast. There’s no room for in-depth chat, spontane-
ous banter, or tangents to explore. You hit the red button and remain on 
target from beginning to end, keeping your podcast strictly focused on 
the facts. Shakespeare said, “Brevity is the soul of wit.” Considering his 
words, ol’ Bill would probably have podcast under 15 minutes if he were 
alive today.
Nothing’s wrong with keeping a podcast short and sweet. In fact, you might 
gain more subscribers who appreciate your efficiency.

79
 Chapter 4: Before You Hit the Record Button . . .
A little length won’t kill you
Now with that quote from the Bard about brevity, you might think, 
“Shakespeare said that?! Before or after he wrote Hamlet?” That’s a good 
point because Shakespeare did have a number of his characters say, “My 
lord, I will be brief . . .” and then launch into a three-to-four-page monologue.
So what if Shakespeare decided to be brief in his podcast? Would he get any 
subscribers if his show ran longer than half an hour? What if he broke the 
60-minute ceiling? Would the Podcast Police shut down his show?
Podcatchers (such as iTunes, Juice Receiver, and Songbird) and subscribers, 
on reading your show notes and descriptions, should be able to figure out 
the average running time of your show. On a particular topic, some podcasts 
can easily fill two or even three hours. It’s hard to believe even avid podcast 
audiences would want to sit and wait for such a mammoth download, but 
huge productions have some definite advantages:
 
 If the show is an interview, you have anywhere from two to three 
hours with an authority. It’s something like having a one-on-one session 
stored on your computer or MP3 player. From marketing shows like 
G’day World or science/tech shows like Technorama, if a guest or author-
ity is part of the podcast, you can rest assured your podcast will go a 
little longer than 30 minutes — and sometimes it should.
 
 You’re allowed verbal breathing room. Discussion stretching past the 
30-minute mark allows you and your co-hosts or guests to break off into 
loosely related banter, widening your podcast’s focus and sparking dis-
cussion that can lead in other directions. 
 
 Be careful with this one. Shows and interviews that ramble aimlessly run 
the risk of losing audience attention. We talk more about good interview 
practices in Chapter 5.
 
The cost of podcasts longer than 30 minutes is in bandwidth and file-storage — 
issues that smaller podcasts rarely, if ever, have to deal with. See Chapter 10 
for a discussion of the bandwidth demands on your server.
Finding that happy medium
Is there such a thing as middle ground in the almost-completely undiscov-
ered territory that is podcasting? How can you find a happy medium if pod-
casters can’t agree on a standard running time?
The happy medium for your podcast should be a sense of expectancy or con-
sistency. For example, in Tee’s podcast of Billibub Baddings and The Case of 
the Singing Sword, the running times for each chapter are across the board — 

80
Par t II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 
the shortest is just over 30 minutes, and the longest weighs in at a whopping 
1 hour, 15 minutes. His audience, however, understands this is a podiobook, 
an audiobook in serialized format. Readers understand that chapters vary 
in size with a printed book, so it’s no surprise when a podiobook follows 
suit. Some of the podcasts are short, sweet, and a quick bridge between one 
plotline and another. Other chapters reveal a new plot twist or introduce new 
characters, meaning that some length is in order.
 
Podiobooks aren’t the only genre that variable length works well for. If your 
podcast deals in do-it-yourself home improvement, explaining the construction 
of a bookshelf will be a far shorter show than one about adding an extension to 
your deck.
Give yourself some time to develop your show, your voice, and your direction. 
If you build some consistency and expectation for your audience, it’s easier to 
introduce a little variation or even a happy medium into your running time.
I Hear Music (And It Sounds 
Like Police Sirens!)
In creating your own podcast, something that will give your show an extra 
punch or just a tiny zest is the right kind of music. We’re all musicians, and 
although our skills and tastes range from classical to rock ’n’ roll, we all 
Podcast Galactica
The SciFi channel has struck gold with an inno-
vative approach on an old favorite from the ’70s: 
Battlestar Galactica. With a new cast, a new 
look, and some gender-bending on the char-
acters Boomer and Starbuck, the successful 
series rounds off a solid night of science fiction. 
Galactica takes delight in taking chances and 
challenging boundaries. In the spirit of taking 
chances (as well as being interested in reaching 
new audiences), Executive Producer Ronald D. 
Moore and SciFi.com decided to host a podcast: 
hour-long episodes, similar to director commen-
taries on DVDs, providing an inside look at what 
went into the season’s most recent episode.
An hour inside Ron Moore’s head? That’s a 
sci-fi geek’s dream come to life. Season one 
of Battlestar Galactica was so successful that 
its premiere, “33,” won Science Fiction’s high-
est honor — the Hugo — for Best Short Form 
Dramatic Presentation. The companion pod-
cast of Battlestar Galactica was so successful 
that SciFi brought it back for repeat episodes 
and has now broadened its scope to include 
scriptwriting sessions and guest appearances 
from cast members. Moore’s casual chats last 
an hour (well beyond the average running time 
for a podcast . . . not that anyone subscrib-
ing cares) and provides inside stories on how 
improvisational the actors can be on the set,

We also understand and appreciate the law. Although you may think it’s cool 
to “stick it to the man” and thumb your nose at Corporate America, the law

ing schedules, and even grants a more personal 
look at the production, such as referring to über-
intense actor/director Edward James Olmos as 
“Eddie.” Keeping the production values to the 
basics, Galactica’s companion podcast adds 
a new dimension to the military SciFi epic by 
taking fans behind the scenes and into the 
imagination of its creator.

We want to make this clear as polished crystal — we are not lawyers. We’re 
podcasters. We’ve looked up the law on certain matters so we know and 
understand what we’re talking about, but we are not lawyers. We can tell you 
about the law and we can give a few simple definitions of it, but we are not 
giving out legal advice. If you need a legal call on a matter concerning your 
podcast — whether it concerns the First Amendment, copyright issues, or 
slander — please consult a lawyer.
The powers that be
The government still regards the Internet as a digital Wild West, an unknown 
territory that’s avoided regulation for many years, granting those who use 
it a true, self-governed entity where ideas, cultures, and concepts can be 
expressed without any filtering or editing, unless it comes from the users 
themselves.
Does this mean we podcasters are free to do as we please? Well, no, not by 
a long shot. There are some rules and regulations that even podcasts must 
follow. There are also organizations that both broadcasters and podcasters 
must pay attention to.
The following organizations all have influence on the destiny of podcasting, 
and it’s only going to benefit you as a podcaster to understand how their leg-
islation, activities, and actions are going to affect you.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
The Federal Communications Commission, or FCC (www.fcc.gov), is 
the watchdog of anything and everything that gets out to the public via 
mass communications. The FCC keeps an eye on technology development, 
monopolies in the telecommunications industry, and regulating standards for 
telecommunications in the United States and its territories. They are most 
commonly known for enforcing decency laws on television and AM/FM radio.
For podcasters, the FCC can’t regulate what is said (yet) because it doesn’t con-
sider the Internet a broadcasting medium. However, given existing legislation 
to reduce spam (junk e-mail) and the growing popularity of podcasting among 
mainstream broadcasters (such as Clear Channel, Oprah Winfrey, and the SciFi 
Channel), it may not be long before the law catches up with technology.
The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)
Sean Fanning. Does that name ring a bell? Sadly, it was Fanning who lost his 
battle against the Recording Industry Association of America, also referred to 
by their more common acronym RIAA (www.riaa.com), when he contested 
that his file-sharing application, Napster, in no way infringed on copyright 

83
 Chapter 4: Before You Hit the Record Button . . .
laws and was not promoting music piracy. The RIAA led the charge in shut-
ting down the original Napster and continues to protect property rights of its 
members — as well as review new and pending laws, regulations, and poli-
cies at the state and federal level.
The RIAA will have a definite say as to why you cannot use a selected piece 
of music for your podcast. Simply put, it’s not your music. Sure, you own 
that CD, but the music you listen to is under the condition that you use it for 
listening purposes only. (Didn’t realize there were conditions involved, did 
you?) This means you can’t use it as your own personal introduction that 
people will associate with you. And, no matter how appropriate your favor-
ite song is, you cannot use it as background music. Unless you’re granted 
licenses and you pay fees to the record labels and artists, you’re in copyright 
violation when playing music without permission.
 
One way of getting music for themes, background beds, and segues is to look 
into what musicians and podcasters refer to as podsafe music. This is pro-
fessionally produced music from independent artists who are offering their 
works for podcasting use. The demand for podsafe music has been so high 
that the Podsafe Music Network Web site (see Figure 4-2) was launched (www.
mevio.com/music/), offering a wide array of genres, artists, and musical 
works. Today several other sources of podsafe music exist including Garage
Band.com (www.garageband.com) and Magnatune (www.magnatune.com). 
Find out more about podsafe music, the conditions of using it, and how it can 
benefit your podcast.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
In addition to the big dogs who are passing the laws and legislations to 
restrain your podcasting capabilities, a group is looking out for you, the 
podcaster, with Science Fiction author and tech guru Cory Doctorow step-
ping forward as one of its more outspoken members. The Electronic Frontier 
Foundation, or EFF (www.eff.org), is a donor-supported organization 
working to protect the digital rights of the individual; to educate the media, 
lawmakers, and the public on how technology affects their civil liberties; and 
uphold said civil liberties if they’re threatened.
A good example of EFF’s mission is its involvement in various legal cases 
concerning URL domain registration and cybersquatters (individuals who buy 
desired domains and then hold on to them, waiting for the highest bidder). 
The EFF stands for the rights of legitimate Web site owners who happen to 
own a domain that a larger corporation would desire to use.
The EFF, provided you have a strong case to contradict the findings of the 
RIAA and the FCC, will stand up for you and give your voice a bit of power 
when you’re standing up to a corporate legal machine.
Creative Commons (CC)
Founded in 2001, Creative Commons (CC) is a nonprofit corporation dedi-
cated to helping the artist, the copyrighted material, and the individual who 
wants to use copyrighted material in a constructive manner but may not 
have the resources to buy rights from groups like the RIAA.
Copyright protection is a double-edged sword for many. On the positive side 
of a copyright, your work is protected so that no one can steal it for their 
own personal profit, or if someone makes the claim that you’re ripping off 
their work, your copyright is proof that your egg came before their chicken. 
That’s the whole point of the copyright — protection. The downside of this 
protection is that people now must go through channels for approval to fea-
ture your work in an educational or referential manner; and although you’re 
given credit for the property featured, there’s still a matter of approvals, fees 
for usage, and conditions that must be met. Also, many contributors just 
want to share their work with others on no other terms but to contribute and 
share with the world. Copyrights complicate this.
This complication of the digital copyright, protections, and desire to exchange 
original creations brought about Creative Commons (http://creative
commons.org), shown in Figure 4-3. It’s dedicated to drafting and implementing 
via the Internet licenses granting fair use of copyrighted material.

Figure 4-3: 
Creative 
Commons 
offers free 
licenses 
for use 
of original 
content in 
podcasting.
 
In the case of the podcaster, you want to offer your audio content to every-
one, not caring whether listeners copy and distribute your MP3. As long as 
the listeners give you credit, that’s all fine and good for you. CC can provide 
you with licenses that aid you in letting people know your podcast is up for 
grabs as long as others give credit where credit is due. CC provides these 
same licenses for artists and musicians who would not mind at all if you used 
their music for your podcast.
CC licenses are made up of permission fields:
 
 Attribution: Grants permission for copying, distribution, display, and 
performance of the original work and derivative works inspired from it, 
provided credit to the artist(s) is given.
 
 Noncommercial: Grants permission for copying, distribution, display, 
and performance of the original work and derivative works inspired 
from it for noncommercial purposes only.
 
 No Derivative Works: Grants permission for copying, distribution, dis-
play, and performance of the original work only. No derivative works are 
covered in this license category.
 
 Share Alike: Grants reproduction of the original work and also allows 
derivative works if they are also released under a similar Creative 
Commons license.

86
Par t II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 
These four fields can be used as stand-alone licenses or can be mixed and matched 
to fit the needs of the podcaster or the artist offering content for the podcast.
The CC and its Web site give details, examples, and an FAQ page that answers 
questions concerning the granting of licenses for use of protected content. Just 
on the off-chance you don’t find your answer on the Web site, it gives contact 
information for its representatives. CC is a good group to know and can open 
opportunities for you to present new and innovative ideas and works in your 
podcast.
I can name that tune . . . I wrote it!
Using almost anyone else’s music for your podcast can be an open invitation 
for the RIAA to shut it down. This is primarily to protect the artist’s rights. 
Think about it — how would you feel if you were producing a popular pod-
cast, receiving praise from all over the world, and while you’re thinking about 
ways of taking the podcast to the next level, you turn on your radio and hear 
your podcast being broadcast on a top-rated radio station. Soon, your podcast 
is all the rage on the broadcasting airwaves — and you haven’t made dollar one.
The same thing can be said for artists and their music. They work hard to 
produce their work, and now podcasters are using their music to brand their 
shows, not bothering to compensate the artists for their efforts. Artists love 
to say that they “do what we do for the love of the craft” but in the end, it’s 
their work, and artists have to pay the bills too.
So how can you use a piece of music without suffering the wrath of the RIAA 
or FCC? Ask permission of the artist? Only if the artist owns the rights to the 
music and the recordings. Otherwise, you also need to get written permission 
from artists, musicians, record labels, producers . . .
 
The best way to avoid the legal hassles is to avoid copyrighted material that is 
not your own.
If you want to use published pieces that aren’t royalty-free, ask the artist 
directly (if you can) for permission to use that music on a regular basis. 
Compensation to the artist may come in the form of a promotion at the begin-
ning or end (or both) tags of the podcast. As long as you have written permis-
sion from the artists and the artists have the power to grant it (that is, they 
haven’t signed the power over to their label or publisher), you should be able 
to use their work to brand your show or feature them on your podcast. (If 
you’re not sure whether you have the appropriate permission, you may want 
to consult an attorney.) This is usually acceptable with independent artists 
because, in many cases, they also own the record label. Confirm this with art-

87
 Chapter 4: Before You Hit the Record Button . . .
ists. Otherwise, you run into the same legal issues if you were to use music 
recorded by Queen, Switchfoot, or U2.
 
You can always offer your podcast as a venue for the musician to sell his or her 
work. Dave Slusher of Evil Genius Chronicles (www.evilgeniuschronicles.
org) has written permission from the Gentle Readers to use its music as intro, 
exit, and background music for his podcast; in return, Dave promotes its CD 
Hi, Honey. This promotion works well for the Gentle Readers as well as artist 
Michelle Mallone (www.michellemalone.com). After her music was featured 
on Dave’s podcast, her sales spiked — both through her Web site and on 
iTunes!
I’ll take the First: Free 
speech versus slander
Words can (potentially, at least) get you in just as much trouble as music. 
The legal definition of slander is a verbal form of defamation, or spoken words 
that falsely and negatively reflect on one’s reputation.
So where does podcasting fit into all this? Well, the Internet is a kind of public 
space. Think about it — before you open your mouth and begin a slam-fest on 
someone you don’t like in the media or go on the personal attack with some-
one you work alongside, remember that your little rant is reaching MP3 players 
around the world. Be sure — before you open your mouth to speak — that you 
aren’t misquoting an article or merely assuming that your word is gospel. When 
expressing jaded opinions, have real evidence to back up what you say — and 
put up or shut up!

P
odcasting is empowering. There’s something about a microphone in 
your hand that gives courage. Suddenly, you’re not afraid of anything. 
Oh yeah, you’re “running with the big dogs” now, and like Charlie Rose, Larry 
King, or Mike Wallace, you’re asking the questions to find out what makes 
your guest tick.
What sets you apart from those big dogs, though, is skill. James Lipton of 
Inside the Actor’s Studio may make interviewing look easy, but make no mis-
take: Interviews are not easy. It takes skill to host an interview, and hosting 
a great interview is an art. The good news is these luminaries possessing the 
gift of gab all had to start somewhere. Podcasting is an excellent venue to 
hone your interviewing skills, but you’re going to want a solid foundation to 
build your skill set on.
Along with helping you schedule an interview, we help you get ready for it by 
looking at hardware and software tried and true for us, asking good questions 
to keep the conversation lively and engaging, and giving you examples of bad 
questions best avoided. Finally, we impart those always-valuable behind-the-

Par t II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 
I’ll Have My People Call Your People: 
Interview Requests
The courage to submit an interview request comes simply from your inter-
est in the interview subject. Script or compose an e-mail to ask your favorite 
author, actor, sports celebrity, podcaster, or whomever you want for an 
interview. You may need to submit the request multiple times, and some-
times you may have to work through numerous people simply to get a “no” 
as your final reply. That happens. It doesn’t mean that individual is mean, a 
rude person, or otherwise. They just don’t do interviews. For every “no,” you 
will find ten others who will enthusiastically say “yes.” 
Here are some other things you should keep in mind when working on the 
interview request:
 
 Market yourself and your show: A good deal of marketing is involved 
with podcasting. Your interview request needs to sell your services to 
the prospective interviewee. If you’re part of a podcasting network, be 
sure to mention that. Large listenership numbers are always helpful. 
Have you done interviews before? If so, do some name dropping. If not, 
a good place to start might be with other podcasters. They’re looking to 
get their names out and grow their listenerships also.
 
 What can I do for you? The person (or the person’s agent) is going ask 
“What’s in it for me (or my client)?” You need to ask yourself questions 
like: Does he or she have a new book coming out? Perhaps he or she is 
about to launch a special product? Find an angle and work with it.
 
 Be flexible: Remember, you’re asking for their time. There may be 
restrictions in your schedule and theirs. Sometimes you can get an 
interview within 24 hours or you have to schedule it weeks or months in 
advance. You may have to take time off work from your regular job or re-
arrange other plans. 
 
Don’t assume the person reading your interview request is going to know what 
a podcast is. You may have to explain your medium using alternative terms or 
a short explanation.
Preparing for Interviews
There’s an approach that all interviewers, be they Barbara Walters or 
Stephen Colbert, should take in talking to guests — use a simple, basic plan 
to ask the questions that garner the best responses.

91
 Chapter 5: Interview-Fu: Talk to Me, Grasshopper
Asking really great questions
Chances are good that if you’re new to podcasting, you’ve never held an 
interview quite like this — an interpersonal, casual chat that could get a bit 
thought-provoking or downright controversial, depending on your podcast’s 
subject matter. The interview may be arranged by you, or it may be prear-
ranged for you, but if you think what reporters do is easy, it isn’t. There’s a 
science to it, and here are just a few tips to take to heart so you can hold a 
good, engaging interview:
 
 Know who you’re talking to and what to talk about. With interviewer 
Jana Oliver, former host of two shows on Leisure Talk Radio, the sheer 
number of guests she interviewed could cause a problem: trying to 
find the time to read all her guests’ books. So she did a different kind of 
homework on her guests. “If my guest wrote a book about Charlemagne, 
I will go online and do my own research into the topic. This has two 
effects: (1) I sound like I have a clue what I’m talking about and (2) It 
allows me to ask better questions.”
 
 It’s also a good idea to visit guests’ Web sites (provided they have ’em). 
You don’t have to be an expert on their subject matter, but you should 
be familiar with it so you know in what direction to take the interview.
 
 Have your questions follow a logical progression. Say you’re interview-
ing a filmmaker who is working on a horror movie. A good progression 
for your interview would be something like this:
 
• What made you want to shoot a horror movie?
 
• What makes a really good horror film?
 
• Who inspired you in this genre?
 
• In your opinion, what is the scariest film ever made?
 
 You’ll notice these questions are all based around filmmaking, beginning 
with the director’s choice and ending with a director’s choice. The pro-
gression of this interview starts specific on the current work and then 
broadens to a wider perspective. Most interviews should follow a pro-
gression like this, or they can start on a very broad viewpoint and slowly 
become more specific to the guest’s expertise.
 
 Ask open-ended questions. To understand open-ended questions, it’s 
simpler to explain closed-ended questions. Close-ended questions are 
the kind that give you one word answers — for example, “How long have 
you been studying plate tectonics?” Don’t count on your interviewee 
giving a dynamic answer to a question like that. Close-ended questions 
make the process harder than it needs to be. Instead, rephrase your 
question like “So what exactly got you interested in plate tectonics?”

92
Par t II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 
 
 Prepare twice the number of questions that you think you’ll need. 
Some interviews you hear grind to a halt for no other reason than the 
interviewer believed that the guest would talk his head off on the first 
question. You’re certainly in for a bumpy ride when you ask a guest, 
“Tell the listener a little bit about your experience at WidgetCo” and the 
guest replies, “It was a lot of hard work, but rewarding.” (Yeah, this is 
going to get painful.)
 
 Write down a series of questions that could fill your podcast with brief, 
one-or-two-word answers. This way, if you find yourself struggling, you 
have a hidden stockpile of questions to call upon. After a few quick 
answers, you can always fall back on the “Would you expand a bit on 
that please?” question.
 
 Never worry about asking a stupid question. When asking questions 
that may sound obvious or frequently asked, remember: Chances are 
good that your audience has never heard them answered before. Okay, 
maybe a writer has been asked time and again, “Where do your ideas 
come from?” or a politician has heard, “So, when did you first start in 
politics?” often. When you have a guest present for a podcast, there’s 
no such thing as a stupid question; what’s really dumb is not to ask a 
question that you think isn’t worth the guest’s time. He or she may be 
champing at the bit in hopes you will ask it.
Avoiding really bad questions
Before you start percolating and dream up a few questions based on the 
preceding tips, stop and think about the interviews you’ve listened to where 
things suddenly headed south. Usually the interviewer ambushes the guest 
or tries to dig into something that’s either out of the guest’s scope or none 
of the interviewer’s business. We’ve piled up the typical gaffes in a prime 
example of a good interview gone bad. 
Every podcaster should know how to turn a pleasant conversation sour (uh, 
this is a satire and not a recipe, okay?); the following blunders should do it:
 
 Ask inappropriate questions. Keep in mind your podcast is not 60 
Minutes, 20/20, or even Jerry Springer. If you want to fire off hard-hitting-
tell-all-mudslinging questions, think about who your audience is, who 
you’re talking to, and whether the question is within the ability of the 
guest to answer honestly and openly. If not, an awkward moment may be 
the least of your worries. 
 
 Inappropriate can also mean irrelevant, wacky, off-the-wall, and far-too-
personal questions. For instance, author Neil Gaiman was once asked 
completely out of the blue: “Mr. Gaiman, what is your best score in bowl-
ing?” Gaiman, somewhat baffled, replied awkwardly, “Well, um, I can’t 
really answer that question because I . . . don’t . . . bowl. Never been 
bowling. Don’t know how. So . . . ummm . . . sorry.”

 Chapter 5: Interview-Fu: Talk to Me, Grasshopper
 
 Maybe silly questions work for shock jocks, but when you have an 
opportunity to interview people you respect in your field, do you really 
want to ask them something like, “Boxers, briefs, or none of the above?” 
Think about what you’re going to ask before you actually do.
 
 Continue to pursue answers to inappropriate questions. If a question 
has been deemed inappropriate by a guest, don’t continue to ask it. 
Move on to the next question and continue forward into the interview. 
Podcasts are by no means an arena for browbeating guests into submis-
sion till they break down in tears and cough up the ugly, sordid details 
of their lives. If this is the intent of your podcast, you’ve picked up the 
wrong book; you need Psychotherapy For Dummies.
 
 Are there exceptions to this exception? We would say, yes, depending 
on the content of your podcast. Say after reading — and enjoying — 
Podcasting For Dummies, you decide to become the Tom Green of pod-
casting. Of course, if you’re after irreverent material for your show and 
push that envelope as far as you can, your guests may not want to play 
along — especially if they don’t get the joke. If that’s the case, expect 
your guests to get up and walk away. Even in the most idyllic situations, 
guests can (and do) reserve the right to do that.
 
 Turn the interview into the Me show. Please remember that the spotlight 
belongs to your guest. Yes, it is your podcast, but when a guest is intro-
duced into the mix, you’re surrendering control of the show to him or her, 
and that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Let guests enjoy the spotlight; your 
audience will appreciate them for being there, which adds a new dimen-
sion to your feed. One way to avoid the “me factor” is to think of yourself 
as a liaison for the listener. Ask yourself, “As a listener, what questions 
would I ask or information would I be looking for from the guest?” 
Feelin’ the synergy
One final note on preparing for interviews: We’ve heard some guests say, “I’m 
doing these interviewers a favor by going on their show.” And we’ve been 
told by other show hosts, “We’re doing you a great favor with this chance to 
showcase your work on our show.”
Both of these opinions are not just arrogant, they’re just flat-out wrong.
The reality is that host and guest are working together to create a synergy. 
The interviewer has a chance to earn a wider audience and display mastery 
of journalistic techniques. The guest has a chance to get into the public eye, 
stay in the public eye, and talk about the next big thing he or she has coming 
in sight of said public eye. Working together, guest and host create a seam-
less promotional machine for one another.

94
Par t II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 
If you decide to take on the art of the interview, keep these facts in mind; you 
and your guests will have your best chance to work together to create some-
thing special.
 
If your format allows it, ask your guest for an ID that you can drop in from 
time to time. You’ve probably heard these before on radio stations “Hi, this 
is Rex Cramer, danger seeker. You may remember me from such films as 
Airplane and Kentucky Fried Movie, and you’re listening to The Shameless Self-
promoting Podcast.” If the interview guests want to be more creative, let them. 
These are a great self-promotion tool, a whole lot of fun, and a way to remind 
your listener of previous accomplishments. Remember to ask politely, and be 
aware that not everyone will (or can) comply.
Recording Interviews with Skype
Unless you’re conducting in-person interviews, your podcast just got a bit 
more technically complicated. You need to have the appropriate software to 
record your interview over the phone.
The best option of recording your interviews is with Skype (www.skype.com). 
Skype is “free Internet telephony,” which is akin to iChat’s/AOL IM’s Audio 
mode but is more stable and, in some instances, provides clearer reception. 
What makes Skype more appealing to Internet users than iChat/AOL is the 
expandability of the application. It’s available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. 
Skype is the vehicle to make your calls, but it lacks the feature to record them. 
You can record Skype conversations with various methods and use down-
loadable software to monitor levels and volume as you record. You can also 
use Skype with a little more hardware for similar results. We discuss all your 
options — whether software or hardware — in the following sections. 
 
As stated in Chapter 4, there are legal restrictions concerning the recording 
of telephone/Skype calls, and these restrictions vary from country to country, 
state to state, and region to region. Compliance with these laws is the respon-
sibility of the podcaster. Always ask for permission (or better yet, get it in 
writing) before recording phone calls.
Recording using software
Recording using software or hardware — once again you’re faced with 
choices. Software solutions are typically less complex to set up and use and 
cost less; however, they can put more load on the computer’s CPU. If the CPU 
is too busy, it could impact the quality of the recording. The following sec-
tions cover some software options for recording Skype calls.

95
 Chapter 5: Interview-Fu: Talk to Me, Grasshopper
Call Recorder
Call Recorder for the Mac from eCamm Network (www.ecamm.com/mac/
callrecorder) is a handy little piece of software with a simple interface 
that allows you to record Skype audio and video and save it to one of many 
formats for later editing. The only downside of Call Recorder is that the file is 
recorded as a robust MOV file. To reduce its size (for archiving purposes or 
to produce a smaller MP3 from), you need to run it through a media player 
like QuickTime Pro, producing a streamlined AIFF or WAV file. However, this 
step isn’t necessary if you’re using GarageBand or Soundtrack Pro. If you 
don’t have the money for a mixer and second computer (or portable record-
ing device), the $15 investment is a great deal.
SoundTap
For the Windows users, SoundTap, from NCH Swift Sound (www.nch.com.
au/soundtap/index.html) lets you record just about any audio that plays 
through your Windows computer. Simply install the software and turn it on, 
and then all sound played on or through the PC, including Skype calls, will be 
recorded as WAV or MP3 files. All audio is “tapped” by a virtual driver, so the 
process is perfect digital quality. Current pricing for SoundTap is $19.40.
WireTap Studio Pro
As mentioned in Chapter 3, WireTap Studio from Ambrosia Software (www.
ambrosiasw.com/utilities/wiretap) lets you record just about any 
audio that plays through your Mac and also allows you to record from a 
second source such as your mixer, iTunes, or another media player.
As for the steps involved in recording a Skype interview with WireTap Studio, 
it’s a piece of cake:
 
1. Launch WireTap Studio Pro and make sure the Controller window 
(shown in Figure 5-1) is visible. You can access it either by choosing 
Window➪Controller or by pressing Ô+0. 
 
2. From the top menu, select one incoming source of audio. From the 
menu underneath it, select your second input source.
 
 The image on the right in Figure 5-1 shows you the input menus for the 
running applications that can serve as an audio input source.
 
 
3. Choose File➪Preferences to access the Preferences of your WireTap 
Studio Pro application. 
 
 
 The Preferences window appears, as shown in Figure 5-2.
 
4. Click the Source button at the top of the Preferences window. Have 
your interview subject (on Skype) talk as you check your own levels 
(on the mixer, USB microphone, and so on).

 You can record your audio as an AIFF, a WAV, or another uncompressed 
digital audio format or it can go directly to MP3 to the compression set-
tings of your choosing.
 
6. Close this window and then return to the Controller. The large, dark 
circle is the Record button. Single-click that to begin recording.
 
7. When the interview is concluded, end the recording by clicking the 
Stop button (the dark square).
 
 Automatically WireTap Studio pulls up a window with the waveform of 
your newly recorded audio (see Figure 5-3). Here you have tools avail-
able for editing, creating loops, and creating basic audio effects. For

Par t II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 
WireTap Studio Pro is the more pricy of the software options at $69, but 
when you consider its capabilities of mixing in two separate audio sources, 
editing, ID3 tagging, and exporting options, it’s an easy and reliable recording 
resource for those important Skype interviews.
SkypeOut
SkypeOut is a built-in feature that comes with Skype and gives you, the Skype 
user, the ability to dial a telephone number and use Skype to talk to people 
all over the world starting around 2 cents per minute. Rates to various desti-
nations vary, so check the Skype Web site for details.
The Gizmo project: A recording option
Gizmo (http://www.gizmoproject.
com) is an intuitive, multiplatform VoIP (Voice 
over Internet Protocol) application (much like 
Skype) offering additional features that Skype 
lacks. One of these additional features is the 
ability to record conversations and save them 
in WAV format. Gizmo also informs both parties 
in the call that the phone conversation is being 
recorded and when recording stops.
If you’re looking for an easy way to record inter-
views, take a good look at Gizmo, the latest option 
offered by the Internet to make over-the-phone 
interviews cost effective for start-up podcasts.

99
 Chapter 5: Interview-Fu: Talk to Me, Grasshopper
Follow these steps to start using SkypeOut:
 
1. Go to the Skype Store Web site at www.skype.com/go/store, click the 
Account button, and log in using your Skype username and password.
 
 You can also access this Web page by clicking the View Account button 
in Skype’s startup window.
 
2. Look for the SkypeOut link and click the Add Credit link.
 
3. Select the credit package you want (usually listed in Euros in incre-
ments of ten, but each package lists the details of what you’re buying) 
and then purchase it by using PayPal or any major credit card.
 
 Your SkypeOut account is activated.
 
 Your account can go inactive for two reasons. When your credit is at $0, 
or when it’s been 180 days since your last SkypeOut call (credits have 
a shelf life of 180 days). So if you go three months between calls, you 
might find that your credit is gone and your SkypeOut feature is inactive. 
If your account goes inactive, simply purchase another block of credit to 
reactivate it.
 
4. On the Skype Web site, click the Dial tab.
 
 Skype opens a numeric keypad emulating a telephone, as shown in 
Figure 5-5.
 
5. Enter a phone number and click the green Call button.
 
6. Record the phone call by using either WireTap Studio or Gizmo (both 
of which are described in this chapter).
Recording using hardware
If recording using software has your head spinning, using hardware may sim-
plify things a bit. The key to the operation is a device called a mixer. (You can 
find more details on mixers in Chapter 2.) You’ve probably seen mixers at 
music concerts or television studios — those are for the big boys and tend to 
be quite expensive. Fortunately for you, there are less expensive options that 
cost as little as $50.
The idea behind a mixer is to take multiple inputs and mix them to create an 
output. An input can be a microphone, a computer, a MP3 player, an elec-
tronic keyboard, or just about anything with an audio output to feed in to the 
mixer. For interviews, your input will come from the microphone, and your 
interviewee will be coming from a computer running Skype. The output needs 
to go to a recording device such as an MP3 player or a second computer. 
Why do you need a second device? Well, the output can’t go to the machine 
running Skype, or your interviewee would hear his or her own voice (prob-
ably with annoying lag), and that would be bad.

Call button
Figure 5-6 shows an example setup that provides the ability to record Skype 
calls using a little more hardware.
For standard studio recording, the mixer is quite simple — microphones, 
computers, perhaps an MP3 player in the input port (or channels), and your 
main output going to a recording device. Of course, because we’re talking 
about interviews, who wants simple? 
Alright, it’s not that complex. Whether you have a basic four-channel mixer 
or something the size of a cruise ship, most mixers have the same basic 
layout and features. Plugging in a microphone to a single audio channel is 
pretty straightforward. Adding the stereo output of a second computer is 
also pretty simple (given you have the right connecting cables). The real fun 
begins when you need to get your output back to the Skype machine and the 
recording device. This is where you need to take advantage of your mixer’s 
aux send (sometimes called effects send) port. This is an output port that you 
will feed back to your Skype machine. So the question now becomes, how do 
you get your microphone input sent out the aux send?

RECORD FUNCTION
You see, most mixers have the ability to create multiple mixes. The main mix 
is what you typically record, but there are often hidden mixers, called buses, 
that let you create an alternative mix. How cool is that? You thought you 
were just buying one mixer, and you got yourself one (or more) for free! To 
make use of this additional output mix, locate the row of knobs on your mixer 
labeled Aux, which often are red in color. (If you have more than one row 
of Aux knobs on your mixer, each row corresponds to a separate aux send 
channel.) These are the volume controls for your aux send. If you turn up the 
volume on your microphone, whatever is connected to listen to the aux send 
output will hear it. 

102
Par t II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 
For example, if your Skype computer is connected to input channels 3 and 4, 
you want the red knobs on those channels turned all the way down so that input 
isn’t fed back to the output on the aux send channel. This is called mix minus 1 
because you’re taking the entire mix minus one input (the Skype machine). For 
a short video tutorial, watch the video at www.friendsintech.com/index.

Prepping Your Green Room for Guests
A guest could be your dad, your mother-in-law, your best friend, or the man 
on the street. It could also be the friend of a friend who can get you on the 
phone with your favorite author, actor, or athlete. When you’re interviewing, 
you have a second party to worry about. 
Removing the “technical difficulties” element usually means either taking the 
show to the guests or bringing the guests to the show. This kind of interview 
not only is the most fun to do, but also gives you direct contact with the sub-
ject so you can observe body language, facial expressions, and reactions to 
questions and answers.
Welcoming in-studio guests
When you have guests visit your facilities — and because you’re podcasting, 
this is probably your house — make them feel at home. Offer them something 
to drink. Offer to take them on a tour of your humble abode. Introduce them to 
your family. The point is to be polite. You don’t have to cook dinner for them, 
but offering a hint of hospitality, be it a glass of water (or a beer, if you’ve ever 
worked closely with the Draco Vista Studios crew), is a nice touch.
If you’re having in-studio interviews, it’s also a good idea to get your home 
and yourself ready to receive guests. Sure, Tee has recorded quite a few pod-
casts in his pajamas, but because he’s reading a book for his podcast, he’s 
allowed. If fantasy and science fiction authors Terry Brooks and Catherine 
Asaro ever come over to his house for an interview, don’t think he’d be greet-
ing them in his Joe Boxer jammies and Guinness slippers.
Okay, maybe he would greet them wearing the Guinness slippers, but he would 
be bathed and dressed and have his teeth brushed and hair combed. The key 
word here is guest. Treat them as such. Be cool, be pleasant, be nice. And if 
you’re a guest on someone else’s podcast, the same rules apply. Don’t prop 
your feet up on the furniture, don’t demand hospitality, and don’t be a jerk 
during the interview.
The in-studio visit is an audition for both guest and host. If the guest is abra-
sive, abusive, and just plain rude, chances are good that the guest will never 

103
 Chapter 5: Interview-Fu: Talk to Me, Grasshopper
be invited back, no matter how well the previous interview goes. If a host 
asks unapproved questions, continues to pry into personal matters that have 
nothing to do with the interview, or seems determined to take over the inter-
view spotlight as if trying to impress the guest, said guest may never return, 
even if extended an invitation. 
Meeting guests on their own turf
Be cool, be pleasant, be nice. These same rules apply when you take your 
podcast on the road. You may find yourself at a person’s home, place of busi-
ness, or some other neutral place. You’re now practicing — for the lack of 
a better term — guerilla journalism, ambushing unsuspecting people with 
questions that may not strike you as hard and probing but could be to people 
who don’t expect them. Make certain to show respect to your guests, wher-
ever you are when the interview takes place.
A good approach for getting good interviews is to ask permission of your 
guests, be they passers-by or experts at their place of business, to interview 
them. Shoving a microphone in someone’s face and blurting out a question 
is hardly a great way to introduce yourself and your podcast to the world. If 
the guest you want to interview has a handler or liaison, it’s good protocol to 
follow the suggestions and advice of the guest’s staff.
If you start out with a warm, welcoming smile and explain what you’re doing 
and why, most people open up and are happy to talk.
 
When interviewing people on the street or in the moment, there are some 
easy ways to identify yourself. Michael Butler of The Rock and Roll Geek Show 
(http://rockandrollgeek.podshow.com) uses a mic cube around his micro-
phone — these are sometimes called mic flags. The classic cube usually has a logo 
identifying a network, a show, or an organization affiliated with the interviewer. 
You can find mic cubes online (unprinted) starting around $25. There’s also the 
simple greeting, “Hi, do I have your permission to record this for a podcast?” 
 
Just as with the phone and Skype interviews, test your equipment. You’re now 
out of the controlled environment of your home studio; you have to deal with 
surrounding ambient noise and how well your interview is recording in the 
midst of uncontrolled background variables. Set up your equipment; power 
up your laptop, mixing board, and mics; and record a few words. Then play 
back your tests and set your levels accordingly. When you have your setup 
running, you’re ready to get your interviews.
Ensuring Trouble-Free Recordings
When it comes to recording conversations, here are a few points to keep in 
mind before asking the first question:

104
Par t II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 
 
 Get permission to record conversations, even if the interview is prear-
ranged. Laws (both federal and state) prohibit the recording of conver-
sations without permission, and further restrictions limit broadcasting 
these conversations. If you plan to record and publish a conversation, get 
the subject’s consent (for both) beforehand, both verbally and in written 
communication (even e-mail) to make sure your legal issues are covered.
 
 Test the calling equipment. If you have arranged a phone-in (or 
Skype-in) interview with someone for your podcast — say, a favorite 
musician or politician — prepare for the interview ahead of time. Skype 
(or phone) a friend to conduct a mock interview and make sure the 
recording setup not only works but also sounds good.
 
 The bandwidth demand increases the more people you conference 
through your computer. Reception will be affected, so if you know more 
than one person will be involved in this interview, it’s a good idea to test 
how many people you can effectively conference in one call.
 
 Check your batteries. If you’re using a portable recorder (such as the 
Zoom H2), make sure your batteries are charged and you have spares. 
(Check the spares, too.) If you’re really paranoid or live in an environ-
ment with periodic electrical problems, you can also pick up an uninter-
ruptable power supply in case your main power cuts out.
 
 Check your hard drive space. Hard drives are getting bigger and cheaper, 
but that doesn’t mean they’re infinite. Audio files can be big — especially 
if you’re recording to a raw format like WAV or AIFF! If you run out of 
space in the middle of recording a show or an interview, you lose time; 
lose pace; and in the case of interviews, lose face with your interviewee. 
If you’re recording to a portable recording device, it’s basically the same 
idea. Know how much storage you have, in megabytes or gigabytes, and 
how long you can record at your current bitrate. Don’t worry; we talk 
more about bitrates in Chapter 9.
 
If you’re doing an interview with multiple Skype participants (known as confer-
encing), it’s often best to have the person with the highest-power CPU host the 
meeting. That person should initiate the call and invite the other attendees 
one at a time. The better the CPU, the better the conference will run and the 
better your recording will sound. Also, the conference host may or may not 
be the same as the person recording the call. Remember, your goal during an 
interview is to try and minimize the chances for problems.
And although this may sound a bit pessimistic, be ready for things to go 
wrong. Guests might not show up for interviews. Also, new high-tech toys, if 
not given a proper pre-interview shakedown, may not come through. Prepare 
to have plenty of topics to discuss on your own, and then your podcast can 
continue following a quick disclaimer. In podcasting, sticking to a regular 
schedule is reassuring to your listeners because they know you’ll offer new 
feeds consistently and punctually.

O
kay, you’ve most likely gone through the hardware and software gad-
gets from Chapters 2 and 3. In this chapter, we make the bold assump-
tion that you’ve made your purchasing selections, hooked up all the 
hardware according to the supplied documentation (you did read the docu-
mentation, right?), chosen your software, and gotten everything ready to 
record. This is it! You have a microphone pointing in the direction of your 
mouth, just waiting anxiously for you to begin podcasting.
So what’s stopping you? Perhaps you have no clue how you sound to your 
recording equipment, or perhaps you’re still trying to understand why your 
smooth and sultry voice sounds like you just finished a dozen espressos. The 
problem could be in your audio application’s sound settings. Too much pep 
in the voice, and you sound like Rob Zombie crooning a goth’s delight. Too 
little amplification, and you’d be better off if you just went out to your front 
porch and shouted your podcast’s content.
So before the podcast itself comes setting levels and parameters — a fancy-
schmancy way to say fiddling with knobs and sliders on your mixing board or 
your audio-editing software to ensure that the signal you’re sending through 
the microphone is loud and clear. And once the technical side is running 
smoothly, give some thought to your voice — things like timing and enuncia-
tion. Because how you say your message directly impacts the listeners’ inter-
est in what you’re saying.

106
Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 
Did Your Sound Check Clear the Bank?
If you show up early enough for a rock concert, you see those roadies setting 
up microphones, playfully waving to the crowd as they speak quickly into a 
microphone “Check one, check two, check-check-check!” It’s a staple for 
rock ’n’ rollers to do such a mic check because the fans expect a good 
performance — it needs to be done.
With podcasting, your own mic check should be more involved. In Chapter 4, 
we recommended you perform such an audio diagnostic just to assure your-
self (and, if applicable, your guests) that the equipment is working and sound 
is, in fact, reaching your computer. The goal is not only to confirm that your 
mic is picking up sound, but also to check the volume of the voices — yours 
and that of whoever else is involved in this podcast.
Understanding dB levels
Setting levels is quite easy, provided you know where your decibel (dB) input 
levels are displayed on your software. The decibel unit is used to express the 
intensity of sound, beginning at zero for the least perceptible sound to 
approximately 130 for an intensely loud sound level. Your readout measures 
how hot you are (that’s the power of your voice, not how good you look) on 
the microphone. Audio signal strength (measured in decibels) is the amount 
of power that goes into the signal, which affects how clearly it can be heard 
and how hard it hits the ears. “Loud and clear” is good; too much signal 
strength causes distortion, and that’s a pain to listen to.
In vintage radio and audio equipment, this dB display was a VU (volume unit) 
meter — the little needle that bounced in response to your voice. Later, the 
needle was replaced by lights that reacted when you spoke into a micro-
phone, going from green to yellow to orange to red. What the lights said was 
pretty easy to translate:
 
 Green: Well, I can hear you, but wow, are you quiet!
 
 Yellow-Orange: You’re coming in loud and clear.
 
 Red: You’re in danger of hitting the distortion level (clipping).
 
 Red with double bars: Your audio is going to sound distorted.
Across hardware and software, the volume meters appear different (Figure 
6-1 shows the volume meter display for Audacity), but they all serve the 
same purpose: to make sure your content is heard clearly. Your aim, as you 
speak and watch the indicators speak back, is to keep your dB levels bounc-
ing in the high level (low red) without lighting up those double bars. When 

107
 Chapter 6: So What Are You Waiting For? Record, Already!
you attain that average, your voice is rising and falling within a good bal-
anced dynamic range. Try to keep things a little lower — in the red and 
orange range — with only the high points (when you raise your voice) going 
in to the red occasionally. You can always bring up the low spots with some 
simple post production tips (described later in this chapter).

Input level meters
Because microphones, audio-capture cards, and mixing boards all work at 
different sensitivity levels, it’s best to test your voice before you record. If 
your levels are in the green, it means you’re loud enough to be heard by your 
equipment but still so soft that people will have to crank up the volume on 
their computers or portable MP3 players, consequently blowing out their ear-
drums on the next podcast or CD.
If your recording is too loud (or “hot”), it tends to cause problems for listeners. 
Listeners have their MP3 players set for a pleasant, comfortable volume . . . 
and suddenly your show begins with guns blazing and pipes blaring. As your 
levels reach deep into the red, listeners fumble for their players and try to 
turn down the sound so the program can be understandable through its own 
distortion. Sadly, the modulation is such a problem that your voice crackles 
and growls as it tramples the volume limits of your recording equipment, 
even at the lower volume.
 
You want try to avoid clipping to prevent that distorted sound. Clipping is 
when you’re feeding too much signal to your equipment. It can come from 
many sources including incorrect settings on a microphone or other audio 
input, incorrect settings on a mixer, or the preferences in your software. Once 
audio is clipped, you can’t get the original (or intended) quality back.

In achieving a balance in your audio, you could spend the day setting and 
resetting those levels in quest of dB nirvana. That’s time spent, but not well 
spent. It makes more sense to practice till you get a pretty good sense of 
what your best working level is and get comfortable speaking into a mic at 
that level. Time to go mano-a-mano with setting the levels.
Setting your levels
Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to keep your levels in the 
neighborhood of 0 dB, dipping and spiking when necessary. For podcasting, 
consistency is key. You have your mixer turned on (if you have one), your 
mic is plugged in and turned on — check — and your software is running. 
Now follow these steps to check levels:
 
1. Begin talking into the mic about your podcast topic or plans.
 
 You can do a scripted test read or just talk off the top of your head, but 
be sure to speak in the manner and mood of your podcast.
 
 Instead of speaking to thin air in the vague direction of the mic (or the 
person next to you), speak in the exact direction of the mic, pointing 
your voice directly at the recording device (as shown in Figure 6-2). 
Even if the mic isn’t omnidirectional (meaning it picks up sounds from 
all directions at once), it can pick up your voice better this way.
 
 
If you speak directly into the microphone, you might hear some 
sounds — particularly ps and bs — causing an effect known as popping. 
An investment of less than $20 in a windscreen or pop filter can fix that. 
This device is a foam or nylon filter that stops the wind made by your 
mouth from hitting the microphones diaphragm and causing distortion.
 
2. While you’re talking (or if you’re monitoring by playing back your test 
takes), keep an eye on your dB levels on the computer screen.
Calling in the crew
It’d be great to set your levels so “0 dB” is 
always where your lights remain, but recording 
is a real-world activity. Sometimes your meter 
may never reach yellow, and other times it 
might hit the double red bars. If your goal is to 
maintain perfect levels from the beginning 
to the end of a recording session, an audio 
crew can work with you in rehearsal and 
performance, adjusting levels when you go loud 
and when you go soft. 
The downside of hiring a crew is an added 
expense to producing your podcast. Even if the 
crew is a collection of audio geek friends, it can 
still cost you sending for a lot of pizza every time 
you record.

at a com-
fortable 
distance, 
close 
enough to

ambient 
noise, but 
far enough 
to avoid

contact. 
 
 
 If the levels are spiking into the double-red/red area or remaining in the 
green, check your input volume settings on your mixing board or audio-
editing software. This might require a bit of multitasking on your part, 
but continue to adjust the input levels while talking, as you watch the 
input meters.
 
3. Re-record your voice at the new settings.
 
 Try to speak in the same manner and inflection as you did on the first 
recording.
 
4. As you review the second take, watch the dB input levels and adjust 
accordingly.
 
 When in doubt, err on the side of caution on the input levels. Record 
your volume a little low. You can always correct it in post production. 
One way to increase the volume later, using Audacity, is to select your 
audio and use the Effects➪Amplify feature to bring it up. Another is to 
save your audio to WAV format and use a tool called The Levelator 
(http://gigavox.com) to fix the levels.
 
After you set your levels, make a note of the settings somewhere other than 
your computer (using, say, a PDA or its retro ancestor — a legal pad and pen), 
in case your preferences are lost or fiddled out of whack by somebody’s child 
or best friend playing spaceship in your studio. (Yes, even adults enjoy play-
ing spaceship with really super-cool-looking equipment!) That way, even if 
something awful happens to your application’s preferences or your mixing 
board, you always have your last known settings to reference.

Noises Off: Capturing Ambient Noise
Part of the charm that is podcasting is just how varied the content is, as well 
as how spontaneous the shows tend to be when the record button is hit. 
Some podcasters believe that a “true” podcast (whatever that is!) must 
record everything in one take and deliver its content to listeners completely 
unedited. This supposed mark of authenticity includes any background noise 
There’s a right way and a wrong way . . .
Time for a confession.
When Tee got his MXL990, it was his first studio 
condenser microphone, and he was so excited 
about this microphone he failed to check the 
small slip of paper included that told him how to 
talk into it. Perhaps it was the excitement of ven-
turing into new frontiers of creativity that made 
him hook up the equipment without reading the 
directions. Maybe it was a bold assumption that 
he knew what end to talk into with a mic as he 
had worked with (dynamic) microphones before. 
Whatever the reason, Tee was speaking into the 
microphone incorrectly (left image). His friends 
in the podosphere, on seeing Tee “in action,” 
didn’t really have the heart to tell him so — or 
didn’t know any better themselves.
Fortunately, Evo Terra is a heartless evil 
mastermind. He told Tee he was doing it wrong, 
as any heartless evil mastermind would. 
On a podcast, naturally.
All microphones do not behave the same, and 
condenser microphones work best when 
speaking into them properly (right image), with 
the microphone pointed straight down. Tee, on 
hooking up his new AKG Perception-200, read 
the documentation included, reflected on Evo’s 
“kind” advice, and then positioned the mic 
accordingly. When hooking up microphones, 
refer to the enclosed documentation for addi-
tional and essential information on getting the 
best sound out of your microphone.
You, too, can avoid the embarrassment (caught 
forever) that published photographs may deliver 
upon you . . . regardless of how good the 
content it generates for your podcast.

111
 Chapter 6: So What Are You Waiting For? Record, Already!
(also called ambient noise) you happen to capture while recording — you 
know, rustling trees, birdcalls, pounding car stereos, jackhammers, the usual.
Hey, if that’s the style of your show, that’s great. However, if you’re trying to 
take listeners to a place in their imagination, read on to find out how to 
reduce or eliminate ambient noise.
Identifying ambient noise
As we discuss in Chapter 7, how much you edit depends on what kind of con-
tent you’re presenting. For example, if you’re doing an off-the-cuff, off-the-wall 
podcast about your life and a typical day in it, you may just grab the iTalk, 
plug it into your iPod, and head out the door, recording every step along the 
way. This kind of podcast can be (note we said can be) easiest to record. 
You’re podcasting a slice of Americana . . . or Britanniana, if you’re in the 
United Kingdom . . . or Australiana if podcasting from Down Under. Especially 
if your goal is to capture the look and feel of your culture, ambient noise is 
not only welcomed, but desired. Up to a point.
Some podcasters cringe at the mere mention of ambient noise — ambient 
noise like . . . well, what was in Tee’s very first podcast. When he podcasted 
MOREVI: The Chronicles of Rafe & Askana, he worked to create a magical set-
ting with voice, story, music, special effects . . . a world that was completely 
shattered by real-world interference like school buses, kids at recess, UPS 
trucks, the Virginia Commuter Rail system, and air traffic from two nearby 
airports. (All this, and he’s a dad.) Even if you love the source of the ambient 
noise, sometimes it just doesn’t fit what the podcast is trying to do.
 
If your podcast could do without input from the outside world, scheduling 
recording sessions is the start of your production. The best noise reduction 
happens in pre-production. Try scheduling your recording at night or early 
morning. You’ll find that traffic is lighter, the kids are in bed, workers aren’t 
running those jackhammers, animals typically are less active — all adding up 
to less ambient noise, hence takes on the mic.
Minimizing ambient noise
To reduce the intrusion of the outside world and still maintain a budget, 
some creativity is in order.
Truth be told, there really isn’t an easy solution to podcasting in a noisy 
world. One not-so-cost-effective answer is to rent a studio and record your 
podcast there. Unless you have a sponsor who bankrolls your costs, your 
“hobby” could easily max out credit cards and cast a hungry eye upon your 
nest egg. (Let’s not even go there.)

112
Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 
A somewhat-less-expensive option is to soundproof your home-based record-
ing room. That may sound simple, but it can involve a lot of home improve-
ment before you have one room in which you can be sure the only sound is 
yours. But is it impossible or impractical? Not really. P.G. Holyfield of the 
podcast novel Murder at Avedon Hill (http://pgholyfield.com/maah) 
and the writing podcast The NanoMonkeys (www.teampodcasts.net/
nanomonkeys) built his own studio for podcasting.
Holyfield’s do-it-yourself adventure began with a house hunt, so a studio in a 
finished basement was on the list of what the house needed. The studio even-
tually came about from a large storeroom, a few new walls, and the addition 
of an air vent. The newly created 7 x 8 foot room was then soundproofed with 
foam tiles that cost around $500. Holyfield found the effort worthwhile. “The 
studio is working out great. It was amazing to hear the difference as the foam 
went up. Now I have a completely silent room, except when the A/C turns on 
(which I can turn off most times, since the basement is pretty cool).” Figure 
6-3 shows the process he went through: the arrival of acoustical foam (left), 
measuring twice and cutting once (center), and the studio (right). The advan-
tage of being in the basement is far less outside noise entering through the 
walls. The advantage of the acoustic foam is to reduce sound waves bouncing 
off the walls and creating unwanted effects.
 
Figure 6-3: 
The Voices 
of Cairn 
Studios 
started 
as P.G. 
Holyfield’s 
dream 
project.  
Renovation, especially if you’re a fan of the DIY Network, makes this kind of 
home-built studio a possibility, but still may not be a practical solution for all 
homeowners. And this kind of aggressive home improvement is seriously 
frowned upon if you’re renting an apartment.
You can keep this home renovation affordable and within the lease agree-
ment terms:
 
 Stuff towels under the door. It decreases the amount of sound from 
inside your house filtering into your recording area.
 
 Keep the microphone as far away from your computer as possible. Its 
fan (if audible) simply becomes part of the natural ambiance for the pod-
casting room.

113
 Chapter 6: So What Are You Waiting For? Record, Already!
 
 Turn off any ceiling fans, floor heaters, additional air conditioners, or 
room ionizers. With fewer appliances running, you have less chance of 
additional ambient sound being created.
 
 If you do encounter ambient noise that you don’t want in your pod-
cast, simply give it a few moments. Wait until the noise subsides, pause, 
and then pick up your podcast a few lines before the interruption. That’s 
for the sake of post-production: With a substantial gap in your podcast 
activity, you can easily narrow down where your edits are needed.
 
When noise interferes with your podcast, leaving gaps of silence so you know 
where to edit isn’t exactly a foolproof method. Always set aside enough time 
to listen to your podcast — and really listen, not just play it back while you 
clean the office or call a friend. Make sure levels are even, no segments are 
repeated, and the final product is ready for uploading and posting.
Many podcasts rely on ambient noise to set a mood, but sometimes reality 
just doesn’t cut it. If you want to put more craft into the setting for your pod-
cast, the ideas in this section should help you keep the background down to 
a dull roar.
 
When holding podcasts on location, make sure the ambiance — be it a particu-
larly busy crosswalk at a street corner, a frequented bar, or backstage at a 
concert — does not overwhelm your voice. Background noise belongs in (well, 
yeah) the background. Its intent is to set a tone for the aim of the podcast, not 
to become the podcast itself. It would also be a good idea, if possible, to do a 
few test recordings in the space to see how much volume you’ll need and how 
close to the mic you have to be in order to be heard.
Now Take Your Time and Hurry Up: 
Pacing and Clock Management
Podcasts, whether short and sweet or epic and ambitious, all share some-
thing in common: the need for pacing. As a rule, you don’t want to blurt out 
the aim or intent of your podcast in the opening five minutes and then pad 
the remaining ten or fifteen with fluff. Nor do you want to drone on and on 
(and on . . .) till suddenly you have to rush frantically into why you’re pod-
casting on this particular day about this particular topic. Give yourself ample 
time to set the mood comfortably and competently and make it to the intent 
without dawdling. Enjoy your podcast but respect your listeners’ time. Make 
certain you don’t overstay your welcome. The trick in pacing is to under-
stand how much time you have to get your message across.

114
Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 
So the big question is how to really grasp how much time you really have. 
Where to start?
It’s a good idea to get a grasp of how much time you really have in one whole 
minute. To do this, find a clock, watch, or a stopwatch and for one minute 
(and only one minute) sit quietly and do nothing, say nothing, and remain 
perfectly still. That one minute will feel like a short eternity. Now imagine 
that one minute times 15. (No, no, no — do not repeat this exercise for 15 
minutes. There’s a fine line between an exercise and a complete waste of 
time.)
Fifteen minutes (for a start) is a good amount of time on your hands, so you 
should make certain that in your podcast you take your time to get to the 
message. The journey you take your listeners on doesn’t necessarily have to 
occupy all of that time — be it 15, 20, or 30 minutes — but you have time to 
play. That’s the most important thing to remember as you set your best pod-
casting pace.
Take the potato out of your 
mouth and enunciate
This section is dedicated to FarPoint Media’s, Michael R. Mennenga. He’s an 
easy guy to love; but, man, does he need to take a breath and give himself a 
moment before speaking. It’s rough enough when your Slice of SciFi co-hosts 
are constantly riding you like a Triple Crown winner; but an intervention is in 
order when Bruce Campbell (Ash from the Evil Dead films, and Elvis from 
Bubba Ho-tep) puts you in your place — and on your show!
And sometimes, all you need to sharpen your speech and your vocabulary is 
to take a breath.
It isn’t out of the ordinary to fire up the mic and launch into your podcast 
with enough energy and vitality to power a small shire in England. Nothing 
wrong with that — until you go back and listen to yourself. Your words, 
phrases, and thoughts are running together and forming one turbulent, 
muddy stream of thought. Yes, that is your voice, but even you’re having a 
tough time understanding what the podcast is about and what the podcaster 
is saying . . . and you’re the podcaster!
One way of getting a grip on pacing yourself through a podcast is enunciation — 
pronouncing your words distinctly, explaining your topic clearly — and there is 
no better way to do that than to slow your speech slightly and listen carefully to 
certain consonants (for example, the t, s, and d sounds). Proper enunciation can 

115
 Chapter 6: So What Are You Waiting For? Record, Already!
help you set a comfortable pace and keep you from rushing through your pre-
sentation. In fact, it isn’t a bad idea to over-enunciate. In the excitement of 
recording, over-enunciation actually forces you to slow down, clean up your pro-
nunciation, and make your voice easily understandable. That same excitement is 
likely to increase your pace of speaking. Again, if the rapid pace is part of your 
presentation, stick with it, but if you’re doing anything like a narration for an 
audio book, slow down. If you think you’re speaking just a little too slowly, 
you’re probably going just the right speed.
 
Speaking a few tongue-twisters before going on mic helps your enunciation 
and also warms up your voice and prepares it for the podcast you’re about to 
record. Here are some easy ones that emphasize the problem consonants lost 
when speaking too quickly:
 
 Toot the tin trumpet, Tommy, in time.
 
 Pop prickly pickles past the peck of parsley.
 
 See sand slip silently through the sunlit seals.
 
 The sixth sheik’s sheep is sick.
 
 Will Wendy remember wrecking the white rocker?
If you perform a search online for tongue twisters, you can find a wide variety 
of classic and original warm-ups for the voice. You can also take the twisters 
you find and compose your own. 
And now let’s take a break 
for station identification
Ever notice that certain podcasts suddenly break in with a show ID or take 
some other marked break and then (if they’re lucky enough to have spon-
sors) play their sponsors’ spots? They’re trying to emulate — and maybe 
make themselves easily syndicated by — conventional radio. You know — 
the broadcasting industry. Clock management is the careful, standardized 
interruption of a typical radio broadcast — usually every 15 minutes in a one-
hour slot — for such necessities as station identification, show identification, 
public-service announcements (PSAs), and (of course) commercials.
Following this professional format has broadened podcasting’s potential of 
becoming a commercial venue. Many shows such as NPR, The Dragon Page: 
Cover to Cover, and NBC’s The Today Show are following clock management 
as they’re syndicated for radio or television already. Tailoring a podcast for 
the broadcast airwaves, or even scheduling in quarterly breaks in the hour, 

116
Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 
can actually work in your favor. Some podcasts such as Dancing with 
Elephants (http://dwithe.com), and the audio novels of Scott Sigler 
(http://scottsigler.net) have found natural places in their episodes 
for ads. They may not be following strict clock management, but it’s a step 
towards that model, making advertising and commercial gain in podcasting a 
possibility.
Another nice bonus of following clock management is you have several points 
in your show to give a quick “show ID” (something like “You’re listening to 
Technorama with Chuck and Kreg . . .”) that lets people know who you are. 
This show ID is great to catch the attention of people who may be walking 
into the middle of your podcast, and just as they ask the podcast listener 
“What are you listening to?” the show ID drops. Although “show IDs” are usu-
ally expected at the top of the hour and on the half-hour, you can drop in a 
show ID anytime you feel like it. 
Clock management usually works in this fashion during an hour:
 
 :00 — programming break, station identification, show ID, PSAs, 
advertisements
 
 :15 — programming break, PSAs, advertisements
 
 :30 — programming break, station identification, show ID, PSAs, 
advertisements
 
 :45 — programming break, PSAs, advertisements
These breaks vary in length but can last anywhere from two minutes to five 
minutes. No surprise that this is where hardcore podcasters (anyone pod-
casting since before early 2005) get a bit restless. They find clock manage-
ment and show ID redundant, if not frivolous. Why bother to break or even 
drop in a show ID? People have downloaded your feed specifically. They 
know what they’re listening to, so what purpose does clock management 
serve?
It all comes back to what you see for your podcast’s future. If you intend to 
remain in the podosphere (the community of podcasters and loyal listeners, a 
podcast version of the blogosphere), it really comes down to your format, 
your way. No constraints from the FCC. It’s just you, the microphone, your 
listeners, and caution to the wind. However, if you set your sights for the 
broadcast airwaves — be it AM, FM, or satellite radio — you have to format 
your show to fit the standards. This may not sound like a challenge, but when 
Michael R. Mennenga and Evo Terra took the 2004 incarnation of The Dragon 
Page from a pre-recorded venue to a live call-in show on an Arizona radio sta-
tion, their jump appeared no larger than a hop as the pace of the show was 
already tailored for clock management.

117
 Chapter 6: So What Are You Waiting For? Record, Already!
Think about the possibilities of your podcast and where you see yourself 
with it several months (or years) down the road. Maybe a bit of management 
and organization will aid your podcast in jumping to the airwaves.
Concerning Tangents and Their Val — 
Oh, Look, a Butterfly!
It’s hardly surprising that broadcasters who have no experience in broad-
casting tend to stray from their topic once the microphone goes hot, and 
then they lose themselves in the thickets and thorns of tangents. Defensive 
podcasters claim that’s part of the charm of podcasting, but that charm fades 
as the topic gets closer to serious. If (for example) you launch a podcast 
intent on addressing the growing concern of television violence and wander 
into American Idol trivia, don’t be surprised if your audience wanders away.
 
It’s worth repeating: Stay focused on the intent of your podcast. Remaining 
true to your podcast’s intent isn’t just a matter of staying within your running 
time; it also makes clear to your listeners that, yes, you have a message and 
you will deliver it. You haven’t promised something substantial only to let 
your mind and commentary wander aimlessly. When people listen, you want 
them to feel assured that what they will hear is exactly what you’ve offered.
Read on to find out how you can make tangents work and how to smoothly 
get back on topic after you’ve taken your side trip.
“Say, that reminds me of something . . .”
Tangents can be creative opportunities. You don’t necessarily treat tangents 
as strictly verboten in podcasting. If your tangent is directly related to, or 
benefits/enhances, your topic, it can be effective and engaging.
Podcasting goes pro
Broadcasting networks that present to the air-
waves sensational commentators like Sean 
Hannity, Anderson Cooper, Bill Mahr, and Rush 
(no, not the kickin’ rock group from Canada, 
but the big man of the Right Wing, Rush 
Limbaugh . . .) are now taking their shows to the 
podosphere as a way to market their shows and 
reach a worldwide audience.
Along with the talk-radio personalities, other 
major players in broadcasting turning to pod-
casting as an alternative include NPR, ESPN, 
Disney, the BBC, and ABC.

118
Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 
Say your commentary begins with “Anyone notice how cell phones are no 
longer just cell phones but tiny PDAs that can be easily monitored and 
hacked into?” and covers that for a bit, and then you break off on a tangent 
about cell phone etiquette and the lack of manners it brings out of people, 
then this is a tangent that will keep your listeners engaged — and that can 
count as much as staying on topic.
What if your podcast isn’t so structured, though? There’s nothing wrong with 
hitting Record and forging ahead into the great unknown of the next 15 or 20 
minutes, so long as you have an idea of where you want to go. Tangents are 
terrific in moderation, but put some reins on ’em and keep them at least 
(well, yeah) tangentially related to the subject matter of your podcast. If, say, 
your podcast is about movies but your review of The Fantastic Four suddenly 
goes into the decline of the comic book industry (regardless of the onslaught 
of comic-books-to-film productions), then you still have a sense of focus. 
However, if your review of The Fantastic Four wanders off into how your cat 
is throwing up hairballs every time you podcast or that your car’s sunroof 
chose to stop working, blah, blah, what the heck is going on here? Your audi-
ence may grow frustrated enough to stop listening. 
“But getting back to what 
I was saying earlier . . .”
When you’re podcasting for 15 or 20 minutes (or longer . . .), it’s okay to take 
the scenic route with your discussion, but make sure that you return to the 
point you wanted to make in this particular (weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly) 
installment. The listener’s delight in podcasts is often the revelation that indi-
viduals who (in many cases) have never set foot in a recording studio can 
produce entertaining, and even informative, shows. Sometimes meandering 
back to the point is part of that delight.
For instance, a podcast might begin with something read in the headlines — 
say, a new marketing strategy launched by Apple for the iPhone to reach a 
wider client base. This can lead to a variety of topics in the discussion, such 
as the following:
 
 Multipurpose cell phones that play MP3s, video clips, text messages, 
and podcasts
 
 Costs for iPhone services from AT&T and other carriers
 
 Ways that carriers could bring down the costs of services
 
 Continued shortcomings and disappointments from the cell-phone 
industry

119
 Chapter 6: So What Are You Waiting For? Record, Already!
But in the last five to ten minutes, a simple segue like “So, to recap our 
thoughts on this bold marketing strategy from Apple to offer the iPhone 
legally to other carriers. . .” can successfully steer you, or you and your co-
hosts, back to the aim and intent of your podcast. If you return deliberately 
from a tangent, your listening audience arrives back at the point and knows 
the destination as well as the scenery they went through to get there.
The name says it all
The ADD Cast (http://addcast.net) has 
a real charm about it in that its hosts Paul 
Fischer and Martha Holloway indulge in the 
many tangents that, on hitting the Record 
button, they explore with their numerous in-
studio guests. What makes The ADD Cast so 
much fun to listen to is how they go completely 
off-topic and try to come back full circle at the 
end. Sometimes, it’s the guests that bring Paul 
and Martha back to the starting point. Other 
times, it’s the show hosts themselves. Many 
times, though, The ADD Cast lives up to its name 
and covers a lot of ground in less than an hour’s 
time, ending with an offering from the Podsafe 
Music Network. Although most shows try to 
stay focused on the topic at hand, the cast of 
The ADD Cast creates engaging content with 
tangents. Have a listen and you’ll soon under-
stand what they mean by “If you can’t control 
the stimulus, control the response.”

Get your listeners there and back again. Not only will they appreciate it, but 
they’ll tell others about your podcast, and your subscribers will grow in 
numbers.
We hit on the topic of using a script versus an outline in Chapter 4. When it 
comes to staying on track, clearly, a script has a distinct advantage over an 
outline. Regarding interviews (see Chapter 5), having a list of questions is 
important, but don’t be afraid to ask impromptu questions — you can always 
go back to your prepared list.
Recording!
Whew — there certainly is a lot to think about before you get started. That’s 
what makes a great podcast — someone did some planning. Now it’s time to 
put that planning and practicing into action.
Getting started with GarageBand
When you first start GarageBand, you’re presented with an array of choices. 
How you answer this first question has ramifications on what you can — and 
in some cases cannot — do in GarageBand: Should you create a new music 
project or a new podcast episode? Believe it or not, if your goal is to have an 
MP3 to distribute to the world, you want to create a new music project. Ah, 
the sweet ironies of podcasting. The reason is because so many of the 
defaults for a new podcast episode are set up to create an “enhanced” pod-
cast, one that contains multiple images, discrete sections known as chapters, 
and a file format (m4a) that is playable only on an Apple-branded product 
like an iPod or iTunes. That isn’t to say you can’t create an MP3 by creating a 
podcast project in GarageBand, but it requires a few extra steps.
For simplicity’s sake, choose to create a new music project. We also recom-
mend changing a few settings that work better for music composition than 
they do for podcast recording:
 
 Turn off the metronome. The metronome is a device used to keep time 
in music. If you don’t turn it off, you’ll hear a click-click-click while 
you’re speaking — annoying to say the least. The easiest way to turn it 
off is to press Ô+U.
 
 Turn off the snap-to-grid feature. Again, this feature is beneficial to 
musicians but can be rather annoying to podcasters when it comes to 
editing. By turning this feature off, you can edit any arbitrary position 

121
 Chapter 6: So What Are You Waiting For? Record, Already!
rather than those based on measured spaces. To turn off snap-to-grid, 
press Ô+G.
 
 Delete the default track. Not to sound like a broken record, but this too 
has a purpose for musicians. The first track doesn’t really have a use for 
recording voice, so delete it by pressing Ô+Del.
 
 Turn off the keyboard display. Unless you have a need to plink on the 
keyboard while recording your podcast, turn it off by pressing Ô+K.
 
 Show time in the LCD. In the bottom of the GarageBand window is a dis-
play. Because you picked a music project, it shows measures. For your 
podcast, time is more appropriate so switch it by pressing Shift+Ô+F.
That may seem like a lot before you even hit the Record button, but it takes 
about a second to press all those key sequences. If you prefer, you can find 
most of these on the Control menu.
Now you have a clean slate to start with. There’s just one more thing to 
check before you “throw the switch,” and that’s to make sure GarageBand 
knows where to get input from. Choose GarageBand➪Preferences and click 
Audio/Midi at the top of the window that pops up. Check to make sure your 
Audio Input is selected correctly. The setting varies depending on your 
actual input (USB microphone, FireWire mixer, analog mixer to the built-in 
audio, and so on). After that’s taken care of, close the window.
Go ahead and create a new track by choosing Track➪New Track, click the big 
red Record button on the bottom, and begin speaking. When you’re ready to 
stop, click the Play button. Note, clicking the Record button again stops 
recording, but GarageBand continues playing. 
Congratulations, you’ve made your first recording in GarageBand!
Getting started with Audacity
Audacity was meant to be simple. To record a podcast in Audacity, follow 
these simple steps:
 
1. Set your input.
 
 At the top of the screen you can find a drop-down list with several 
choices — Line In, Microphone, CD Player, and so on. Your settings 
depend on your system setup. Audacity is pretty good at detecting what 
inputs it can use on your system. Go ahead and pick the proper one.

122
Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 
 
2. Click the Record button.
 
 Audacity creates a new track and begins recording. As you speak your 
words of wisdom to the world, you should see the meters moving and 
the waveform being created.
 
3. Click the Stop button.
 
 When you’re done, just click Stop.
Congratulations, you’ve made your first recording using Audacity. Now you 
know why so many podcasters love it!

lthough a high-tech activity like podcasting doesn’t exactly qualify 
as quaint, “the charm of podcasting” is (as Steve Jobs describes it) 
a Wayne’s World approach to broadcasting. In Wayne’s World (1992), two 
Illinois teenagers, Wayne and Garth, shoot a television show in Wayne’s base-
ment. They rock and roll their afternoons away for their local cable-access 
station, all on the budget that their allowance (and perhaps the odd sponsor 
or two) can swing.
Podcasts, much like Wayne’s World, are often done on a shoestring budget 
and recorded in one take, with no editing. All the trip-ups and tangents are 
captured for posterity and sent to MP3 players everywhere. This is part of 
the homespun appeal that podcasting is not only known for, but prides itself 
on nurturing as new and innovative podcasters enter the podosphere.
Although podcasting purists may harbor animosity toward the editing pro-
cess, sometimes it makes all the difference between a listenable podcast and 
an incoherent mess of senseless rambling. For example, you might want to 
eliminate the sound of a train going by or silence a cough that would other-
wise distract your listeners from a brilliant riposte. This chapter shows you 
how to use editing to shape your podcast while retaining its natural atmo-
sphere, adding depth to that atmosphere with music, and then give the final 
touch to your podcast’s format with an introduction and exit.

Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 
A Few Reasons to Consider Editing
Take a serious look at the script and the mood you want to convey with your 
podcast. From there, you can judge how intense your editing workload will 
be. The following list explains some instances where editing is needed — and 
(trust us) your podcast will benefit from it:
 
 Professional production quality: You can’t always get everything right 
on the first take — and sometimes not even on the second or third. 
Editing makes it sound like you got even hard-to-pronounce names and 
tricky tongue twisters right on the first try. What’s more, you can drop 
in pre-produced clips with just the right amount of space before and 
after to give it that polished feel.
 
 Removing boring material: You’ve probably watched a live show or 
listened to live audio that doesn’t go quite where it is intended. The 
content gets dull and uninteresting. As a listener, you can fast forward, 
change the channel, or just turn it off. As a podcaster, you can avoid this 
situation with editing. But even though it sounds easy to take out the 
boring bits, be careful that you maintain continuity. If edited improperly, 
the listeners may find themselves confused because the line of ques-
tions changed from space travel to herbs and spices in the matter of a 
few seconds.
 
 Ambient noise: As explained in Chapter 6, ambient noise is the natural 
and spontaneously occurring noise you may pick up when recording 
your podcast. In some productions, such as podiobooks (books podcast 
one chapter at a time, in a serialized format), moods and atmospheres 
must be maintained. In others — say, a radio drama like The Radio 
Adventures of Doctor Floyd (http://doctorfloyd.com) — continuity 
and clarity are established, requiring a certain amount of editing simply 
to control ambient noise. If you’re conducting an in-studio interview and 
suddenly a passing siren or the rumble of a garbage truck makes it into 
your recording, the noise can disrupt the momentum of the interview 
and distract the audience.
 
 Running times: You just wrapped your latest podcast with a great inter-
view, and you’re confident that you have plenty of material for your 
30-minute podcast. And then you check again and realize that you have 
recorded over 90 minutes’ worth of interview. And you love all of it! 
Now here’s where editing works in your favor. Your listeners expect 30 
minutes, give or take a segment or two, from your podcast. You could 
run the whole thing, unedited, but that might test the patience of your 
audience members (not to mention their bandwidth and file storage). 
Or you could split it up into two 45-minute interviews — or even three 
30-minute interviews — breaking up the airplay of the interviews with 
two smaller podcasts in-between the segments. In this approach to edit-
ing, everyone wins.

125
 Chapter 7: Cleanup, Podcast Aisle 7!
 
 Editing can easily increase your productivity with podcasts. True, some 
podcasters define “editing” as cutting and deleting material, but there’s 
more to it. Editing can actually help you rescue discussions and content 
that would otherwise be hard to shoehorn into one podcast.
 
 Scripted material: Some podcasters argue that the true podcast is done 
in one take, but as podcasting matures as a medium, audiences grow 
more and more demanding. Expectations for a podcast change when 
your podcast includes scripted material. Editing is a necessity in these 
situations. With dramatic readings and productions, moments of “ah” 
and “um” should be edited out to maintain the clarity of the story, as 
well as maintain the mood or atmosphere established in your reading.
 
 With the rising popularity of audio literature in the podosphere, pro-
fessionalism and performance are the keys to a good product — and 
usually that means (yep) editing. If you feel that editing would mar the 
spontaneity of your podcast — but still want to present literature or 
other scripted material — ask yourself how good you think The Lord of 
the Rings would had been if Ian McKellen or Viggo Mortensen did every-
thing in one take. Imagine their dialogue sounding like this:
 
 Gandalf: Frodo . . . he, uuummm, grows closer to, you know, the 
end. I wonder if, um, he’s, ahh . . . alive.
 
 Aragorn: Ummm . . . what *sneezes suddenly — sniffle sniffle* . . . 
what does your heart *ahem* tell you?
 
 Not what we would call riveting drama. With scripted material, editing is 
a must.
The Art of Editing
Editing out breaks, stammers, and trip-ups may sound easy, but there’s a sci-
ence to it. If you cut off too much from a clip, one word comes right on top 
of another, and you sound unnatural. If you don’t cut off enough, pauses last 
too long between thoughts. 
 
When you’re editing voice, the key is to review, review, review.
A lot of audio applications are out there, each with their own way to edit 
stumbles, bumbles, and moments of silence to honor a lost thought. The 
same principles apply to all of those applications:
 
1. Find the unwanted content.
 
2. Give your clip a little bit — perhaps a half a second — of silence as 
leader or “play area” between edits.
 
3. Review the edit, making sure it sounds smooth and natural; an effective 
edit doesn’t sound like an edit.

126
Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 
But instead of talking about it, how about you do it? In the following sec-
tions, we go into basic editing using GarageBand (www.apple.com/ilife/
garageband) and Audacity (http://audacity.sourceforge.net) as 
examples. These are two very common audio-editing software packages in 
podcasting, and both serve as our benchmarks for how to create podcasts. If 
you’re using some other audio-editing software package, the steps are similar 
enough for you to apply to your own project.
Editing with GarageBand
You can use GarageBand to edit awkward gaps of silence or eliminate coughs 
and stammers from your podcast. We assume at this point you just finished 
recording or opened a GarageBand file with a recorded track already done 
(see Chapter 6 for instructions on recording with GarageBand). You can also 
import audio files (perhaps recorded on a portable device) by dragging them 
from the Finder into GarageBand. 
To prepare for editing the silences and splutters, split your audio into 
smaller segments to isolate the audio that you want to remove. Then follow 
these steps:
 
1. Determine where in the track you want to make the edit by clicking 
and dragging the playhead to the beginning point of your edit.
 
 Use the Time Display readout to see exactly how long the gap of silence 
runs. The playhead tool is the triangle connected to a vertical red line. 
(See Figure 7-1 for details.) When creating segments, you want to place 
this line at the beginning and ending points of your edit. 
 
 
Silence is pretty easy to see when you’re looking at a waveform of the 
audio. Coughs or other noise can be a little trickier to isolate. We sug-
gest watching the waveform while you listen to the audio at the same 
time. You may want to use the slider in the bottom left to increase your 
time scale resolution and make it easier to work with smaller bits of 
information.
 
2. Choose Edit➪Split to make the first cut.
 
 Figure 7-1 shows the first cut.
 
3. Move your playhead to the location where you want the edit to end. 
Then choose Edit➪Split to make your next cut.
 
 
As you edit, give yourself a second or two of silent “play area” at the 
beginning and end of your edits. It makes the editing of two segments 
sound like one continuous segment, and they’ll be a little easier to mix 
together.

4. Single-click the segment between your two cuts and then press the 
Delete key.
 
 
If you’re working with GarageBand for the first time, note that the first 
track of audio is selected by default. To deselect the segment you’re 
editing, single-click anywhere in the gray area underneath the track(s) 
you’re working on.
 
5. To join the two remaining audio segments, click and drag the right 
segment over the left segment, overlapping the two (as shown in 
Figure 7-2).
 
 
If the selected segment overlaps any part of the unselected segment, it 
takes priority over the unselected segment, effectively erasing any con-
tent there.
 
 You can combine the step of deleting a segment and closing the 
gap (delete and move) by using the GarageBand key sequence 
Ctrl+Backspace.

6. Click and drag the playhead to any point before the edit and click the 
Play button to review.
 
7. If the edit doesn’t sound natural, undo the changes (by choosing 
Edit➪Undo Change of Position Region) and try again.
 
 Because you’re allowed multiple undos in GarageBand, you can step 
back in your project to begin at the first Split command.
Hate editing? Get real . . .
Are there exceptions to the rule? Absolutely! 
Yes, a performance is at its best when your 
actors are stammer-free, but back in 1938 
there was a radio drama that was chock-full of 
trip-ups, stutters, and “fluffs” as Paul Jenkins 
of RevUp Review (www.revupreview.
co.uk) calls them. With all this going against 
its production, the Mercury Theatre terrified a 
nation with its adaptation of H.G. Wells’ War of 
the Worlds, arguably the first “reality-based” 
entertainment (well, a realistic simulation of 
reality, anyway) unleashed on America — the 
fluffs intensified the illusion of reality. If your 
podcast is primarily entertainment anchored 
in reality, you can probably avoid the arduous 
editing process. Again, it depends on the con-
tent you’re podcasting.

129
 Chapter 7: Cleanup, Podcast Aisle 7!
As much as we would love to cover all the neat doo-dads in GarageBand — 
and there are a lot of them — we need to stick to the essentials you need 
to get started podcasting. For more in-depth information on mastering 
GarageBand, there are plenty of other resources available, including The 
Garage Door Web site at http://thegaragedoor.com.
Editing with Audacity
At this point, we assume you’ve just finished recording something awesome 
with Audacity (see Chapter 6 for instructions), or perhaps you’ve opened a 
saved project. If you have an audio file from another source, such as a porta-
ble recorder, you can import it using File➪Import. Now you’re ready to follow 
these steps to make a basic edit:
 
1. Find the segment that you want to edit.
 
 
 To view the entire timeline of your project, click the Fit Project in 
Window tool, shown here in the margin.
 
 You can easily navigate between the segments of your timelines selected 
and the project timeline as a whole with the Fit Project in Window and 
Fit Selection in Window tools, located in the top-right section of the proj-
ect window.
 
 
2. Click the Selection tool — in the upper left (Mac) and upper center 
(Windows) — and then click and drag across the unwanted segment.
 
 The unwanted segment is highlighted, as shown in Figure 7-3.
 
 
Right about here would be a good opportunity to use the Fit Selection in 
Window tool to double-check that the selection border doesn’t go into 
the recorded content you want to keep.
 
3. Single-click the segment between your two cuts and then press the 
Delete key (Mac) or the Backspace key (Windows).
 
 You can also choose Edit➪Cut or press Ô+X (Mac)/Ctrl+X (Windows) to 
remove the unwanted segment.
 
 
Do not use the Trim command. (HERE’S THE COMMAND NOT TO USE: 
Edit➪Trim or Ô+T for Mac/Ctrl+T for Windows.) You may think you are 
trimming away unwanted content, but this command works differently 
from the Ô+T command in GarageBand: Just like when you crop an 
image, it trims off unselected material — leaving you with only the con-
tent you wanted to edit out. Ack!
 
4. Review the clip. 
 
5. If the edit doesn’t sound natural to you, undo the changes by choosing 
Edit➪Undo Change of Position Region or pressing Ô+Z (Mac) or Ctrl+Z 
(Windows), and try again.

 You’re allowed multiple undos in Audacity, giving you the advantage 
to go back to the beginning point of your editing just in case you aren’t 
happy with the sound of the edit.
Making Your Musical Bed and 
Lying in It: Background Music
On listening to podcasts of people in interview situations or in round table 
discussions, there can be a strange sense of isolation, especially if the con-
versation hits a pocket of dead air (when conversation or the signal stops), 
and only silence is recorded or broadcast.
A few podcasters like to add a little bit of atmosphere in their individual pod-
cast with bed music — a background soundtrack that’s usually two to three 
minutes long and is looped so it can play again and again throughout the 
podcast, if desired. Sometimes the bed music lasts only a minute or two into 
the podcast when the hosts return from the break, whereas other shows, like 
Chuck Tomasi’s Gmail Podcast, keep it going from beginning to end, fading it 
out if they’re bringing in any other sources of audio (voice mail, other pod-
cast promos, ads, and so on).

131
 Chapter 7: Cleanup, Podcast Aisle 7!
 
Regardless of how long the loop is, you must obtain permission from the art-
ists to use their music and give them audible credit — either at the beginning 
or end of your podcast. If you’re using shareware music, such as from Podsafe 
Music Network (http://music.podshow.com), giving audible credit is one 
of the conditions you must agree to. Other options include using music loops 
found in GarageBand, Audition, or Soundtrack.
Finding the right balance
As you add music as a background bed, incorporate sound effects, and bring 
in pre-recorded audio from other sources (such as a Samsung H2 or a Skype 
call), the sound of your podcast gets more complex. Balance becomes not 
only harder, but even more essential. (Note, for example, the various volume 
levels of the multiple tracks in Figure 7-4.)
Bed music should add atmosphere to your podcast. That means finding a 
proper balance between the talking of the hosts and the soundtrack. The fol-
lowing sections explain why you want to avoid music that’s too soft or too 
loud.
 
Figure 7-4: 
Adding mul-
tiple tracks 
is easy. 
Balancing 
them can be 
challenging.
 

132
Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 
What is that noise?
If your music is too soft, your looped music could be mistaken as unwanted 
ambient noise of someone listening to music in the next room. Or it could 
be regarded as some kind of technical difficulty such as a stray signal bleed-
ing (another wireless audio signal accidentally being picked up by the same 
frequency as your own wireless audio device) into the podcaster’s wireless 
microphone. Music too indistinct to hear can be a distraction, particularly in 
quiet moments or pauses in the conversation. Your audience might end up 
hammering out e-mail after e-mail (asking what’s making that annoying noise) 
or trying to figure out what that faint music in the background is.
Could you speak up? I can’t hear you for the music . . .
When bed music is too loud, your voice is lost in the melody. Music, espe-
cially classical music and selections that rise and fall in intensity (like any 
good Queen album) can be really tricky to mix into a conversation.
You do want to allow your audience to hear the music in the background, but 
the music, if you’re using it as background music, probably isn’t the point 
of the podcast. It shouldn’t be so loud that you have to pump up your own 
voice track to be heard.
Never sacrifice audio clarity so bed music can be heard and identified clearly. 
If you want to showcase music, then showcase music properly. Otherwise, 
your bed music should remain in the background as a setting, not in the fore-
front of your podcast.
Applying bed music the right way
When you’re setting audio levels, you want to find the best blend of music 
and voice, assuring one doesn’t overpower the other. Both tracks should 
work together and not struggle for dominance. 
 
Always listen to the podcast before uploading to the Internet — review, 
review, review, and find that balance.
To avoid music that’s either too soft or too loud, keep the following points in 
mind as you apply the bed music:
 
 Experiment with levels for the music before you record voice. Watch 
your decibel level meter and set your music between –11 and 16 dB, 
depending on the music or sound effects you’re using.
 
 When you’re comfortable with the bed’s level, lay down a voice track 
and see how your project’s overall levels look (as well as sound) on 
your decibel level meter. Remember, your aim is to keep your voice 
in the “0” or red area without overmodulating. With the music bed now 
behind your voice, it’s much easier to hit the red without effort.

133
 Chapter 7: Cleanup, Podcast Aisle 7!
 
 Avoid “uneven” music, or music that suddenly dips low and then has 
moments of sudden intensity. The best music-bed-friendly loops have 
an even sound (whether driving and dramatic or laid-back and relaxed) 
and an even level.
 
 Experiment with putting your music at the beginning and at the 
ending of your podcast instead of throughout. In these cases, music 
beds announce upcoming breaks and pauses in your podcast.
Setting volume levels for bed music
Each audio application has its own way to change volume dynamically — but 
the basic process is the same. In the sections that follow, you find out how 
to use GarageBand and Audacity to bring music into your podcast at full 
volume, and then balance it to be just audible enough in the background.
Setting volume levels manually with GarageBand
Follow these steps to set volume levels with GarageBand:
 
1. Click to select the track icon (usually represented by a silhouette of a 
person) that your voice resides on.
 
 All segments in this track only are selected.
 
2. Click and drag the playhead to anywhere between five and ten sec-
onds into the project.
 
 If you look at the Time Display in GarageBand and see a music note in 
the left corner, single-click it. Doing so switches the display out of Beats 
and Measures mode and into Time mode.
 
3. Click and drag the beginning of your vocal track (your voice) to the 
playhead.
 
 You now have ten seconds of lead time between the beginning of the 
timeline and your podcast.
 
4. In the Finder open a window and find the music file you want to 
use as your bed music. Click and drag the file into GarageBand, just 
underneath your podcast track, as shown in Figure 7-5.
 
 When using sound effects or bed music, try to use AIFF or WAV files. 
An MP3 file is a compressed file. Compressed files (film, photo, audio, 
whatever) are usually far from ideal for editing because there’s loss with 
every compression cycle — you lose a bit of quality. If you have audio 
bits you want to export for editing, perhaps in another program, we 
recommend to export them in a raw format such as AIFF or WAV so you 
don’t lose any quality.

5. Expand the new track of audio you just imported into the project by 
clicking the Expand Track (the upside-down triangle) tool located in 
the collection of tools grouped with the music track.
 
 You should see a thin blue line against a simple grid. This is your track 
volume control. If your playhead isn’t at the ten-second mark, be sure to 
put it there.
 
6. Click at the point where the playhead line and the volume control line 
intersect.
 
 You have now created a control point — a place you can click and drag 
to change volume levels at various times. (See Figure 7-6.)
 
7. Move your playhead back two seconds to the eight-second mark. At 
the eight-second mark, click the volume control to create another con-
trol point.
 
8. Return to the first control point you created (in Step 6). Click, hold, 
and drag the control point halfway between the bottom of the track-
volume partition and its current level.
 
 You have just created a volume curve. Now the sound dips lower, allowing 
for a voiceover to be heard with music softly playing in the background.
 
9. Move your playhead back to the ten-second mark, as shown in 
Figure 7-6.

135
 Chapter 7: Cleanup, Podcast Aisle 7!
 
 Doing so completes your fade-down (the automatic fading of the music 
to a subdued volume behind the voiceover).
 
10. Select the podcast track and click and drag your podcast segments to 
where the content begins at the ten-second mark.
 
 You now have a bed of music behind your podcast.
 
11. Bring the playhead back to the beginning and review your podcast. 
Change the levels accordingly to set the music at a level you think 
works best.
Setting volume levels automatically in GarageBand
Beginning in iLife ’06, GarageBand includes a ducking feature to automati-
cally lower (and raise) the volumes of your bed music. When enabled, duck-
ing automatically senses audio from the other tracks and lowers any tracks. 
When there is silence or a gap in the other tracks, the ducking feature raises 
the volume.

136
Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 
Follow these steps to have GarageBand automatically detect the volume 
levels in your podcast:
 
1. Begin with the same four steps as the previous section, by dragging an 
audio file from the Finder to GarageBand.
 
2. Choose Control➪Ducking from the menu. 
 
 A pair of arrows appears in the audio controls for each track.
 
3. Click the top triangle for the lead tracks, where the volume should 
not be automatically adjusted, and click the bottom triangle to enable 
ducking on your bed music track. (See Figure 7-7.)
 
 Now when your primary track(s) have audio on them, the bed music 
automatically fades down to roughly –14 dB and pops back up to 0 
during gaps.
 
Figure 7-7:

137
 Chapter 7: Cleanup, Podcast Aisle 7!
You may find that the ducker isn’t responding rapidly enough. For example, 
you don’t feel your bed music is coming back up quickly enough after you’re 
done talking. If you have GarageBand ’08, you can adjust the sensitivity of the 
ducker by following these steps:
 
1. Choose Track➪Show Track Info.
 
2. When the Track Info pane appears, click Master Track and then click 
the Details triangle at the bottom.
 
3. Choose a preset from its preset menu or click its Edit button (the little 
pencil) to fine-tune things with the sliders.
 
So the likely question in your mind right now is “Why would I want to set the 
volume levels manually instead of automatic ducking?” As with anything, 
manual control affords the ability to be in complete control of your volume 
levels — at the trade off of increased effort. If you plan on using bed music, 
our recommendation is to try the auto-ducking feature and see whether it 
meets your needs. If not, work with the manual audio controls.
Setting volume levels with Audacity
If you’re using Audacity, you can set volume levels by following these steps:
 
 
1. Click the Selection tool to activate it and then click at the ten-second 
mark of your timeline, placing an edit line there.
 
 
2. Click the Time Shift Tool button on the toolbar, shown in the margin.
 
 The Time Shift tool takes an entire track of content and places it else-
where along the project’s timeline.
 
3. Click and drag your audio to the edit line you created in Step 1.
 
4. Choose File➪Import➪Audio and browse for the music file that you 
want to use as bed music. Then select the file and click Open to begin 
the import process.
 
 
Although you can import MP3 files directly into Audacity when you’re 
editing — be it film, photo, or audio — you shouldn’t be working with 
compressed files. (It’s just too easy to lose a bit too much quality along 
the way.) You can use them in Audacity, but do so at your own risk.
 
 
5. Click the Envelope Tool button on the toolbar.
 
 The Envelope Tool allows you to dynamically control the audio levels 
over a timeline. Clicking at the beginning of the audio track establishes 
the first volume setting, and the second click (at the ten-second mark) 
establishes the new volume level.

6. Select the track of recently imported music by clicking its name on the 
left side of the project window.
 
7. Click at the beginning of the music and then click at the point where 
your podcast begins (the ten-second mark).
 
 Two sets of points appear in your track of music.
 
8. Click and drag the second set of points to the 0.5 dB mark.
 
 You now have a fade-down of the music that maintains its subdued 
volume behind the voiceover.
 
9. Activate the Selection tool, click at the beginning of the timeline, and 
then click Play to review your podcast.
 
 Now you can change the levels as needed to set the music at a level you 
think works best.
Making an Entrance: Intros
Now that your podcast has a solid lead-in and a cue to fade out — or you 
have a loop throughout your podcast that sets a tone — your podcast is 
beginning to solidify. It’s establishing an identity for itself; be proud of the 
way this podcast of yours is maturing.
But when the microphone comes on, do you always know what those first 
words are going to be? For some listeners, you’re about to make a first 
impression. What do you want that first impression to be? Are you looking 
for something spontaneous every time, or do you want to create a familiar 
greeting that makes listeners feel like old friends? Your chance to make a first 
impression with your listeners is with an intro, which is the first thing the 
listener hears, be it with a bit of theme music or a word or two about you and 
your show.
It’s up to you, but think about how strong a first impression and a cool intro 
can make. Consider the ten simple words that became the signature introduc-
tions for George Lucas’ Star Wars saga:
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away . . .
This intro leaves an unforgettable first impression. But even if you’re not 
vying to be the next George Lucas, the first impression is always important. 
No matter who you are, this is a moment that can either establish you as a 
personality (and a podcast) that people will enjoy and anxiously await from 
episode to episode, or it will make winning over audiences a little harder. 
You want the first impression to be fascinating, lasting . . . and positive.

139
 Chapter 7: Cleanup, Podcast Aisle 7!
Consistent, iconic intros can serve as a polished touch of preparation or a 
subtle flair of professionalism. You’re announcing to your audience that the 
show is on the launchpad, you’re ready, and the journey is about to begin.
Theme music
How about a catchy theme? Just as television and motion picture themes 
establish a thumbprint for themselves in pop culture, an opening theme — be 
it a favorite song (used with permission!) or an original composition — can be 
just the right intro for your podcast. Perhaps you have a friend in the wide 
world of podcasting who can assist with audio production. Ask — you might 
be surprised how willing other podcasters are to assist. Earlier-mentioned 
software applications such as GarageBand, CakeWalk, Soundtrack, and 
Audition all offer royalty-free loops that can be easily edited into your own 
podcast intro. If you have a little cash in the coffers, check out Digital Juice 
(www.digitaljuice.com) for a large collection of royalty-free jingles and 
sound effects for around $50 per CD set.
 
Royalty free means you’re free to use the audio clip over and over without 
paying a license fee. You may still need to purchase the audio clips such as 
Digital Juice. In the case of GarageBand, the loops and clips are included in the 
price of the package with additional add-on libraries, or JamPacks, available 
for $99 each.
Intro greeting
Some podcasters use quick, snappy intro greetings for their podcasts. For 
example, Adam Christianson opens every show with a heavy rock riff and the 
salutation “Hey, Mac Geeks, it’s time for the MacCast, the show for Mac Geeks 
by Mac Geeks . . .” that kicks off his podcast, The MacCast (www.maccast.
com). Others create an imaginative setting; for Slice of SciFi (http://sli
ceofscifi.com), the crew has a more complex intro with music, sound 
effects, and other audio clips. Whether elaborately produced or just a simple 
welcome, a consistent greeting serves to bring listeners into your corner of 
the podosphere.
The elements you’re looking for in a spoken introduction are
 
 The show’s name.
 
 The name(s) of the host(s).
 
 Location of the podcast.

140
Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 
 
 A tagline that identifies your show. One of the more interesting tag lines, 
(and show titles), is Jimmy Jett’s Podcast About Nothing (www.jimmyjett.
com).
Sit down and brainstorm a few ideas on how to introduce your particular 
podcast. For example, try these approaches on for size:
 
 “Good morning, Planet Earth! You’re listening to My Corner: A Slice of 
Cyberspace, and I’m your host, Tee Morris.”
 
 “From Washington, D.C., welcome to My Corner: A Slice of Cyberspace.”
 
 “With a perspective on politics, technology, and life in general, it’s Tee 
Morris with the My Corner podcast.”
As you see in these examples, you can mix and match the elements to drop 
into an intro. Come up with what feels right for you and your podcast, and 
stick with it. After you’ve put together your greeting, you can either keep it 
pre-recorded and use it as a drop-in (an isolated audio clip that you can use 
repeatedly, either from podcast to podcast, or within a podcast) at the intro-
duction of your podcast, or you can script it and record it with each session. 
Whatever method you choose, a greeting is another way of bringing your 
audience into your 20 to 30 minutes (or five minutes to an hour and a half) of 
time on someone’s MP3 player.
Exit, Stage Left: Outros
Now that you have reached the end of your message or the time limit you 
have set yourself for a podcast, what do you do? Do you just say “Thanks, 
everyone, see you next time . . .” or just a basic “Bye,” and then it’s over? Or 
do you want to go out with a bit of fanfare? Whatever you decide, an outro 
is much like an intro — as simple or elaborate as you want to make it. Your 
outro is your final word, closing statement, and grand finale (at least for this 
podcast).
In practical terms, putting together an outro is no different from putting 
together an intro — same approach, only you’re doing it at the end. So review 
the earlier suggestions for intros and consider what seems a likely direction 
for an outro.
Some podcasters figure there’s little more to think about for an outro than 
what to say and how to present it. Sure, you could keep it simple — say “Bye” 
and switch off, no fuss, no script, just do it, done, and then upload. But other 
podcasters see the outro as more of an art form. Before taking a shortcut 
to the end, check out the following sections for some ways to spiff up your 
outro.

141
 Chapter 7: Cleanup, Podcast Aisle 7!
Leave the audience wanting more
Continuing your podcast to its final moments is a gutsy, confident, and excit-
ing outro, carrying your audience all the way to the final second. This is one 
of the toughest ways to end a podcast, but if it’s done right, it can only make 
your podcast better.
For example, Jimmy Jett’s Podcast About Nothing takes a cue dating back 
to “Smokey and the Bandit” movies with outtakes at the end of each show. 
While Jimmy’s entire show has a clean, professional polish to it, he keeps 
you listening to the end to find out what really happened when he tried to 
produce those segments. Just when you think the show is over with his sign 
off “Bye-bye, my friend,” an announcer hits you saying “. . . and now, the out-
takes,” with all the bloopers Jimmy made along the way. The content contin-
ues right up to the end.
Catch phrase sign off
Your outro can be the final word from the host, and it should be your bow 
during the curtain call. A signature farewell is a classy way of saying “This 
podcast is a wrap. Thanks for listening.”
For example, throughout the years that journalist Walter Cronkite reported 
the news to America, he always ended with the words, “And that’s the way 
it is . . .” followed by the date. On Technorama, Chuck and Kreg have taken a 
similar approach with their signature sign off starting with Chuck saying “And 
until next time, a binary high five.” To which Kreg always responds “1–0–1.” 
It has become such a well known piece of the show that listeners writing or 
calling to leave feedback close their pieces with the same tag.
 
If you can’t think of anything overly clever, a consistent exit such as “This has 
been my podcast. Thanks for listening . . .” works too.
Credits roll
Another possibility for your outro could be a scripted list of credits: Web 
sites where past shows can be downloaded, resources can be endorsed, and 
special thanks can be given to various supporters of your podcast.
 
When listing credits, take care that your list of thank-yous and acknowledg-
ments doesn’t ramble on for too long after every podcast. Some podcasters 
reserve a full list of end credits for special podcasts, such as an “end-of-the-
season” or even “final” episode. By and large, a minute can serve as a good 
length for ending credits — plenty of time to mention relevant Web sites, tuck 

142
Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 
in the obligatory “Tune in next week . . .” statement, and ask for a vote of sup-
port on your favorite podcast directory.
Coming soon to an MP3 player near you
Just as television shows drops teasers of what will be coming up next week, 
podcasters can also give quick hints as to what is planned for future pod-
casts. Mark Jeffrey’s The Pocket and The Pendant (http://pocketandpendant.
com) and Scott Sigler’s EarthCore (http://scottsigler.net) episodes 
had already been pre-recorded for the intent of podcasting. This gave both 
authors a terrific advantage to edit together montages of audio clips and 
even record a quick synopsis of what was to come in the next 
episode.
Previews for future podcasts tend to be difficult to plan — mainly because of 
the spontaneous nature of podcasting that the medium prides itself on. Many 
podcasters have no idea what will be on the agenda for their next show until 
the day or even a few hours before recording, and then there are other pod-
casts that start up the audio equipment and speak with no prep time for their 
latest installment. However, for those podcasts that can provide glimpses of 
things to come, this kind of outro serves as a commitment to the audience 
that there will be more content coming through the RSS feed and that pro-
gramming is being planned for future installments.
As mentioned with intros, your outro can use one of these approaches or 
combine them. Find what best fits your podcast and stick with it. The more 
consistency your podcast can follow, the more professional it sounds — 
spontaneous but focused, right?

 Preparing your Windows Movie Maker video for podcasting
I
n its first year, podcasting established itself as an exciting audio option. 
It was truly “The People’s Radio” for your computer, promising a fresh 
alternative to cookie-cutter corporate radio. A few potential podcasters took 
a closer look at the way RSS 2.0 worked and thought, “Wait a second — if 
we can do this with audio, what about video?” So a few brave podcasters 
decided to put moving pictures to their podcasts; and while people still 
search for “just the right term” (vidcast, vodcast, vodblog, and so on) video 
podcasting came to be and continues to grow.
Once upon a time, professional-quality video production (such as editing, 
post-production effects, and DVD authoring) on a consumer market was 
either a pipe dream or a hobbyist’s major investment. With the advance-
ments in professional-grade cameras, advancements in home computing 
systems, and the ease of video-editing software, producing broadcast-quality 
video is not only affordable, it’s expected. Add to this the popularity of ser-
vices like YouTube (http://youtube.com) and LuluTV (http://lulu.
tv), and creative minds both in the amateur and professional circles are now 
looking at video podcasting as an alternative to distribution.
We barely scratch the surface of video podcasting in this chapter. To go 
above and beyond, pick up your copy of Expert Podcasting Practices For 
Dummies, which goes into great detail on post-production with audio, post-
production with video, and working with the professional applications like 
Final Cut and Premiere.

Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 
When to Go Video
While Evo and Chuck have only dipped their toes in working with video, Tee 
sports the longest track record with editing video, both in a linear (the tradi-
tional two video decks tied together to one central deck with a control board 
offering basic post production effects) and a nonlinear (all on a computer, in 
a digital format) method. Even in those early Flintstones-esque days of digital 
video, Tee thought this whole process very cool. Today, with terabyte drives, 
gigahertz processors, and 8-core computers, a lot of things have changed, 
and Tee’s opinion has changed as well. He now finds editing video on his Mac 
very, very cool.
Video production is also not easy. Some of the downfalls to video podcasting are
 
 A learning curve: Despite what the commercials for Macs, Dells, and HP 
computers insinuate, editing video is not a push-button technology. A lot 
goes into video, even on the most basic of levels; with video podcasts like 
Rocketboom (www.rocketboom.com), Calls for Cthulhu (www.calls
forcthulhu.com), and The Onion News (www.theonion.com), the bar 
to run with the big boys and girls of video podcasting is pretty high.
 
 More production time: With video, you have to contend with more than 
just ambient noise. Now you need to consider lighting, camera angles, 
wardrobe, make-up, and so on. Podcasting audio can prove daunting in 
its production needs, but video is a step up and demands a great deal of 
time and attention.
So with all these daunting challenges, why go video with your podcast? Here 
are some good reasons to step up to video podcasting:
 
 Your message needs more than sound to get across to your audience. 
If you’re putting together a show for educational or training purposes, 
you may want to feature diagrams or procedures that require visual 
aids. With video, you now can appeal to listeners on a visual as well as 
an aural level. 
 
 You want a captive audience. The ability or temptation to multitask is 
removed as your subscribers are now applying the visual senses, taking 
advantage of the video features in iTunes, iPhones, and iPods. They 
can’t drive a vehicle, cook a meal, or walk Fluffykins at the same time 
that they watch your video podcast, so you gain greater audience focus.
 
 You want to create your definitive vision. In travel podcasts (also 
known as sound-seeing tours), where the sounds of a marketplace pro-
vide the host with a background, or beer tastings (also called pubcasts, 
barcasts, or beercasts) where the flavor of a local bar filters into the 
show, or podcast novels (also called podiobooks) where a few sound 
effects set the scene, the listener’s imagination fills in the blanks on 

145
 Chapter 8: Roll Camera: Video Podcasting
what is happening around the podcaster. Now, the subscriber can see 
and (virtually) experience walking through the marketplace in Athens, 
take in the sights and sounds of a Western Yorkshire pub, or see the 
characters as the author intended them to be seen, in the settings he or 
she imagined. 
Enhanced podcasting: The happy medium
If you’re an audio podcaster who’s curious 
about going video but you aren’t quite ready 
to make the jump, take a look at the rarely 
employed but extremely versatile format of 
enhanced podcasting. Enhanced podcasting 
gives producers the ability to drop into their 
podcasts chapter markers, images, and even 
URLs. On iTunes, the Album Artwork window 
provides visual aids for what the show hosts 
are talking about. Although not as visually 
demanding as video (you can still listen to the 
audio without following the images), enhanced 
podcasts are a terrific way to grab the atten-
tion of your audience: Keynote and PowerPoint 
presentations can now be podcast as they are 
presented, podcasters can now give you direct 
access to resources cited, and chapter markers 
can now help listeners navigate to their topic of 
choice. With enhanced podcasting, the experi-
ence becomes more interactive.
So what’s the catch? Enhanced podcasts use 
the AAC format. These M4A files play back only 
in iTunes and QuickTime and can go portable 
only on iPods. This can limit your audience, so 
many enhanced podcasters produce two feeds, 
essentially doubling their workloads. Also, at the 
time of writing this edition, the best applications 
for creating enhanced podcasts are GarageBand 
and Soundtrack Pro 2 (both from Apple) and also 
Lemonz Dream’s Podcast Factory. These appli-
cations run only on Mac OS. 
Still, with a bit of thought, planning, and 
panache, an enhanced podcast can bring a 
lot to your audience. Podcasting For Dummies: 
Season Two, the companion podcast for this 
book, is an enhanced podcast. The enhanced 
version of MacCast (www.maccast.com) 
gives links and images of various product 
reviews and new items, providing an interac-
tion with tech hungry audiences. Stephen 
Fry’s Podgrams (www.stephenfry.com/
podcasts) gives you maps, images, and even 
a potential look at “branding” in a podcast about 
the British actor Stephen Fry’s travels across 
England and various points of the world. To find

it offers, check out Expert Podcasting Practices

The Price of Pretty Pictures
You can create video podcasts with any video-editing application running on 
either Mac or Windows. You can use Apple iMovie, Windows Movie Maker, 
Apple Final Cut Pro, or Adobe Premiere Pro to create your episode. When it’s 
time to export your movie out of your video-editing software, many of these 
applications use a format optimized for podcasting. If you’re using older 
video editors, you can invest into QuickTime Pro (a $30 upgrade available 
from www.quicktime.com), which can export a video file to a format spe-
cific for the iPod (which also includes iTunes).
Of course, you could do the compression by hand, but the question here is 
“Why?” Take advantage of the shortcuts because in this section, we take a 
closer look at other considerations concerning video podcasting.
Sorry, we don’t do windows 
(Media Player)
So if video is so cool, so easy, and (while demanding) so powerful, why isn’t 
everyone doing video podcasts? For one thing, the most common video 
podcast format (.m4v) plays only on iTunes or QuickTime for the desktop 
computer and in iPod portable players (iPod, iPod Touch, iPhone, and so 
on). You could release your podcast in a variety of multiple formats such as 
MPEG, MOV, and AVI. MOV and AVI files, though, are huge in comparison 
to the M4V counterpart. As far as MPEG compression, the format come in 
various versions (MPEG1, MPEG2, and so on). You can export to multiple for-
mats, but now comes the added responsibility of managing numerous feeds, 
tracking which feed people are subscribing to, and exporting for playback in 
specific devices. M4V (which uses the H.264 codec in podcasting) performs 
best in QuickTime and iTunes and is the simplest format to export in (as illus-
trated later in this chapter). M4V doesn’t perform at all in Windows Media 
Player. 

147
 Chapter 8: Roll Camera: Video Podcasting
That file is how big?!
Provided you follow our Cheat Sheet’s compression specs, the standard 
audio podcast of roughly 80MB will cover anywhere from 90 minutes to two 
hours — of audio. When compared with other podcasts that are far more eco-
nomical in their running times, 80MB is huge.
To video, this is chump change.
80MB might earn you 15 minutes of video time, and that depends on whether 
you go with the M4V format or a flavor of MPEG. When video podcasting first 
came to the hearts and minds of audio podcasters, it was a bit of a shock 
when they tried to make their 20-to-30 minute audio into a video equivalent. 
“How do I get my file size smaller?” podcasters asked on various discussion 
boards. Although the reply might have come across as snarky, it was the only 
available answer: “Make a shorter podcast.” If you have a two-hour podcast 
and are planning to compress your video down to the same size (or there-
abouts) as that 80MB MP3, well . . . that just won’t happen.
 
For standard 720 ¥ 480 digital-video resolution that you will probably import 
into iMovie or Windows Movie Maker, the iPod compression setting takes one 
minute of video and squeezes it down to 5MB. Take your epsiode’s running 
time and multiply it by five to get an approximate size before compression. 
Burn, bandwidth, burn!
Bandwidth is the factor most new podcasters tend to gloss over. That can 
prove to be costly, especially if your podcast is 50MB or higher per down-
load. If you garner 1,000 listeners, for example, you’ve gone through 5GB 
simply for that file transfer. If these 1,000 listeners are going through your 
archives, your bandwidth needs to increase exponentially.
Now, suppose you decide to produce a video podcast with some length — 
and even dare to explore the possibilities of high-definition video podcasting. 
What happens? Your first episode is 100MB — a very hefty download.
It’s even heftier if your podcast is a runaway success. If you have 2,000 sub-
scribers in your first week, you have burned through 200GB of your monthly 
bandwidth. What about the weeks — and the listeners — to come? What does 
your webhost offer, and can it handle this kind of traffic for your podcast? 
When you’re looking at video podcasting, consider the running time and file 
size of your episodes, and then look at your Web host’s bandwidth.

Lock and Load (Your Camera): Planning 
Your Shooting Schedule
Nonlinear (that is, digital) video applications like iMovie and Movie Maker 
have dramatically simplified the process of editing video. However, the com-
mercials aren’t quite accurate when describing the ability to make a movie 
as quick and easy. It’s still far from a push-button technology. We’ve been 
talking about the various demands for your video podcast, but perhaps the 
greatest demand of them all is time. 
Here’s how the process works:
 
1. Set up the camera, rehearse your podcast (if applicable), and then make 
time to shoot from that angle. 
 
2. Reset for the same shot but from a different angle. Shoot your footage 
from the new angle.
 
3. Review your video footage and capture (get the video off the miniDV cas-
sette or your DVD and into the video editor) it onto your computer. 
 
4. Edit your footage together, remove your mistakes, continuity errors, and 
small trips and tumbles, and make the whole project appear seamless 
and fluid.
 
5. After all the editing, post-production, and reviewing is done, you must 
render the video, outputting this production in the desired format — be 
it podcasting, full-screen video, or DVD. 
Depending on the power of your computer’s processors, the length of your 
video, and what format you’re outputting it to, this could take anywhere from 
a few minutes to a few hours to a full eight-to-nine-hour work day. 
The allure of video is intense — and don’t mistake us for a moment, we love 
it! — but make sure you give yourself time: time to shoot, time to edit, time to 
review, and time to render. 
 
Make that first episode and then give a second episode a shot. Go for three, 
if you can. Once you have those episodes edited and ready to go, you can 
decide on what kind of posting schedule you want your podcast to follow.
iTarantino: Creating with iMovie
If you’ve just purchased a new Macintosh computer or picked up the most 
recent incarnation of iLife, you have iMovie (www.apple.com/ilife/
imovie) within reach. This unassuming application grants you the ability to 

149
 Chapter 8: Roll Camera: Video Podcasting
edit video by dragging and dropping clips where you want them on your proj-
ect’s timeline.
Capturing video with iMovie
You need to get the video off the camera or media it is currently recorded 
on (DVD, cassette, and so on) and into your computer. This process is called 
capturing. The video is played back and then captured into the video-editing 
application in a format that the program can understand. 
We’re going to make the bold assumption that you have a miniDV camera or 
some other DV playback device that has your video footage ready for captur-
ing. Here’s how you get your video off the camera and into your computer for 
editing:
 
1. Launch iMovie.
 
2. From the intro window, select Create a New Project from the offered 
menu options.
 
3. From the introduction window, change the default title to whatever 
you want to name your project.
 
 By default, your selected video format will be DV, which is a basic video 
format common with many consumer miniDV cameras. Stick with the 
default.
 
4. Connect your video camera to your computer and set it to playback 
mode.
 
 iMovie detects the camera automatically. If it doesn’t, you won’t have 
any options available for capturing footage. If iMovie doesn’t detect your 
camera, check your camera to make certain it’s in playback mode, has 
power, and is plugged into your computer.
 
5. Click the Import button, and iMovie automatically captures what’s on 
your miniDV tape or miniDV tape deck. 
 
 Your clip is imported into the Clips Pane, the area on the right in iMovie, 
as shown in Figure 8-1.
 
 If you have an older version of iMovie, your clips are imported by seg-
ments. If you have iMovie HD, choose iMovie HD➪Preferences and select 
whether to import clips either by scene breaks (where the camera turns 
on and off) or by segments with running time designated by you.
 
 
The version of iMovie Tee is using on his Mac is iMovie HD. There is a 
more recent version available now — iMovie ’08, part of iLife ’08. Some 
of the interface may have changed between versions, but the steps 
should be easily applied to either version.

6. After capturing the clips on your camera, in the Clips Pane, double-
click the name of the first clip labeled Clip 01.
 
 The Clip Info dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 8-2.
 
7. Name the clip something easier to identify it by.
 
 For example, Wide Angle A or Close-Up: Guest Name.
 
 
Custom-naming clips allows you to organize your clips, which helps you 
put your podcast together.

Pane.
 
 
9. When your tape is concluded, move the switch currently on Edit 
(Scissors) back to Capture (Camera) mode. Then repeat Steps 4 through 
8 for any remaining miniDV tapes you need to capture.
 
If your video is on your computer as a data file (MOV, M4V, MPEG, and so on), 
choose File➪Import (or press Shift+Ô+I) to import your clips into the Clips 
Pane.
A walk in the park on a clear Spring day, don’t you think? This process is 
known as logging, where you go through your video (be it one cassette or 
many) and organize your clips as needed.
Creating your episode with iMovie
When you have your video imported and organized in iMovie, you’re ready to 
edit it into a video podcast. Follow these steps:
 
 
1. Switch iMovie from Capture to Edit mode by moving the switch to the 
right (to the scissors icon).
 
 
Or simply select a clip in the Clips Pane. iMovie automatically switches 
from Camera to Edit mode.
 
2. Click and drag your opening clip from the Clips Pane into the 
Timeline along the bottom of the iMovie interface.
 
 The Timeline in your iMovie interface is where you assemble and edit 
your clips. Simply drag and drop clips in the order you want them to 
appear. By default, you’re viewing video in the Timeline as clips (View 
Clip mode).
 
3. Repeat Step 2 for the remaining clips in your Clips Pane until you 
have your clips in the order you want. See Figure 8-3.
 
 What you have now is commonly referred to as a rough cut. This is your 
video podcast without transitions, set volume level, or any detailed edit-
ing. It gives you an idea of what the video will look like when it’s done.
 
 The amount of editing your video podcast needs depends on the amount of 
footage you shoot and how detailed you want your production to be. When 
you have a rough cut, here are some editing tricks to try:
 
 View your video by running time. Click the icon of the clock in the 
iMovie interface. This switches your Timeline mode from viewing video 
as individual clips to viewing video by running time. When you edit 
video in this mode (View Duration mode), you can adjust the timing and 
duration of individual clips accordingly. 

152
Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 
 
 Navigate throughout your video. A scroll bar across the bottom of the 
Timeline will allow you to move from the beginning to the end of clips, 
going back and forth as needed. 
 
 Zoom in and out. Underneath the scroll bar is a Zoom slider that allows 
you to view the project from beginning to end, or zoom in on specific 
edit points. 
 
 Scrub through video. With your playhead, you can scrub through the 
video. Scrubbing is the process of viewing audio at a user-designated 
speed. You scan through segments, find what you’re looking for, and 
make edits. With the left and right arrows, you can also advance through 
a clip frame by frame.
 
 Make a cut. Move your playhead in the Timeline to where you want to 
make an edit. Choose Edit➪Split Video Clip at Playhead (or press Ô+T). 
 
 Delete a segment. Click the segment you want to remove and press 
Delete to remove the unwanted video. 
 
 Create a cutaway. Sometimes, you want video that breaks the monotony 
of a single shot, more commonly known as a cutaway. 
 
 Assemble you episode. Using either View Clip or View Duration mode, 
assemble your episode. 
 
 Drop in a transition. Click the Editing tab and then the Transitions tab. 
A transition is a cool way to get from one clip to the next (a crossfade, 
wipe, or some interesting bridge), unlike a cutaway or jump cut where 
one video source switches to another. Click and drag the desired transi-
tion between two clips to apply it.
 
 
To see a preview of a transition, simply click it.

 Place a title at the beginning of your podcast. Click the opening clip, 
click the Editing tab, and then click the Titles tab in the iMovie interface. 
With the iMovie Title Interface, design your opening title and then click 
the Add button (see Figure 8-4). The Titles Pane is the feature of iMovie 
where you can place animated or static text at the beginning, middle, or 
end of your movie, giving your podcast a polished Hollywood touch.
 
 
Click an offered title template, and iMovie renders a preview of that title.
 
 You can either have the title appear over one of your video clips or over 
black video by selecting or deselecting the Over Black feature. 
 
 iMovie renders the title and then incorporates it into the project. If your 
title needs to change, return to the clip marked with the Title icon (a 
small T icon next to its duration), edit the title, and click the Update 
button.

Congratulations, you have just edited and output your first video podcast. 
It’s just that easy! With upgrades to Leopard and various incarnations of 
iMovie, your interface and your results may vary. You may also find iMovie 
has a lot of features we haven’t even touched. That’s because we’re keeping 
it quick and easy, fast and furious, and above all, to the basics. If you want to 
find out more about editing with iMovie, there are many books on the market 
that will take you deeper into the power of this application. You may also 
pick up a few cool tips from Videoblogging For Dummies, Digital Video For

DV on the PC: Podcasting with 
Windows Movie Maker
Attempting to keep up with iMovie is its Microsoft equivalent, Windows 
Movie Maker (www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/moviemaker). 
This application comes with your Windows OS and offers nonlinear editing 
goodness similar to what iMovie offers its Mac users.
Capturing video with Movie Maker
Getting your footage from your camera or hard drive to Windows Movie 
Maker differs slightly from what you have to do with iMovie. You need to go 
through a setup process so Movie Maker knows what kind of video you want 
to make:
 
1. Make sure your video camera or DV playback device is connected to 
your PC. Then launch Windows Movie Maker. 
 
2. Under the Movie Task window on the left side, click the Capture from 
Video Device option.
 
3. Give a name for your Collection — your video — and a destination 
folder for your captured footage. Then click the Next button.
 
 The Video Settings page of the wizard appears.
 
4. Select one of the three offered codecs from Windows Movie Maker, as 
shown in Figure 8-6. 
 
 Windows Movie Maker gives you an approximation of how much data is 
needed to capture and save your video in the desired format. 
 
5. Click the Next button.
 
 Under Other Settings, a variety of optional formats are offered. We rec-
ommend sticking with one of the first two offered: 
 
• Best Quality for Playback on My Computer: Your video is captured at 
320 x 240 pixels, which is less than half of full-screen video (720 x 
480). This will limit the output options for your project. 
 
• DV-AVI for Full Screen: Choose this option if you want to be able 
to output to DVD or show off your video podcasts to people who 
aren’t quite up to speed with podcasting.

Figure 8-6: 
Before cap-
turing video, 
Windows 
Movie 
Maker 
needs to 
know what 
kind of proj-
ect it’ll be 
creating. 
 
 
 
Because you’re video podcasting, it would seem common sense to select 
the recommended Best Quality for Playback on My Computer option, 
but before jumping to that option, consider the DV-AVI option. 
 
6. Decide on how you want to capture your clips and make sure you 
have the Preview Clips while Capturing option selected.
 
7. In the final window for capturing video, click the Play button under-
neath the Preview window to play the video in your camera or DV 
device. 
 
8. Use the Fast Forward and Rewind buttons to visually search (also 
called jog) through the footage to find what you want. Click Start 
Capture to begin capturing a clip. (See Figure 8-7.)
 
9. Click Stop Capture when the clip is captured.
 
10. Repeat Steps 7 through 9 for all clips on this DV cassette (also referred 
to as a reel) and then eject the reel. Insert any additional reels and 
capture your footage.
 
 This is known as logging in the video-editing industry. You go through 
your footage (be it one reel or numerous ones) and capture what is 
needed for your podcast.
 
11. When your footage is logged and captured, click the Finish button.
 
12. Go through your clips and custom name them something easier to 
identify (such as Wide Angle A or Close-Up: Guest Name) by double-
clicking the clip’s default names.
 
 Custom-naming makes it easier to organize your clips when you’re ready 
to edit your podcast together.

Windows Movie Maker stores your video in Collections and when you repeat 
Steps 2 through 10, you create a new collection that can be accessed for a 
single project. The actual editing process in Windows Movie Maker is similar 
to iMovie, and if you want to find out more about how this PC option works 
(and maybe solve a few odd obstacles it might throw your way), refer to the 
Windows Movie Maker Web site on Microsoft.com or pick up a copy of Digital 
Video For Dummies, 4th Edition.
Creating a video podcast with Movie 
Maker and QuickTime Pro
When you work your way through the Windows Movie Maker video-editing 
process, you have an AVI or MPEG file ready to go for playback on your 
computer. Not for podcasting. Although Microsoft is doing its best to keep 
up with the medium, it still has yet to include a one-click option in Windows 
Movie Maker for podcasting.
Fortunately, Apple has an option that plays on Windows, and it costs approx-
imately $30. It’s QuickTime Pro (www.quicktime.com), and unlike the free 
player you can download, QuickTime Pro comes with a handy Export feature 
that makes the final steps for your video podcast on a PC a piece of cake.
 
1. After reviewing your movie in Movie Maker, go under the Movie Task 
window on the left side and click the Save to My Computer option 
under Finish Movie.

158
Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 
 
 Make sure you know where on your computer Windows Movie Maker is 
saving the final file.
 
2. In the offered pane, select from the list of formats DV-AVI and then click 
the Next button. Then in the final window, click the Finish button.
 
 Exporting your movie may take some time, so walk away from the com-
puter and give yourself a well-earned break.
 
3. Close Windows Movie Maker and then launch QuickTime Pro.
 
4. Choose File➪Open File or Ctrl+O to open your newly produced 
AVI file.
 
5. Choose File➪Export or Ctrl+E and from the Export drop-down menu, 
select the Movie to iPod option.
 
 Although you may think the Export for Web would be the option to 
choose, Export provides you everything you need for podcasting. By 
selecting Movie to iPod, everything (the codec, screen resolution, audio 
compression) is set.
 
6. Click Save. 
 
 Again, this may take a few minutes as you’re processing the video a 
second time. When the processing is done, you have a M4V file, ready 
for ID3 tagging.
 
7. Open your video in iTunes. Choose File➪Get Info or Ctrl+I. 
 
8. Click the Info tab to add in your ID3 Tags (refer to Figure 8-5). When 
your tags are completed, click OK.
This method takes a few more steps than iMovie, but it’s still very easy, pro-
vided you’re willing to make the investment for QuickTime Pro. When you 
consider the mistakes, the hassles, and the time in reprocessing a file if the 
codecs aren’t exactly right, the simplicity and ability to select a format opti-
mized for iPod makes video podcasting stress-free.
 
Although programs like iMovie and Movie Maker have simplified video editing 
dramatically, as mentioned before, this isn’t a quick-and-easy process. When 
the video is done, it must be processed, and that can take anywhere from a 
few minutes to a few hours. You want to give yourself that time to edit and 
time to process the video you’re creating. Before announcing your video pod-
cast, try to find out how those first few episodes will progress in production 
and finally what the processing time will be for a single episode. You may find 
that a missed mistake can cost you hours. Always preview and then preview 
again before processing.

Screencasting: What’s on your desktop?
Taking both enhanced and video podcasting to 
new applications, screencasting is emerging as 
a new delivery method of an established teach-
ing tool: recording actions of your desktop. 
In a screencast, a podcaster is usually show-
ing off features of a computer application (like 
InDesign, Final Cut Pro, Word, and so on); but 
instead of using screen captures that show 
drop-down menus already deployed or attempt-
ing to film your monitor and sacrificing clarity of 
image, a third-party application like Ambrosia 
Software’s SnapzProX (www.ambrosiasw.
com/utilities/snapzprox) captures all 
actions taken on your desktop in a live record-
ing and then saves them as video footage. Now, 
you can edit your various desktop actions in 
your video editor of choice. Subscribers can 
follow along with the video, cursor, menus, and 
actions all happening clearly and vividly on your 
media player. 
The Digital Media Dude podcast (www.pixel
headsnetwork.com) takes full advantage 
of programs like SnapzProX and Final Cut Pro 
and produces Digital Media Quick Tips, an 
impressive, user-friendly, and downright slick 
screencast that can easily teach you something 
new in your favorite application, be it Mac or 
Windows software. So, if you’re learning an 
application for the first time, are interested in 
learning a new trick on an old favorite, or if 
you have a question about software, check out

 Understanding bitrates and sample rates
 Dissecting ID3 tags: They’re not just for music anymore
Y
ou’ve finished your final edit (and if you think we’re skirting blasphemy 
whenever we use the E word, trust us — creativity sometimes demands 
a sacrifice). At last you’re ready to compress your mondo-super-sized AIFF or 
WAV file down to the format that inspires terror and indigestion in RIAA rep-
resentatives everywhere: MP3.
The MP3 format was designed to reduce the amount of data (via compres-
sion) required for digitized audio while still retaining the quality of the origi-
nal recording. MP3 files are the best way to keep the audio small enough in 
size to make it a quick-and-easy download, and it’s this format that podcast-
ing uses to get content efficiently from podcaster to podcatching client. 
Although creating MP3s is a simple enough process, you do need to make 
some tradeoffs between quality and compression.
A Kilobit of Me, and a Whole Lot 
of You: Understanding Kbps
The compression process begins with proper bitrate settings, measured in 
Kbps (kilobits per second). Bitrate is a method of measuring data transmis-
sion from one point to the next. The higher the Kbps value, the more data 
being transferred between two points. The more data being transferred per 

164
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 
second, the better the quality of information. With each rate of data transfer 
offered by recording applications, you can digitally reproduce the various 
qualities of audio:
 
 8 Kbps, matching the vocal quality of a telephone conversation
 
 32 Kbps, yielding audio quality similar to AM radio
 
 96 Kbps, yielding audio quality similar to FM radio
 
 128 Kbps, matching audio CD quality, and the most common Kbps used 
for MP3 compression of music
 
 192 Kbps, a “Higher Quality” setting Kbps used for MP3 compression of 
music; better audio sound, but higher data files
You aren’t married to this listing of Kbps by any stretch of imagination. 
Figure 9-1 shows that Audacity offers in its Preferences plenty of variations 
from the five common settings. Tweak till you find the Kbps best suited for 
your podcast.
 
Figure 9-1: 
You find 
a wide 
variety of 
bitrates for

ing your 
podcast to 
MP3 with 
Audacity. 
 
It’s a tradeoff: The higher the bitrate, the larger your file size is — but the 
smaller your bitrate, the lower your audio quality is. A good idea is to experi-
ment: Compress your podcast using one bitrate, save it that way, and then 
change your bitrate to something higher (or lower), save it, and play back 
each clip to compare how they load and how they sound. Note any changes 
in sound quality and file size. When you find that happy medium between 
quality and compression, stick with that number for your current and future 
podcasts. If you want to skip experimentation, refer to the suggested compres-
sion settings we have outlined on the included Cheat Sheet at the front of this 
book. 

165
 Chapter 9: Shrink That Puppy and Slap a Label on It
In the following sections, you find out how to change bitrates using Audacity 
and iTunes. If you’re using applications like Audition or Soundtrack, you 
can find out more about what they offer in Expert Podcasting Practices For 
Dummies.
Setting bitrates in Audacity
Changing bitrates in Audacity (version 1.3.3 featured here) is a multistep pro-
cess. The first step is to get your editor all set for creating MP3 files:
 
1. Choose Audacity➪Preferences (Mac OS X) or choose Edit➪Preferences 
(Windows).
 
 The Preferences window opens.
 
2. Choose the File Formats option in the left column (see Figure 9-2).
 
3. Click the Download Free Copy of LAME button in the MP3 Export 
Setup section or point your browser directly to http://audacity.
sourceforge.net/download/lame.
 
Figure 9-2: 
Before set-
ting bitrates 
in Audacity, 
you need to 
download a 
LAME file.
 
 
4. Follow the steps for your OS as outlined on the Web page to download 
the proper files.
 
5. Open the archive file (no need to worry — it’s a safe download) and 
drop it into your Audacity folder.

166
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 
 
6. Return to Audacity and click the Find Library button.
 
7. Choose Applications➪Audacity (Mac) or My Computer➪(Main 
Drive)➪Program Files➪Audacity (Windows) to navigate to the libm-
p3lame file.
 
8. Select the libmp3lame file and click Open.
This step in setting up the LAME Library is a one-time thing. You won’t have 
to repeat this process again unless you move the library to another location. 
Now you’ve come to the point where you set the bitrate. When you have a 
file, follow these steps to export it as an MP3 file:
 
1. Choose File➪Export.
 
2. From the Format menu, select MP3 Files.
 
3. Next to the Format: MP3 Files menu, click Options.
 
 The Specify MP3 Options dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 9-3.
 
Figure 9-3:
Under 
the MP3 
options, 
you can 
set bitrates 
and other 
variables 
for your 
compressed 
audio.
 
 
4. Choose your desired bitrate from the Quality drop-down menu.
 
 If you’re following our recommendation from the Cheat Sheet at the 
front of this book, you would set the bitrate to 128. 
 
 
You can also set up your Bit Rate Mode (Constant) and your Channel 
Mode (Joint Stereo). Constant bitrate ensures the bits are output at a 
steady (constant) rate despite the audio that is being used (including 
silence). Variable bitrate attempts to do a bit of compression — for 
example, the bitrate of a complex music sample would take more space 
than that of the same length of time in a spoken piece with several 
pauses. Although variable length audio sounds good on the surface, it 
can present problems to the listener — actual playback times may not 

167
 Chapter 9: Shrink That Puppy and Slap a Label on It
be correct, causing problems when people pause a long podcast. Joint 
Stereo refers to a technique that saves some space when your record-
ing includes mono channels or tracks. Rather than using the space of a 
stereo track (left and right) to save that information, joint stereo tech-
niques recognize it and save space by only using half the space.
 
5. Click OK to return to the Export window.
 
6. Name your file and then click OK.
After you set the bitrate for this one file, your settings are automatically 
applied to other MP3 files created from this point. Only when you go into the 
Options for MP3 files will you change bitrates.
Changing bitrates in iTunes
It doesn’t matter how your audio files get in to iTunes, be it from Audacity, 
GarageBand, or anywhere else. When you get the files in to iTunes, you can 
easily convert them to a different bitrate, change the file format, or make any 
number of other changes to the file. 
 
You can’t get better quality out of a file by changing it from a lower bitrate to a 
higher bitrate. For example, once a file has been saved at 32 Kbps, converting 
it to 128 Kbps won’t make it sound any better.
To set the bitrate in iTunes, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac OS) or choose Edit➪Preferences 
(Windows).
 
 The Preferences window opens.
 
2. In the Preferences window, choose Advanced➪Importing.
 
3. Choose Custom from the Setting drop-down menu.
 
 The MP3 Encoder dialog box opens.
 
4. Select your desired bitrate from the Stereo Bit Rate drop-down menu 
(shown in Figure 9-4).
 
 You can also choose to make your channels mono, stereo, or Joint 
Stereo and what your sampling rate is. (See the following section for 
more about sampling rates.)
 
5. Click OK.
 
 You return to the Importing tab. The default settings for your MP3 com-
pressions are now in the Details area.

Care for a Sample, Sir? (Audio 
Sample Rates)
When you have a grasp of bitrates, you’re ready to move on to sample rates. 
This may strike you as a tad redundant, particularly when you see the list of 
common audio-sample rates. A strange déjà vu makes you wonder whether 
you’re in the real world or exist merely as part of The Matrix. No biggie — 
sometimes technology is redundant.
As we discuss in the previous section, bitrate is a measurement of how much 
audio data is transferred between two points, such as the computer and your 
headset. The sampling rate is a measurement of audio samples taken from 
a continuous signal (a signal of a varying quantity, defined over a period of 
time) in order to create a discrete signal (a signal made up of samples from a 
continuous signal).
Very simply, the sample rate determines the maximum sound frequency 
that can be reproduced — the value you set is twice the frequency value. 
For example, a 44.1 kHz sample rate can reproduce sounds up to 22.05 kHz, 
which is slightly above the range of human hearing.
The most common audio sampling rates found in MP3 encoders are
 
 8,000 Hz / 8 kHz, telephone-quality recording or lo-fi
 
 22,050 Hz / 22 kHz, equal to AM radio transmission

169
 Chapter 9: Shrink That Puppy and Slap a Label on It
 
 32,000 Hz / 32 kHz, equal to FM radio transmission, minimum sound 
quality on miniDV digital video camcorder
 
 44,100 Hz / 44 kHz, audio-CD quality
 
 48,000 Hz / 48 kHz, digital TV, DVD, films, maximum sound quality on 
miniDV digital video camcorder, and professional-grade audio recording
As with your audio-recording applications, you have a range of bitrates 
available — and you can type in your own custom sampling rates.
 
Using different sample rates in compressed audio files does not affect the file 
size — only the bitrate and duration affect file size. A high sample rate at a low 
bitrate can result in poor signal representation and thus poor quality, but if 
you’re using at least 64 Kbps (bitrate), there’s no good reason to ever use any-
thing except 44.1 kHz as the sample rate. 
Setting the standard for a new kind of book, 
a new kind of podcast
When Evo Terra, Chris Miller, and Tee Morris 
launched Podiobooks.com in October 2005, 
they knew setting an audio standard for cur-
rent and future podcasters would be important. 
The challenge was in establishing standards 
that podcasters could easily follow, but that 
listeners would find comfortable. In the end, 
they looked to The Dragon Page (now known 
as Cover-to-Cover) and its podcast (that, at the 
time, was syndicated on XM Satellite Radio 
and AM/FM radio stations) as a benchmark. 
Now, Podiobooks.com asks for the following 
parameters:
  64 (voice only), 96 (voice with intro/outro 
music), or 128 (voice, music, SFX) Kbps
  44.100 kHz / 44,100 Hz
  Joint Stereo
We haven’t discussed the difference between 
stereo and joint stereo output in this chapter, 
for one reason: It all depends on the method 
you use for recording — and on how you’re 
listening:
  Stereo: By default, many applications that 
export to MP3 also export as Stereo. Stereo 
encoding takes the left and right audio 
separately and divides the selected bitrate 
for each. The drawback to (plain) stereo is 
that the channels are equal width, so a 128 
Kbps encoding of a mono signal is really 
two identical 64 Kbps channels, resulting in 
a 50 percent inefficiency.
  Joint Stereo: With this option, one channel 
carries sound that is identical in both the 
left and right stereo tracks, and the other 
channel carries the difference. Both chan-
nels are only as big as they need to be, so 
if your podcast is mostly mono — with just 
one microphone — you’ll get more out of 
your bitrate than you would with a plain 
stereo file, but without the reliability issues 
of a mono file.
With these parameters in place, Podiobooks.
com ensures consistency between the numer-
ous titles featured. Something to consider 
when setting standards for yourself and your 
podcasts.

170
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 
 
Be careful when using a sample rate other than a multiple of 11. Many Web 
sites use Flash players that don’t work well with other sample rates. Choosing 
a sample rate other than 11.025 kHz, 22.5 kHz, or 44.1 kHz can produce an 
effect similar to the voices of Alvin and the Chipmunks. It might be funny at 
first, but most listeners won’t stick around to hear your entire message.
Changing sample rates in Audacity
Sample rates are located in the Preferences window and extremely simple to 
either change or customize to your podcast’s personal needs. Follow these 
steps to customize sample rates in Audacity:
 
1. Choose Audacity➪Preferences (Mac OS) or File➪Preferences 
(Windows).
 
 The Preferences window appears.
 
2. Click the Quality option in the left column.
 
3. Select your desired bitrate from the Default Sample Rate drop-down 
menu (as shown in Figure 9-5), or enter your own custom sampling 
rate by selecting the Other option and entering a number.
 
 
If you’re entering a custom sampling rate, make sure you enter the rate 
in hertz (Hz) and not kilohertz (kHz). For example, if you decide your 
sampling rate is 44.1 kHz, you have to enter 44100, not 44.
 
4. Click OK.

Changing sample rates in iTunes
iTunes makes the process of changing the sample rate easy — what else 
would you expect from Apple? 
 
To get an idea of what a good sampling rate is, take a look at the podcasts 
your aggregator is pulling down and check the settings. Press Ô+I (Mac) or 
Ctrl+I (Windows) to see the MP3 Summaries. Settings may vary from file to file. 
As you work out the final technical details of your podcast, make sure that one 
of them is the setting that best suits your needs and (of course) your ear.
Follow these steps to change the sample rate in iTunes:
 
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac OS X) or Edit➪Preferences 
(Windows).
 
 The Preferences window appears.
 
2. Choose Advanced➪Importing.
 
3. Select the Custom option from the Settings drop-down menu.
 
 The iTunes MP3 Encoder dialog box opens.
 
4. Select your desired sampling rate from the Sample Rate menu.
 
 
Apple loves to make things easy for its users, and we love that. However, 
Apple sometimes takes out the “I did it MY WAY!” alternative and does 
not allow for custom settings. Here, iTunes keeps this sampling to the 
common settings, so you’re given no leeway.
 
 
Note that iTunes offers your sampling rates at kilohertz (kHz), a more 
common, recognizable presentation of a sampling rate. Again, this is 
Apple looking out for you, keeping it to the basics.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 You return to the Importing tab. The default settings for your MP3 com-
pressions are now visible in the Details area.
ID3 Tags: They’re Not Just 
for Music Anymore
Is it soup yet? Not quite yet. Adding ID3 tags is the final step before you can 
upload the podcast to your Web site. This is the final detail (okay, batch of 
details) that not only tells other podcasters who you are, but also tells listen-
ers what your podcast is all about, and which episode they’re listening to.

172
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 
Because this is a final detail, we find that some podcasters either skip it or 
just don’t care how they tag their podcasts. And there goes any hope for 
their listeners to effectively organize podcasts in a computer’s MP3 player. 
Maybe some podcasters are unaware of where or how to identify their 
podcasts — or want to get their content out to the fans ASAP without taking 
the time to implement these tags.
Whatever the case, we entreat you: Stop the madness, stop the insanity, 
and stop the monkeys. Proclaim your true self for the sake of MP3 players 
everywhere — implement your ID3 tags!
Tell me about yourself: All about ID3 tags
First created in 1996, ID3 tags were designed to be added to audio files in 
order to have the artist, album, and track title displayed in a computer’s MP3 
player when the file is played back. The current ID3 tags now include com-
poser, bitrate, and even genre.
Of course, another question that comes to mind is why would a podcaster 
want to even bother with ID3 tags?
Take a look at a podcast you’re listening to, regardless of whether it’s on 
your portable MP3 player or the player on your desktop. Your podcatch-
ing client probably organizes your various feeds by the date downloaded, 
either with the most recent show at the bottom or at the top of your playlist, 
depending on the player’s preferences. Each individual podcast has an epi-
sode title, an artist, and a podcast title. If your MP3 player and the podcaster 
working with the ID3 tags are particularly savvy, artwork associated with 
your show is also displayed.
Now hop from podcast to podcast in your MP3 player, and you can tell which 
people care — or don’t — about identifying their shows. Some podcasts 
simply use obscure numbers that could be a date, but when you hear two 
episodes of the podcast back to back, you find out the number and the date 
read at the intro of the show (provided there is one) don’t match up (confus-
ing). With ID3 tags in place, you can now look at your portable MP3 player or 
your desktop player to get an idea of what you’re listening to.
When you add ID3 tags to your podcast, you set apart individual podcasts 
from one another, making each one unique but keeping it grouped with your 
podcast show.

173
 Chapter 9: Shrink That Puppy and Slap a Label on It
IDentity crisis: Making ID3 
tags work for podcasting
Some ID3 tags really don’t work for podcasting. Album? Track number? 
Composer? You’re podcasting, not producing music. Your responsibility (as 
a podcaster) is to redefine the following tags we have found useful for the 
podcasting medium:
 
 Name: This should be the name or number of your podcasting episode. 
Examples are Show #19, Episode 3: One of Those Faces, 
BOOK THREE: Chapters 39 & 40.
 
 Artist: This one is pretty self-explanatory. You’re the artist behind this 
podcast, so let people know who you and your group are. Put in your 
name (or at least the pseudonym you’re using as a podcaster) or the 
name of your podcasting team. For example, Philippa Ballantine, 
Earl Newton, and J.C. Hutchins.
 
 Album Artist: Many times left blank, this tag can be a bit tricky for users. 
The Album Artist usually refers to the Artist, but you can also use it to 
refer to the artwork artist, the production studio, or the creator of the 
podcast. Examples are Philippa Ballantine, Stranger RSS LLC, 
and Carrie Seidman (artist for Tee’s MOREVI: Remastered 
artwork, used for the podcast).
 
 Album: In most instances it is the name of your show or your show’s 
Web site. Good examples are Whispers at the Edge, Stranger 
Things – iPod (640 x 480), and 7th Son Podcast Novel 
Trilogy.
 
 Track Number: Purely optional, this ID3 tag allows you to make sure 
your podcasts remain in some kind of sequential order. For podcast nov-
elists, the track numbers coincide with the chapter numbers. If podcasts 
follow a season of multiple episodes, the Track Number coincides with 
the episode in that season. 
 
 Year: The year this podcast episode was produced.
 
 BPM: If you are into staying fit and are listening to or producing a 
workout podcast, you want to fill in this ID3 tag as BPM is for Beats Per 
Minute. BPM is also good if your podcast is a house music-dance mix 
podcast. A good example of a podcast showing off BPM is any one mixed 
by D.J. Steveboy (Podrunner).
 
 Grouping: This tag may remain blank until you’re affiliated with 
a network or distribution hub of some kind. Good examples are 
Podiobooks.com and Farpoint Media.

174
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 
 
 Composer: If Album Artist already sports the name of your cover artist, 
this tag can be used to host the name of your producer. You can enter 
your engineer’s name, or the studio where the show is produced. For 
example, MOREVI’s artist is listed as Tee Morris but the composers 
are Tee Morris & Lisa Lee as the original work was co-written.
 
 Genre: The genre “Podcast” wasn’t offered in drop-down menus of MP3 
creators, but with the growing popularity of the medium, it’s becoming 
more and more common.
 
 If you’re using iTunes and don’t see the Podcast genre, you can manually 
type Podcast into the field.
 
 Comments: Similar to comments you leave in XML, you can give a quick 
two or three lines of show notes for your podcasts. It’s also a great place 
to put in any Creative Commons notices, Web sites for more information 
of the show and its hosts, and special dedications.
 
 Album art: Don’t forget, a big piece of successful podcasting is 
marketing — and a big part of marketing is branding. Your podcast 
logo (or album art) is very important to help set you apart. Although 
not all MP3 players have this feature, don’t discount its importance. 
A large percentage of podcast listeners use iTunes and listen at their 
computers — where the album art may be prominently displayed.
Reminiscent of John Cleese’s aside in a Monty Python robbery sketch (“Adapt, 
and improve. That’s the motto of the Round Table”), we podcasters must 
adapt these ID3 tags to our podcasts to improve how they appear in our play-
ers. On playback, the ID3 tags appear on the listeners’ interfaces, offering a 
quick glance at the content of the podcast (as shown in Figure 9-6).
 
If you’re using iTunes as your podcatching software, be aware that it doesn’t 
use most of the information supplied in ID3 tags. iTunes picks up much of 
the information from the RSS feed and retags your files. We cover more RSS 
details in Chapter 12.
 
A peril in working with ID3 Tags is spelling errors. There is no spell check in 
Audacity, iTunes, or any other tag editor. Because many directories, search 
engines, and players rely on the ID3 tags to organize and properly display 
your show, make sure to double-check the spelling of your show title, names 
of people involved, and any other text you’re putting in place. Also, some edi-
tors like iTunes create “quick fill” databases that help you fill in your File Info 
quickly. This database also includes the misspellings. So when filling in your 
ID3 tags, take your time and check your spelling.

175

erly tagged

Creating and editing ID3 tags in Audacity
Unlike iTunes where you tag individual files after they are created, Audacity 
lets you set up a template for the ID3 tags that gets applied when MP3 files 
are created. To create this template, open Audacity and follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Open Metadata Editor.
 
 The Edit ID3 Tags (for MP3 Exporting) window opens (shown in Figure 
9-7). The ID3v2 option is already selected by default.
 
2. Fill in these fields:
 
• Title: The episode name or number
 
• Artist: The podcaster or name of the podcasting crew
 
• Album: The show’s name or Web site
 
• Track Number: The field is optional, unless numerical order is a pri-
ority in your podcast
 
• Year: The podcast publication’s year
 
3. From the Genres drop-down menu, select the option best suited to 
your podcast.
 
 Audacity on version 1.3.3 doesn’t offer “Podcast” as an option. You can 
always select Speech to indicate this is a non-musical podcast. 
 
 
Click the More button to add a customized tag (refer to Figure 9-7). You 
can also add additional ID3 tags and save your tags as a template.

Figure 9-7: 
The Edit 
ID3 Tags 
(for MP3 
Exporting) 
window in 
Audacity.
 
 
4. Give a brief description of your podcast in the Comments field.
 
 Don’t make your comments a long, detailed description of your pod-
cast’s content. Keep it simple and brief. For example, if the creators of 
The Dragon Page: Cover-to-Cover were to write comments for Show #174, 
it wouldn’t say “On this show we interview Brandon Sanderson about his 
debut novel Elantris and then turn our attention to Steve Alten’s latest 
novel, The Loch.” Instead, the creators would boil down this description 
to “Show 174 — Interviews with Brandon Sanderson and Steve Alten.”
 
5. Click Done.
And that’s it! When Audacity generates your MP3, your show is tagged and 
ready for uploading.
 
Audacity’s ID3 tagger does have its limitations. It cannot, in the version 
covered in this edition, embed artwork into your audio metadata. For that 
extra touch, use an ID3 Tag editor such as ID3X (www.three-2-one.
com/321apps/main/global/index1.htm) or iTunes. 
Creating and editing ID3 tags in iTunes
Using iTunes to tag your files offers more flexibility in customizing genres 
and even incorporating artwork than Audacity does. Apple’s MP3 player, 
encoder, and podcatcher also make adding and editing ID3 tags extremely 
easy. Follow these steps:

177
 Chapter 9: Shrink That Puppy and Slap a Label on It
 
1. Single click your newly created MP3 in iTunes. Choose File➪Get Info 
or press Ô+I (Mac) or Ctrl+I (Windows).
 
 The Info window appears, which gives you a summary of your MP3 file.
 
2. Fill in the following fields:
 
• Title: The episode name or number.
 
• Artist: The name of the podcaster or podcasting crew.
 
• Album Artist: This would be a good spot to give credit to the art-
work artist or show producer.
 
• Album: The show’s name or Web site.
 
• Track Number: This is optional, unless numerical order is a priority 
in your podcast.
 
• Year: The podcast publication’s year.
 
• BPM: If you’re doing an exercise show or a music podcast featuring 
original house mixes, give your Beats Per Minute here. Listeners 
will dig that.
 
• Grouping: If you’re part of a group or network like Farpoint Media, 
or FriendsInTech, give credit here.
 
• Composer: Fill in this field if you have a separate sound engineer, a 
tech guru handling the editing, or if you’re doing the work yourself.
 
• Genre: Select one of the offered genres from the drop-down menu, 
or you can select the genre in the field and type Podcast (or what-
ever genre you want to use to classify your work).
 
 One of the cool bonuses of iTunes is how you can create custom 
genres. Choose File➪Get Info➪Info and enter your own genre here. 
Or go to the song in your iTunes Library and click in the Genre 
column and edit the genre name. When you return to the Info 
window later, you can see your custom genre offered as an option 
on the Genre drop-down menu.
 
• Comments: A brief version of show notes.
 
3. Take a last look at your ID3 tags to make sure everything is spelled 
properly and listed the way you want it, and then click the Artwork tab.
 
4. Drag and drop a desired piece of artwork into the Artwork field or 
click the Add button and, using the window that appears, navigate to 
the artwork you want to have associated with your podcast.
 
 If your logo is in a format that iTunes recognizes, it appears in the 
Artwork field, as shown in Figure 9-8. See the sidebar “Art for art’s sake” 
to make sure your logo has the appropriate format.
 
5. Click OK.

Artwork by Carrie Seidman
Art for art’s sake
Album artwork, commonly seen in many desk-
top MP3 players and now in iPods that display 
photos, is a nice option for podcasters who want 
to brand a podcast with a logo. Mur Lafferty’s 
Parsec-winning I Should Be Writing logo is a 
classic broadcast microphone with a sticky 
note slapped on it and a pencil, sharpened and 
ready for use. Then you have The Onion Radio 
News’s trademark onion with a globe ghosted 
behind it, the stamp of quality journalism at its 
funniest. These are icons associated with their 
shows, and this kind of branding is becoming 
more and more common in podcasting, espe-
cially with the iTunes Store becoming podcast 
friendly.
But what is the best way to make sure iTunes 
(and for that matter, the iTunes Store’s Podcast 
Catalog) recognizes your artwork? Just make 
sure that your logo fits the following param-
eters:
  300 x 300 pixels, both in width and height, 
or 600 x 600 if you anticipate listeners/view-
ers on Apple TV. This isn’t required, just an 
Apple recommendation that has become a 
de facto standard.
  JPEG (.jpg) format
Keep in mind that when you compress your art-
work, overcompression can distort and dete-
riorate its visual quality. Some JPEG settings 
work in numbers 1–10 or 0–100. As a rule, if you 
compress your logos no more than “50”, your 
artwork should retain visual quality.

Chapter 10
Move It on Up (To Your 
Web Server)
In This Chapter
 Moving podcast media files to your Web server
 Naming your files appropriately
 Keeping your FTP space neat and tidy
You’ve managed to figure out what it is you want to say (or show), you’ve 
gone through the trials and tribulations of the editing process (or not), 
and you’ve faithfully employed correct ID3 tagging (nonnegotiable). That’s 
great, but no one is going to hear your contribution to the podcasting world 
until you put your files up on the World Wide Web.
In Chapter 1, we cover the hosting provider selection process. In this 
chapter, we take an extensive look at the mechanics of the process, including 
how to appropriately name and organize your files.
Podcasters have a variety of options when it comes to moving files. Many 
people employ specialized software, and some podcast-specific hosting 
companies make moving your files to the Web as simple as point and click. 
And for the “old school” folks, text-based applications baked right in to the 
operating system might be the preferred method.
Although the methods for uploading files are all different, they all help you 
accomplish the same job: moving files from your personal computer to their 
new home on the World Wide Web.
Adopting an Effective Filenaming 
Convention
In Chapter 9, we talk about the importance of “the little things,” such as ID3 
tags. Equally important is how you decide to name your podcast media files. 

180
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 
In this section, we illustrate the importance, not only to you as a podcaster, 
but also to your listening audience. Although no hard and fast rules for 
naming files exist, following some common conventions allows everyone to 
easily find your podcasts.
A good naming convention of a podcast accomplishes the following:
 
 Easy sequential ordering: Files should not appear at random in your 
directory. They should line up — first, second, third, and so on.
 
 “At a glance” recognition for your listeners: Calling a podcast media 
file my media file doesn’t help very much. Calling it Bob’s Fencing 
Podcast certainly does.
Here’s an example of a well-named podcast media file, if we do say so 
ourselves:
Tech_Ep200_080102.mp3
Although the structure may not be obvious, this filename adheres to both 
rules and even adds one more:
 
 Tech: This abbreviation stands for Technorama, one of the many pod-
casts Chuck produces each week. Starting the filename with these four 
letters organizes the files together in the media folder. For listeners 
who can see only the filename on their MP3 players, they can quickly 
recognize that files starting with these four letters belong to his show.
 
 Ep200: This is Episode 200 of the show. Referring to each show with a 
sequential number is a good idea, giving you and your fans a common 
reference point that is easier than “remember when you did that one 
show with that one guy who said that funny thing? Man that was great!” 
Having the episode number right after the name also ensures that the 
files “stack up” right in the media folder, as well as in your listeners’ MP3 
players. You may want to consider adding some leading zeroes to the 
number so episode 3 (003) comes before 200. Add more zeroes if you 
plan on doing more than 999 shows.
 
 080102: The date Chuck posted the live file. The order he uses here is 
year-month-day. He uses 08 instead of 8 so that dates from October 
(10), November (11), and December (12) don’t intermingle with January 
(which would happen if he used 1 instead of 01). True, in this case the 
files were already sorted by episode number, but you may choose to go 
with the date first.
Between each element, he adds an underscore (_) simply to provide a 
clear distinction of each part for his eye, or anyone else’s eye looking at 
the filename.

181
 Chapter 10: Move It on Up (To Your Web Server)
 
Don’t use any spaces or special characters in your filenames. Stick with A–Z, 
0–9, dashes, and underscores. Slashes (/, \), octothorpes (#), ampersands (&), 
and others can and do cause problems when creating RSS 2.0 files or when 
clients are handling the file. Also, leaving a space in the filename might mess 
up a URL, so if you want to space things out, use underscores or dashes (for 
example, use My_Podcast.mp3 instead of My Podcast.mp3).
The following examples are from well-respected podcasters who all follow 
the guidelines we set forth earlier:
 
 JimmyJett-2007-12-17.mp3
 
 Gmail-063-Security.mp3
 
 VF_Ep060_paidinfull-120407.mp3
 
 DSC-704-2007-12-27.mp3
Note how each of them identifies the name of the podcast and provides a 
sequential way of ordering the files. If you leave out the episode number, 
as in the case of the JimmyJett file, the year of the podcast ahead of month 
and day also ensures that 2007 files are always grouped together. If the 
podcaster had used the month first, as people traditionally think of dates 
in the United States, files would be mixed based on the month they were 
released, regardless of the year.
If thinking about the date that way seems a little too strange for you, do what 
Chuck does — stick a sequential episode number in front of your date, and 
don’t worry about it.
Understanding How FTP Works 
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is the method by which you can transfer files 
from one destination to another over the Internet. You likely transfer 
files every day, from your desktop to your documents folder, from an e-mail 
to your desktop, or even MP3 files from your podcatching client to your 
MP3 player.
Transferring files to and from the Internet isn’t much different, at least on the 
surface and even at any depth necessary for podcasters to ply their trade. 
Lucky for you, specialty software exists to make this process even more 
simple. FTPing files has become as simple as dragging and dropping.
 
Some podcast hosting services, such as Liberated Syndication (http://
libsyn.com) make this simple process even simpler by providing a Web 
form to handle the uploading of podcast files, as described later in the chapter 
in the “Uploading to a Podcast-Specific Host” section. Browser-based systems 
certainly remove the complexity for many, but it doesn’t hurt to understand 

182
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 
the processes outlined in this chapter. Many experienced podcasters need 
more flexibility than the limited functionality a browser-based upload 
process allows.
Regardless of what software, forms, or other assistance you use to move files 
around, the concept of FTP is the same. 
FTP has been around for quite a while now. As such, archaic and seemingly 
nonintuitive names abound from the start — such as the following two 
computer systems involved: 
 
 Local host: The local host is the computer you are sitting in front of 
and initiating the file transfer from. If you’re using a laptop to connect 
to your Web server, your laptop is the local host. If you’re at work and 
logged in from a workstation, your office computer is the local host.
 
 The local directory or local path is the folder on your local host that con-
tains the files you want to transfer. You can change local directories at 
will, but most FTP programs have a default starting place. Feel free to 
move around after that.
 
 Remote host: The remote host is the computer or Web server to which 
you’ve connected. It’s likely the spot where you’re trying to get your 
MP3 files to go so you can start podcasting.
 
 Not surprisingly, the remote host has its own remote directory (the folder 
on the remote system where you drop your files). Again, you can change 
or navigate through remote directories just as you can change the file 
folders on your computer.
Making Your Connection 
with an FTP Application
You need three pieces of information to initiate an FTP connection:
 
 The IP address or hostname of your Web server
 
 Login name
 
 Password
Your hosting company should have provided this information to you. If you 
don’t have it handy, find it. You’re not going any farther without it.
All FTP programs do the same job but have slightly different methods of 
going about it. After you grasp the concept, using just about any FTP 
client is a simple process. Here are the general steps you follow to set up 
a connection in any FTP client:

183
 Chapter 10: Move It on Up (To Your Web Server)
 
1. Launch your FTP client and create a new connection.
 
 Because this step is what FTP clients are designed to do, they usually 
make this process very simple.
 
2. Enter the hostname of your Web server, username, and password.
 
 This step identifies the remote system and shows you have access to 
the files and folders it contains.
 
3. Connect using either a button or a menu option.
 
 Depending on the speed of your connection, the connection is 
established in a matter of seconds.
The following sections show you how to use Cyberduck (http://
cyberduck.ch), a free and handy FTP program for the Macintosh system, 
and FileZilla (http://filezilla-project.org), a similar program 
for the PC. You can find many FTP programs as freeware, shareware, and 
shrink-wrapped software, for every brand of modern day operating system. 
We picked these two for their ease of use and streamlined approach to 
getting the job done, but you can use the FTP program of your choice.
Step by step (or quack by quack) 
setup for Cyberduck
After you download the Cyberduck program from http://cyberduck.ch 
onto your Mac, you can follow these steps to set up an FTP connection in 
Cyberduck:
 
1. Click the New Connection button in the upper-left corner.
 
 The Connect dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10-1.
 
2. In the Server text box, enter the name of your server.
 
 Depending on the requirements of your ISP, this name can be in the 
format of ftp.mydomainname.com or perhaps simply my_domain_
name.com. And of course, you need to be sure and use the name of your 
Web server. Chances are good that you don’t really own the domain 
my_domain_name.com, right?
 
3. Leave the Path text box blank.
 
 Every Web server is configured differently, and most ISPs have things 
configured to put you in the appropriate place. Later, you may want to 
add something to this line so you don’t have to move around file folders 
each time you connect.

184
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 
 
4. Enter your Username and Password in the text boxes.
 
 The hosting company should have provided this information. If your 
hosting company is the same company that is supplying your connec-
tion to the Internet, it might be the same information you use to check 
your e-mail. But if you toss some additional money each week at a host-
ing provider, it’s likely something completely different.
 
 Select the Add to Keychain option to store your username and password 
for the next time you connect.
 
5. Click the Connect button in the lower-right corner.
 
 If you entered things properly, you now see the file folders on your 
remote Web server. If you didn’t, you get an error message or a login 
failed dialog box. Correct what’s wrong and try it again.
 
When your connection is established, choose Bookmarks➪New Bookmark. 
Give your newly created connection a catchy name and simply double-click 
the given name the next time you need to connect.
 
Figure 10-1:

Step by step setup for FileZilla
FileZilla (http://filezilla-project.org) operates much the same as 
Windows Explorer, allowing you to drag and drop files between your PC 
and your FTP server. When you’ve downloaded the FileZilla program, follow 
these steps:
 
1. On the Login toolbar (shown in Figure 10-2), enter your server name, 
username, and password.
 
 Leave the port blank. (It defaults to 21.)

185
 Chapter 10: Move It on Up (To Your Web Server)
 
2. Press the Quickconnect button.
 
 If you did things right, you see a lot of text scroll by in the upper-most 
window and content from your Web server appears in the right win-
dows, labeled Remote Site. 
 
 Congratulations; you’re now connected to your Web server. If you 
entered something wrong, you get an error message in red text in the 
upper window. Correct your mistakes and try it again.
From here, you can navigate through the folders on your Web server much 
as you do on your computer’s hard drive. You can move up or down the file 
system, finding the spot where you want to drop your podcast files.

A place on your Web server for your stuff
Logging in to your Web server for the first time can be an intimidating pro-
cess. In this section, we show you how to place your files in a location so you 
can easily create links to your podcast files.
Don’t be intimidated by the odd directory names on your Web server. The 
only one you really need to know is Public_html. Other hosts may call it 
www or simply html. If you don’t have one of those three, poke around until 
you find one that has a bunch of files in it that end in .html.

Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 
 
Look, but don’t touch. Going into folders doesn’t hurt anything, but doing silly 
things such as deleting, renaming, and moving files you know nothing about is 
a bad idea. All those strangely named folders do something, and they’re likely 
necessary to make your Web site work right. Remember the proverb “’Tis best 
to leave functioning Web servers lie. . . .”
You may see lots of different files and a few folders. We show you how to 
add even more files to this system, so now is a good time to think about 
organizing and housekeeping.
Start by creating a special place to keep your podcast files. Making a new 
folder exclusively for your podcast media files not only separates your 
podcasts from your other critical Web server files, but it also allows you to 
quickly see what is currently live and what needs to be cleaned up.
In your root directory (the top level folder usually denoted with a forward 
slash), create a new folder called media. With Cyberduck, choose File➪New 
Folder, followed by entering the name in the resulting dialog box. On FileZilla, 
right-click the window with the details (date, size, permissions) on the 
remote file server and choose Create Directory.
After you create the new media folder, double-click the name of the folder to 
open it. You’re now inside your totally empty media folder, and ready to load 
it with your podcast media files.
Uploading your files
After you set up a folder for your podcast media files and decide on a 
filenaming convention, you’re ready to move your freshly named files to 
the Web server.
Unmetered and unlimited explained
Okay, we can’t throw out terms like that without 
saying something about them:
  Unmetered bandwidth refers to the policies 
of certain hosting companies, like Liberated 
Syndication (http://libsyn.com), 
that don’t base their monthly charges on 
the amount of files transferred (podcasts 
downloaded) each month.
  Unlimited server space means you can host 
1 or 1,000 different podcast media files on 
the Web server and be charged the same 
flat fee. We don’t know of any hosting com-
pany offering unlimited server space cur-
rently, but you can get close. Many hosts 
offer gigabytes for a cheap price — some-
times even hundreds of gigabytes — which 
is effectively unlimited.

187
 Chapter 10: Move It on Up (To Your Web Server)
Both Cyberduck and FileZilla support drag-and-drop file transfers. If you’re 
new to FTP, the FTP program interface may be easier for you to use.
For Cyberduck, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Upload.
 
2. Browse your system to find the podcast media file you want to upload.
 
3. Click the Upload button.
For FileZilla, here’s what you do:
 
1. Navigate to the desired folder using the Local Site window on the left.
 
2. Select one or more files and/or folders from the window directly 
below.
 
3. Drag the selected files to the Remote Site window on the left.
Depending on the size of your file and the speed of your Internet connection, 
the file may transfer in a matter of seconds or a matter of minutes. When 
completed, the file appears in your FTP client and is ready to be linked in 
your show notes and RSS 2.0 feed, as we discuss in Chapters 11 and 12.
Using your blogging software to upload
Many popular blogging tools allow podcasters 
to upload files without the need for special FTP 
software, much like the HTTP process.
However, podcast media files often exceed 
the file size requirements for these services. 
For this reason, we recommend not using your 
conventional blogging software to handle your 
podcast media file uploads.
Consider that blogs are primarily used to com-
municate text. Although you can easily extend 
the functionality of a blog to support a podcast, 
the site management tools are designed for text 
and images.
WordPress (http://wordpress.org) 
does allow file uploads, but the file size 
depends on system parameters that are often 
set by the Web host and can’t be changed by 
the individual. You can upload, but it does take 
a significant amount of work that exceeds the 
scope of this book.
Instead, we recommend using blogging 
software to manage the posting of your con-
tent after your file is uploaded to the server. 
In WordPress, this is easily done with a plug-
in called PodPress. For more detailed infor-
mation about PodPress, be sure to pick up a 
copy of Expert Podcasting Practices For 
Dummies, by Tee Morris, Evo Terra, and 
Ryan Williams.

188
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 
Uploading with Command-Line FTP 
(Speaking of Old School . . .)
Earlier in this chapter, we talk about FTP clients that handle the uploading 
process for your podcast media files. Each option requires you to either 
download some specialty software or make a selection of a hosting company 
that offers HTTP transfers. But there’s another way. . . .
Each PC and Mac has a built-in FTP program, but the programs are neither 
elegant nor pretty, and they’re the antithesis of simplicity at first glance. 
But these built-in tools are handy to know about, especially if you can’t 
install new programs (library or shared-school computers may have this 
restriction) and/or your hosting provider doesn’t provide a Web-based 
HTTP transfer option.
We talk about command-line FTP in this section, and it comes with none of 
the conveniences and assurances of the other options we covered earlier 
in this chapter. But it’s a sure-fire way to get your files uploaded no matter 
where you are. (Almost.)
Before you get into the program itself, you need to move the podcast media 
file to a staging area on your desktop. Follow these steps:
 
1. Create a new folder on your desktop.
 
 We recommend naming your folder something like media or 
media staging.
 
2. Move your podcast media files to this folder.
 
 Drag and drop the files from a new Finder window, My Documents, 
or wherever you may have them stored.
Accessing Terminal on a Mac
If you’re a Mac user, follow these steps to use Terminal to access the podcast 
files you want to upload:
 
1. From Applications, open the Utilities folder and activate Terminal.
 
 A small window appears, reminiscent of old-time computers where 
unstyled black text appeared on a white background, or vice versa. Your 
graphical interface is gone, and you might as well move the mouse out of 
your way for a bit; you won’t be using it.

189
 Chapter 10: Move It on Up (To Your Web Server)
 
2. Type cd Desktop/media at the flashing cursor prompt.
 
 Your local directory changes to the media file staging area that contains 
the podcast files you’re about to upload.
 
 Be sure to substitute the name of your folder if you’ve named it 
something else beside media.
Jump ahead to the section “Uploading your files” to find out how to finish the 
uploading process.
Accessing the command prompt on a PC
If you’re a PC user, follow these steps to use the command prompt to access 
your podcast files:
 
1. Choose Start➪Run, type cmd, and click OK.
 
 A small window appears, reminiscent of old-time computers where 
unstyled white text appeared on a black background, or vice versa. Your 
graphical interface is gone, and you might as well get your hand off the 
mouse for a bit; you won’t be using it.
 
2. Type cd Desktop\media at the flashing cursor prompt.
 
 Your local directory changes to the media file staging area that contains 
the podcast files you’re about to upload.
 
 Be sure to substitute the name of your folder if you’ve named it some-
thing else beside media.
 
 Be sure to use the backwards slash (\) located above the Enter key on 
most keyboards. Using a forward slash (/) doesn’t work on a PC.
Now you’re ready to upload your files as described in the following section.
Uploading your files
After you access the podcast files you want to load (see the two preced-
ing sections), the uploading process is the same on a Mac or a PC. (Bet you 
never thought you’d see that happen, huh?)
Follow these steps to upload your files:
 
1. Type ftp my_domain_name and press Enter.
 
 For example, we typed ftp ftp.chuckchat.com and then pressed Enter.
 
 A variety of text appears in this window, followed by a prompt to enter 
your name.

190
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 
 
2. Type your username and press Enter.
 
 If your username is accepted, you get some positively reaffirming text 
followed by another prompt.
 
3. Type your password and press Enter.
 
 If you’ve typed your password correctly, several more lines of text 
describing the server appears, followed by a new prompt. You’re now 
connected to (and controlling) the remote server.
 
4. Type cd www and press Enter.
 
 That step takes you to the root directory where your files are accessible 
to Web browsers and podcatching clients. Depending on your server 
configuration, it may be public_html or simply html. If you try chang-
ing to a directory that doesn’t exist, you get an error message indicating 
as much. You may need to check with your ISP if neither of these works 
for your situation.
 
5. Create a media folder for your podcast media files. Type mkdir media 
at the prompt, press Enter, and then type cd media and press Enter to 
move to that folder.
 
 You’ve just created a connection between your local media folder and 
your remote media folder.
 
6. Type bin to ensure the files are transferred accurately as binary files.
 
 This is a safety step. To the FTP protocol, there are two types of files: 
ASCII (or text) and binary. Some command-line FTP programs default to 
ASCII, which does a translation on certain characters. Because your MP3 
file is not a text file, you want to ensure the contents are transferred 
exactly byte-for-byte.
 
7. Type put my_podcast_file.mp3 at the prompt.
 
 Replace my_podcast_file with the name of your file. 
 
 Type the name exactly as it appears, with proper capitalization, because 
case is important. If you want feedback that your file is transferring, type 
hash (before the put command) to see hash marks (#) print as the file 
copies. For large files, it can be a bit discomforting to just see a blinking 
cursor for several minutes. When the file is done transferring, you see a 
status message stating “File Successfully Transferred” and some statis-
tics about how much data and how long it took, and you are pleasantly 
returned to the FTP command prompt.
That’s it! If you’ve done things properly, you’ve now placed your podcast 
media files on the server and are ready to create your show notes and/or 
create your RSS 2.0 file. You can exit the command line by typing quit, exit, 
or close, depending on the application.

191
 Chapter 10: Move It on Up (To Your Web Server)
Uploading to a Podcast-Specific Host
Podcast-specific hosting companies significantly simplify the uploading 
process; many include Web-based forms that take the place of additional 
computer programs to handle the uploading process. They also take care of 
archiving, RSS 2.0 creation, and even ID3 tagging.
 
Although this Web-based uploading process is simple, we prefer the flexibility 
of using an FTP client — or better yet a command line interface. Or maybe 
we’re old school. . . .
For the purposes of illustration, we use an account with Liberated 
Syndication (http://libsyn.com) in this section. If you haven’t already, 
you need to sign up with LibSyn and create your own account. Then follow 
these steps:
 
1. Begin at LibSyn’s home page. Enter your username and password and 
press the Login button.
 
2. Click the Settings tab to access your blog and podcast settings.
 
3. Enter the information for your blog and/or podcast. When you finish, 
click the Save Changes button.
 
 The blog settings are very simple; things like the name of your blog, 
your e-mail address, and what category you want it placed in. Nothing 
here is mission critical, so fill it out however you want to see it listed. 
You can always come back and change it later.
 
4. Click the Media Files tab.
 
 If you’ve never uploaded any media files, no media files are listed.
 
5. Click the bright green button labeled Upload a File.
 
 You’re taken to the upload page, as shown in Figure 10-3.
 
6. Click the Browse button.
 
 The File Upload dialog box opens.
 
 Note: HTTP upload is another name for form-based transfers.
 
7. Find the podcast media file you want to upload and either 
double-click the file or select it and click Open.
 
8. Click the Load File button.
 
 Depending on the size of your file and the speed of your Internet connec-
tion, the page may refresh in a matter of seconds or a few minutes. After 
completion, the screen refreshes, and your podcast media file displays. 
Note also that the text box under Advanced Users contains a string of 
RSS 2.0 code. Remember this Web page and text box because we revisit 
it in Chapters 11 and 12.

LibSyn offers an FTP interface if you prefer to use an FTP client or command 
line interface. Your login and password are the same as through the Web 
interface.
 
If you like to try it before you buy it, LibSyn lets you log in to a demo account, 
move files around, and generally get a feel for how it works before you sign up. 
Not that the very inexpensive monthly fees will break you or anything, but it’s 
nice to know how your future home might work.

S
how notes are brief summaries of each podcast episode. Show notes can 
take the form of an outline, a bulleted list, or just a few sentences of text. 
In this chapter, we show you how to effectively use show notes to enhance 
the listener experience of your show and bring in additional traffic to your 
podcast through search engines.
And where do you find these show notes? Simply enough, on the podcast’s 
Web site. 
Getting additional traffic means additional bandwidth consumption, which 
can cause issues. Flip to Chapter 10 for tips on ways to reduce the load on 
your servers and for info about optional hosting plans that don’t charge for 
additional bandwidth.
Show Note Etiquette
Several schools of thought exist on how to approach show notes. Some say 
you should be very brief, using notes only to hold URLs and other pieces 
of important offline data that your listeners may not have had time to write 
down as the show was playing. Others suggest show notes should be filled 

194
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 
with information on each and every concept touched upon in the show. We 
prefer a more moderate approach, and your personal tastes and style go a 
long way in determining what is right for you.
Regardless of the length of your prose and the level of detail you want to 
explain, you need to follow some basic rules of etiquette:
 
 Use intriguing and informative titles. In general, and to keep things 
simple, the title of your show notes should match your episode title. 
Your title is your pitch; you’re a huckster competing for the attention of 
listeners. Some listeners may know all about you; others could be seeing 
something from you for the first time. Include keywords in your title that 
accurately and specifically represent the contents of this episode. Your 
keywords should also generate some excitement and make the episode 
sound interesting and intriguing to potential listeners.
 
 Include links to all the locations mentioned in the podcast. If you’re 
talking about a trip to the local museum, provide a link to the museum’s 
Web site in your show notes. If you mention another podcast, link to it. 
Good linking brings good karma, and it may provide some interesting 
and potentially helpful “Hey, you linked to me!” comments (and back-
links) from others.
 
 Concise or complete? Show notes can be as simple as a bullet list of 
topics or as detailed as a word-for-word transcript of your show. It’s 
up to you. The advantage to the bullet list is that it’s quicker to put 
together, obviously. If you’re already scripting your podcast, it’s no 
extra trouble to post the script, but be aware of the length. A transcript 
for a 3-minute show is pretty easy for someone to read from their 
browser; however a 45-minute transcript — yes, there are 45-minute 
shows that are completely scripted — may be something you don’t want 
the reader to go through.
Figure 11-1 displays how Phil Clark and Mike (Lingo) Lingafelter of The Brit 
and Yankee Pubcast (http://thebritandyankee.com) use show notes. 
The notes include plenty of backlinks, time marks, and a brief discussion 
about the topics covered. A thing of beauty, to be sure.
When we think of show note etiquette, we’re reminded of a commercial that 
aired years ago for a small car company. The premise was “if everyone drove 
one of our tiny cars, traffic congestion would vanish, the demand for fossil 
fuels would drop, and the world would be a generally nicer place.” We’re con-
vinced that if every podcaster followed the preceding three simple show note 
guidelines, the podcasting world would be a better place. The impact on traf-
fic jams and oil consumption remains questionable, but one can dream. . . .

Planning the Post
The amount of time you spend planning your show notes is inversely propor-
tional to the amount of time you spend during your show prep (see Chapter 
4). If you forgot everything from your high school Algebra II class, allow us 
to paraphrase: The more you prepare for your show, the less time you spend 
working on the show notes — and vice versa.
Examine the notes you used when you recorded your podcast. Did you talk 
about any Web sites? Find the URLs and make sure you spell them right. We 
highly recommend the copy-and-paste technique for URLs, rather than rely-
ing on your typing skills, especially for lengthy URLs.
If you recorded and/or edited your show hours or days before you started 
this notation process, replaying the media file with pen and paper at the 
ready is a good idea. Look for need-to-know moments and jot them down 
as the show plays. After it finishes, use a search engine to find additional, 
relevant URLs you may want to provide to your listeners.
The following sections help you create powerful show notes that benefit you, 
the listener, and potential listeners.

196
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 
It’s all in the details
Now is a good time to figure out what level of detail you’re going to employ in 
your show notes. Several factors can influence your decision, and audience 
expectation and personal choice are among the more important.
 
Here’s a good rule: The deeper you dive in to a single topic, the less detailed 
your notes need to be. That may sound counterintuitive, and please keep in 
mind this is only a general rule and not a law. For example, if your podcast 
episode features a 20-minute interview with Theoretical Physicist Dr. Michio 
Kaku on his book Physics of the Impossible and how applicable those ideas are 
to the Star Wars Universe, you likely won’t have much more than a link to buy 
the book and/or rent the movie.
Show note details serve several primary purposes:
 
 To act as a table of contents for the episode
 
 To allow listeners to skip ahead if they so choose
As the podcaster, you can decide how much or how little you embrace 
these purposes. Here are some approaches that other podcasters 
have adopted:
 
 Add a time stamp. Some podcasters put the exact time stamp of when 
they change topics, which is quite frequently. Time stamps can be quite 
helpful to your listeners if you cover a wide range of topics in a given 
episode and want to assist possible listeners in jumping around.
 
 Write in complete sentences and paragraphs. Taking cues from the 
world of blogging, many podcasters follow a similar approach to Kris 
Smith of The Croncast (http://croncast.com). Kris writes his show 
notes in prose, using complete sentences and paragraphs in place of 
bullet points and time stamps. This approach feels better to poten-
tial readers, giving them a flavor of the show without having to listen. 
However, we’ve also heard listeners complain that key elements are 
difficult to find in this format.
 
 Create more than a one-line summary. Some podcasters, such as 
Dave Winer (http://morningcoffeenotes.com) take the opposite 
approach and post a simple one-liner that isn’t much more than a title. 
We suggest new podcasters not follow his lead because it doesn’t do 
much for helping attract new listeners. Dave is a seminal figure in the 
world of podcasting and gets most of his listeners because he’s Dave 
Winer, not because he posts great show notes.

197
 Chapter 11: Providing Show Notes
 
Detailed show notes are also useful for attracting new listeners. Show notes 
improve your search engine rankings, and they enable Web surfers to deter-
mine the value of an episode before listening. For his Gmail Podcast, Chuck 
started with a synopsis of each show (for example, “Learn how to be more 
effective using labels”). After seeing little increase in listenership for 18 
months, he started including the full transcript to the 5 minute show, and 
listenership doubled — that’s how powerful show notes can be.
A picture is worth a thousand words
Some podcasters include a representative image or two in their show 
notes. Although random graphics serve only to increase your bandwidth 
consumption and clutter your page, well-selected images can add flavor 
and dimension to your show notes. In some cases, these are the same 
images used as album art in the episode files.
Before you add an image to your post, keep in mind these three 
considerations:
 
 Is the image protected by copyright? Posting someone else’s creative 
work without first securing permission (which may include royalties 
and fees) is stealing, pure and simple, and can land even the most 
well-meaning podcaster in a heap of legal trouble.
 
 Can you link directly to the image, or do you need to copy it to your 
server? Some sites, such as Amazon.com, allow you to link directly to 
images as they sit on the Web site. These sites have a huge technology 
infrastructure and can handle remote hosting images that appear on 
other sites. But many smaller and personal sites can’t handle the load 
a popular podcast can put on their systems if they allowed direct link-
ing to their stored images. In these cases, copy the image to your own 
server before adding it to your page. If you’re going to do this, it’s good 
karma to provide an “image courtesy of . . .” link to the original site. 
Again, this assumes you’ve received the appropriate permissions to 
copy the file. When in doubt, don’t.
 
 Does the image fit on your page? Images too small or too large aren’t 
doing your listeners any favors. Make sure the image you select is the 
right size. You can add width=”x” height=”x” declarations to your 
image tags to control the size, but keep in mind that this distorts the 
image. Previewing your post with resized images is a must. If your HTML 
is a little rusty, check out HTML 4 For Dummies, by Ed Tittel and Mary 
Burmeister (Wiley Publishing, Inc.), for additional help.

198
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 
 
We can’t stress enough how important it is that you not take, post, modify, 
or use any image without the express permission of the copyright owners. 
The act of someone posting an image to a Web site does not give you carte 
blanche to use it as you see fit. When in doubt, leave it out.
Posting Your Show Notes
If you’ve planned and prepared, posting your show notes is easy. And if 
you’ve decided for the minimalist approach or don’t really care to use show 
notes, this process can go quickly as well because there’s nothing to do.
In this section, we show you how to enter your show notes by using 
WordPress and Libsyn as examples. If you use another tool to make your 
posts, or if you create your notes by hand, you still get value out of these 
examples as we show you things to consider along the way.
Posting in WordPress
WordPress is free, easy-to-use blogging software that also works well for 
podcasters. Follow these steps to post show notes in WordPress (www.
wordpress.org):
 
1. Log in to your Web site’s site administration page.
 
 By default, you typically can find a Login link on WordPress pages. If 
you’ve already provided credentials, the link may say Site Admin. In 
most instances, the URL looks something like: www.your_domain_
here.com/wp-admin
 
2. Click Write from the menu along the top to start a new posting.
 
 A new posting page opens. Here’s where you fill in the details of your 
new posting. Although this screen displays a lot of items, you don’t need 
to use them all to get started.
 
3. Select the appropriate category for your podcast from the Categories 
section.
 
 Though not critical, categories help keep things more organized. It’s 
not uncommon to have one category for text/blog entries and another 
for podcasts. 
 
4. Enter the title of your podcast in the Title text box.
 
 Label your show with a short descriptive tag, Classic Car Auction, for 
example. For more titling help, see the “Loading up your titles” section, 
later in this chapter. To make the reader’s life easier, we recommend 
using the same title on your show and your show notes.

199
 Chapter 11: Providing Show Notes
 
5. In the large text area below, type your show notes.
 
 Follow a chronological order and list the various topics covered in your 
show, one on each line.
 
6. Be sure to add URLs to any Web sites you mention. 
 
 To create a link, highlight the text you want to link and then click the 
Link button. Copy and paste the full URL — including the http:// 
part — you want to link to in the pop-up box (see Figure 11-2). Click OK.
 
Figure 11-2: 
Enter a URL 
to create a 
hyperlink to 
a podcast 
media file.
 
 
7. Create a link to your podcast file.
 
 Enter text like Listen Now or Download MP3. Just as you create a link 
to a URL in Step 6, you can add a link to your podcast file. If the file is on 
your server, use the pathname on your server. If your file in on another 
server, use the entire URL — for example, http://servername/path_
to_myfile.mp3.
 
8. When you’re done entering your show notes, click the Save button.
 
 You can see a preview of your posting by clicking the Preview button — 
it’s not a bad idea to verify the format and ensure links will work before 
releasing it to the public.
 
9. Scroll down to preview your post. 
 
 Make sure the links work properly — including your podcast file. Few 
things are more embarrassing than releasing that long-awaited podcast 
only to find that a link in your show notes doesn’t work. When you’re 
just starting out, you likely won’t have a lot of people letting you know 
of technical issues. It’s up to you to test as much as you can before 
releasing a new podcast.
 
10. Make any adjustments necessary.
 
 If you notice links that don’t work or typos, you still have an opportunity 
to fix them by scrolling back up, making the edits, saving your work, and 
repeating Step 9 until you’re satisfied.
 
11. When you’re satisfied with your show notes, click Publish.
 
 The system takes care of generating the RSS 2.0 feed. We discuss RSS in 
more detail in Chapter 12.

200
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 
 
12. Click View Site link at the top of the page to see how your entry looks.
 
 Visiting your Web page is a good idea to make sure everything looks 
as you expected it to. If it doesn’t, simply edit the post and resave 
your changes.
We’ve only scratched the surface of what WordPress can do. If you really 
want to take advantage of the software, we suggest WordPress For Dummies, 
by Lisa Sabin-Wilson. You can also listen to The WordPress Podcast with 
Charles Stricklin to keep up on plug-ins, software changes, and security 
updates.
 
Many podcasters with detailed show notes use the <More> tag in their 
WordPress postings, as shown in Figure 11-3. Any text above the More link is 
displayed on the main page. Those with interest to view the detailed content 
can click the link. If you have lots of show notes to include in your post, this is 
a good way to keep your front page tidy with a few bullet items for each show, 
and then you can “hide” the longer list.
 
In the next chapter, you find out about creating the RSS 2.0 feed so that people 
can subscribe to your podcast. Assuming you’ve installed the PodPress plug-
in, WordPress makes RSS feeds easy. Don’t worry about it for now because we 
cover it in detail in Chapter 12.

Posting on LibSyn
Because LibSyn (www.libsyn.com) is a dedicated podcast hosting provider, 
the steps are quite intuitive and a bit different than those used by folks who 
work with blogging software.
Follow these steps to post your show notes on LibSyn:
 
1. To create a new post, click the Publish tab or the link of the same 
name from the main page.
 
2. Click the New Post option button.
 
 LibSyn also allows text-only posts to the site, which is great for times 
when you want to post some text without a media file, such as to say 
“I’m on vacation for the next two weeks.”
 
3. Enter a title for this episode.
 
 We cover some titling tips later in this section. For now, simply enter a 
basic description of what this episode is about — “Classic Car Auction” 
for example.
 
4. Choose a category for your podcast from the Category drop-down list.
 
 Categories on LibSyn work like they do with most blogging applications. 
To keep this simple, choose Podcast from the list.
 
5. Skip the Post Image drop-down list for now.
 
 Yes, you can put something in there if you must. But it’s not required. 
See our earlier comments on using images in this chapter if you decide 
you can’t live without one (but you probably could).
 
6. Enter the detailed show notes in the Show Notes text box.
 
 This is the appropriate place for your detailed show notes. Follow a 
chronological order and list the various topics covered in your show, 
one on each line. Be sure to add URLs to any Web sites you mention.
 
 Typing the URL in this section isn’t quite as effective as providing a true 
hyperlink. Making a hyperlink isn’t difficult, though it may look that way 
if you aren’t familiar with the mysteries of HTML.
 
 Hyperlinks follow this convention:
<a href=”link/to/website/or/web/page”>Name of link</a>
 
 Basically, you fill out what’s between the quotes, replace the name of 
the link, and you’re done. Here are a few real-world examples:
<a href=”http://www.chuckchat.com/gmail”>Gmail Podcast</a>
<a href=”http://morevi.net”>Morevi podcast</a>
<a href=”http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/gallery/images.html”>Pictures from 
Mars</a>

Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 
 
7. Chose your podcast media file from the drop-down list.
 
 If you haven’t uploaded the show yet, LibSyn makes it easy. Simply click 
the Browse button and navigate to the appropriate file in your media 
folder (which we show how to set up in Chapter 10).
 
 Because LibSyn doesn’t allow you to preview your post first, we highly 
recommend checking your spelling and double-checking your links 
before you proceed. An ounce of prevention and all that. 
 
 Figure 11-4 shows how your post looks on LibSyn before it is posted.
 
8. Click the Publish button.
 
 LibSyn makes it hard to screw up, requiring you to fill out the appropri-
ate fields before allowing you to continue. If you’re successful, you see a 
green check box next to your new post.
 
9. Check your page.
 
 Click the link to your show name and see how it looks in the real world. 
Check your links, spelling, and layout. If it’s not the way you want, close 
the window and click the name of your post to edit it.
 
It never hurts to mention that you have show notes. You can do so as part 
of the running dialog — for example, “. . . We found a great deal on those at 
Frobozco. We’ll have a link in the show notes on our Web site . . .” or mention 
it at the end of the show with contact information, as in “Don’t forget to stop 
by our Web site, where you’ll find links to everything we mentioned in the 
show notes, information on how to contact us, and much more at www. . . .”

 Chapter 11: Providing Show Notes
Using a wiki for your show notes
A wiki is a Web site that allows your listeners to contribute to your show 
notes. This may sound rather scary — “let others modify MY Web site? Are 
you crazy?” Before you dismiss the idea, consider sites like Wikipedia (www.
wikipedia.org), one of the foremost reference sites built entirely by volun-
teer public efforts. Now imagine the power of your listener community 
helping you build and maintain your show notes.
One method of using the wiki is to post a framework, or bullet list for your 
show notes, and let the users contribute. Another way is to just start writing 
and let the user community come along and do the clean up. 
Note that wikis won’t work for every podcast. It takes a certain level of 
listener loyalty — something the podosphere has no shortage of.
You can employ a wiki in two basic ways: Build one yourself or use a wiki 
someone else has built. We discuss each way in this section.
Using MediaWiki 
MediaWiki (www.mediawiki.org) is the software that runs the popular 
Wikipedia. The software is freely available to anyone who wants to set up a 
wiki. It does require you to maintain a database with your Web hosting pro-
vider. Check the Web site to install the software.
 
Installing MediaWiki is similar to installing WordPress in that it requires you to 
have a Web host that allows you to upload and install software and access to a 
MySQL database.
When it’s installed, you can create pages specifically for show notes. 
MediaWiki does use special formatting characters to create links, bulleted 
lists, numbered lists, and more; however, using the wiki formatting charac-
ters is simpler than trying to teach yourself HTML. An example of your show 
notes in a MediaWiki page might look something like this:
=Show 15: HP Laptops and me=
* Introduction
* The week in review
* [http://www.microsoft.com Software troubles]
In this example, the line flanked with one or more equal signs (=) indicates 
a section heading. The more equal signs, the further the indent. The lines 
starting with asterisks (*) are a bulleted list. The last line enclosed with the 
single square brackets ([ ]) is a link to another site, everything after the site 
is the text displayed. In this example, the Web browser displays a link that 
says Software troubles, which takes users to the Microsoft home page.
The following steps show you how to create a new page of show notes. We 
assume the top level page is at http://www.mysite.com/wiki.

204
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 
 
1. Click the Log In/Create Account link in the upper-right corner.
 
2. Log in to your wiki with your username and password.
 
 Assuming you set up the wiki, you already have an account. New visitors 
have to use the link Create an Account.
 
3. Click the Edit tab.
 
 The page will change to “edit mode” allowing you to enter text in a large 
text area.
 
4. Create a page link.
 
 Enter the formatting code [[Some Text]], where Some Text is the name 
of your page. For example, [[April 30, 2008]].
 
5. Click the Save Page button.
 
 MediaWiki goes back to browse mode. You now see a link with the text 
of your new page link. Note that the link is in red, which means there’s 
no actual page for this link — yet.
 
6. Click the newly created link.
 
 You’re taken to the same page editor as before, but there’s no content. 
This is where you enter your show notes using the formatting codes for 
headers, bullet lists, and so on.
 
7. Click the Save Page button.
 
 Congratulations! You’ve created your first set of show notes using 
MediaWiki.
In very little time, you can create fairly extensive show notes and then link to 
them from your blog post. Other listeners can them come along (and set up 
accounts if necessary) and make changes. 
 
You can use the wiki for more than show notes. You can create almost any 
Web content to support your show from listener show suggestions to results 
to a contest — there’s practically no limit to the ideas.
 
Most wikis feature revision control — meaning you can roll-back changes in 
the event something goes wrong. With multiple people editing the same infor-
mation, it happens from time to time.
Using Wetpaint
If you don’t have the ability to install software on your hosting server (which 
MediaWiki requires), or setting up your own wiki just isn’t your thing, you 
can still take advantage of a wiki’s features with a site like Wetpaint (www.
wetpaint.com).
Wetpaint is a free site to manage wikis. Begin by going to the site and creat-
ing a login ID. You can create a personalized wiki and give it your own host-
name — for example, http://technorama.wetpaint.com.

205
 Chapter 11: Providing Show Notes
 
Spend the time to watch the video that takes you on a demo to get a tutorial of 
the system. 
Updating your wiki is as simple as running a word processor. Just click the 
Easy Edit button at the top of any page. The graphical toolbar makes it easy 
to create headings, bulleted lists, and even insert widgets like an RSS feed so 
visitors to your wiki know your recent postings to your Web page. And the 
best part for you is that no HTML is required!
Figure 11-5 shows what your show notes look like in Wetpaint.

Boosting Search Engine Rankings 
with Good Show Notes
One tangible benefit of quality show notes is the impact they can have on 
your listings within search engines. Traditional search engines cannot (yet) 
scan and index the contents of your podcast media files. As such, you need 
to provide text for the search engine spiders and bots to examine and evalu-
ate for index inclusion.

206
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 
We go into more detail about spiders and bots in Chapter 13. For now, you 
just need to know that they are tools that search engines use to find interest-
ing information when people search for a particular topic.
 
Podcasters can pick up a lot of tips and tricks from bloggers and other Web 
site owners on how to boost search engine rankings. Many include page-level 
changes to positioning of elements, correct usage of headings, meta and image 
tags, and back-linking techniques. All of that conversation is far beyond the 
scope of this book. Grab a copy of Search Engine Optimization For Dummies by 
Peter Kent (published by Wiley) and break out your code editor if you want to 
make a bigger splash.
In the following sections, we show you some best practices you can imple-
ment right away that can make your notes (and podcast) more accessible to 
search engines — and ultimately search engine users.
Loading up your titles
Search engines (and searchers) pay close attention to titles. You should con-
sider the title of your individual podcast episodes every bit as important as 
the title of a given Web page.
Important as they are, most podcasters struggle with effective titles. The 
biggest problem comes from confusing titles with descriptions. If your title 
starts with “In this episode,” stop right there. You’re writing the description, 
not the title. A title is a string of well-chosen and crafted words that has no 
room for superfluous baggage.
We find that the best titles come from a re-examination of your show notes. 
If you haven’t made your notes yet, you may find coming up with a solid title 
quite tough. Here’s the process we suggest:
 
1. Read your show notes and pull out the key elements, thoughts, or 
themes covered on the show.
 
 For example, for the Classic Car Auction we’ve been using throughout 
this chapter, we’ve come up with the following completely made-up 
topics and themes from an imaginary show:
 
• Sleeping in the Seattle airport while the flight was delayed
 
• Interesting discussion during the flight with an 80-year-old man 
who is a car restorer
 
• Under the hood of the 1965 Ford Mustang
 
• Custom headers and exhaust systems
 
• A short interview with the owner of a 1972 Chevy Nova

207
 Chapter 11: Providing Show Notes
 
• Taking a 1957 Chevy Belair for a cruise
 
• Listener feedback request: What’s your favorite classic car
 
2. Boil down each element to a single word or phrase, if possible.
 
 Think about the people who might be interested in the contents of your 
show and pick common words they’re likely to search for.
 
 For example, if you’re a comedian, the airport delay and the old man 
on the plane might be good places to start. If this is a more serious car 
show, the experience with the ’65 Mustang and the Belair might be a 
good place to start.
 
 If your show is a relatively serious collector/restoration show, you’re 
trying to entertain and attract like-minded listeners. Getting rid of the 
fluff is a good idea. You can select the key points and condense them to 
the following:
 
 “Experienced restorer, a peek at a Mustang, and driving a true classic.”
 
 That’s a solid title, giving searchers a good tease about what they 
can expect. 
 
Notice how the title doesn’t cover everything, and it shouldn’t try. That’s the 
job of the description where you can go into even greater detail on those three 
elements, plus the many other things you talk about on the show.
The title also carries good keywords likely to be of interest to car buffs or 
admirers considering a purchase, looking to get in to restoration, and those 
who may already own a classic.
Chances are good that you know your audience much better than we do. 
Think about how people are likely to search and write your titles for that. 
Keep them short, don’t try to cover everything, and employ more detailed 
descriptions to carry the rest of your story.
Soliciting backlinks
Backlinks are the Holy Grail of search engine optimization. A backlink is 
simply a link from someone else’s Web site to yours — whereas a regular 
link is from your site to another. Sites that have a lot of backlinks pointing to 
them are considered “more important” to the computers that control where 
your site shows up on a search engine. To get backlinks from others, you 
have to create links to their Web sites in your show notes.
 
When you’re soliciting backlinks from sources, make each e-mail personal, 
provide the exact link you want them to use, and tell them why you think it’s 
important for them to link it.

208
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 
In the highly suspect classic car auction we’ve been using as an example, you 
could link to several things, and you really should link to a few things. For 
example, you could provide a link to the airline that messed up the flight, but 
what’s the point? On the other hand, you most certainly want to create a link 
to a place to buy or read more about sources of parts, and you likely would 
want to link to the auction site.
 
Before you post the show, it may be a good idea to contact other podcasters, 
bloggers, and perhaps notable Web sites to see whether they’re interested 
in linking to you (and you to them) to generate interest in your podcast, 
rather than a specific show. Many sites have a section somewhere for related 
sites. This can be a very effective tool for drawing people to your site and 
your podcast. Then you can also find folks who might want to backlink to 
particular episodes.
So, you’ve posted your show and got your show notes online. It’s time to 
start soliciting backlinks to individual episodes:
 
 Company backlinks: Write to the company who manufactures the 
custom headers to tell them you’re posting a review of one of their 
products. Getting big companies to link to you doesn’t always happen, 
but sometimes it does. And getting backlinks from big popular sites 
is very beneficial to your rankings.
 
 Courtesy backlinks: If someone helped you with a part of your podcast 
and you mention it in your episode, let that source know. Send an e-mail 
to the agency you booked the trip with and maybe even the hotel.
 
 Backlinks from fellow podcasters: If other podcasters cover topics 
related to your episode, let them know about it because they might 
be willing to spare you a backlink. Notify various car bloggers and 
podcasters about the new episode. It takes only a few moments of your 
time and is information they would or should welcome.
 
A fine line exists between asking for backlinks and spamming someone. If you 
can’t think of a good reason why that site should link to you, then you don’t 
ask for it; otherwise, just mention what your show is and what you’ve covered 
that might be of interest and let them decide whether they want to provide a 
backlink.

Geeking Out on RSS
In This Chapter
 Understanding RSS
 Creating good introductions
 Handling multi-format podcasts
You’ve entered the dark and murky waters of the RSS generation — a 
region of the podcasting sea that strikes fear into the hearts of the unini-
tiated, causes mild-mannered podcasting preachers to break out into curse 
words that would make a sailor blush, and has soured more than one would 
be independent media producer on the whole prospect of podcasting.
Relax. For the most part, the trials and tribulations you might have heard others 
had to go through are overblown. If it were as hard as some have made it out 
to be, there wouldn’t be as many podcasts as there are available today. The 
RSS step wasn’t designed to be complicated; it’s just quirky, and it’s been 
tainted by the experiences of a few who jumped in a little too fast, without a 
trusty guide to show them the path.
This chapter shines a big bright spotlight on RSS elements, showing you that 
they aren’t as mean and scary as they’ve been made out to be. After reading 
this chapter, you’ll have a solid strategy for generating your podcast’s RSS 2.0 
file, some options for dealing with multiple media files, and the confidence to 
tweak your RSS file as you see fit.
You’re probably asking yourself: “Do I need to know all that”? Well, yes and 
no. Granted, you’ll likely be using blogging software or some podcast-hosting 
company that takes care of the RSS 2.0 feed for you. It’s still a good idea to 
know what goes on under the hood, in our opinion.
Elements That Make the RSS Go ’Round
The main function of your RSS 2.0 file is to distribute your media files to 
people who have subscribed to your podcast. RSS is nothing more than 

210
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 
“marked up” text with special tags. (For more about the technical aspects of 
RSS, check out the nearby sidebar.) Here’s a sample RSS 2.0 feed:
<?xml version=”1.0”?>
<rss xmlns:content=”http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/” 
xmlns:itunes=”http://www.itunes.com/DTDs/Podcast-1.0.dtd”

Getting a handle on TLAs (three-letter acronyms)
XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. 
“Markup” is a lot like what your teacher used to 
do to your homework, only more useful: “mark-
ing up” a text file with some special tags that 
control how the text is used by various appli-
cations, like a podcatching client. This is good 
news if you’re without an advanced degree in 
computer science: It’s text (in this case, English 
or something a lot like it) that tells other text 
how to present itself.
“Extensible” means developers can add 
other tags beyond the original “set” that was 
designed for XML. In other words, a developer 
can add to the code base of XML, adapting it to 
individual needs. Okay, feel free to forget that 
if you want — you won’t have to worry about 
creating new tags, thanks to RSS 2.0.
RSS is a flavor (modified version) of XML, and it 
stands for Really Simple Syndication. (Syndication 
is the process of getting the goods — whether a 
Web site update, news bulletin, or podcast — to 
the intended audience.) Lucky for us podcast-
ers, XML was extended to RSS, which was fur-
ther extended to create RSS 2.0. And inside RSS 
2.0 is where you find the appropriate tags and 
elements that make podcasts work.
You’ll hear podcasters use the terms XML and 
RSS interchangeably. Sometimes people say 
the version number (2.0) out loud and in print, 
other times it’s simply implied. There’s at least 
one other version of XML that works with pod-
casting: Atom. No, it’s not a TLA, because it has 
four letters and it doesn’t stand for anything, but 
it is a version of XML. The differences between 
Atom and RSS 2.0 are beyond the scope of this 
book. The good news is that most podcatch-
ing clients read either Atom or RSS 2.0 files. In 
fact, advanced RSS 2.0 feeds often incorporate 
Atom elements, further blurring the differences 
between the two formats. To minimize head-
aches, this chapter focuses on RSS 2.0 as the 
preferred method of syndicating your podcast 
to podcatching clients. And yes, iTunes fans, 
we do cover the extra tags your podcatcher of 
choice has made us all deal with.
If you want an even deeper dive into the world 
of RSS syndication — because you can do 
some really cool stuff with it — we highly rec-
ommend Ellen Finkelstein’s Syndicating Web 
Sites with RSS Feeds For Dummies (Wiley 
Publishing, Inc.).

Okay, that’s a lot to digest in a single sitting. The next sections of the book 
break it down into individual parts to show you how un-scary it really is.
 
If you’re currently using (or planning to use) blog software or your dedicated 
podcast host to generate your RSS 2.0 feed, it’ll take care of just about all this 
brouhaha for you. It’s still a good idea, however, to have a solid grasp of this 
section in the event you want to make some modifications to your RSS 2.0 feed 
in the future. (Most podcasters do, sooner or later.)

213
 Chapter 12: Geeking Out on RSS
 
Well, your software may not be of much help with the iTunes-specific stuff. 
iTunes burst on the podcasting scene without much (read: ANY) advanced 
notice. And when it did, it came up with unique tags to extend what RSS 2.0 
already provided. Take a good hard look at the tool you’re using to generate 
your RSS feed and see whether there are any iTunes-specific tags. If not, you 
may have to break out the manual and see how you can add them yourself. In some 
cases, it’s easy — for example, adding the PodPress plug-in to WordPress — and 
in other cases, it’s a bit daunting.
Do you have anything to declare?
All RSS 2.0 documents start with a declaration statement. Think of this declara-
tion as working with a “Hello, my name is . . .” badge. This statement identifies 
the contents of the file, allowing podcatching clients and other XML parsers 
or readers to know what to expect and how to handle the contents. Some declara-
tions wear their hearts on their sleeves, some are terse, but all RSS 2.0 documents 
do the initial honors with these first two lines of text:
<?xml version=”1.0”?>
<rss version=”2.0” xmlns:content=”http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/” 
xmlns:itunes=”http://www.itunes.com/DTDs/Podcast-1.0.dtd”>
With those two lines of text, you’ve declared that the document is written 
in XML version 1.0 and is of the special flavor RSS 2.0. Additionally, it calls 
out two specialized namespaces, which we get into in a bit. You might want 
to write those two lines on your forehead backward (metaphorically speak-
ing, of course) so you’ll always see ’em in the mirror as a reminder: They are 
what you use to start every RSS 2.0 file you create as a podcaster.
 
A namespace is denoted by the xmlns: statement, followed by the URL of the 
“home” of the namespace. In the preceding instance, we call the namespaces 
for the encoded content module as well as iTunes tags. Purists will argue that 
encoded content isn’t necessary and that even the iTunes tags are optional. But 
they both go a long way to getting your podcast listened to by the most people.
What’s on this <channel>?
An RSS 2.0 document contains a single <channel> statement, complete with 
lots of other information to help describe the channel. A channel can contain 
multiple <item> statements, and each <item> can have lots of other informa-
tion to describe the individual item.

214
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 
Okay, here’s a real-world example to clarify the issue: NBC is a “channel” on 
your television. Depending on the day of the week and the time of the day, 
various “items” are made available for viewing. It’s not an accident that pod-
casting works the same way.
In the following sections, we examine the contents of the <channel> decla-
ration from the example at the beginning of the chapter. (We cover <item> 
tags in the later section “Loading up on <items>s.”)
 
XML tags are case-sensitive. For example, <description> has a different 
meaning than <Description> or <DESCRIPTION>. Additionally, the case of 
the opening tag (the one that starts a section) must match the case of the closing 
tag (the one that ends the same section). <webMaster> and </webMaster> are 
okay, but <webmaster> and <Webmaster> are not.
<title> tag
You use the <title> tag to hold the title of your channel, that is to say the 
title of your overall podcast. Here’s the title from the example just given:
<title>The Car Collector Podcast</title>
This line of text says, “Here’s what’s inside me.” It never changes, unless you 
decide to change the name of your podcast. Don’t abbreviate or shorten the 
name unless you have a very good reason for doing that.
 
Almost every markup language uses this format of beginning and ending tags 
encapsulated in angle brackets, < and >. The ending tag uses the same name, 
but it’s preceded by a / character to tell the software that the tag is now 
closed. In the example just given, you can think of the code as talking to the 
podcatching client, along these lines: “(The next thing you’ll read is the title.) 
The Car Collector Podcast (That was the end of the title.)”
<link> tag
Here’s a good place to put a link that leads back to your Web site or blog. The 
beauty of RSS and podcasting is that the listeners don’t have to be looking at 
your Web page to listen to your show. This link allows them (through their 
podcatching clients) an easy way to find your Web site if they so desire:
<link>http://www.mypodcast.com/</link>
<description> tag
Your description, much like your title, will rarely (if ever) change. Find a good 
description for what your shows are about. The following example is pretty 
poor (just kidding, okay?), so try to put in some words that truly identify what 
your podcast is about:

215
 Chapter 12: Geeking Out on RSS
<description>The best podcast on the planet. Period. With your host, me!</
description>
 
Technically, the RSS 2.0 specifications allow you to place images, links, and 
even text formatting inside the <description> tag. However, there’s some 
question as to how many of the podcatcher developers have allowed for 
that. Be safe. Keep straight text in your <description> tag and use the new 
<content:encoded> tag to pass HTML. See the section later in this chapter, 
“<content:encoded> tag,” to find out how to use this tag.
<webMaster> and <managingEditor> tags
The webmaster is the person responsible for the technical accuracy of the infor-
mation contained in the feed. The managing editor is the person responsible for 
the messaging and content contained within the tags. For most podcasters, these 
both reflect the same e-mail address. Note that the <managingEditor> tag 
requires a name in parentheses to follow the e-mail address:
<webMaster>chuck@mypodcast.com</webMaster>
<managingEditor>chuck@mypodcast.com (Chuck Tomasi)</managingEditor>
 
Okay, maybe the words webMaster and managingEditor aren’t a perfect fit 
with podcasting, but including an e-mail address for the person responsible for 
this feed as well as the content is an excellent idea. We’ve e-mailed the keepers 
of various feeds to report problems we’ve encountered with their feeds — and 
each one has been very appreciative. Although having that information can help 
improve the podcasting experience for everyone, there have been (and likely will 
be) many feeds that don’t provide contact information. If you make it easy for 
people to help you, you’re ahead of the game. Include a valid e-mail address in 
your feed.
<pubDate> tag
At the <channel> level, the <pubDate> tag indicates the last time the feed 
was updated. It’s very important that you follow the correct convention when 
adding this element — you can’t just put any old date in here.
Getting the <pubDate> (publication date) correct is terribly important, but 
it’s often overlooked by podcasters in a hurry. Don’t fall into this trap. The 
publication date is used by listing sites and directories as a way to show 
fresh content. Don’t be stale; use the publication date, and make sure you do 
it right:
<pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2008 12:02:28 -0800</pubDate>
The <pubDate> element must follow the RFC #822 guidelines (asg.web.
cmu.edu/rfc/rfc822.html), which are simply
[day of week], [day of month] [month] [year] [24 hour time] [time zone (GMT)]

216
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 
Simple as that may be, you have to follow the correct naming convention for 
each of those elements. Table 12-1 shows how.
Table 12-1

The day of the week is always expressed in double digits, adding a zero in 
front of any single-digit numbers (for example, 03 instead of 3), and the year 
is always expressed in four digits. (Well, at least it will be for the next 8,000 
years or so, and then we’ll just have to do something different.)
The big stumbling block with <pubDate> tends to be the time and zone:
 
 Military time: The time should always be expressed in 24-hour or mili-
tary time, (HH:MM:SS). Again, add zeros in front if necessary (for exam-
ple, 03:07:02 is correct).
 
 Time zone: The time zone isn’t represented by everyday abbreviations 
such as PST. Instead, it’s referenced from GMT, or Greenwich Mean 
Time. (That’s a city in England where the International Date Line passes 
through, not a small village on the east coast of the United States.) 
Podcasters in California are in either -0800 or -0700 (that’s 8 or 7 
hours earlier than GMT, respectively) depending on whether Daylight 
Saving Time is in effect.
 
Don’t sweat the timestamp too hard. You should be changing the date every 
time you put up a new episode, but even if you had to hard-code the timestamp 
to 12:00:00 -0800, you wouldn’t have a problem with it. Chances are, your 
RSS 2.0 is generated automatically, so time stamping shouldn’t be an issue.

217
 Chapter 12: Geeking Out on RSS
<category> tag
Though the original drafters of RSS 2.0 had standards in mind, the <category> 
tag has become pretty much a free-for-all. If your podcast has an industry-
recognized category, use that. If not, make it up! That’s what we did in our 
example:
<category>Automotive</category>
<image> tag
This optional RSS tag provides a graphical representation of your podcast. It 
actually contains several elements that further describe the image. They are
 
 URL: The location of your image (in GIF, JPEG, or PNG format) on a Web 
server.
 
 Width: The width of your image, up to 144 pixels.
 
 Height: The height of your image, up to 400 pixels.
 
 Title: This text describes the image, but most people just describe their 
podcast again, because that’s what the image should do anyhow.
 
 Link: The link to your Web site. Just because you needed to put that in 
one more place. Can you say “overkill”?
All these elements, when used together, result in something very much like this:
<image>
  <url>http://mypodcast.com/images/logos/TCCP100x86.jpg</url>
  <width>100</width>
  <height>86</height>
  <title>The Car Collector Podcast</title>
  <link>http://mypodcast.com</link>
</image>
<copyright> tag
Here’s where you can list the copyright information about your podcast. It’s 
free-form text, so be sure to include all the narrative necessary to get your 
copyright information across. We use Creative Commons (more on that in 
Chapter 4) to retain some rights to our podcasts, yet allow for some addi-
tional freedom that’s difficult with conventional “all rights reserved” notices.
<copyright>Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 License</copyright>
<language> tag
Although the file itself is written in the RSS 2.0 flavor of the RSS language, the 
“human language” should also be declared. In our example, we’ve declared 
that our podcast is in English:

218
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 
<language>en-us</language>
If your podcast is not in English, see http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/
tech/stories/storyReader$15 for the appropriate code to use in this 
section.
<docs> tag
This is simply a link to the document that describes what RSS 2.0 is all about. 
This entry is optional, but including it is considered good form. If you do use 
it, just copy the URL in the example — it’s one of the most common. In the 
unlikely event your feed is picked up by a developer who hasn’t adapted his 
application to accept the RSS 2.0 standard, you’re being a good global citizen 
and pointing him in the right direction. Think of this as the Rosetta Stone of 
your podcast feed:
<docs>http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss</docs>
<itunes:subtitle> tag
This is what iTunes uses to populate the Description column of its applica-
tion. It should be a collection of a few choice words about your podcast. We 
recommend simply mirroring the <title> tag:
<itunes:subtitle>The best podcast on the planet. Period. With your host, me!</
itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary> tag
Apple says you have up to 4,000 words in this entry. This content is featured 
prominently when your podcast is selected by someone interested in your 
show. Sounds like a repeat of the <description> tag to us:
<itunes:summary>This podcast blows the doors off all other podcasts. Have a 
listen and leave the others in the dust.</itunes:summary>
<itunes:owner> and <itunes:author> tags
On the surface, it may seem we’re repeating the same thing with <webMaster> 
and <managingEditor> described earlier in this chapter . . . no, wait. This 
is pretty much a repeat of that.
iTunes uses the <itunes:author> tag to power the Artist listing inside of 
iTunes. <itunes:owner> doesn’t publicly display anywhere and is simply 
a way to identify who is responsible for the feed in the event Apple needs to 
contact the party responsible for the feed — such as technical issues, non-
compliance, directory listings, and so on. <itunes:owner> has two subtags: 
<itunes:name> and <itunes:email>.

219
 Chapter 12: Geeking Out on RSS
Here’s how the two tags work together:
<itunes:owner>
    <itunes:email>chuck@mypodcast.com</itunes:email>
    <itunes:name>Chuck Tomasi</itunes:name>
</itunes:owner>
<itunes:author>Chuck Tomasi</itunes:author>
<itunes:category> tags
Pay close attention here because this is another area that gets fouled up 
more times than we care to count. You can’t make this one up — it has to 
follow Apple iTunes categories.
 
Look at the categories inside of iTunes and find out where your podcast 
belongs before adding this tag. iTunes is a free download, and you have to 
install it in order to see what categories you have to choose from. Get it at 
www.apple.com/itunes.
Some categories have subcategories, and both are handled a bit differently 
when it comes to tagging. If you find a subcategory you belong to, you have 
to identify not only the subcategory, but also the parent category. For this 
bogus feed we’ve built, we’ve selected a category/subcategory pair (Games 
& Hobbies:Automotive/Automotive) as well as a category that has no subs 
(Society & Culture:History) so you can see how each is coded:
<itunes:category text=”Games & Hobbies:Automotive”>
      <itunes:category text=”Automotive” />
</itunes:category>
<itunes:category text=”Society & Culture:History” />
Notice how “Automotive” is nested between the beginning and ending 
tags for “Games & Hobbies:Automotive”. Because “Society & 
Culture:History” has no subcategory associated with it, the tag has its 
ending / at the end of a tag, itself, just as you see with “Automotive”.
<itunes:link> tag
Continuing to do its own thing, Apple ignored the RSS <image> tag and came 
up with its own to better match the album art already used within iTunes.
This tag is made up of several different declarations, all of which you must 
follow if you want your artwork to show up inside of iTunes:
 
 rel=“image”: This tells iTunes that the link in question is really an 
image file. It’s not the most intuitive thing in the world, but you work 
with what you have.

220
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 
 
 type=“video/jpeg”: With this tag, iTunes knows that the image is 
a JPEG. Bet you didn’t know that JPEG was originally used as a video 
format. Neither did we. If you decide to use the PNG format, you need 
to change the statement to type=“image/png”. Regardless of your 
format, iTunes recommends images that are 600 x 600 pixels in size.
 
 href=“[URL of your image]”: This is a link to the image.
 
 Yet another title-like statement: Make it easy on yourself and just use the 
name of your podcast.
When it’s all over with, you should have something that looks very much like 
this:
<itunes:link rel=”image” type=”video/jpeg” href=”http://mypodcast.com/images/
logos/TCCP300x300.jpg”>The Car Collector Podcast</itunes:link>
<itunes:explicit> tag
Apple has a kid-friendly reputation to uphold. And because it already has 
a huge 20-million-plus subscriber base, it doesn’t want to allow any unsa-
vory podcasts to fall into the younger hands. Already having developed 
the EXPLICIT tag for songs designed for mature audiences, Apple simply 
extended that tag to the podcasting world.
Three possible values exist for this tag: yes, no, and clean. If you drop 
the F-bomb on your show, fess up and put a yes value in this tag. If you use 
language like you would with your friends, but it’s still safe enough for your 
mom, go ahead and use no. If you’re so squeaky clean that people could eat 
off your podcasting rig, you still include the tag, but your value is clean.
<itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit>
Stating that your podcast uses explicit language excludes anyone under 18 
years old from downloading your podcast, but we wouldn’t want our kids 
using the same computer as we did for that type of podcast.
 
Incorrectly marking your tag with no, or clean, when in fact you drop an 
F-bomb or other bad language could get you rejected or removed from the 
iTunes directory listing.
Loading up on <item>s
Now that the channel has been defined, it’s time to talk about the individual 
items contained within the channel. An item is (in this case) an individual 
podcast episode. If you have three shows available for download on your 
Web site, you have three distinct <item> declarations in your file.

221
 Chapter 12: Geeking Out on RSS
 
Chapter 10 sums up the pros and cons of making all your shows available. If 
you have the server space and the bandwidth to handle it, go right ahead. If 
not, include only the most recent podcasts in your feed. You can control that 
with the items you include in your RSS 2.0 feed.
True to form, each of your podcast episodes starts off with the item declaration: 
<item>.
<title> tag
Much like your channel, each item element also has a title. In this case, it’s 
the title of the episode:
<title>TCCP 013 – Experienced restorer, a peek at a Mustang, and driving a true 
classic.</title>
Some podcasters prefer to put in some recurring text to identify their pod-
cast (in this case, TCCP); others choose not to. It really is a matter of choice.
 
After you decide on a naming convention for your podcast episodes, try 
to stick with it. Listeners grow comfortable with seeing your show display 
on their MP3 players or computer folders in a certain way. If you randomly 
change how you name your episodes, your audience may no longer recognize 
the files as yours. Although there’s no rule against changing, you might want 
to warn your audience before you do so.
<link> tag
Earlier in the chapter, we showed you how to provide a link to your main 
podcast Web site. Here you’re providing a link to the specific page where lis-
teners can find your show notes and other information about this particular 
episode:
<link>http://www.mypodcast.com/tccp013.html</link>
<comments> tag
If you collect and display comments from your listeners on particular epi-
sodes of your podcast, provide a link to that specific page. For many, the 
<comment> URL is the same as the <link> tag. In our example, it’s slightly 
different:
<comments>http://www.mypodcast.com/tccp13.html#comments</comments>
<description> tag
The <description> tag works the same way in the <item> statement as it 
does in the <channel> statement. It’s used to provide detailed information 
about the episode. This is the place for a teaser of what’s in your podcast — 
bigger than the title, but smaller than the full show notes:

Collector Podcast Episode #13</description>
<guid> element
GUID stands for global unique identifier. Well, okay, global may not be the best 
word here, but that’s what it is; don’t worry — you don’t have to pick something 
that’s one-of-a-kind-in-the-entire-universe. But you should pick something that 
makes this entry unique to your RSS file. Here’s an example:
<guid isPermaLink=”false”>1808@http://www.mypodcast.com/</guid>
In this example, a sequential, non-repeating number is added to the beginning of 
the URL of the Web site. Each time a new <item> goes in the file, the number 
is incremented by one. This helps the podcatching clients figure out whether 
a file is new. If a podcatching client has already seen the GUID for this particular 
podcast, it doesn’t download the file. If it has never seen the GUID associated 
with this podcast, it downloads the show.
 
You can generate a GUID lots of ways. In reality, most people use a program to 
help generate the RSS file, and the GUID is automatically taken care of. In the 
event that it isn’t, you can just use the URL of the podcast media file for this 
episode, assuming you use a good filenaming convention and you don’t plan 
on repeating the filename anytime in the future.
<pubDate> tag
This tag shows when the podcast episode was published. Just like in the 
<channel> statement, make sure you follow the right convention. Assuming 
you have more than one <item> in your feed, each item has its own <pubDate>.
<pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2008 12:02:28 -0800</pubDate>
<author> tag
This is simply the e-mail address of the person who created the content. For 
most podcasters, this is the same in each <item> in the feed. But if you’re 
making a compilation where you repurpose content created by others, you 
may want to put their e-mail address in here. The choice is yours:
<author>editor@mypodcast.com</author>

223
 Chapter 12: Geeking Out on RSS
<enclosure> element
Chapter 3 provides a brief rundown of how the <enclosure> element makes 
podcasting possible — but now (finally) we come to that sacred piece of code. 
We hope you’re not too disappointed when you see how simple it is:
<enclosure url=”http://mypodcast.com/media/TCCP013_20080531.mp3” 
length=”24849394” type=”audio/mpeg” />
Hardly seems worth the fuss, does it? Believe it or not, this is the main line 
that makes your podcasts automatically download to your listeners’ desk-
tops and MP3 players. The enclosure tag contains three elements:
 
 url: A link to the podcast media file.
 
 length: The length of the file. In this case, length is synonymous with 
file size, expressed in bytes.
 
 type: The standard MIME type of the media file referenced in the link. 
Podcasting works with a variety of media types. This example is for 
audio files saved in MP3 format. You can enclose video files (and even 
BitTorrent files), but to do that successfully, first determine the appro-
priate MIME type for your preferred media file. A full list of MIME types 
is available at www.iana.org/assignments/media-types. Rather 
than make you wade through all that, we’ll let you know that most audio 
files are either audio/mpeg (for MP3 files) or audio/m4a (for Apple’s 
AAC format used in enhanced podcasts). Video files have a few different 
formats to choose from. Depending on how the file is encoded, you’ll 
want to look it up on the IANA site.
<content:encoded> tag
Earlier we show you how to put a synopsis in your feed by using the 
<description> tag; this is just straight text, without any images, for-
matting, or hyperlinks. The best way to include these extras is to use the 
<content:encoded> tag.
You want a good-quality synopsis on your Web site and in your RSS feed — 
complete with URLs that lead to the various Web sites. So it’s time to do 
something special (okay, sneaky) to avoid breaking any XML laws.
XML is pretty picky about which characters are allowed and which ones aren’t. 
After all, a good synopsis is written to be read by a human being, not an XML 
program — and human language just has a lot more stuff in it. If (for example) 
you want to put in quotes, ampersands, apostrophes, and other characters 
that are considered illegal inside XML, you have to use a Get Out of Jail Free 
card in the form of this statement:

224
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 
<![CDATA[]]>
The <![CDATA[]]> statement informs the XML reader that the contents 
contained within the [ ] symbols are not XML and should not be treated as 
such. Some older XML readers just skip such content altogether. But every 
RSS and XML reader we’ve seen switches over to HTML mode and displays 
the information properly — links, images, and all. As it should be.
So if you really want your description to read “‘There’s trouble & danger 
ahead,’ said the Cap’n” — quirky, isn’t it? — you have two options:
XML-Encoded
<description>&quot;&apos;There&apos;s trouble &amp; danger ahead&quot;, said the 
Cap&apos;n&quot;</description>
Using CDATA
<content:encoded><![CDATA[”’There’s trouble & danger ahead’, said the 
Cap’n”]]></content:encoded>
Now, which way are you going to choose? Both approaches give you the 
same results. One probably gives you a headache.
 
You can go about escaping or encoding illegal characters inside your XML in other 
ways. You can find more information about that in Syndicating Web Sites with 
RSS Feeds For Dummies, or at www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_encoding.asp.
For now, it’s easier to tell the XML reader to lighten up and deal with the text 
as is.
<itunes:author> tag
You guessed it — yet another iTunes tag that looks amazingly like a stan-
dard RSS 2.0 tag. Hey, we didn’t write the spec. We’re just telling you how 
to implement it. In fact, iTunes will use the standard author tag if the 
itunes:author is missing.
<itunes:author>Chuck Tomasi</itunes:author>
<itunes:subtitle> and <itunes:summary> tags
The same rules apply here as did in the <channel> section. In this case, you’re 
describing a single episode of your show in both short and long versions, 
respectively.

225
 Chapter 12: Geeking Out on RSS
    <itunes:subtitle>My recent trip to LA’s antique car auction, plus my

Special thanks to Aiden Somerset from Sun Prairie, WI for allowing

Download The Car Collector Podcast Episode #13</itunes:summary>
<itunes:category> tags
Just as with the <channel> section (see the earlier section “<itunes:category> 
tags”), it’s important to get this right. Use the categories iTunes has available, 
not just any categories. Oddly, we’ve learned that episode-specific catego-
ries (those within the <item> and </item> tags) aren’t used for anything in 
iTunes — yet. We include them here to be good podcast citizens.
<itunes:category text=”Games & Hobbies:Automotive”>
      <itunes:category text=”Automotive” />
</itunes:category>
<itunes:category text=”Society & Culture:History” />
<itunes:duration> tag
Finally — something brand new with an iTunes-specific tag! Remember that 
iTunes was originally a music-distribution system. As such, the length of a 
particular song displays next to the title. Podcasters too are asked to provide 
this information. It follows the HH:MM:SS format.
 
If you use software to help build your file, you may not be able to figure out 
the exact duration of your individual podcasts. iTunes has no way to verify 
this data, so you can just hard-code a ballpark figure of your average podcast 
length.
<itunes:duration>00:45:00</itunes:duration>
<itunes:explicit> tag
Here’s an implementation from iTunes that makes a lot of sense. If your pod-
cast normally doesn’t include any questionable language or subject matter, 
go ahead and mark the channel with an explicit tag of no. However, if a 
particular episode does get a little on the raunchy side, you can use this tag 
inside a particular <item> and </item> pair to mark just the single episode.
 
Even if you know all your podcasts episodes follow the same explicit label set 
forth in the <channel>, you still need to include it here:
<itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit>

226
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 
<itunes:keywords> tag
One would think this tag helps people searching in iTunes find your podcast, 
but in reality, iTunes gets most of that information from the title, description, 
and summary information. Apple recommends minimizing the use of the key-
words tag and using it for things like common misspellings of your name or 
show. To prevent keyword abuse, Apple only indexes the first 12 keywords in 
this tag.
Separate keywords by commas and add in as many as you see fit:
    <itunes:keywords>tomassi,thomasi</itunes:keywords>
Wrapping things up
As with any other markup language (and as indicated earlier in this chapter), 
you have to close those declaration tags. The closing tag looks like this:
</item>
This tag tells the podcatching client that the end of the episode has been 
reached. After you close your <item> tag, you can immediately add a 
second, and a third, and so on. There is no limit to the number of <items> 
you can have inside your RSS feed.
After you add all the episodes inside their own <item> </item> statement, 
it’s time to finish the file:
</channel>
</rss>
These two lines of text bring to a close your <channel> declaration and 
mark the end of the RSS 2.0 file itself.
 
You should have no further text after these two statements. This really is the end 
of your file. If you have extra text hanging around after you close your </rss> 
tag, delete it. Or better yet, figure out where you wanted to put it in one of the 
elements — and put it there.
Tweaking the Contents
The main function of your RSS 2.0 file is to distribute your media files to the 
various people who have subscribed to your feed. However, it’s a smart 
podcaster who recognizes that a well-formed RSS feed can be employed for a 
wider range of needs.

227
 Chapter 12: Geeking Out on RSS
Adding keywords and tags
Although all the elements of a well-formed RSS 2.0 file are important, it’s 
the <title> and the <description> content that are the most useful 
for listeners — be they current or potential. As a podcaster, it’s your job 
to create descriptions and titles that are both relevant to your content and 
intriguing to your listening audience.
As discussed in Chapter 11, keywords are important. Rather than making 
stuff up again, this time we use real-world examples to illustrate the point. One 
of your humble authors hosts several podcasts. One of the shows features 
topics about tech, science, sci-fi, and other nerdy subjects. Another show 
deals exclusively with a popular online mail application; yet another is really 
more about . . . well, whatever fits the podcaster’s mood.
Understanding that each of these shows appeals to a completely different 
audience, the podcaster employs very different strategies when providing 
information about these shows. But as different as these strategies are, they 
follow a similar theme: Tell listeners what they want to hear.
No, we’re not suggesting you lie or stretch the truth about the content of your 
podcasts. Instead, practice thinking like a listener. What do you think listeners 
want to hear? Then consider why you did this episode in the first place: Who 
would be interested in listening, and why? After you figure all that out, it’s 
time to start writing descriptive keywords and adding them to your <title> 
and <description> declarations.
 
Whether or not you heard it here first, the ability to change the contents of 
your RSS file is critical to your success as a podcaster. Before you select a 
hosting company or blogging software that manages your RSS 2.0 file for you, 
ask some important questions about modifying that file. (By and large, we’d 
say take a pass on companies that don’t allow do-it-yourself changes to your 
RSS 2.0 file or template.)
Making newcomers feel welcome
Think back to when you were a new podcast listener or, perhaps, consider 
the last time you added a podcast to your podcatching client. Did you know 
what you were getting yourself into? Perhaps someone recommended the 
show to you, and you already had a feel for what it was you could expect. But 
maybe not.
For a lot of new people just starting out as podcast listeners, there is a large 
gulf of uncertainty and concern they have to get over before subscribing to 
a new podcast. By subscribing to your feed, a listener is putting a significant 
amount of trust in you, the podcaster. Don’t forget that podcasting means 

228
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 
your subscribers automatically receive any and all podcast media files you 
make available, regardless of what’s in them or how big they are.
How large will these files be? How often will they be coming down? What can 
I expect out of the content? Can I listen in front of my kids? Will the file size 
overload my hard drive?
These and a slew of other questions invade the mind of every person thinking 
about taking the plunge and subscribing to your podcast. And these concerns 
stay on the minds of those who bit the bullet and subscribed for at least the 
first few weeks. Your job, then, is to find ways to make those listeners feel 
comfortable so they keep listening. Stay tuned (as it were). . . . 
You have two options to address these concerns: 
 
 Place a short audio file or block of HTML on your Web site: Describe 
what the show is, the run time, and how often you expect to offer a new 
show. This is commonly referred to as “episode 0” and released as the 
first show in the feed.
 
 Address these same items as part of your show: “Listen every week for 
an exciting hour of outdoor news, product reviews, and discussion from 
the man who’s been in the business for over 30 years.” Within 10 seconds, 
the listener knows exactly what to expect.
If you find your listeners still have questions, try to provide answers. 
Sometimes this comes in the form of e-mail, sometimes blog or forum replies, 
or adapt your show description content mentioned earlier. If you want to be 
a little more proactive, you could also set up an FAQ (frequently asked ques-
tions) page for Web visitors to read and review.
Make your RSS feed easy to find
Podcast still has a “geek factor” to it. As a result of that, you’re going to have 
to do whatever you can to make it easy for people to find, and subscribe to, 
your show.
If you want to convert casual listeners in to loyal subscribers, make it as easy 
for them to subscribe to your show as possible. A little link in an obscure 
place on your Web page just isn’t going to do the job. Remember, podcasting 
is as much about marketing you and your podcast as it is about the technical 
details. iTunes and Zune now offer a way to put an icon/link on your Web site 
so that people can subscribe with a single click — once your podcast is listed 
in those directories. Now that’s simple!

229
 Chapter 12: Geeking Out on RSS
To add a link on your Web site, follow these steps:
 
1. Search for your podcast in the iTunes Store or in Zune. 
 
2. When you have the screen with just your show’s details displayed, 
right-click your podcast icon and choose Copy. 
 
 What you’re copying looks kind of like this:
zune://subscribe/?MyPodcast=http://mysite.com/myfeed.xml
 
3. Paste your show’s URL i.nto the HTML for your Web site.
 
 Now, you’ve given listeners a simple way to find your show.
 
You can make a one-click subscription for iTunes listeners by changing your 
URL slightly. After copying and pasting the URL, change the http to itpc. 
Now when someone clicks the link, instead of being taken to your podcast 
listing in the iTunes Music Store, your podcast will automatically be added to 
their iTunes podcast list.
 
For most other software packages besides iTunes or Zune, a standard RSS 
badge with a link to your feed works well, but you rely on the user to copy the 
URL manually in to a podcatching client.
Multiple-Show File Strategies
You may just catch the podcasting bug hard. It’s so easy to create a podcast 
that you’ll want to do more. Soon you may find yourself doing three shows a 
week, each with slightly different content and topics, each appealing to a 
different audience.
Make it easy to listen
One strategy used by many podcasters is to 
have an audio player on the site. You can do 
this in a variety of ways — plug-ins to your blog 
software or Flash players. These players allow 
people to listen to your material without the 
bother of a podcatching client. For some pod-
casters, it’s difficult to comprehend that despite 
the fact that they’ve spent a lot of time setting 
up an RSS feed, a fair percentage of listeners 
are still listening straight from the Web site. 
Don’t be like those podcasters: Make it easy for 
listeners to click and listen. One popular way is 
to use the PodPress (www.podpress.org) 
plug-in to WordPress. Adding the podcast file 
is trivial and includes a Flash player for each 
episode.

230
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 
One possible situation might be that you have diverging content — you begin 
to hear from your listeners that Monday’s show is right up their alley, but 
Wednesday’s coverage of different material isn’t their cup of tea. You get plenty 
of e-mail and voice mail with the opposite viewpoint, and a good many listeners 
say they love everything you’re doing.
Another situation might be to offer special content. Give the listener some-
thing above and beyond your regular content for those die-hard loyal fans 
who are willing to contribute a little information such as demographics or 
e-mail address for your members-only newsletter list.
How can you make all these people happy? Simple. Multiple feeds. 
Manager Tools (http://manager-tools.com) is one example of a podcast 
with multiple feeds. Its primary feed of useful management advice is avail-
able to the public without obligation. It also offer a “members only” feed with 
a monthly extra. To receive this separate feed, the subscriber needs to give 
his or her e-mail address — that’s it. In addition to the members-only audio 
content, the subscriber also gets a regular newsletter, pre-announcements to 
conferences, and other items. Manager Tools also has something called “pre-
mium content,” which is available for an annual fee. 
When you’ve figured out how to customize your feed, it should be easy to 
break out a second (or third) feed, isolating the content as appropriate. 
You need to check the documentation of your blogging software or RSS-
generation tool to see what steps are necessary.

 Finding conversations on the Web
 Handling listener feedback
C
ommunication can be defined in a multitude of overly complex ways. 
For the sake of argument (and not to copy each and every dictionary 
entry we can find), we define the term as
The exchange of information between two points.
Note that last part — between two points. To us, this implies a bi-directional 
flow of information, to and from both parties.
If you’ve had the pleasure (note how well we can say that with a straight face) 
of attending any productivity or team-building seminars, the presenters really 
drive the message home: Effective communication is not a one-way street.
Over the past few years, podcasting has evolved as a more effective com-
munication than traditional media (such as radio or television). We all have 
same tools to communicate at our disposal — e-mail, Web sites, phone lines — 
so why do podcast listeners seem to get more involved with podcasting? Two 
simple reasons 
 
 There seems to be a closer bond between podcast listener and podcast 
producer. The simple fact that anyone can do this makes the producer 
seem more like a real person than a personality and easier to relate to.
 
 The podcasters are asking for the feedback — and getting it. Audience 
size doesn’t matter. We’ve seen some instances of shows with a couple 
hundred loyal followers where the podcaster has to spin off a second 
show just to handle the listener feedback. When was the last time you 
heard of a “listener feedback show” for American Idol?

234
Part IV: Start Spreadin’ the News About Your Podcast 
In this chapter, we show you some real-world examples of how to foster com-
munication between you and your audience, touching on a variety of meth-
ods and venues you probably haven’t considered.
Gathering Listener Feedback
It must be a natural human reaction to fear the opinions of others. Perhaps 
it’s insecurity, but we think it has more to do with our culture’s constant rein-
forcement of the “How are you?” — “I’m fine. You?” — “Fine.” meaningless 
chatter that precedes most of our conversations.
That cultural crutch, however, is left next to Tiny Tim’s seat when it comes 
to podcasting. Listeners, for whatever reason, are compelled to actually give 
real and meaningful criticism. And podcasters, for the most part, take to 
heart those responses.
Of course, we’re speaking in general terms. Yes, there are flamers and jerks 
out there with less than helpful answers at the ready. Podcasting can’t 
change basic human nature for the ill-evolved, unfortunately.
You can foster good communication with your listening audience in a multi-
tude of ways, such as
 
 Allowing and responding to comments on your blog
 
 Creating and visiting online discussion groups and forums
 
 Responding to listener e-mail
 
 Exploring online social networks
 
 Leveraging voice mail
All of these avenues are discussed in detail in the sections that follow.
Fostering Comments on Your Blog
In an ideal world, all communication, feedback, rants, and raves about your 
show would take place in a neat little box, keeping things nice and tidy for 
you. But because that won’t happen, your best bet is to build a Web site that 
both enables and encourages the communication in your own backyard.

235
 Chapter 13 Speaking Directly to Your Peeps
In Chapters 11 and 12, we demonstrate how much simpler adding show notes 
and generating RSS files are for those podcasters who use blogging software, 
rather than those who try to do everything by hand. Well, here’s one more 
feather in the cap of blogging software such as WordPress, Blogger, and even 
Movable Type: Feedback mechanisms come pre-installed.
In the world of blogs, this feedback mechanism is referred to as comments. 
Visit just about any blog you can find, read a post, and you’re likely to find a 
small Comments link at the bottom. Figure 13-1 shows one example, though 
the treatment varies widely from site to site.
 
If you’re already using a blog, you usually don’t have to do anything special 
to turn on the comments feature. Most software comes configured to accept 
comments by default. If you decide comments are not for you or your podcast, 
turning off that capability is simply a matter of finding the right check box.
Some podcasters get dozens of responses per episode. Some get none. 
Although there is some relation to the size of your listening audience and the 
number of comments you’re likely to receive, it really has more to do with 
the connection users feel they have with your podcast.
 
Figure 13-1: 
The 
Bitterest 
Pill gets 
quite a few 
comments 
on each 
episode.
 

236
Part IV: Start Spreadin’ the News About Your Podcast 
Much like two co-workers chatting about last night’s The Daily Show with Jon 
Stewart, two or more listeners using your Web site to talk to each other about 
your show speaks to the attachment they feel to what you have to say (or 
play). From the very first moments of attachment, you can nurture for your 
podcast its own community. Here are some simple ways we recommend to 
foster your following:
 
 Mention that you have comments on the blog either as a standard prac-
tice as part of the show — part of the intro, outro, or break perhaps.
 
 Include a line in your e-mail signature.
 
 Ask questions during the show and direct listeners to your blog to leave 
their comments or opinions.
 
 Actively respond to received comments.
Communication develops amongst the listening community itself. Rather than 
talking to you, listeners start talking to each other, and the conversation takes 
on a life of its own. If this happens to you, don’t fret over it; encourage it! For 
example, on Jack Mangan’s Deadpan Podcast (http://jackmangan.com) 
blog, the comments on individual blog posts consistently reach well into the 
hundreds, and the comments may begin on one topic from the show only to 
break off into a tangent of their own. Other times, it may become quick banter 
between listeners. With Jack at the helm, the activity has become so lively 
the podcast now has a regular segment where Jack uses a 20-sided die to pick 
several comments at random to read on the show. This kind of interaction 
between host and listeners has now created a Deadpan community that meets 
regularly on this blog to share links, feedback, and random thoughts.
 
Sometimes, the comments that take on lives of their own mutate into hostile 
takeovers, and the conversation is lost amidst an onslaught of personal attacks 
either to other posters or to you, the podcast’s and blog’s host. Neither your 
community nor you need this kind of conversation. You may want to consider 
moderating blog comments. Moderating still allows people to post comments, 
but you get to approve those comments for public consumption. When some-
one posts a comment, you get an e-mail. With a couple mouse clicks, you can 
chose whether to approve it. You have to do a little more work, but moderating 
ensures all comments meet your quality standards.
You may find your name or podcast mentioned other places on the Internet 
via search engines (discussed later in this chapter). We recommend you get 
engaged with those discussions as well. Be sure to check back in a couple 
days for additional follow-ups, or if you are responding to a blog comment or 
forum, check to see if they have an option to alert you to replies.

237
 Chapter 13 Speaking Directly to Your Peeps
Starting an Online Discussion Group
Community forums, groups, and discussion lists — also known as e-mail lists, 
mailing lists, or distribution lists — allow for easy virtual community build-
ing, enabling disparate people to share their thoughts and opinions on a wide 
variety of subjects. You can find many free services to create a place where 
listeners can post, share, and discuss their thoughts and ideas online.
 
As easy as it is to create places for these types of conversations to occur, 
someone else may have already done it. Spend some quality time searching 
the Internet for your name and your show. Maybe a devoted fan has already 
done the not-so-heavy lifting for you.
Although the number of free online discussion groups is legion, we’ve decided 
to focus on two of the larger offerings: Yahoo! Groups and Google Groups. Both 
are free to join and create, but both are supported by various forms of adver-
tising. There ain’t no such thing as a free lunch, as Heinlein said.
 
Remember when we said podcasting has an element of marketing with it? 
Here’s another opportunity to take your name to the people. Using a large 
service like Yahoo! or Google means your information is available to a lot of 
potential listeners. They may find your discussion list and become interested 
in your podcast, rather than the other way around.
Yahoo! Groups
Yahoo! Groups has the distinction of being one of the oldest and most widely 
used free discussion groups on the Net. Although it may not have been first 
on the block, it has stood the test of time, and many consider it the 800-pound 
gorilla on the block. Yahoo! Groups also boasts of a huge user base, which can 
help your fledgling group swell in size rapidly.
Setting up a group is quick and easy; just follow these steps:
 
1. Log in to Yahoo! Groups at http://groups.yahoo.com.
 
 If you already have an account, enter your Yahoo! ID and password.
 
 If you don’t have a Yahoo! ID yet, click the Sign Up link and follow the 
simple instructions to get your free Yahoo! account.
 
 When you’re logged in, you can find a list of all the groups you’ve either 
created or belong to on the left side of the page. Of course, if you’re in 
Yahoo! Groups for the first time, this area is empty.
 
2. To start a new group, click the Start Your Group link near the top of 
the page.

238
Part IV: Start Spreadin’ the News About Your Podcast 
 
3. Select the appropriate category and subcategory for your group. Then 
click the Place My Group Here button.
 
 As you select categories, you’re presented with subcategories to refine 
your group’s placement. You can stop after the first subgroup or con-
tinue selecting links until you find the appropriate categorization for 
your group.
 
4. Enter the appropriate information in the Group Name, Group Email 
Address, and Describe Your Group text boxes. When you’re finished, 
click Continue.
 
 See Figure 13-2 for an example of a page that’s been filled out.
 
 The Group Email address is the e-mail address members of your group 
will use to send messages to the entire group. You get to make up this 
address; we suggest making it something simple and easy to remem-
ber. Acronyms are a good idea here, as are any abbreviations or secret 
words that your group members are likely to remember.
 
5. Select which Yahoo! Profile and Email Address you want associated 
with this group.
 
 Because you’re setting up the group, you are the Owner (which gives 
you phenomenal cosmic powers like kicking people out if they get out 
of line). If you have multiple Yahoo! IDs, you need to associate one with 
this group. And if you have more than one e-mail address, Yahoo! needs 
to know where to send the mail.
 
6. In the Word Verification text box, type the letters that are displayed in 
the accompanying image.
 
 Yahoo! Groups asks you to type the letters to help prevent e-mail spam — 
which is a good thing, right? Oh, and it’s case-sensitive, so make sure 
you use capital letters where appropriate.
 
7. When you’re done, click Continue.
 
 That’s it! You’ve just created your group.
 
Figure 13-2: 
Yahoo! 
Groups 
allows you 
to describe 
your group 
with a little 
text or a lot.
 

239
 Chapter 13 Speaking Directly to Your Peeps
From here, you can set how much control and flexibility you want to 
have over the group, as well as the ease at which others can join. Yahoo! 
leaves some things pretty open, yet locks down others. Be sure to follow the 
Customize Your Group link to make sure that the settings are to your liking. If 
not, change them! If you need to make changes later, start at http://groups.
yahoo.com, click your group name in the My Groups, and then click the 
Management link.
When you’re happy with your group, click the Invite People to Join link and 
tell everyone you know about your new group. Well, maybe not everyone. 
But you should tell the folks who might be interested. You can also send an 
e-mail — or better tell listeners in your podcast about your new group.
 
An invitation is something you send to notify people about an event or new 
service, in this case your Yahoo! group. Sending an invitation to 1,000 people 
is likely an unsolicited e-mail. Chances are good that recipients aren’t expect-
ing this mail from you. That makes it look suspiciously like spam, and people 
are likely to just delete it. When you send your invitations, don’t send them to 
folks you don’t know and make sure the mail is personal enough to let them 
know the message is not spam from some faceless person.
Google Groups
Not to be outdone, Google has released a service similar to Yahoo! Groups. 
Google is quickly becoming the dominant player in many online initiatives 
after its successful Gmail launch in early 2004. Here’s how to create a Google 
group:
 
1. Sign in to your Google account at http://groups.google.com.
 
 If you’re already registered with Google, enter your e-mail address and 
password to log in to Google.
 
 If you don’t have a Google account, the sign up process is free and easy.
 
2. Click Create a Group on the right side of the screen.
 
3. In the corresponding text boxes, type the Group Name, Group E-mail 
Address, and Group Description.
 
 The group e-mail address is the e-mail address members of your group 
will use to send messages to the entire group. Google helps by suggest-
ing an e-mail address based on the name of your group. You can change 
the e-mail name if you’re not happy with it.
 
4. Set the Access Level for your group.
 
 If you want the maximum usage of your group, select the Public level. Of 
course, you may have reasons to select a more restrictive access level, 
and we’re certainly not going to stand in your way. One of the options 
also allows you to deem your group Adults Only or open to all ages.

240
Part IV: Start Spreadin’ the News About Your Podcast 
 
5. Click the Create My Group button.
 
 You’ve now created your group and are all set to invite new members. 
Google Groups makes this an integral step in the creation of the group, 
whereas Yahoo! Groups makes it more of an option.
 
6. In the large text box at the top of the page, enter the e-mail addresses 
of the people you’d like to have in your group. Then select the Add or 
Invite option button, depending on what action you want to take.
 
 It’s a better idea to invite people than to automatically add them to your 
new group.
 
 If you choose to automatically add members to your group, e-mail mes-
sages from the group will show up unannounced in the recipients’ mail 
boxes, unless you told them in advance. That’s spam, pure and simple. 
Unless you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that the person you 
intend to add wants to be a member of your group, invite that person 
instead. That gives them the option to join or not and makes you a 
better netizen.
 
7. Select a subscription type and write a welcome message. When you’re 
finished, click Done.
 
 The default subscription type is to have e-mail sent individually to 
members that have joined your group. We suggest leaving this setting 
right where it is and allowing the members to change it to their personal 
preference at their discretion. Some prefer the Digest Form option, and 
some prefer No E-mail at all. Leave it up to them.
To access your group in the future, simply go to http://groups.google.
com and your group is listed in the My Groups section. To make changes, 
click the Manage link next to the group title.
Publicizing your group
After you create your online discussion group and send your initial invita-
tions, it’s time to spread the word! In Chapter 14, we go into a longer conver-
sation about publicizing you, your podcast, and everything you do to support 
that. But for now, here are a few tips on how to increase membership in your 
discussion group:
 
 Publish the group information on your Web site. Log in to your Google 
or Yahoo! account to find the URL for your group home page and/or your 
subscription e-mail address. Post this information prominently on your 
podcast’s Web site.

241
 Chapter 13 Speaking Directly to Your Peeps
 
 Add the group information to your signature line on outbound 
e-mails. Let each e-mail you send out act as a mini-advertisement for 
your discussion group. Provide a link to the home page as well as the 
subscription e-mail address.
 
 Promote the group on your podcast. Find time to mention the group 
on each episode of your podcast. Don’t make an entire show about why 
someone should join the group, but do talk about the ability to have 
stimulating conversations with other listeners as well as yourself.
Focusing on Online Forums
While quite useful in some situations, discussion groups can be a little confusing 
to follow, especially when the topic of your show is complicated and multifac-
eted. This is compounded by the time-shifting nature of podcasting, causing your 
listeners to be a week or more behind the listening schedule from one another. 
How are you going to handle conversations that span timelines and topics? We 
suggest giving forums a shot.
An online forum allows individuals to post their thoughts and ideas on a vari-
ety of topics — at their own choosing. Through a concept known as thread-
ing, multiple discussions can exist independently of all the others. Topics 
can get buried quickly in a mailing list like those mentioned in the previous 
section. Forums work differently, keeping all threads and topics available for 
clutter-free commenting at any time.
Finding free, hosted forums
Using a hosted forum, like a hosted blog, takes away much of the burden of 
downloading, installing, and configuring the software. On the other hand, 
you don’t have quite the flexibility with a hosted solution as you would 
with a package you host yourself. One of the easier hosted forums to use is 
ProBoards. To get started, just follow these steps:
 
1. Browse to www.proboards.com.
 
 If you have a ProBoards account, enter your username and password.
 
 If you don’t have an account, click the Sign Up link.
 
2. Create a username.
 
 Choose carefully. Your username becomes part of the URL that followers 
will navigate to. We suggest using your show name as the username.

242
Part IV: Start Spreadin’ the News About Your Podcast 
 
3. Enter the remaining information in the form.
 
 Provide a password, your name, e-mail address, and category for your 
topic.
 
4. Click Sign Up.
 
 Information regarding your newly created forum will be displayed including 
the URL to publish, your administrator account, and password. That’s it! 
You’ve created a new forum, like the one shown in Figure 13-3.
 
5. Customize the forum.
 
 Click the Admin link at the top of the screen, and you can create new 
boards, categories, and other customizations to create a framework 
around which discussions can happen. For example, visitors will find it 
easier to find information about where to get car parts if that discussion 
is kept separate from auction values for classic vehicles.
 
6. Send invitations.
 
 Using the same etiquette as a distribution list, let the world know your 
forums are available. You can send an e-mail or announce it on your podcast.
 
 Again, keep in mind the issue of how some people might see invitations 
as spam. If you missed that discussion, check out the “Yahoo! Groups” 
section, earlier in the chapter.
 
Figure 13-3: 
ProBoards 
offers free 
forum 
hosting that

243
 Chapter 13 Speaking Directly to Your Peeps
That’s it! You can now customize your forum, start new posts, and spread 
the word of your newly created forum. Much like discussion groups, you can 
promote your forum by
 
 Posting the address on your Web site
 
 Adding the address to your e-mail signature line
 
 Mentioning the forum on each of your podcast episodes
Other hosted forums are available. You can find plenty of options by entering 
hosted forums into a Google search. Most are supported by Web ads or vol-
untary donations. 
 
Like discussion groups, forums take some time to build steam. Be persistent, 
post every day, and constantly encourage your listeners to interact with you 
and your podcast in this manner. But above all, be patient!
Now, although your forum performs admirably — for free — it most likely 
doesn’t have The Look (and you know what we mean by The Look) of other 
online forums. Popular podcasts also host forums that sport a spit-polished 
look, interfaces that make posting and replying easy-peasy, and little details 
peppered throughout that make you think “Wow, I’d love to have a forum 
that does that!”
You can . . . but a bit more effort (and investment) is needed. See the following 
section.
Gaining more control of your forum
After a time, you may find yourself wishing for more control of your lively 
forum. Perhaps you’d like to implement the look and feel (branding) of your 
Web site on the forum, eliminate the advertisements you get with the free 
service, or more tightly integrate your forum into your overall Web presence. 
When that happens, it’s time to think about installing some forum software 
on your Web site.
Here we go with the tech stuff again. We’re not going to go into great detail 
on how to install and configure forum software on your Web server. But we 
give you some things to think about when wrestling with the decision of 
using free forum software or dropping some cash on one you can purchase.
There’s the old saying: Why should I pay for the cow when I get the milk for 
free? Choosing between a free or paid solution depends on many factors, at 
the top of which are your level of technical prowess and tolerance for down

time. Like anything in life, there are tradeoffs with each option. Consider this 
checklist:
 
 Are you comfortable editing PHP or Perl scripts?
 
 Do you have the ability to create new MySQL databases?
 
 Can you change the permissions of files and directories on your Web server?
 
 Are you willing to continually seek out patches and updates to keep the 
hackers out?

If you answered No to one or more of the preceding questions, you probably 
aren’t ready to tackle installing your own forum software.
If you answered Yes to all the preceding questions — except for the last one, 
and, by the way, the answer is Tallinn — you don’t mind getting your hands 
dirty. We recommend finding out what forum software your hosting company 
already has pre-configured on your Web server, if any. If your hosting company 
doesn’t have a forum pre-configured for your system, start searching through 
the multitude of options out there ready for downloading and installing. You 
can also visit some existing podcast sites that use forums and ask them what 
they use, what they like (or dislike), and perhaps some of the technical details. 
One option for your own forum is to look into open source solutions that 
many podcasters implement on their sites. For the Fear the Boot guys of www.
feartheboot.com, their forums are powered by phpBB (www.phpBB.com), 
a download that needs only your Web host to support PHP (a programming 
language that gives site developers methods of creating dynamic content that 
interact with databases) and databases in order to work. Although knowing 
PHP helps you use phpBB to create a better forum, it isn’t a pre-requisite. With 
its built-in GUI (graphic user interface), phpBB can do quite a lot for you, even 
if you know nothing about PHP. It’s a bit like working with the WordPress blog-
ging software in that you can use what phpBB provides or go beyond it with a 
background in PHP.
Adam Pinilla carries the responsibility of making sure the Fear the Boot forums 
are online and running (see Figure 13-4). He says, “Forums are a direct link to 
the fans. While podcasting in itself is one-way communication, forums are a 
direct avenue for fan interaction, and it keeps people around.” For him, mod-
erating a forum takes only three to four hours a week for troubleshooting, 

245
 Chapter 13 Speaking Directly to Your Peeps
answering user requests, and keeping the spammers and forum troublemak-
ers at bay. Four hours is a modest investment considering the return is a 
strong community of Fear the Boot listeners.
As far as his investment of time as a forum participant, Adam clocks in any-
where between 20 to 25 hours on a weekly basis. “I have grown quite fond of 
our community,” he admits.
Like blog comments, you might find your name or podcast being thrown 
around other forums. We highly suggest you sign up and participate in the 
discussion. Respond to the comments — positive or negative. (See the sec-
tion about not-so-positive comments later in this chapter.)
 
Like many other things on the Internet, the most popular software is often 
the biggest target of attacks from spam and hacking — that includes phpBB. 
You might want to choose a “path less traveled” like Simple Machines Forum 
(http://www.simplemachines.org) that is very secure and easy to set up.

Online Social Networking
Social networking Web sites are online communities that are made up of 
online profiles and pages for individuals. They can serve as one-stop shops 
for when you pay a visit, or combine popular forms of communication into 
a hybrid that gives you all the best features. These sites have been online 
longer than podcasting has been in existence, but the podcasters have now 
taken these sites to new levels of application.
We cover only a few of the networks available. Yes, there are many more than 
the ones highlighted here, but these are the ones getting a lot of the attention.
 
You can find plenty more social networking sites out there, and many more 
will probably appear (and disappear) in the time it takes this book to reach 
your hands. What’s important is finding the network or networks that can get 
the word of your listeners back to you, help you create a better show, and 
make you a better podcaster.
MySpace
If iTunes is the King Kong of the podcasting clients, MySpace (www.myspace
.com) is the Mighty Joe Young of the social networking sites. With a stag-
gering membership of over 200 million users, MySpace remains the social 
networking juggernaut. What makes it so popular is what it offers in one 
location: a blog, an instant messenger, a bulletin board, a comment board, an 
online forum host, and a mail service. If you don’t feel like monitoring numer-
ous applications or maintaining various Web sites, and do like to keep every-
thing in one location, MySpace is your economic space saver online. You can 
cultivate communities, set up your own group, and keep in touch with your 
listeners using MySpace. 
If you choose to set up a MySpace account, check out MySpace For Dummies 
by Ryan Hupfer, Mitch Maxson, and Ryan Williams to really get the most out 
of MySpace.
Facebook
At first glance, Facebook (www.facebook.com) may strike you as a MySpace 
version 2.0, but Facebook goes beyond offering a blog, bulletin board, a mail 
service, and an online scrapbook. Facebook gives registered users the abil-
ity to create online groups where comments can be circulated across others’ 

247
 Chapter 13 Speaking Directly to Your Peeps
networks as well as your own. You can also customize your Facebook with 
add-on applications that promotes an even greater interaction with your 
community. You can even set up a Facebook account to be an online, one-
stop bulletin board of events that your listeners can check to not only see 
what’s coming up next on your podcast but also give feedback on previous 
episodes.
For more information on Facebook, pick up a copy of Facebook For Dummies 
by Carolyn Abram and Leah Pearlman.
Ning
What sets this new player apart from others is that Ning is not as all-
encomassing as either MySpace or Facebook. With the other two services 
opening their doors to the great big Internet out there, Ning (www.ning.
com) allows a moderator to start up a meeting place for a specific commu-
nity. This site combines the power of forums with the invitation-only exclu-
sivity of an online discussion group. Figure 13-5 shows the Podiobooks.com 
Community powered by Ning; the feedback and discussion are geared for 
only the interested (and invited) members of the podcast novel listeners. So 
instead of creating a community in the Podcast directory, you can set up a 
community specific for your podcast. After you have an exclusive network 
created, you can then open discussions specific to issues pertaining to your 
topic.

Twitter 
Twitter (http://twitter.com) is the unassuming service that is a fantas-
tic and instantaneous way of beginning conversations, garnering feedback, 
and getting word out about your podcast while not becoming a distraction 
or time-sink from your productivity. Twitter, either through its Web site or 
through a third-party application, such as TwitBin (www.twitbin.com) or 
Twitterific (http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific), gives 
you 140 characters to say anything. You can use Twitter to direct people to 
your blog when a new show posts. Listeners can post (or tweet) what they’re 
listening to and comment on it. From various tweets, topics can be created 
on the blog or forums, resources can be cited, and quick announcements can 
reach a wide variety of listeners in moments. 
Twitter is best described as a nanoblog, giving you the instant gratification of 
posting a comment but giving you only 140 characters to do it, keeping you 
from losing your intent in a drawn-out posting. It’s based on the premise of 
answering the question “What are you doing?” If you find someone is listen-
ing to your podcast, ask them for feedback. Good or bad, begin a simple chat 
and ask for the opinions of others in your network. Feel free to post teasers 
on the next episodes, ask for validation from comments found elsewhere, and 
tweet links back to other comments and URLs sent in from listeners.
Using Voice Mail
One of the strengths of podcasting is that the content is so portable. That 
means your listener is quite likely to be away from a computer while listening 
to your podcast — making the interaction more difficult. Plenty of people, 
including your authors, listen to podcasts during their commute to work or 
on road trips. How do you get comments from those listeners? Simple, have 
them call in.
Mobile phones are very ubiquitous. It’s a fair assumption that if your listener 
has a portable media device, they likely have a mobile phone also — some-
times they are the same device. If you want those listeners to give you feed-
back, give them a number to call. Many podcasters have set up a number 
through K7 (k7.net). K7 lets people call and leave a message. A copy of that 
message is then e-mailed to you. 
To set up a “listener line”, follow these steps:
 
1. Go to k7.net and click the Sign Up link at the top of the screen.
 
2. Give the e-mail address you want your messages sent to (twice for 
validation).

249
 Chapter 13 Speaking Directly to Your Peeps
 
3. Provide a security code in the event you cannot login.
 
4. Check the options for how you want your messages.
 
 Messages can be e-mailed to you, saved on the server for you to retrieve 
later, or both.
 
5. Choose your file format.
 
 We recommend you choose PCM. The files are a little bigger, but quality 
is a bit better too.
 
6. Click Submit.
 
 You are issued a phone number. Now get the word out! Post that puppy 
on your Web site, include it in your e-mail signature, mention it in your 
podcast. You know the drill!
 
K7’s service is based in Seattle Washington (United States). While it isn’t free 
to callers outside the local Seattle area, most mobile plans have more minutes 
than a person is likely to use in a month.
 
K7 numbers are disabled after six months of inactivity. If you set up a number, 
and don’t get a lot of feedback you could find yourself advertising a phone 
number for someone else. We recommend calling your own number every 
month or so if you find you’re not getting a lot of calls.
Okay, K7 is fine and dandy if you’re calling from the United States, but let’s 
not forget that podcasting can reach anyone anywhere. How do you get in 
touch with the listeners from Australia, South Africa, or Tierra del Fuego? 
For about $1 per month, you can add a service to Skype to get voice mail. 
Listeners can use their computer to call your Skype voice mail from any-
where in the world for free — well, free for them.
You may find yourself with so much voice mail that you’ll have to do what 
several podcasters have done and create a separate show for their listener 
feedback. Listeners, including your authors, often get a kick out of hearing 
their comments aired before the world.
Seeking Out the Comments of Others
There’s an old saying about the best-laid plans of mice and men (and how 
they often go awry). Although some doubt exists in our minds as to the real-
ity of rodents podcasting, we can say for certain that listeners of your show, 
both fan and foe, will communicate about your show to others in a variety of 
formats and places of which you have absolutely no control.

250
Part IV: Start Spreadin’ the News About Your Podcast 
There are likely existing forums, chat rooms, and mailing lists that deal with 
your particular podcasting topic. At some point, those people will find 
out about your show and start listening. Current research shows it takes 
these people exactly 3.7 seconds to post a review to the rest of the masses. 
Welcome to the community of the Internet.
There are a variety of ways to keep your eyes and ears on these groups and 
to find comments regarding your podcast. Doing so will give you valuable, 
direct feedback from listeners and let you respond quickly and easily. See the 
following sections for the details.
Trying a general search
Is it just us, or don’t most people do a Google search for their own name at 
least twice a week? Could be just us. But that’s a great way to see whether 
people are talking about you. Google has a gazillion pages in its search data-
base and constantly crawls a good percentage of the Web, finding interesting 
tidbits and adding more data with each pass.
When you search, try various combinations. If your name is a common one, 
such as John Smith, you’re probably going to get a lot of hits unrelated to you. 
Try adding the topic of your show to the search for more relevant results. For 
example, if your name is John Smith and you’re podcasting about underwater 
basket weaving, type John Smith underwater basket weaving in the Google 
search box. If your show name is unique, or at least uncommon, try using the 
name of your show as a search term.
 
We realize that there are other search engines besides Google. Yahoo! pro-
duces fine results, as do a few others. If you have neither the time nor the 
inclination to experiment with a dozen search engines, we suggest these two. 
Both syndicate their results to other lesser-known (but equally valid) search 
engines. Together, they cover the vast majority (by some estimates, about 
90 percent) of the indexed pages online. But as we’ve said countless times 
before, your mileage may vary. The same techniques we outline work well on 
just about any search engine you prefer.
Using specialty search engines
Search engines are great tools, but sometimes they search a bit too far and 
wide for your tastes. Many specialty search engines have cropped up in the past 
few years to cater to the needs of people looking to search a more narrow set of 
criteria than “all Web pages on the entire planet.” Researchers, academics, and 
students have had this level of access for a while. Now, several services that 

251
 Chapter 13 Speaking Directly to Your Peeps
have been made public may be of use as you’re trying to find communica-
tions about your show.
Google Alerts
In what might be the most narcissistic activity on the planet, Google allows 
you to easily do a daily check of who is talking about you and your podcast 
on the Internet with Google Alerts (www.google.com/alerts). With this 
feature, you receive an e-mail when a news article, blog posting, or Web page 
containing text matches a text string of your choice, which is likely to be your 
name or the name of your podcast.
Here’s how to set up Google Alerts:
 
1. Go to Google Alerts at www.google.com/alerts.
 
 If you have a Google account, you can save yourself a couple steps at 
the end by clicking the Sign In link and providing your credentials.
 
 On the right side of the page is a Create a Google Alert interface.
 
2. Enter the search terms for the topic you want to monitor, the type of 
results you want, and how often you want to receive results.
 
 Just for example, you might want to type Tee Morris and have it perform 
a comprehensive search, covering blogs, Web sites, news, and any other 
connotations of online media. If you want to change the parameters of your 
search to more than once a day, you can change these default settings.
 
3. Enter your e-mail address.
 
 If you’re already logged in to Google, you won’t see this step. Google 
Alerts work with any e-mail address. If your e-mail is not part of the 
Google system, you receive an e-mail validating your request. Check 
your e-mail and click the link to validate your request. 
When Google finds matching terms, it sends you an e-mail notification along 
with a link to the article. Each alert that comes in offers you the ability to 
cancel the Google Alert at any time.
Technorati
Technorati (http://technorati.com) is really more of a “buzz engine” 
than a search engine. It focuses its concentration and power on blogs and 
news services and does an exceptional job of ferreting out conversations 
about hot topics of nearly any size.
With Technorati, you can search for keywords, key phrases, or specific URLs. 
Many bloggers have found ways to pass the URLs of their blog posts to the 
Technorati search engine, allowing them (and others) a quick way to take the 
pulse of the community reaction to their words. Although Technorati won’t 

252
Part IV: Start Spreadin’ the News About Your Podcast 
search through podcast audio yet, it’s a great way to find out whether blog-
gers are discussing the ideas and comments you put forth on your show.
Podscope
As of this writing, many podcasts talk about . . . other podcasts. Many don’t 
adequately use show notes, which makes it difficult for search engine spiders 
and bots to find the content. (Spiders are programs that follow links around 
the Internet and report back on what they find, and bots are automatic scripts 
that act a lot like spiders but usually don’t crawl so far.) However, the fine 
folks at Podscope (http://podscope.com) have figured out a way around 
that difficulty — searching the actual audio (and when it applies, video) entry 
of the episode. Figure 13-6 shows a recent result on searching for Yo Yo Ma 
at Podscope. If the service finds any show notes, they are brought back as 
search results.
 
Figure 13-6: 
Audio 
and video 
search 
results are 
displayed on 
Podscope.
 
However, the true coolness lies a bit deeper. Click the little + button to 
expand your results and then click the green Play button to listen to a 
10-second audio clip that contains the search phrase in question. How very 
cool! You can amuse yourself for hours on this little feature. And rather than 
spoil it for you with a technical description of the technologies involved, 
we’re sticking with “magic” as the most relevant explanation. 
Will you find everything you look for with Podscope? Doubtful. Will you turn 
up some interesting results? To quote the Magic 8-ball — future uncertain, 
try again later.

253
 Chapter 13 Speaking Directly to Your Peeps
Searching within a site, blog, 
or message board
As extensive and cool as search engines are, they can’t cover everything on 
the Net. Not only are there physical limitations as to how wide of an area the 
spiders and bots can cover, there are also self-imposed limitations set up by 
Web site owners that inhibit a good indexing of the site.
Take forums for example. Some forums are set up in a manner that renders 
their internal pages invisible to the spiders and bots of even the best engines.
But most forums have an internal search engine that you can use to find the 
content within the forum — though you may be required to register with the 
forum to access its search engine. Figure 13-7 shows the search results we 
found by doing an internal search on a popular discussion board that prohib-
its spiders and bots from indexing its individual pages. None of these pages 
were indexed by Google or Yahoo!.

When the Comments Are Less Than Good
First, don’t panic.
Second, don’t respond. Not yet.
Third, let your blood pressure come down to a normal level.
Let’s face it. Anytime someone has any critical comments about us, we get an 
emotional reaction. We call that being human, and it’s perfectly understandable 
and impossible to suppress. Following that impulse of replying right away only 
leads you to discover the two reasons why it’s called a knee-jerk reaction: It’s a 
reflex to clashing viewpoints, and you come across like a real jerk when you don’t 
think about your response before riding the emotional roller coaster. (The classic 
wooden ones like the Rebel Yell, Beast, or Grizzly. Yeah. Roller coasters. Cool.)
When you’re calm and feeling a bit more detached, reread the comment and 
plan your course of action. Here are some suggestions:
 
1. Reflect on the comment.
 
 What does the comment say, really? Does the person make a valid point? 
Is there an area of improvement you should make? If the comment was 
specific, re-listen to the show in question. Did you say what the person 
said you did or stumble as bad as the person made it out to be? You may 
need a different perspective, so feel free to get someone else involved.
 
2. When you fully understand the criticism, decide whether or not you 
want to respond.
 
 Obviously, if a comment is in any way libelous, you may want to seek 
legal counsel before proceeding. If a comment is simply pure vitriol, 
your best course may be to ignore it and go about your business.
 
3. If you decide to reply, consider sending an e-mail. 
 
 If you send an e-mail, count on that e-mail being posted right alongside 
the negative comment. There’s no guarantee the person will keep your 
correspondence private. In fact, count on the opposite. Whatever you 
say in a private e-mail should be something you would be willing to say 
in a more public forum. Keep your rebuttal rational, civil, and, above all, 
professional.
 
Just like any argument, it’s best to keep things on a professional level with 
your words and mannerisms. Although it may be hard to not put it on a per-
sonal level, try to refrain. It’s not going to help the situation.
Negative feedback is never an easy thing to stomach, but look at the positive 
aspect of this: People are listening. They’re listening, and now they’re most 
assuredly talking, blogging, and podcasting about you. We’re not saying to 

255
 Chapter 13 Speaking Directly to Your Peeps
rush out and say something completely irrational simply to drum up contro-
versy, but we’re saying that people will disagree with you now and then. It 
should be expected, and you should be ready to face that tough love when it 
comes your way.
More than anything, grow from the experience. Understand that anything you 
say in your podcast will be heard by a variety of people, with different back-
grounds, experiences, and expectations of the world. We’ve been on both 
sides of this and can count many times where the negative comments we 
received turned out to be some of the best feedback. We think we’re better 
podcasters for it.
Feedback, good or bad, is only as constructive as you make it out to be.
Avoid The Baiting Game
Tee recalls, after watching a scene in Bull 
Durham where an umpire goads Kevin Costner 
into insulting him, saying, “That’s so Hollywood.” 
His dad, a highly respected umpire in college 
and semi-pro baseball, said, “Actually, that’s not. 
That’s baiting.” Although you may not think there 
is a common trait between baseball umpires and 
podcasters, there is: The Baiting Game.
Fast-forward to Tee’s Web site (and podcast) 
Survival Guide to Writing Fantasy, where 
he posted a tribute to a friend lost to breast 
cancer. Billed as a “Special Edition” this show 
was simply to raise awareness. An anonymous 
poster came on to the show’s blog and left a 
long comment that said in so many words, “We 
don’t care about you. We don’t care about your 
friend dying of cancer. Stick to the content of 
the show.” While Tee did not reply, his commu-
nity of “Survivalists” did, to which the anony-
mous poster rebutted with a lot of contempt 
and very little reason. On his following Survival 
Guide, Tee asked the poster to stop listening if 
he found the show so distasteful. The anony-
mous poster returned to say “You can’t make 
me stop listening . . .” and then listed other writ-
ing podcasts he found better than Tee’s.
At this point, Tee recognized this for The Baiting 
Game that it was.
There are people out there who live to pick 
fights. They can be “listeners” of your pod-
casts or, sometimes, other podcasters looking 
for a thrill in bucking the community. A way to 
tell it’s The Baiting Game is to look closer at the 
criticism with (pardon the pun) a critical eye. 
Usually the feedback from baiting is comprised 
of personal attacks, misconstruing of facts, 
flawed reasoning (if there’s any reason pres-
ent), spin control, and a healthy dose of verbal 
insults akin to punching someone in the ear 
and then running away. When this happens, 
don’t reply. Ever. By not replying, the words 
sent to you are a waste of time and effort on 
the sender’s part, not yours. Not replying isn’t a 
guarantee that the baiter will simply disappear. 
You may need to moderate your blog just to be 
sure people don’t post comments that you deem 
inappropriate.
The high road has a better view than the low. 
In some cases, like The Baiting Game, the best 
response is none at all.

Fishing for Listeners
In This Chapter
 Getting your podcast ready for advertising
 Using paid advertising
 Taking advantage of free advertising
 Generating buzz about your podcast
A
s of this writing, there are tens of thousands of podcasters. By some 
estimates, the number of people who listen to various podcasts range 
in the millions. However, that pales in comparison with the potential audience, 
which is somewhere in excess of 300 million people worldwide with a broadband 
Internet connection. Although the audience is large, the options for listeners 
are legion. But how do you attract an audience to your podcast?
In this chapter, we show you a variety of options that you may want to use in 
an effort to gain a larger listener base. Some cost you money; others cost you 
time. But the end result is exposing your podcast to the right people at the 
right time.
Getting Your Podcast 
Ready for Advertising
Whether you plan on spending real money or expending real energy, you need 
to do some prep work before you start your campaign. You shouldn’t rush your 
advertising campaigns, but take the time to carefully plan and execute them. 
Failure to do so can not only be a huge waste of time and money, but it may also 
result in turning off potential listeners to your show, making it many times more 
difficult to attract them back for a second chance.

258
Par t IV: Start Spreadin’ the News About Your Podcast 
Polishing your presentation
Most podcasters need a few shows under their belts before they hit their 
stride. If you’re on podcast episode number three, you likely haven’t fleshed 
out your show. Granted, you may have been planning your podcast for 
months on end, or have previous experience behind the mic on another 
medium, or have nailed it from the beginning. If so, great. But understand 
you’re in the minority.
 
Even though each person is different, we suggest giving yourself at least five 
full shows to find the sweet spot. Experimentation is part of the format, so 
play with a few things along the way to see where your strengths as well as 
your weaknesses are.
Checking your bandwidth
In Chapter 10, we talk about the negative aspects of too large an audience. 
Each new listener means more of your precious bandwidth being consumed. 
For podcasters with limited bandwidth, getting more listeners can be an 
expensive proposition.
 
If you’re using the services of Liberated Syndication (http://libsyn.com) 
or another unmetered bandwidth podcast hosting company, you don’t have 
to worry about your bandwidth and can safely skip ahead to the next section. 
See Chapter 10 for more information about these very affordable services.
Many podcasters start out using the standard Web hosting service to host 
their podcast files and are quickly surprised when they run out of bandwidth. 
We’re more surprised about how poor their math skills are. Suppose that you 
have 100MB of monthly transfers allowed for your site. On the 10th of July, 
you log in to your bandwidth stats page and see that you’re already at 60MB 
for the month. Will you make it? Here are the formulas to figure this out:
Bandwidth consumed / number of days so far this month = Daily band-
width rate
Daily bandwidth rate  31 (the total number of days in the month) = Total 
bandwidth needed
Now you plug in your numbers to find out your daily bandwidth rate:
60MB / 10 = 6MB

259
 Chapter 14: Fishing for Listeners
You’re consuming about 6MB per day. Now multiply this number (6MB) by the 
number of days in the month (31) to get the total bandwidth you need for the 
month:
6MB × 31 = 186MB
It’s inevitable; you’re not going to stay within your 100MB limit. You will be 
roughly 86MB over your 100MB plan.
That sounds — and is — simple. As a real-world example, Chuck checked his 
bandwidth usage on July 18th and found that he had used 256.65GB in the 
first 17 days. 
First, he needs to find out his daily bandwidth:
256.65GB / 17 days = 15GB average daily transfer rate for July
Then, he has to find out his total bandwidth for the month:
15GB × 31 days = 465GB
As you can see, he needs 465GB of bandwidth to get through the month, 
assuming his traffic stays steady and doesn’t increase. If his bandwidth ceil-
ing was 500GB, he’d need to think twice before starting an advertising cam-
paign, as he’d likely hit that ceiling, and his hosting provider would likely 
shut down access to all those brand-new podcast listeners he just worked so 
hard to get. Not a good way for anyone to spend his or her time.
As a good rule, you need to be using less than 50 percent of your monthly 
allotment of bandwidth before starting an advertising campaign. If you’re 
using any more than that, you’ll run out of room and will have to seek alterna-
tive hosting options before proceeding. We cover some of these alternative 
options in Chapter 10.
Figuring out your USP
USP is a marketing term, and it stands for unique selling proposition — a mes-
sage that sells your podcast to potentials listeners. Although you probably 
aren’t charging money to listen to your podcast, make no mistake that you 
need to “sell it” to potential listeners if you’re considering advertising.
Why should a potential listener listen to your podcast? And more impor-
tantly, how can you, as the podcast advertiser, present a message that makes 
a potential listener want to listen?

Plenty of books, Web sites, seminars, and post-graduate degree programs 
are dedicated to the subtle nuances of advertising. We’re not suggesting you 
go that far, obviously. But we do suggest you take a good, hard look at what 
you produce every week and come up with a concise and consistent message 
with which to promote your show.
For example, when Chuck was looking at advertising for his ChuckChat 
Technorama podcast, he found that the market for another tech podcast 
was pretty saturated. Several dozen shows repurposed the same news about 
Microsoft, Google, and Apple. Instead, Chuck chose to spotlight the strange, 
bizarre, and unusual items that are typically passed via e-mail from geek to 
geek — the steam-powered Nintendo DS, the motorcycle that folds in to a 
briefcase, and who can forget the device made of wood that adds binary num-
bers. Thus, the USP for Technorama goes like this:
Technorama takes a light-hearted look at the world of tech, science, sci-fi, 
and all things geek. 
Is advertising right for your podcast?
Before launching your advertising campaign, 
apply some Jurassic Park logic. In that movie, 
Jeff Goldblum’s character chastises the 
dinosaur-resurrecting mogul with “your 
scientists were so preoccupied with whether or 
not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they 
should.” Good advice for podcasters and mad 
scientists alike.
For many, podcasting is a labor of love and not 
a money-making proposition. As such, spending 
too much money or time on advertising may make 
a passion seem a heck of a lot more like a job — 
and you probably already have one of those.
If you’re interested in making money on your 
podcast, you might also consider the Return on 
Investment, or ROI — oh, now we’re starting 
to sound like a corporation so bear with us a 
moment. Simply put, is the money you spend 
on advertising going to generate you any 
additional. . . anything? It doesn’t make sense 
to spend $5 or $5,000 if you won’t get more. . . 
something — listeners, advertisers, sponsors, 
money — in return. Spending money just to 
spend money doesn’t sound like a lot of fun to us. 
Some of the podcasts we enjoy the most, such 
as Dave Slusher’s Evil Genius Chronicles (www.
evilgeniuschronicles.org), are very 
vocal about not advertising and not work-
ing toward a huge listener base. Dave makes 
a podcast for one person — Dave Slusher. If 
other folks hear about the podcast and decide 
to listen, great, so long as they enjoy it and don’t 
expect him to be something he’s not. Fame is 
a double-edged sword — even the moderate 
fame a popular podcaster can achieve. Before 
long, e-mails and voice mails are flying in with 
ideas, suggestions, and even mandates of how 
you can make the show better — for the listen-
ers. Don’t forget that fan is short for fanatic, and 
fanatic people don’t always behave rationally.
So choose this path with caution. In reality, 
“doing it for the love” probably means you can 
(and should?) forgo advertising your podcast. 
It’s not a fast way to get more listeners, but it is 
a fast way to burn through money without a lot 
to show for it.

 Chapter 14: Fishing for Listeners
 
Sometimes calling in help from the outside can be a good thing. Ask your friends 
and family, or even your listeners, to come up with some key points of why they 
listen to your show. We’re not talking about a catchy slogan or jingle of the sort a 
Madison Avenue marketing firm might designate as the “perfect” thing to attract 
new listeners, but plain English (or your language of choice) ways to tell inter-
ested folks what your show is about and why they should be listening.
We can’t give you a step-by-step outline on this one. Spend a few days on it. 
Try it out on some folks first. When you find a message that fits, you’re ready 
to proceed on your advertising quest.
Exploring Various Advertising Options
In this section, we discuss some of the many ways you can advertise to give 
your podcast exposure to a larger audience. 
Google AdWords
When it comes to exposing yourself to the largest possible audience, you 
simply can’t beat the power of Google. More than just a search engine, 
Google allows you to reach over 80 percent of all active Internet users 
with targeted and relevant advertising. With Google AdWords (http://
adwords.google.com), you can keep your advertising costs under control 
and reach a very specific audience.
How it works
Google AdWords allows you to place text ads or sponsored links at the top 
and right side of Google search results pages, based on keywords that you 
(and others) bid on. Additionally, its content distribution network allows 
your text ads to appear on various Web sites related to the keywords for 
which you have placed bids. The trick is to pick the keywords and phrases 
likely to be used by people interested in listening to your podcast. Here’s 
how it works:
Google charges advertisers on a cost-per-click basis, — that is, you’re only 
charged when a user clicks your advertisement. Knowing that this cost-per-
click system appeals to lots of small advertisers with small budgets, Google 
allows you to cap your daily spending. There may be the chance for a thou-
sand people to click your ads on any given day, but Google pulls your ads 
once you’ve reached your limit. And Google scales to your budgetary require-
ments, happily serving ads whether your budget is $5 per day or $500,000 per 
month. Evo has been a power user of Google for years, both personally and 
on behalf of his clients, and has always found Google delivers great results.

262
Par t IV: Start Spreadin’ the News About Your Podcast 
 
All Google ads are bid-based, causing those who pay the highest amount of money 
for a click to (usually) rise to the top. If you are only willing to spend $0.25 to get 
a click, yet the top bid on that keyword is already $4.50, you’re going to be way 
down the list of advertisers, and probably see little to no clicks.
 
When you sign up for AdWords, Google provides a Traffic Estimator so you 
can see how much traffic you might expect from a given set of keywords. Then 
you can evaluate how much you need to budget to get a decent showing on 
the page, or whether a set of keywords is worth the price of the clicks or not.
Using the service
The signup process for the AdWords product is simple and straightfor-
ward, so we don’t go in detail about it in this book. Simply access http://
adwords.google.com, and Google takes you step by step through the 
signup process.
 
When you first sign up for Google AdWords, start with a small investment. Even 
if you represent a large company that’s starting a podcast, don’t go overboard 
on spending real dollars on advertising campaigns right off the bat. Pick a 
modest number to start with, evaluate your results, and refine your technique. 
After you have it figured out, then you can go hog wild!
After you decide on a budget, you need to find keywords that fit within that 
budget. Say, for example, your podcast is about fishing. For the keyword fishing, 
Google estimates approximately 2,600 clicks per day for ads in the top positions. 
That’s a great traffic number that any fledgling podcaster would love to have 
hitting his or her site each day.
However, to get all those 2,600 clicks for fishing, Google says you’d need to 
set your maximum bid at $2.50 per click so that your ad shows in the top 
position against other people and companies advertising on the page. That’s 
a lot of money. You can choose to not bid for that top position and just set 
the bid at the average price of $0.62 for each click. You ads won’t always be 
on top, but should be in the top three spots. You’ll end up paying a bit over 
$1,600 for all the clicks Google can deliver to you. Per day. Wow.
To help bring this cost down to a more manageable level, you need to get 
more targeted with your keywords. Fishing is a rather broad term, so try 
a few other combinations to see whether you can find a cost within your 
budget. Here are a few examples you might consider:
 
 salmon fishing: If you enter salmon fishing in the Traffic Estimator, you 
get a more reasonable estimate of a daily cost of $46.19 per day. However, 
at that price tag, you’re only attracting 20 clicks. Salmon fishing has a 
much higher average cost per click ($2.31) than fishing ($0.62).

263
 Chapter 14: Fishing for Listeners
 
 fishing advice: Not as many big outfitters and organizations are willing 
to give advice away, so they aren’t bidding on those types of keywords. 
Daily traffic isn’t much more than 1 or 2 clicks per day, and the cost esti-
mate is only $0.44 per click. Now you’re on to something. Less people 
are viewing the ads, but you’re reaching a much more relevant audience 
than the thousands who may or may not see the more generic “fishing” 
ad. Now you’re into the world of reality.
What happens after the click?
So now you’re happily spending money for clicks. It’s within your budget, and 
Google provides you a nice and easy-to-read interface that shows you exactly 
what Google is giving you for your money.
But what are you getting?
Any online advertising campaign that doesn’t come with clearly defined goals 
and extremely unambiguous ways to track them isn’t worth the money — at 
any price. Earlier in this chapter we mentioned Return On Investment (ROI), 
and in this section, we discuss how you measure it. 
To measure your ROI, you have to have a good handle on the current per-
formance of your podcast. How many subscribers do you have? How many 
visit your Web site? How many listen to your show from the links straight off 
your page? You have to know these data. Any ad campaign you put in place 
is designed to improve one or all of these metrics, so you had better know 
where your starting point is.
When you have a handle on the number of subscribers you have, figuring out 
what your ads have done to improve those is a relatively trivial matter, as 
long as you are good with simple math. Find out how your show is trending 
prior to your campaign and compare it to the trending after the campaign has 
launched. This will be different for each podcast, so we can’t be a whole lot 
more specific.
 
Want an even easier way to measure success? Install Google Analytics (www.
google.com/analytics). It’s free, it’s easy, and it ties in to your Google 
AdWords campaign seamlessly. It also works with any of the other ideas we 
talk about in this chapter. Pretty slick. With the click of a few buttons, you can 
see how the campaign has impacted your site, for better or for worse. 
Blogads
Advertising on blogs requires a different mindset than advertising on a 
search engine. Blog readers, for the most part, have little love for advertising. 

264
Par t IV: Start Spreadin’ the News About Your Podcast 
They’re looking for content they can’t get from the mainstream media outlets 
or are caught up completely by the cult of personality surrounding their blog-
gers of choice.
Sounds like a perfect place to attract listeners to your podcast!
Blogads (http://blogads.com) is a fine example of a company that makes 
advertising easier for you. Blogads has created a network of sorts, allowing 
you to place a single ad on a multitude of blogs. That’s a whole lot easier than 
researching blogs, negotiating prices individually, and creating and tracking 
ads for each one.
 
According to Blogads: “Warning: ads you’d run on sites like MSNBC.com may 
underperform on blogs. Smart blogads join a community’s conversation rather 
than shouting over it.” If you’re an independent podcast producer, you should 
have no trouble creating ads that really speak to why people should listen to your 
podcast. If you’re podcasting for a corporation, getting your advertising depart-
ment to speak in this language may be more difficult. Blogads has some great 
examples of what works, as well as what doesn’t work, on its network of sites.
Signing up for Blogads takes only a few minutes. You’re guided through the 
process of creating a compelling image and using supporting text within the 
ad. Prices range from $20 per week to over $5,000 per week, putting Blogads 
in a price range for nearly anybody who is ready to spend some money 
advertising his or her show.
 
There are other services similar to Blogads to help get your message out — 
another popular one is called Project Wonderful at www.project
wonderful.com.
Writing press releases
Some podcasters have had enormous success attracting new listeners with 
press releases. When you release a press release, it’s available to be picked 
up by a variety of news sources. On the positive side, you have a lot of room 
inside a press release to talk about your show. On the negative, you have no 
guarantee of whom — if anyone — will pick up and run your press release.
Writing an effective press release is a true art form. It has to appeal both to 
the managing editor of the publication considering your release for building 
a story around it, as well as being worthwhile reading to John Q. Public in the 
publication. 

265
 Chapter 14: Fishing for Listeners
Here are some ideas to help you write a good press release:
 
 Tell a story. Your press release should convey a condensed version of 
what it is you want to say. Three or four paragraphs made up of two or 
three sentences each is a good guideline to follow. Try to answer the most 
common questions people will have about your announcement. Start with 
the basics of good journalism — who, what, when, where, and why.
 
 Target the press release. Write the press release suitable to your target 
audience. You will likely have to write more than one version — and 
send your story to those likely to run it. A story about “hometown boy 
writes successful book on podcasting” is more likely to get published in 
the college alumni school paper than USA Today.
 
 Hook them early. This is also known as B.L.U.F. — stating your bottom 
line up front. Whatever you have to say, be sure to say it first and grab 
their attention.
 
 Give the tag line. Use your USP. This is the perfect place to give some-
one that 30 second pitch about your show.
 
 Give some quotes. Include a couple lines from the people involved. 
Keep them positive and upbeat.
 
 Provide appropriate URLs. Don’t forget to provide links to your site(s). 
This should go without saying, but sometimes you may get so wrapped 
up in the wording of the press release that you forget the point of the 
press release — to get people to come to you site and try your content.
 
We recommend reading a number of press releases to get a feeling for the 
marketing aspect.
If you know people who have written press releases in the past, see if they 
can lend some help — if not, reach out. Remember that podcasting can be a 
very helpful network.
PR Newswire
PR Newswire (http://prwire.com) is the cream of the crop when it comes 
to online and offline distribution of your press release. PR Newswire has the 
ability to send your press release to thousands of media outlets, ranging from 
newsprint, radio, Web sites, television, and more.
The company also provides editorial services for your press release, as well 
as tips and tricks on how to write an effective release that’s more likely to get 
results. If you’re serious about getting the maximum exposure to your show 
and are thinking about using a press release as part of your strategy, PR 
Newswire is worth looking into.

266
Par t IV: Start Spreadin’ the News About Your Podcast 
However, many independent podcasters may find the cost prohibitive 
(around $300 to start) and the registration process somewhat daunting. In a 
world where online registration and upfront disclosure is commonplace, PR 
Newswire follows a more traditional approach. Gaining access requires you 
to contact your local bureau either via e-mail (information@prnewswire.
com) or by telephone. You can find a list of bureaus at www.prnewswire.
com/services/resources/bureaus.shtml.
PRWeb
Considerably less archaic is PRWeb (http://prweb.com). This organiza-
tion offers paid and donation-based services, and it boasts of a good number 
of media outlets. The main difference between the two organizations (other 
than cost and the hassle-factor) is the quality of the distribution. PRWeb works 
to put your press release in front of thousands of online media outlets. Offline 
media sources may subscribe as well, but the primary distribution is online.
Not that that is a bad thing. After all, your podcast is an online service, and 
you’re likely most effective reaching an audience who is already online. All 
three of us have had various write-ups in both online and offline media, and 
we’ve always received more traffic and attention to our Web sites from the 
online sources.
We don’t want to make PRWeb sound somehow inferior to the traditional 
sources of press release distribution. Far from it, actually. Although the ser-
vice may not be as full featured, it can still be a great way to get your word 
out, and one that is quite cost effective.
For $80, PRWeb distributes your press release (among many other things) in 
Yahoo! News, a huge news source that’s often referenced in the online com-
munity. Additionally, press releases at this level are reviewed by the PRWeb 
editorial team, providing valuable feedback on ways to make your press 
release more meaningful and more likely to be picked up by various other 
news organizations around the Internet.
Promoting Your Podcast
Before you start throwing money toward an advertising campaign, consider 
all the things you can do to spread the word about your podcast that don’t 
require a financial investment. In fact, you probably should be doing these 
things even if you plan on tossing out some cash for effect.

267
 Chapter 14: Fishing for Listeners
Optimizing your site for search engines
In Chapters 11 and 12, we give you several tips on how you can make your 
RSS listings, as well as your show notes, more appealing to search engines. 
You can employ similar methods to your entire Web site so that it receives 
the maximum exposure and visibility to search engines.
For more information on optimizing your site, we highly recommend Search 
Engine Optimization For Dummies by Peter Kent (Wiley Publishing, Inc.). 
Additionally, Cre8asite Forums at http://cre8asiteforums.com is an 
invaluable discussion board to keep up on the latest techniques on keeping 
your Web site search engine friendly.
Submitting promos to other podcasts
Podcasting has been called by critics (even us) to be a great hall of mirrors, 
as it seems that nearly every podcast spends a ridiculous portion of its time 
talking about . . . other podcasts!
We think this is normal for an emerging medium, and something that is, for 
the most part, accepted by the general podcasting audience. The podcasting 
landscape isn’t shrinking anytime soon, and it’s so fractured that many listen-
ers are looking for their favorite podcasters to help steer them toward other 
podcasts they may find interesting.
 
Not all podcasters do this. In fact, the majority of the corporate podcasts must 
see other podcasts as competition and are as likely to talk about another pod-
cast as a traditional broadcaster is to talk about another station across town. 
Even some of the independent podcasters make a point not to talk about other 
podcasts, simply because they don’t want to add to the hall of mirrors effect.
One of the more widespread ways podcasters talk about other podcasters 
is with promos. A promo is a short (or long) audio clip that describes your 
show. Other podcasters then insert this clip into their shows — play it on the 
air so to speak — thereby presenting your message to their subscribed and 
downloading audiences.
Promos are a great way to let other folks know your podcast exists. Spend 
some time listening to other podcasts and see whether they’re playing 
promos. When you find one that does, see what the average time for the pro-
motion turns out to be and what type of content is being presented. Is it all 
serious business, or is more light-hearted humor involved?

268
Par t IV: Start Spreadin’ the News About Your Podcast 
Some podcasters are really good at making promos and even offer to make 
promos for free for other podcasters. A whole promo exchange industry is crop-
ping up, allowing podcasters to trade time with other podcasters, each agree-
ing to run the other promo for a certain number of weeks. Check out http://
promos.podshow.com and http://podcastpromos.com for details.
One final note on sending out promos: Ask. Unless the show specifically says 
“submit your promos to us at . . .”, be a good podcasting citizen and send the 
podcaster a note asking whether she’d like to run your promo. Requests that 
start off with “I listen to your show every week because you . . .” are likely to get 
a better response than those starting (and ending) with “Please run my promo.”
Recording your promo
Recording your own promo isn’t difficult, and we tend to enjoy the ones that 
come from the voice of the podcaster. You’ve done the hard work by figuring 
out what makes your podcast special; now you need to sit down and record 
your promo. Here are a few tips:
 
 Write your script. Or don’t. Some folks are happy flying off the cuff. But 
in the interest of time, we highly recommend putting some thoughts 
down on paper and running through them out loud to see how long it 
takes. Most promos are under a minute long, unless you have lots of 
great stuff to say.
 
 Add effects and music from your podcast. If you use the same music 
(see Chapter 7) in your show each week or have some special sound 
effects that brand the show as yours, include them in your promo. 
Effects are a great way to tie in your promotion to your show, giving new 
listeners assurance they have subscribed to the right place.
 
 Don’t forget your Web site URL! Too many podcasters provide the link 
to their podcast feed. Useless, in our opinions. Instead, repeat the URL 
of your Web site, where it should be painfully simple to subscribe to the 
RSS feed for your podcast. Now here’s to hoping you picked an easy-to-
remember domain name!
 
 Include a link to the promo on your Web site. Recording one and sending 
it out to a few podcasts is great, but what about all the other folks who 
you inspire to make their own podcast? Chances are good that if you put 
a link to your promo file on your Web site, others will grab that file and 
include your promo in their shows. It’s also a good repository for when 
you find another podcast you think might want to run your promo. 
 
 When you send other podcasters your promo, save some e-mail band-
width and send the link that’s on your Web site, rather than the file itself.

269
 Chapter 14: Fishing for Listeners
Giving interviews
Don’t forget that podcasting is the fastest growing medium we’ve seen . . . 
ever! If your podcast covers a brand-new area of the world or addresses an 
underserved market, folks are out there who want to talk with you about it.
Contact the publications, radio shows, Web sites, and other outlets that 
cover the industry your podcast falls under. Send them your press release, 
along with a personalized note telling them about your show and stating that 
you’re happy to do an interview.
Interviews can be done in person, but most today are conducted over the 
phone. A handful are conducted via e-mail. Preparing for an interview can 
make the difference between a poor interview that never sees publication or 
airtime and a well-delivered interview that keeps the audience — as well as 
the interviewer — engaged and entertained.
Here are a few tips to make your interview go swimmingly:
 
 Eliminate the BS factor. If you have only a passing interest in the subject 
for which you’re trying to pass yourself off as an expert, you’ll quickly 
be discovered, thrashed repeatedly, and left out for the buzzards. The 
people who are interviewing you likely are already experts in their fields, 
so don’t try to come off as something you aren’t. Be open and honest 
about your experience and focus on why you’re doing the podcast. 
Even if you’re considered a subject matter expert, remember that your 
listener may not be. You might want to consider simplifying things on 
behalf of the listeners new to the subject. Of course, this depends on 
your listeners and the subject being covered.
 
 Mention your Web site over and over again. Remember that the listeners, 
readers, or viewers you are being interviewed in front of have no idea 
who you are and what you are about. This is your chance to sell your-
self and your podcast. If your interviewer is good, he’ll give you ample 
opportunity to mention your Web site and podcast. If not, it’s up to you. 
Look for chances to drop the name and URL if necessary.
 
 Stay positive. If the interviewer knows anything about podcasting, he’ll 
likely ask questions on the future of podcasting, the death of radio, 
amateur versus professional, and all sorts of other controversial topics. 
Unless your podcast is about podcasting, we recommend rising above 
the din. This conversation doesn’t serve you or the listening/reading/
viewing audience well. Point out how your podcast addresses the issue 
and resist the temptation to get into an argument. Unless your podcast 
is about arguing with interviewers; in that case, go right ahead.

270
Par t IV: Start Spreadin’ the News About Your Podcast 
Generating buzz
All the processes we outline in this chapter are geared toward one thing: gen-
erating buzz for your podcast. The more folks you can get talking about your 
show, the better off you are. We don’t buy the “any publicity is good public-
ity” line, but we do think that “Hey have you heard about . . .?” conversations 
amongst real people are the best form of advertising you can get.
Sometimes, you need to take the message to the masses. Find a discussion 
group or an online forum germane to your podcast’s area of interest and start 
posting.
When you post, don’t start out with “Hey, I’m new to the group and have 
this great podcast!” Instead, listen in to the conversation, comment on a few 
threads, and get folks used to your voice before you hit them with the come-
listen-to-my-podcast pitch. In fact, the best way to pitch your podcast is to 
never utter those words at all. Instead, offer up things like “Last week on my 
podcast, I covered the very thing you were talking about, Jill.” It shows you’re 
paying attention to the conversation and not just looking to spam a news-
group or mailing list with your podcast URL.
 
A very fine line exists between tasteful self-promotion and outright spamming. 
Generating buzz isn’t the same as advertising. Advertising has its place, but 
most forums don’t welcome it. If you can’t decide whether your post contains 
too much advertising or not, it probably does. Discretion is the better part of 
valor, in this instance.
For more ways to generate buzz we recommend Expert Podcasting Practices For 
Dummies by Tee Morris, Evo Terra, and Ryan Williams (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).

T
hroughout this book, we show you novel and interesting ways to toss 
significant amount of coinage into the proverbial black hole of podcast-
ing. Throwing money at your podcast can easily become a habit — and it 
likely should come with a warning from the Surgeon General or perhaps your 
accountant.
Hosting fees, bandwidth overages, shiny new microphones, music royalties 
and licensing fees, phone charges, travel expenses . . . the hard and soft costs 
of this little hobby of yours just might add up quickly.
That’s why this chapter shows you some ways to offset a portion (or all) of 
these costs and perhaps even add a few dollars to your pocket while you 
explore your newfound passion. In case you anticipate a large following, we 
cover some ideas you can use to make this your paying gig.
 
Being a podcaster is a lot like being an actor, a writer, or a movie star. A few 
select individuals may make it big, but most folks just get by — and that can 
be okay. If you’re reading this chapter first in hopes of getting a crash course 
in how to “get rich quick” with your podcast, you’re about to be disappointed. 
If not, we can talk.
How Much Money Can You Make?
Most podcasters fall into one of three categories in terms of their audience 
size: small, medium, and large (well, yeah). Because of the very low barrier-
to-entry — in effect, almost anyone can create a podcast — the smaller 
variety of podcaster will likely make up the bulk of the community for the 
foreseeable future.

274
Part V: Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show 
Here’s a closer look at the moneymaking opportunities for these three pod-
cast categories:
 
 Small: Roughly, a small podcast has under 1,000 listeners. Having a 
small audience size doesn’t exclude you from drawing a revenue stream 
from your podcast. It likely limits the size of your potential revenues, 
but it doesn’t mean you can’t bring in at least some income. 
 
 Small is a relative term, and we’re not about to start tossing out 
audience-size statistics to draw a clear demarcation between small and 
medium. Small is also not a derogatory term; many podcasters enjoy 
the idea of keeping their cast small. There’s a certain comfort in the 
small podcasts, a charm that some would say is diminished as the 
size of the podcast’s audience increases. Small can actually be an asset — 
some podcasts are so niche that they draw a small, but extremely loyal 
following. To a potential advertiser, you have a target audience.
 
 Medium: When you have more than a handful of dedicated listeners (in 
the four-digit bracket with over 1,000 listeners), you find yourself in the 
medium category. This category affords you additional opportunities. 
For instance, corporations and advertisers may be more willing to con-
sider placing ads or providing sponsorships.
 
 However, you also find yourself in a more competitive marketplace, 
as other podcasters start fishing for monies to help offset their costs. 
Stepping upward in the ranks also means stepping up your game, and 
you may find yourself in an unfamiliar place — trying to develop a media 
kit that boosts your podcast above the din raised by all the other pod-
casts chasing the very same advertisers.
 
 Creating an effective media kit, especially for a newly discovered market-
place such as podcasting, is actually a pretty important task. (For more 
about the why, what, and how-to, see “Developing a media kit,” later 
in this chapter.) We highly recommend the Podcast Brothers podcast 
(http://feeds.feedburner.com/PodcastBrothers) to anyone 
looking for ideas and ways to make money with podcasting. Tim and 
Emile Bourquin produce this weekly show, covering the ins and the outs 
of making money with your podcast.
 
 Large: Breaking the barrier at the far end of the size spectrum is an elite 
set of podcasters who occupy the large category and are in the five-digit 
bracket with over 10,000 listeners. When it comes to making money with 
your podcast, size really does matter. With a huge audience base, you’ll 
likely find advertisers a lot easier to approach; you can present listener 
numbers that are more like what the advertisers are used to seeing in 
their more traditional media buys.
 
 Outside the mainstream media (like NPR, CNN, and ESPN), there aren’t 
that many really large podcasts out there — yet — so thus far the play-
ing field is still fairly open. Still, it’s no picnic for large podcasters; after 
all, they’re still targeting a very narrow audience on typically one topic 
(or show), and they probably won’t rake in as much as a nationally 

275
 Chapter 15: Show Me the Money
syndicated radio program. Don’t be surprised, however, if you see that 
paradigm change. Podcasters have much more flexibility than broad-
casters and arguably a closer relationship with the audience.
Does your podcast need to pay for itself?
“You spent how much on a new microphone?” 
You’ll soon be hearing that or a question just 
like it with a different gizmo attached to the 
question mark. Your non-podcasting friends, 
colleagues, and perhaps even family will gaze in 
wonder at your apparent lack of good judgment 
as you seemingly spend money as if it grew on 
trees, trees we say, adding just one more piece 
to your previously professed “perfect” podcast-
ing setup.
How can you, in good conscience, justify this 
outlay of cash without the financial backing of 
someone else? Surely if no one is willing to pay 
you to do this podcasting thing, you shouldn’t be 
doing it at all, right?
In a word, wrong.
(Evo here) As I write this, my 14-year-old son is 
busy bouncing back and forth between his PS2 
and his PC, about $3,000 in total investments. My 
wife is on her laptop ($1,500) cropping recent 
images taken with her new top-of-the-line pro-
sumer digital camera ($2,000). Next door, my 
neighbor is up to his elbows in grease, chang-
ing the rear seals (whatever those are) in his 
“family fleet” of ATVs before a trip to the dunes 
this weekend. He wins the prize, having no less 
than $15,000 invested in his passion.
Each of these non-podcasting individuals, all 
of whom are involved in the healthy pursuit of 
liberty and happiness, constantly spend money 
on their hobbies. My son thinks nothing of drop-
ping $50 of his (read: MY) money on a game 
every two months. My wife now goes through 
at least two color ink cartridges every month. 
And Jerry next door has to burn through a few 
hundred dollars of fuel, parts, and doctor bills 
each month.
If I were to poll each of these people, asking 
them whether they had ever considered getting 
someone to help pay for their various addic-
tions, they’d look at me as if I were from another 
planet. Well, except my son. He’d just grin and 
say, “But isn’t that you, Dad?”
Think of the amount of money you spend eating 
out each week. Or for movie tickets, theater 
presentations, concerts, and/or bar tabs. 
These are things you love and enjoy, not things 
you’re trying to find others to pay for. Most 
podcasters will spend no more than a hundred 
bucks a month on their show — average over 
time — and that’s stretching it. And for such a 
small investment that has such a high personal 
payoff . . . do you need to be paid off in cold hard 
cash to do it?
 (Chuck here) To follow-up on Evo’s thought, 
there is an incredible non-monetary value in 
podcasting. It was through podcasts that I have 
found a wealth of information to help my profes-
sional career. Heck, if it weren’t for doing a little 
bit of volunteer work writing and voice-overs in 
the podosphere, I may not have landed this gig 
— writing Podcasting For Dummies.
(Tee here) And of course, never underesti-
mate the power and value of SPUs: Spousal 
Permission Units. Flowers, a surprise trip to a 
spa, and cooking dinner and cleaning house for 
a month . . . it will surprise you how many SPUs 
a little TLC can earn you for some killer podcast-
ing hardware!

Convincing Advertisers to 
Give You Money
If the idea of begging for money sounds rather repulsive, good. If you have 
to resort to begging, you shouldn’t be asking at all. People will only part with 
their cash if you give them a compelling reason. “Because I’m a poor pod-
caster” is not a compelling reason.
Whether your goal is to gain sponsors or sell advertising spots, you have to 
answer a very important question: What’s in it for them? Why should some-
one else make a financial contribution to your show? There are a multitude of 
good reasons that you’ll need to uncover, understand, and be able to explain 
if you hope to be successful in asking for funds to support your podcast.
Contrary to popular belief, there aren’t nearly enough corporations so 
bursting-at-the-seams with unused advertising dollars that they’ll welcome 
you with open arms when you approach them and say, “Hey! Wanna adver-
tise on my podcast?”
Most corporations have an advertising budget (as in, a limit on what they can 
spend). In nearly all circumstances, this budget is significantly smaller than 
the range of potential places they might be advertising — so they’re looking 
for the most bang for their buck. As one of the would-be venues for their ads, 
you’re competing with other forms of media — including outlets that already 
have well-established pitches and presentations at the ready.
Before you start cold-calling possible advertisers, do a little homework. 
Spend some time, energy, and money developing something your poten-
tial advertisers can touch and see: a media kit and a rate sheet, which we 
describe in the next sections.
 
Sometimes all you can do is put your best foot forward and make your pitch. 
Talk to the advertiser about your dedicated audience, and how loyal it is to 
your show. Breaking down the costs into per-listener numbers might help as 
well. Whatever your approach, don’t try to compare your numbers with those 
of traditional outlets the advertiser is already working with. Instead, talk about 
how adding podcast advertising to the mix can enhance its current efforts, 
allowing the company to reach an audience that has turned away from tradi-
tional media sources in favor of this new medium.
Developing a media kit
A media kit is, in effect, a collection of marketing tools designed to awaken 
potential advertisers to their crying need to shell out big bucks to support 
your product (in this case, your podcast). The size of your media kit depends 

277
 Chapter 15: Show Me the Money
on many factors, among which are how much you want to spend and how much 
important stuff you think you have to say. It’s not size you’re striving for here; 
it’s a compelling argument that you can present to your potential advertisers.
Media kits are most certainly not one size fits all. Your media kit should be 
representative of the actual feeling you try to produce on your podcast — 
competent and real, not over-the-top glitzy. Consider it like a job interview: 
It’s okay to comb your hair and put on a fresh shirt, but you wouldn’t send 
your good-looking-but-ignorant roommate as a stand-in, would you? (Look 
what happened to Cyrano.)
 
The big fish are very well armed in this pond. Large media outlets tend to have 
large media kits that were developed with the assistance of large advertising 
agencies that charged large sums of money for their expertise. The small- to 
mid-size podcaster need not go this far. But you need something more than 
just a burned CD of your latest episode.
So here’s a practical list of dos and don’ts to keep in mind when considering 
what to put in your media kit.
First off, the “Yes, go for it” list:
 
 Include accurate listener statistics. Well, as accurate as you can, 
anyway. Include the total number of subscribers to your podcast feed; 
estimate how many direct downloads an episode of your show attracts. 
If your podcast is seeing great growth, include a chart that shows the 
increasing numbers. (For more about listener statistics, see the handy 
nearby sidebar, “Can you ever really know the size of your audience?”)
 
 Display your show schedule. If you update your podcast several times 
a week or once a month, include a calendar or schedule of when your 
updates happen. If your show has no set schedule, be prepared to 
explain your methodology of updates. Many advertisers expect some 
sort of consistency (read: reliable exposure) from the places their ads 
are running.
 
 Provide demographic information. Some advertisers want to know 
the general make-up of your audience. The more detailed you can get, 
the better. At a minimum, show a breakdown of gender, age range, and 
household income level. These statistics can be difficult to gather, but 
doing so increases your chances with many advertisers. Consider asking 
listeners to take a voluntary survey. There are many sites like http://
surveymonkey.com that cost a few dollars — remember sometimes 
you have to spend money to make money.
 
 Showcase your popularity. If you get 50 comments on each of your 
show note entries, talk about it. Technorati (http://technorati.
com) and Google (www.google.com) can support any claims for the 
popularity of your site. Print any great testimonials showing your knowl-
edge and expertise in the field. Favorable comments from other known 
experts go a long way, too!

278
Part V: Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show 
And in the “No, no, a thousand times no” corner, we have . . . 
 
 Don’t artificially inflate your statistics. Grandmother always used to 
say that lies just cause you to make bigger lies. Eventually you find your-
self with an advertiser who wants you to explain how you came up with 
your numbers. Make sure you can support your claims.
 
 Don’t offer reduced pricing. Podcasting is a new medium, and you 
likely haven’t had time to put things on sale yet. Pick a price you’re 
comfortable with and justify why it’s worth it. If you’re not sure of a 
starting price, ask other podcasters. Avoid discounting right off the bat; 
it implies that you’re over-valuing your product. You can always nego-
tiate the price, but don’t try that in a media kit. We talk about putting 
together a rate sheet in the following section.
 
 Don’t include a copy of your entire show on CD. People like to know 
what they’re getting themselves into. You have a great opportunity to 
offer that courtesy to potential advertisers — to let them listen enough 
to sample the wares. Remember, however, that their time is limited. You 
may include entire episodes if you like, but you may find better success 
by stitching together “best of” clips from your show; these take less time 
to consume.
 
 Don’t make a halfhearted effort. Okay, you don’t have to create a full-
blown presentation that would make the mavens of Madison Avenue 
envious of your skill set. But we’re not talking Elmer’s glue and crayons 
here, either. Treat it like a business; invest the right kind of time and money 
to make your media kit look (and sound) as professional as you can.
When you have your content figured out, go buy a nice, pretty binder. Or 
better yet, order some custom ones online that feature your podcast logo, 
slogan, and Web site address. You can get them online from VistaPrint (www.
vistaprint.com) if you want large quantities. For smaller runs, see what 
your local office-supply or copy center can provide.
Establishing a rate sheet
A rate sheet is simply a table of what you charge for ads and other services — 
this could include things like audio or graphic production. And you thought 
you were headed into uncharted waters by just creating a podcast? How 
about figuring out a fair price to charge for running advertising? That’s by no 
means a science. Heck, it’s not even an art form at this stage! It’s total guess-
work — picking a number, throwing it out there, and seeing what sticks.
You can start by reviewing rates of other podcasts — hopefully podcasts 
with similar topics or audience sizes. Ask them for their media kits and rate 
sheets — if they are separate items.

279
 Chapter 15: Show Me the Money
A rate sheet can be as simple as a fixed price for a given ad segment — we 
like to think podcasting is more flexible than that. Can you offer cheaper 
prices for shorter ads? Can you offer prices for different placement within the 
show, keeping in mind that the closer to the top of the show, the more valu-
able the ad placement? You can offer decreasing rates based on how many 
shows carry an ad. How about giving better pricing if there’s an ad in your 
show along with a link on your Web site? Are you capable of offering produc-
tion services for an audio or video ad? All of these options can be combined 
in a variety of ways to complement each other.
Can you ever really know the size of your audience?
Tracking down listener statistics is elusive — 
and that’s quite an understatement. Although 
many of the podcasting pundits will tell you how 
important understanding your audience size is 
(especially when you’re trying to attract adver-
tisers and sponsors), it’s difficult for them to 
agree on the best way to snag those numbers.
Web server analysis tools are wholly unreliable 
in this regard; after all, they weren’t designed 
for this purpose. They can tell you how many 
times your podcast episodes were requested, 
but not how many of those requests were suc-
cessful. They can tell you how many times your 
RSS 2.0 file was accessed, but they provide no 
tool to filter out requests made every five min-
utes by the same obsessed podcatcher.
The most widely used model of determin-
ing audience size is the bandwidth-division 
method. This requires you, the podcaster, to 
know two pieces of data: the average size of 
your podcast media files and the total amount of 
data transferred in a given month. For example, 
suppose your ISP reported that you transferred 
350GB of data in the month of May. Convert that 
to MB by multiplying by 1,024 (the numbers of 
megabytes in a gigabyte) to get 358,400MB of 
data transfer.
Okay, suppose that during that month, you put 
up four podcasts, each with a size of 10MB. 
Divide the total number of transfers (358,400) by 
the average size of your file (10MB) to get the 
“total” number of accesses to that file — in this 
case 35,840. Finally, divide that number by the 
total number of podcast media files released (4, 
in this case). The answer (in theory, at least): 
You have approximately 8,960 listeners to your 
show.
This number, however, does not take into 
account the data transferred by your Web 
server simply to run your Web site — say, 
images and text. Nor is it helpful when your 
podcast media files vary widely in size. And it 
still doesn’t factor in those folks who down-
loaded 90 percent of your show before the con-
nection broke.
Another method is counting the unique IP 
addresses. This involves using the raw Web 
log data and using a script for unique down-
load sites. The “podstats” script might do the 
trick for you — you can find it at: http://
forums.friendsintech.com/index.
php?board=7.0. Check with your hosting 
provider to see whether you have access to the 
raw logs. 
Our advice is to find a method that seems to 
work for you and stick with it. It’s the best you 
can do . . . for now.

Part V: Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show 
Getting a Sponsor
Sponsorship and advertising are often used as interchangeable terms, but 
they’re actually distinct approaches with different requirements. For the pur-
poses of this discussion, we consider sponsorship as a relationship you (the 
podcaster) have worked out with an organization that regularly funds — and 
has a vested interest in the success of — your show. (Obviously, you can’t 
say that about all advertisers.)
Sponsorships were popular — almost to the point of exclusivity — in the old 
days of radio in the early 20th century. During that time, corporations would 
actually create the various radio programs as an advertising vehicle — they 
could even censor content if (for example) some writer goofed and had the 
villain using the sponsor’s product. Modern-day advertising deals, which 
allow a station or program to drop a 30-second ad into its already-established 
programming, came into play much later; these days, such deals dominate 
the scene.
Traditional media sponsorships have all but disappeared, and their last bas-
tion can be found in the world of daytime television: They have morphed 
into . . . the dreaded infomercial. We’re not suggesting that you turn your 
podcast into an infomercial. However, if you’re catering to a niche audience 
and a corporate entity can service the needs of your audience, that angle 
may be worth considering.
 
Understand that obtaining a true sponsor for your show likely means you give 
up some creative control. Instead of paying you a few dollars to run a pre-
produced ad, your sponsoring corporation underwrites your entire show, or 
at least a significant portion of it. Rather than getting you to take a break from 
your content while you talk about its product for a few moments, your content 
becomes dedicated to talking about its product.
Two examples of the “pay-for-podcasting” model are Disneyland Resort pod-
cast (http://disneyland.com/podcast) and the (albeit short-lived) 
Heineken Music podcast (www.heinekenmusic.com). In both cases, the cor-
porations underwriting the programs are heavily involved with (read: own) 
the content.
If you’re thinking about approaching a corporation to underwrite your show, 
you need to provide much of the same information necessary for securing 
advertisers, as discussed earlier. In addition, however, you need to demon-
strate how your show can help bolster the success metrics of the corpora-
tion. “It’s a cool show that your customers will love” probably won’t cut it.
There’s no secret sauce that irresistibly attracts corporate sponsorship. Each 
corporation has distinct goals and objectives. Any podcaster trying to solicit 
sponsorship would be well served to understand these goals and objectives 

281
 Chapter 15: Show Me the Money
inside and out, and be prepared to clearly demonstrate how sponsoring a 
podcast can help the company achieve those goals.
Asking Your Listeners for Money
There is one group of potential financial backers out there who could care 
less about your fancy media kit: your listeners. They couldn’t give a hoot 
about your anticipated growth curve in subscribers or your ratio of direct 
downloaders to feed-based audience. They do have a vested interest in your 
continuing to produce the very best possible show, each and every episode — 
and they are (usually) content to let you take the show in the direction you feel 
it should go.
Sometimes your show is important enough to them that they’re willing to 
pony up. That’s why the following section discusses some novel ways you 
can go about soliciting your listeners for funds to help offset some of the 
costs of creating a podcast.
 
Please don’t turn your podcast into a weekly telethon. Most people tolerate 
the time when NPR goes into pledge-drive mode, but no one looks forward to 
it. If you’re going to ask your audience for money, do it tactfully and as rarely 
as possible. Please.
Gathering listener donations with PayPal
Some of your audience will so love your show that they’ll happily hand over 
some of their hard-earned money — if you’ll only ask.
Asking for listeners’ support is a two-step process: First you ask for the 
money, and then you provide an easy and convenient way for your listeners 
to send you money. PayPal (www.paypal.com) has been handling small and 
large Web-based transactions for years. A PayPal donation link can be fully 
integrated into your Web site with minimum hassle. Here’s how:
 
1. Log in to PayPal.
 
 If you don’t have a PayPal account, click the Sign Up link and follow the 
simple instructions. You need a valid credit card to sign up.
 
 PayPal, like much of the Web, is subject to change. The flow of these 
steps might be slightly different at the time you’re reading this. 
Regardless, the steps you need to follow will basically be the same.

282

2. From your Account Overview page, click the Merchant Services tab.
 
 The Merchant Services section allows you to set up a variety of ways 
people can send you money.
 
3. Click the Donations link in the Create Buttons section on the right side 
of the page.
 
 You may also find this link under Website Payments Standard elsewhere 
on the page. 
 
 You’re taken to the Donations page, shown in Figure 15-1.
 
Figure 15-1: 
PayPal 
makes 
accepting 
donations 
as easy as 
filling out a 
few fields.
 
 
4. Enter a donation name and donation ID in the appropriate text boxes.
 
 We recommend using the show name, and perhaps a suffix such 
as “– Donations” to help you identify your donations if you have other 
types of income to your PayPal account.
 
 You can also use the ID field to denote multiple types of donations or 
donations for different shows in the event you produce more than one 
podcast. You can put anything you want in this field, but keep in mind 
that it will be visible to those making donations — so make sure it isn’t 
something confusing.
 
5. Enter a set donation amount if you want in the Amount text box. Also, 
change the designated country if you’d like your currency to be some-
thing other than U.S. dollars.

283
 Chapter 15: Show Me the Money
 
 If you want your listeners to donate a set amount, choose that amount 
now. If you leave the Amount field blank, your users will have to enter an 
amount before they donate. You decide which is best for you. 
 
 If you’re familiar with using HTML forms, you can later add a suggested 
donation amount, and allow your listeners to change the amount if 
they desire. Get a copy of HTML 4 For Dummies by Ed Tittel and Mary 
Burmeister (Wiley Publishing, Inc.) if you need help with editing forms.
 
6. Select the style of Donation button you would like to use from the 
Choose Button Style section.
 
 If you have a custom button, here’s the place to change it. If you don’t 
have one, don’t worry. The default button works just fine on your Web 
site, and you can always change it later if you want.
 
7. Set the encryption to No.
 
 If you’re confident you won’t want to change any of the settings given so 
far, you can set the encryption to Yes. We prefer to leave it unencrypted, 
so we can later edit any options without having to re-create a button 
from scratch. Also, turning encryption off allows PayPal to create a 
simple-to-use URL for your donation page that you can add to e-mails 
and show notes.
 
8. After you fill in the fields on the Donations page, click Create Button 
Now at the bottom of the page.
 
 PayPal whisks you to the Add a Button to Your Website page.
 
9. You have some decisions to make about the custom HTML code for 
your button:
 
 If you’re comfortable doing some minor editing of the HTML that makes 
your Web site work, copy the HTML in the first box and add it to your 
page.
 
 If you think editing HTML is a little beyond you just now, then simply 
copy the text in Link for Emails and include it in your show notes. You’ll 
want to make it a hyperlink, so don’t just leave it like this:
https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&business=chuck%40chuckcha
t%2ecom&no_shipping=0&no_note=1&tax=0&currency_code=USD&charset=
UTF%2d8&charset=UTF%2d8
 
 Instead, you want to enclose it with an <a href=“”></a> tag and 
include some descriptive text, like this:
<a href=”https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&business=chuck%4
0chuckchat%2ecom&no_shipping=0&no_note=1&tax=0&currency_code=USD
&charset=UTF%2d8&charset=UTF%2d8”>Donate to my show</a>
 
 That should do it for the donation link.

Selling stuff
Some podcasters offer merchandise for sale as a way to support their show 
financially — T-shirts, hats, mugs, CDs, autographed pictures, you name it. If 
it’s sellable, chances are good that some podcaster out there is selling it.
If you’re contemplating selling merchandise via your podcast, you fall into 
one of two groups:
 
 You have merchandise to sell. Musicians, authors, artists, and 
craftspeople fall into this category. For these podcasters, offering CDs, 
books, prints, or other items to the listening audience can bring in sig-
nificant revenue. (Down the road, there’s no reason why it shouldn’t be 
possible to make a living via podcasting.)
 
 Once again, PayPal (www.paypal.com) can be very helpful in taking 
away the technical hurdles for selling items online and integrating them 
into your podcast and Web site. If you can master the process for set-
ting up online donations, you aren’t far from having PayPal work as your 
entire online shopping cart. But this book is about podcasting, not about 
PayPal. Luckily for you, Victoria Rosenberg and Marsha Collier wrote 
PayPal For Dummies (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
 
 You need merchandise to sell. If you need stuff to sell, CafePress (www.
cafepress.com) is more than happy to step in and offer its assistance. 
Remember the T-shirts and other stuff mentioned earlier? You can go to 
the trouble of making those yourself, carrying an inventory, and ship-
ping the orders out as they trickle in — or you can let CafePress take 
care of all that for you.
 
 Setting up a CafePress storefront is a breeze, though it’s a highly con-
figurable task, and how you set it up depends on what you want to sell. 
A basic shop is free to set up and to use. Your listeners buy the T-shirts 
and coffee mugs (or whatever), with your logo or design on them from 
the CafePress store, and CafePress pays you a commission. It’s very 
simple and requires only some quick setup information from you to get 
started. Figure 15-2 shows a CafePress store for Technorama. It took 
about five minutes to set this up; CafePress takes care of the rest.

285
 Chapter 15: Show Me the Money
 
Figure 15-2: 
Listeners 
can buy lots 
of good-
ies from a 
CafePress 
store.
 
 
Don’t expect to make tons of cash via CafePress. Unless you can convince a 
large group of your listeners that they simply must have an $18 T-shirt with 
your logo on it, we wouldn’t recommend quitting your day job just yet.
Handling Fee-Based Subscriptions
Getting your listeners to donate a couple of bucks to you or buy your latest 
CD is one thing, but getting them to shell out money for the privilege of listen-
ing to your show is another matter altogether.
 
If you don’t have a pre-established following, a fee-based subscription 
approach likely won’t help you. If you do have a following but have never 
required anyone to give you money, you may find yourself with less of a fol-
lowing afterwards. Use this option sparingly — and only if you really think 
others are willing to give money to listen to your podcast. You’ll need to come 
to the decision whether you want x listeners for free, or 1/10 x listeners to 
pay — okay, we made that number up, but it will definitely be far less than 
your current listener base.

286
Part V: Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show 
 
One way to get your listeners interested in parting with their money would be 
to give them a sample of what to expect. Offer the first episode or two for free 
download and in them, mention how to get the rest. (We knew podcasting was 
addicting, but this is ridiculous.)
Securing your feed
Okay, we’re sure you’re wondering just how you prevent giving away your 
podcast to anyone who cares to download it, not just to those who pay for it. 
The answer is to create a secure RSS feed with logins and passwords.
It’s time to be blunt — setting up and maintaining a secure feed is a little 
ugly. The good news is this is a For Dummies title, so we don’t expose all the 
technical warts and scars here. We keep the process simple but still manage 
to get you in touch with the inner code monkey that lurks in everyone.
To start, there’s nothing special about a secure feed. The Web server handles 
prompting for the login and password. You are responsible for setting up 
the feed and a configuration file. If you’re using a Web server based on 
Apache — which a lot of hosting providers are — the high-level technical bits 
look something like this:
 
 Create a separate RSS feed for your “protected” content in a separate 
directory — we’ll call it members.
 
 In the new members directory, create a file called .htaccess with some 
special instructions. These instructions tell the Web server where to 
look for accounts and groups allowed access to this directory.
The authentication process works like this:
 
1. The Apache Web server receives an instruction from the podcatching 
client to download the new feed file. It peeks inside the .htaccess file 
to find the logins and passwords. 
 
2. The podcatching client presents a prompt for a login and password. 
 
3. The user types his or her information. 
 
4. The podcatching client sends the info back to the Web server. It checks 
to see whether a) the information provided is correct, and b) that the 
account is in a group with permissions to the directory. 
 
5. If both of those are correct, the feed is downloaded and processed by 
the podcatching client like any other feed.

A sample .htaccess file looks like this:
AuthType Basic
AuthName “Members Only”
AuthUserFile /www/users/chuckchat/html/security/passwd
AuthGroupFile /www/users/chuckchat/html/security/group
Require group members
The first line (AuthType) tells the server what type of authentication to 
use — for now, stick with what it says. The second line (AuthName) is the text 
that appears when the login/password prompt appears. The AuthUserFile 
line points to a file with login names and passwords. The AuthGroupFile file 
is a simple list of accounts associated with a group name. It’s important that 
the files indicated in AuthUserFile and AuthGroupFile are placed where 
the file says they are or this doesn’t work.
 
The contents of the .htaccess file are case-sensitive — with the exception 
of the text between quotes. It’s extremely important you get the case right for 
this to work. One of your authors spent many hours trying to figure out why 
things didn’t work because he had Group instead of group.
A sample line from the AuthUserFile file looks like this:
chuck.tomasi:2nyp44rex
In this example, the login name is chuck.tomasi, and the password is 
encrypted, so nobody can download your file and find out all the pass-
words. You, the podcaster are responsible for creating and maintaining the 
AuthUserFile (and AuthGroupFile). For a small list of user accounts, 
it’s fairly easy to maintain the password file by hand, using a command-line 
utility called htpasswd — commonly provided as part of the Apache Web 
server.
 
Not all hosting accounts provide access to a command-line interface. You 
should check with your Web hosting provider to see whether you have this 
capability. If not, you may have to resort to creating and maintaining these 
files on another system and uploading the files. For Mac OS X users, you 
already have Apache installed and can access these tools from the Terminal 
window. Windows users have to download Apache (http://apache.org) to 
install them. 
 
If you find yourself with a runaway hit podcast on your hands with lots of 
accounts, managing them can be a bit of a pain. In such a case, take a look at 
a product like aMember at www.amember.com, which is a PHP Web interface 
that runs on your Web server. Make sure your hosting account allows you to 
upload and run PHP programs beforehand, though.

288
Part V: Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show 
A typical line from an AuthGroupFile file might look like this:
members:tee.morris,chuck.tomasi,evo.terra
The format is pretty straightforward — first is the group name (members), 
then a colon (:), then a list of comma-separated names from the 
AuthUserFile file. You can name the group anything you like — as long 
as it corresponds to the Require group line in the .htaccess file. The 
AuthGroupFile can also manage multiple groups with each line following 
the same format described earlier.
The path less traveled
When you have your AuthUserFile and AuthGroupFile files set up, you 
must designate the physical path to them. You get the physical path to your 
password and group files from your hosting tech support.
 
Be sure to ask for the physical path and not the virtual path. A virtual path is 
a shortcut that the Web server gets from the browser on the other end in a 
URL to get to your files, for example, /security/passwd. The physical is how the 
operating system on the Web server gets to the same information, for exam-
ple, /www/users/chuckchat/html/security/passwd. Most modern 
podcatchers and RSS readers support basic authentication. If you would like 
more information on configuring an Apache file, refer to the Apache Web page 
(www.apache.org).
If all else fails, seek out an experienced Web geek and offer pizza, extra 
cheese, and a six pack of Red Bull!

“T
rue” podcasters bristle at the growing commercialization of podcast-
ing. With iTunes stepping into the podosphere and spotlighting many 
corporate podcasts, the independent podcasters have voiced many concerns 
that boil down to one: A “true” podcast is done for passion, not for profit. 
The movement towards podcasting as a moneymaking venture goes against 
the grain of a “true” podcast. The words, opinions, and emotions should all 
be aimed for the listeners’ hearts and minds, not their wallets.
Well, yeah — and even as we cheer the sentiments of the purists, we have to 
observe that sheer love of the medium isn’t all there is to it. Truth be told, pod-
casting has proven itself a great way to reach the consumer. It’s economical, 
unobtrusive, and can be a great way to connect with your potential audience.
With the new buzz word in business being “Web 2.0,” blogging, social net-
works, and the still-mysterious podcasting are all finding themselves becom-
ing integrated as part of a business’ marketing and promotion machine. 
Podcasting has come a long way since the first edition of this book, but 
for larger corporations (such as Coca-Cola, Nike, and others), podcasting 
still remains an unproven medium when it comes to promotions. Because 
podcasting is “audio-on-demand,” there’s still no formal way to measure 
numbers, feedback, and response in the same way radio and television adver-
tisements are tracked. However, statistics from WordPress plug-ins like pod-
Press, online services like Google Analytics, and service providers like LibSyn 
and Podango continue to develop new methods to do so.
This doesn’t mean the change is taking its time. With Apple iTunes and its 
podcast subscriptions going from zero to 1 million in two days — match those 
numbers, J.K. Rowling! (oh, wait, you did) — the corporate world is wanting 
to know more about podcasting, realizing that some independent podcasts 
are actually discovering new audiences for their products (and broadening 

290
Part V: Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show 
their existing audience) one MP3 at a time. If the end goal of your podcast is 
publicity, this chapter is for you. We go through several examples of where 
podcasting has paid off — maybe not in dollars and cents, but in good word-
of-mouth buzz.
Podcasting and Politics 
In the political arena, innovation can be a political candidate’s best strategic 
option in winning an office. The “podcasting fad” that some of the old guard 
snickered and scoffed at is now catching the attention of major political play-
ers. Individuals interested in holding office — be it local, state, or national — 
are side-stepping conventional media and adding to their platform the people 
who listen in the podosphere.
 
What we’re defining in this section as a political podcast is a podcast hosted by 
a political figure or an individual seeking a political office. (We’re not talking 
about podcasts where the host discusses current affairs, rants about the state 
of the world, or cracks jokes about the latest scandal.)
So, what can a podcast do for you, the tech-savvy politician?
 
 Podcasting (and its companion blog, if you use a blog as part of your 
delivery) connects you directly with your constituencies.
 
 Podcasting can reach young voters, the elusive demographic that can 
easily make or break a victory at the polls.
 
 Podcasting avoids the bias that creeps up in media outlets, allowing you 
as a candidate to present agendas and intentions uninterrupted.
When going political with a podcast, whether you’re running for the U.S. 
Senate or podcasting your term as School Board representative, here are a 
few things to keep in mind:
 
 Keep your podcast on a consistent weekly schedule. Monthly podcasts 
don’t cut it; the tide of politics is in constant flux. Daily updates are 
less than practical, but weekly podcasts work well for ongoing political 
issues, and you can shape their content to remain timely enough to fit 
the podcasting medium. Set a day for delivering your weekly message 
and stick to that schedule.
 
 Focus on the issues, not the opinions. A political podcaster will always 
walk a fine line between public servant and political commentator. You 
need to stay focused on the issues. If you suddenly start hammering 
away with opinion and commentary, you’d become more like Hannity, 
O’Reilly, or Franken (whom nobody elected). If you want politics as your 
podcast’s subject matter, ask yourself whether you’re looking to help 
listeners understand the issues accurately and take meaningful action, 

291
 Chapter 16: Podcasting for Publicity
or whether you’re just ranting and venting to entertain people who want 
their opinions reinforced. 
 
 Give your listeners a plan for action. When you cover the issues in your 
podcast, provide possible solutions to the pressing matters of your com-
munity and your constituents. Whether you’re detailing blood drives or 
fundraisers, or launching an awareness campaign for cancer research, 
increase that divide between political figure and political commentator by 
offering listeners ways they can get involved in the community and make 
a difference.
Anytime a podcast goes public on the issues, its creator walks a fine line 
between public servant and political commentator. The following podcasters 
all keep their content focused on the issues and less on what they “feel” are 
the issues.
The first politician to use a politically themed podcast was North Carolina 
Senator John Edwards. Following the 2004 election, he launched the One 
America Committee Podcast with John Edwards. Found at www.johnedwards.
com/media/podcasts), the podcast covers poverty, Internet law, and 
environmental issues and encourages youth involvement in politics. Also 
featured in this podcast is Elizabeth Edwards’ update on her current fight 
against breast cancer and her efforts to raise awareness about the disease.
Edwards invited the world into his home with an intimate podcast that not 
only gets political, but personal as well: “Elizabeth and I are both sitting here 
at our kitchen table. The microphones are sitting on my youngest’s, Jack’s 
blanket that he sleeps with every night, so we feel very much at home, and I 
hope you enjoy this discussion.”
To make his connection to the podosphere even stronger, Senator Edwards — 
on the success of his podcast — enlisted the help of two accomplished 
podcasters, Mur Lafferty and Rob Walch, to assist in its recording and pro-
duction. The success of the One America podcast caught the attention of 
the govern-ator himself, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is now podcasting his 
weekly radio addresses (found under iTunes Podcasts➪News & Politics). 
Also in this iTunes category is Senator Barack Obama, reaching out to voters 
with both audio and video podcast. And the White House also joined the 
podosphere with President Bush being the first American president to host a 
podcast (www.whitehouse.gov/podcasts).
 
Podcasting is definitely an avenue to explore if you’re venturing into the politi-
cal area, but this is not your sole means in reaching out to voters. You will 
need to campaign, of course. Get out on the road, shake hands, kiss babies, 
and the like. Unless you are recording said baby-kissing and hand-shaking, 
campaigning will mean your podcast goes on the occasional break (as John 
Edwards’ has at the writing of this edition). Make sure to communicate to your 
listeners that changes in the posting schedule are upcoming. When you can, 
give a podcast from the road to keep the communication lines open.

In an interview with BusinessWeek, Democratic strategist Joe Trippi sees 
a time when podcasting will carry the same impact and influence as blogs. 
“Podcasting is growing even faster than blogging. I think podcasting is going 
to have a huge impact on the next election cycle.” 
 
If you’re a politician and you want to get in touch with the people (as a way to 
respond when voters complain about poor communication with their repre-
sentatives or the candidates running for office), why not invite them into your 
kitchen, offer them a cup of virtual coffee, and ask them to relax a bit? Instead 
of dishing up prepared statements from professional speechwriters, you can 
offer voters (and worldwide listeners) impromptu, candid, sincere opinions on 
issues facing the country and the world.
Telling the World a Story,
One Podcast at a Time
The whole point behind promotion — be it for books, film, or other forms of 
entertainment — is to win prospective target audiences (or build on existing 
ones) with something new or to give a different take on a familiar commodity. 
For a fraction of the cost of print advertisements and broadcast-media com-
mercials, podcasting opens markets for your creative work — and can even 
start to get your name into an international market. If you’re an established 
presence in the writing market, or any entertainment field, the fans you have 
nurtured, with time, will not only eagerly support your podcast, but also 
introduce your MP3s to reader groups, friends, and enthusiasts of the sub-
jects you’re writing about.
Podcasting can introduce your writings or your music to audiences world-
wide. For artists in more visual arts such as film, dance, painting, or sculp-
ture, podcasting can serve as an audio journal leading up to the premiere of 
your work — or as a venue to promote your career. It’s an instant connection 
with your audience, and a great way to build an audience by getting them 
to know you on however intimate a level works best for you and your work. 
Planning a strategy for this kind of promotion only helps your agenda:
 
 When podcasting for visual media, briefly describe the action for the 
audience. In his podcast for the SciFi Channel, Ron Moore adds in his 
commentary on whichever episode of Battlestar Galactica happens to 
be airing (www.scifi.com/battlestar/downloads/podcast). He 
doesn’t take for granted, though, that people will always be watching the 
episode along with its companion podcast. In only a few words and a few 
seconds, he sets the scene for what’s happening in the episode, for the 
sake of listeners who may listen to his podcast independently.

293
 Chapter 16: Podcasting for Publicity
 
 If you’re documenting your visual art, it will take only a moment to 
describe what you’re doing. For the painter: “I am using green with just 
a hint of black so we can make the eyes appear more unearthly, unnatu-
ral.” For a dancer, “In reconstructing the Australian Aboriginal dance, 
you must remain grounded and deep in your squats, more so than what 
is normally seen in modern dance.” You don’t need to go into every 
minute detail. Only a few words are needed to create a picture. 
 
 Another option is to take advantage of enhanced and video podcasting. 
Although you may not reach as many listeners, you can take advantage 
of incorporating visuals with your audio. For the basics of video pod-
casting, take a look at Chapter 8. 
 
 For writers and musicians: Edit, edit, edit. Awkward pauses, stammers, 
and stumbled words are obstacles for a writer introducing his work to 
the podosphere: They’ve gotta go! The approach is no different from 
that of an independent musician who podcasts a rehearsal session or a 
recording: You don’t want off-key instruments and vocalists missing the 
high notes. Your podcasts need to sound sharp and clean. 
 
 Musicians, no matter if it takes five takes or 50 takes, should have their 
instruments in tune, lyrics clearly pronounced, and all notes sung on key. 
Writers should enunciate, speak clearly, and (most importantly) enjoy 
the manuscript. Each piece, whether music or printed word, should be a 
performance that serves as your audition to a worldwide audience. (While 
that may sound a bit nerve-wrecking, don’t think of it as walking out on 
stage so much as building something fine to send into the world. Just have 
fun, and your audience will enjoy the ride with you.)
 
 If you need a refresher on the basics of editing, skip back to Chapter 7 
for the primers on editing with Audacity and GarageBand. 
 
 Open or close your podcasts with a brief, off-script commentary. 
Before beginning your latest installment or after your latest chapter 
concludes, a brief word from the author is a nice (and in many cases, 
welcoming) option for a podcast’s audience. This commentary gives 
the author a unique opportunity to connect with readers, sharing ideas 
about what inspired a scene, to promote an upcoming book-signing, or 
to give an update about what’s happening in the next book’s production. 
 
 The first author to do this was Scott Sigler. Along with keeping his listen-
ers on the edge of their seats with his science fiction/horror podcasts 
(available at www.scottsigler.com), he chats with his fans at the 
beginning and end of each episode. In these messages, Scott assures lis-
teners he wouldn’t hold last chapters hostage, announces release dates, 
and shares his plans for world domination.
 
 This approach added to the intimate experience of podcasting a novel, 
and other podcast novelists like Mur Lafferty, Philippa Ballantine, and 
J.C. Hutchins followed suit, inviting listeners into their real world after 
sharing the world they imagined. Let your audience members know who 
you are, and they’ll show their appreciation through their support of 
your current and future works.

Podcasting fiction continues to prove itself as a viable means of promotion 
for authors unable to fund their own coast-to-coast tour. It may make con-
ventional writers shake their heads at the idea of giving their works away for 
free, but the numbers and individual successes of authors taking this chance 
is the proof in this publicity. Now, before ink even hits the page, authors are 
building fan bases and getting their names out into the public. (And some of 
the really lucky ones get to write books for the For Dummies people!)
Where it all began . . .
Allow us a personal account of the journey from 
podcasting fan to full-fledged podcaster. When 
Podcasting For Dummies’ own Tee Morris was 
in the final rewrites of Legacy of MOREVI, his 
publisher contacted him and said, “Okay, Tee, 
start thinking of neat promotional ideas.” Around 
this time, Evo Terra and Michael R. Mennenga, 
hosts of The Dragon Page (www.dragonpage.
com), had just started podcasting. The more 
Tee found out about podcasting, the more he 
began planning to podcast MOREVI as a way 
to get word out about Legacy of MOREVI. After 
all, he’d been complimented several times on 
his live readings. And as an actor who loved 
playing around with his Mac’s audio and video 
features, he figured . . . why not?
The Prologue of MOREVI: The Chronicles of 
Rafe & Askana (www.morevi.net) dropped 
into the Dragon Page’s feed on January 21, 2005, 
and so began a completely new kind of promo-
tion, different from what The Dragon Page had 
ever done before: a chapter presented every 
Friday, as read by the author. The feedback was 
nearly instantaneous. Within weeks of Tee’s 
first episode, two other authors stepped up and 
offered their works for podcast as well. One of 
them was Mark Jeffrey, author of the science 
fiction/fantasy young adult adventure, The 
Pocket and The Pendant (www.podiobooks.
com/title/the-pocket-and-the-pendant). 
The other author was an adrenaline-hepped, in-
your-face, über-intense conductor of mayhem, 
chaos, and carnage, Scott Sigler, and the book 
was EarthCore. The idea was apparently work-
ing with other authors.
Listeners’ answers came after the conclusion of 
MOREVI in the form of a review from SFFAudio.
com: “Swashbuckling action takes the main, 
and heart-rending romance builds slowly, 
culminating right at the end . . . it is daring-do 
adventure set in a world that would fit well on 
a shelf next to Eric Flint’s 1632verse alternate 
history series.” 
Along with a glowing review, orders for MOREVI 
and pre-orders for Legacy of MOREVI spiked 
in sales (which included a few international 
readers) via Amazon. Scott Sigler went on to 
see the EarthCore novel finally in print, had the 
novel of his second podcast Ancestor debut 
at #1 in Amazon’s Science Fiction and Horror 
section when it premiered in print, and took the 
novel of his third podcast, Infection, to a hard-
cover debut with Crown Books and topped the 
Amazon charts in 2008.

Keeping Good Company: Community and 
Sound-Seeing-Tour Podcasts
Slice-of-life podcasts that encourage community among listeners and among 
fans are podcasts that promote. They can promote a show cancelled too soon 
into production, an issue affecting the well-being of a community, or a cause 
such as breast cancer research. The promotion comes from word-of-mouth 
advertising (buzz) that these podcasters generate from their thoughts, com-
ments, and opinions on their subject — be it traveling across Spain, daily life 
in New York City, George Lucas’s Star Wars, or Joss Whedon’s Firefly.
Slice-of-life podcasts let the world into locations and clue people into pos-
sibilities that listeners may be curious about. After a few podcasts, you can 
even encourage listeners to experience that corner of the world, that idea, or 
join the community.
Do you have a cause you want to give attention to? Do you want to raise 
awareness in your county or district? Do you want to share the experience 
of preparing for a wedding or anniversary? Consider sound-seeing tour pod-
casts in order to build an online community through your podcast. 
Putting together a sound-seeing tour of 
your favorite destination
Sound-seeing tours are “virtual walks” down sidewalks and side streets of 
wherever you happen to be in the world. These audio getaways, just by 
the sounds (and if you’re doing video, the sights) of the people and things 
around you, can promote the community of a city, region, or country better 
than any brochure found in a travel agency.
The atmosphere of a marketplace, the rumbling of a train and various 
announcements to its commuters, and even the traffic passing by builds the 
world (or the part of it you are presently occupying) around you. Peppering 
this atmosphere is your commentary. The podcast becomes a grand bay 
window to your world with you as the walking, talking frame of reference.
 
Don’t rely on the environment to be the podcast. Part of a sound-seeing tour 
is the ambient noise. A sound-seeing tour shouldn’t be you simply walking 
through your local downtown or social hot spot, recording the world passing 
you by. The world is your backdrop, and you are the podcast’s host. Your 
thoughts, opinions, and observations will continue to drive this podcast; your 
environment is working with you to create a complete picture. Feel free to 
comment on what you see and allow yourself a chance to explore.

Rich Pav is your average, ordinary blogger, making his way through the not-

(www.herroflomjapan.com), Rich frames his various travels and encoun-
ters with the history, culture, and people of Japan in his own unique point of 
view. According to his companion blog, Rich doesn’t consider his podcast 
to be a true sound-seeing tour — but his glimpses into Japan were compel-
ling enough for listeners to nominate Herro Flom Japan for the First Annual 
People’s Choice Podcast Awards in that category. Now, with the ease and 
popularity of video podcasting, Herro Flom Japan also offers the occasional

Creating a podcast to bring together a 
community
Community is synonymous with podcasting. This book talks a lot about the 
power of community through podcasting, establishing a connection between 
you the podcaster and your audience which is waiting impatiently for the 
next episode. Podcasts can also bring an existing community — a group with 
a shared interest, a community of homeowners, or a group dedicated to a 
cause — together and keep its members informed. The podcast can reach 
audiences in and outside of your community, sharing your interests and con-
cerns with others, making your community even stronger in the long run.
The Disney Podcast Directory (Figure 16-1, found at www.disneypodcast
directory.net) is a Yellow Pages of podcasting that features shows by 
either the Disney Corporation or Disney fans. What started off as a simple 
portal to all thing concerning Mickey, the Disney Podcast Directory has 
become a central hub for fans. There’s even a behind-the-scenes podcast 
of things going on at this directory called Inside the DPN, a podcast that 
spotlights new arrivals and old favorites to the directory. Inside the DPN 
also interviews podcast hosts, comments on the state of Cinderella’s Castle 
(and other franchises), and shares personal anecdotes on everything from a 
favorite amusement park ride to tips on planning the best Disney vacation. 
What makes DPN more of a community than just another directory is in how 
its podcast keeps everyone in the know on who is joining the network, which 
shows have podfaded (gone away), and what is happening in the Disney fan 
community based on content contributed by the directory’s members.
The podosphere takes great pride in its sense of community, but the pod-
casts showcased here are set apart because the community is encouraged to 
take a more active role in the issues, concerns, and points of focus the pod-
cast is centered around. More than chiming in with feedback, the community 

297
 Chapter 16: Podcasting for Publicity
takes an active role in participating with increasing awareness over the pod-
cast’s main subject. In some cases, the producing of the podcast brings the 
community together, either through listener contributions, listeners directing 
the course of the show, or listeners coming together for a common cause.

Thirty days, 50,000 words, and a podcast for each day . . .
Having a podcast keep its community focused 
on a goal is seen clearly in The NanoMonkeys, 
a daily podcast that happens in November. 
Why November? It coincides with NaNoWriMo 
(National Novel Writing Month), which takes 
place in November. Participants in NaNoWriMo 
commit to writing a novel of 50,000 words in a 
month. 
To help NaNoWriMo writers, P.G. Holyfield, 
Chris Miller, and Kris Johnson started The 
NanoMonkeys (www.teampodcasts.net/
nanomonkeys) podcast. From November 1 
to December 1, these three podcasters post 
a daily podcast ranging from 3–10 minutes, 
offering advice for the struggling participant or 
for the NaNo player who is on a tear. 
With NaNoMonkeys, the community is dedi-
cated to a goal: Producing 50,000 words in a 
month. Not only the producers, but the listeners 
themselves, are all driven by the daunting task of 
creating a novel in a month’s time. The success 
of The NaNoMonkeys can be seen in its kudzu-
like growth in listeners and participants, as 
well as the feedback from its subscription base 
who gave K.J., P.G., and Chris a lot of credit in 
getting their work (and they themselves) to the 
Finish Line of Midnight, November 30.

Community podcasts cover a wide range of audiences. However, all commu-
nities share a similar mindset, and you can apply these “sound” production 
principles:
 
 You are the host, but it’s not all about you. Community-based podcasts 
should be about the community. Yes, there is room for personal thoughts 
and commentary, but in small doses.
 
 The podcast is about the community and how it interacts with the world 
around you; that is what the content should focus on. Your podcast can 
feature other members of the community who share the same opinions 
as yours or even take opposing viewpoints (a spirited debate can up 
your show). Just remember that the community-based podcast is not 
about you personally, but about how you see the world, how that con-
nects with the people around you in the community, and how all that 
comes together in the pursuit of a common interest.
 
 Avoid the negative. Particularly with community-based podcasts such 
as Jack Mangan’s Deadpan (www.jackmangan.com) and The Signal 
(http://signal.serenityfirefly.com/signal.php), it would be 
easy to turn a podcast into a gossip column or a personal rant against 
the very concept that brought the community into being. While there 
is no law or ethic barring you from speaking out or voicing concerns, a 
community is based on support. Whether you consider yourself a fan of 
Harry Potter, Apple Computers, or Prince William County, your goal in 
a community podcast is to remain positive and celebrate the benefits 
of being part of the cooperative spirit. If there is a matter of concern 
in your community, then there’s room for debate and action, as with a 
political podcast — offer some possible solutions to these issues. 
Regardless of the kind of community you’re chronicling, your podcast should 
work much like glue — helping to keep supporters together in the face of 
problems (instead of just crying in your collective beer) and celebrating what 
gives them joy. Reinforce that sense of community and keep your podcast 
strong. 

Chapter 17
Podcasting for Passion
In This Chapter
 Connecting with the passion of the cast
 Asking, “Why do we do it?”
 Keeping the passion alive in your own podcast
O
ur mission from the beginning of this book has been to fill you in on 
what a podcast is, demystify the technical aspects of getting your voice 
heard on media players around the world, and assure you that those with the 
drive to make their message happen can do it, with the right tools. But a pod-
cast is empty if you don’t have that drive, that passion to get your podcast up 
and running and keep it running, whether the episode goes out every week, 
every other week, or every month. We drop that word a lot in the previous 
chapters: passion. What do we mean by “podcasting with passion”?
Okay, if you take the dictionary as a starting point, passion means “a keen 
interest in a particular subject or activity, or the object of somebody’s 
intense interest or enthusiasm.” You can have state-of-the-art audio equip-
ment, hire the most engaging vocal talent, and employ the best engineers, but 
that isn’t what makes a podcast a podcast. The artists and creativity behind a 
podcast make an investment — not simply financial or physical — and collect 
the windfall in listener feedback and download stats.
Yes, a podcast can make money, promote a cause, or bring attention to social 
issues, but without that passion, you might as well sit behind a microphone 
and read the instruction manual to your mobile phone. Passion is what moti-
vates relative unknowns to slip on the headphones, step up to the micro-
phone, and let their words fly.
This chapter won’t presume to teach you how to create, cultivate, or conjure 
your own passion. It’s something you have, or you don’t, for a given topic — 
and we suspect everybody has it for some topics. Instead, we offer some real-
world examples of how others apply their passions to podcasts — and we tell 
you about some tools to apply a little passion-power of your own.

The Philosophical Question for All 
Podcasters: Why Do We Do It?
It’s going to come up sooner or later: Someone will question your motives, 
rationale, and even sanity at your investment of so much time and energy 
into this newfangled thing called podcasting. We highly recommend deep 
nonsensical answers such as “It’s because of the cheese” be returned to 
these people. Then watch their eyes start to twitch. That never stops being 
funny.
The following sections tell you some of the ways you can take that passion 
and channel it in to a truly effective force behind your podcast.
Gaining perspective on passion
“Get some perspective!” they say. Well, we agree with them (whoever they 
are). As a podcaster, you need a firm idea of what your show is about. If you’re 
not sure what your point is, your audience isn’t going to be sure, either!
Mur Lafferty entered the podosphere in December 2004 with Geek Fu Action 
Grip. The podcast featured witty essays about growing up geek and remaining 
geek in adulthood. Geek Fu, in its way, was a lynchpin to Mur’s plan to make 
a living at writing, and hopefully selling her first novel for publication. She 
used the podcast to discuss the tribulations of writing full-time, and also the 
frustration of getting fiction published amidst her non-fiction accomplishments.
Noticing episodes of Geek Fu leaning towards her writing pursuits, Mur 
decided to launch I Should be Writing (shown in Figure 17-1). This podcast 
focused less on essays and witticisms from a geek’s perspective and more on 
the business, the frustrations, and the momentary highs of writing. The pod-
cast was her own journal of what she went through to get that first novel on 
bookshelves. Mur’s perspective of “a writing podcast by a wanna-be fiction 
writer” became a source of inspiration for writers. 
“I wanted to contribute something to the podosphere that wasn’t there 
already,” Mur says in response to a question about her inspiration. “There 
were already podcasts from writers, but to my knowledge, there wasn’t a 
podcast by a published writer who was not published in fiction. In all hon-
esty, I was doing this podcast more for myself. I podcast because it’s a good 
outlet for my thoughts and my writing. That’s what I was doing with I Should 
Be Writing, but I didn’t expect the reaction it got.”

ers present 
and future 
to join 
her in the 
journey to 
publication 
in I Should

The reaction Mur speaks of was the outpouring of encouragement she received 
from around the world as feedback to her setbacks. Listeners thanked Mur for 
inspiring them to write again. There were outcries for Mur to continue devel-
opment and work on her fiction, eventually leading her to featuring previews 
of her Parsec-nominated series Heaven and the popular superhero adventure 
Playing for Keeps (http://playingforkeepsnovel.com).
What makes the Parsec-winning I Should Be Writing a delight is Mur’s enthu-
siasm. For the Durham, N.C. mother, gamer, writer, and all-around-geek, her 
podcasts serve as a catharsis for the struggles in getting her fiction pub-
lished: “I was so stunned when people told me it was I Should Be Writing that 
made them pick up writing after years of nothing. The knowledge that people 
are looking forward to my podcast really means a lot and does a lot to moti-
vate me. I know a lot of podcasters have had the problem of not receiving 
sufficient feedback. A nice e-mail here and there really means a lot to keep 
people going. It’s that kind of encouragement that motivates me to podcast 
my fiction.”
Whether Mur’s wisdom was planned from the start or not, it offers some 
good take-aways for the budding podcaster:

302
Part V: Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show 
 
 Look for a unique angle. The last things your listeners need are carbon 
copies of other podcasts or (perish the thought) radio shows based on 
a template. If your passion is commonplace, focus on a niche or small 
aspect that you have the most knowledge about.
 
 Step beyond your comfort zone. No one expects you to be a trained 
voice actor. All they expect is for you to talk about your passion with 
authority and sincerity. Remember, you’re only trying to appeal to 
people who care.
 
 Don’t get preachy. Passion and authority are fine, but don’t cross that 
line into assuming you know more than everyone else. Unless you’re 
putting together a sermon or series of lectures, speak in the common 
tongue and with respect to your audience. If we want to be talked down 
to, we can always tune in certain talk-radio hosts.
Podcasting passion with a purpose
Podcasting with a purpose is an essential. By doing so, you have a destina-
tion. It doesn’t matter if that destination is to educate, showcase your mate-
rial, or entertain. Pick something as your core reason for speaking and don’t 
be afraid to have fun with it and make it exciting.
Speaking of fun and exciting (and, okay, escapist) rides, the EarthCore pod-
cast (http://scottsigler.net/earthcore) might have escaped notice 
had it not been for the passion behind its host: the high-octane, in-your-face 
podcasting personality, Scott Sigler. Sigler found a terrific hook in describing 
his science-fiction thriller as “24 meets Predator” — but even his promotions 
convey the deeply rooted passion he nurtures for his genre and his own 
adventures.
Scott Sigler — who has, hands down, the most successful of the podiobooks 
initially offered by www.podiobooks.com — set out to show that a book 
in audio format didn’t have to be a guy in a soundproof booth simply read-
ing the manuscript. “I podcast because it’s the perfect vehicle for serialized 
fiction,” Sigler says of his decision to podcast his debut novel. He seeks not 
only to hook listeners with the format, but also to keep them in suspense till 
next week’s episode: “My novels are long, with cliffhangers at the end of each 
chapter. That’s designed to keep you turning the pages. With podcasts, you 
just have to wait for the next episode.”
Scott’s nostalgia for radio-style serials is not the only motivation behind his 
podcast. “The amazing reaction I get from the listeners is the motivation,” 
he adds, acknowledging his loyal fan base, also known as “Junkies” as they 
became hooked on his podcasts. The fans showed Scott (along with print 
publishers, Dragon Moon Press and Crown Publishing) exactly how hooked 
they were when the podcast of Ancestor premiered in print. The book shot up 
Amazon charts to hit #1 in both Horror and Science Fiction. That was enough 

303
 Chapter 17: Podcasting for Passion
for Crown to approach Scott with an contract for another one of his podcasts, 
Infection, which the publisher retitled as Infected (shown in Figure 17-2).
 
Figure 17-2: 
Scott Sigler 
(inset) took 
his podcast-
exclusive 
novel 
Infected to 
print, and

blockbuster, 
thanks to 
podcasting.
 
For Scott, the passion had a purpose; but even on meeting his goal, Scott 
continues to deliver. “To know that my fiction has entertained thousands of 
people, helped them escape from their day-to-day lives, and just plain have 
some fun means the world to me. Is it a power trip? Sure! But knowing that 
I’ve delivered a great story and entertained someone is a fantastic feeling.”
Scott showcases some excellent attitudes and approaches that would serve 
many podcasters well:
 
 Cultivate feedback. Don’t sit on your heels hoping someone will e-mail 
you. Put together a contest, solicit information, and generally get out 
there and ask people what they think.
 
 Respond in a timely manner. If you’re going to ask, you can’t ignore the 
responses. When someone takes the time out of his or her busy sched-
ule to e-mail you feedback, positive or negative, respond. Sooner rather 
than later, please.
 
 Have your audience spread the word. Who better to seek out people 
who might like your podcast than those who already love what you do? 
Assuming these people have friends, have them toss a little love your 
way by getting their friends to listen. Ask them to burn your show onto a 
CD and pass it around. Make it easy for others to listen!

Planning out your passion
Equally important to having a purpose is having a plan with your passion. 
The purpose is the why of your podcast, and the plan as the how. If you can 
plan out your podcast, you’re more likely to achieve your goal or purpose. 
This is what happened with Lanie James of Oklahoma State University. 
As part of her Masters in Mass Communications and Media Management, 
Lanie turned to podcasting. “It was something no one else was looking at 
and I saw the potential in it,” she said. The plan she outlined was a strategic 
implementation of podcasting as a way to offer interview and résumé tips 
for soon-to-be OSU graduates looking to enter the professional sector. Her 
boss at OSU’s Career Services (http://hireosugrads.com) took a look 
at her plan and saw the same potential Lanie did. As Employee Development 
Coordinator, Lanie served as liaison between recent OSU grads and potential 
employers. The podcasts outlined in her Masters’ creative component ranged 
from interview tips for graduates to background for employers to consider 
about potential job candidates. Lanie kept her podcasts short (between 5 and 
15 minutes) and easily accessible. “I was pretty excited about OSU wanting 
to give podcasting a try, and now part of my job is producing these podcasts. 
I’m helping students and employers, and doing it in a manner that I have a lot 
of fun and creativity with.”
Lanie is also the podcasting oracle of OSU as Student Affairs turned to her 
to run workshops and clinics for their podcasts. OSU is now turning to video 
podcasting and has plans to implement enhanced podcasts as part of its pro-
gram. Lanie said, “I really find OSU embracing podcasting so rewarding, and I 
know we’re doing something good as I was checking our stats and discovered 
a new subscriber from the University of Toronto. That means our podcast is 
helping more than just OSU grads, but reaching out to a wider audience.”
If you come up with a cunning plan for your podcast, here are a few tips to 
keep in mind:
 
 Make sure your plan is clear. Coming up with a plan is more than just 
saying to the people you work with “We should do a podcast because 
it’s cool. Here’s what we talk about in Episode One.” A plan for your 
podcast will be more than the show’s posting schedule, content outline 
for the first five shows, and who will be the guests on Episodes 3 and 5. 
Your plan will go into detail. Who is your target audience? What is your 
goal? How do you plan to obtain your goal? What other tangible benefits 
will the podcast generate? Ask the tough questions when writing up 
your plan so when others ask them, you have the answer in front of you 
with the facts to back it up.

305
 Chapter 17: Podcasting for Passion
 
 Keep the plan close by and easily accessible. The plan that you have 
slaved over and put your time, effort, heart, and soul into is now com-
plete (and approved if approval is required), and your podcast is under-
way. It would be a good thing to have a printed copy of your plan so you 
have a roadmap to get you, your co-hosts, and your show guests to the 
planned destination of the episode and of the podcast on a whole. The 
plan, within reach of you, will keep your podcast on track and in sight of 
your eventual goals.
Passion comes in all shapes and sizes
Passionate people are usually easy to find. One guy started a podcast 
because he knows a lot, and loves to talk about rugby. Another husband and 
wife team feel comfortable sharing their stories about their children. And 
another person goes on and on about the English language. What they all 
have in common is they have opinions and want to share them.
Also never short on opinions — or providing glimpses into his corner of the 
world(s) — is science-fiction author Paul S. Jenkins. (Or would he call what 
he writes speculative fiction?) His bimonthly podcast Rev Up Review (www.
rev-up-review.co.uk), launched in March 2005, provides listeners with 
a review of magazines, books, podcasts, and music. The Rev Up Review is 
not only a review of all things speculative, but also a revue of music avail-
able at the Podsafe Music Network, sound-seeing tours around his village 
and around his home, and even a serialized presentation of his previously 
published short stories. Is Paul trying to generate new interest in his own 
published works? Does he have an agenda in promoting the Podsafe Music 
Network? There has to be an agenda here, doesn’t there?
Well, we don’t believe so. The Rev Up Review (or “Revue,” depending on your 
take on Paul’s approach) comes across as an hour with an old friend over 
a pint at your local pub. Paul Jenkins’ passion comes through in the sincer-
ity behind his podcast — seasoned with a whimsical, almost mischievous, 
approach. In one episode, Paul presented an alternative to the beercast: a 
breadcast. The RevMaster (as he calls himself) welcomed the world into his 
kitchen for a ten-minute segment of baking fresh bread, starting from the 
beginning with measuring of water and breaking out the flour. Paul knows 
this kind of sound-seeing theater may not rivet action-addicts, but he isn’t 
pressured to be aggressively entertaining all the time. You can hear in his 
voice a genuine delight — in not only recording this culinary experience, but 
also sharing it with the world.
Paul’s approach to podcasting is easily adaptable for many:

306
Part V: Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show 
 
 Don’t be afraid to explore new areas. Just because your podcast is 
about fishing, it doesn’t mean that you can’t meander to rock climbing, 
pickup-truck repair, or even the secret to marital bliss. Exploring new 
areas can breathe new life into stale podcasts and even help you find 
new areas of interest and expertise you didn’t even know you had.
 
 Keep it personal. Consider talking to one person — because in most 
cases, you are. You’re likely to build a closer relationship with that 
person by using terms like “my friend” or “my faithful listener” — yeah, 
those are cheesy examples, but you get the idea — rather than “folks” or 
“ladies and gentlemen” like you’re addressing an arena. We don’t know 
of many podcasts that get played before a large audience on a regular 
basis.
A passionate love for the podcast
All successful podcasters share in common a true love for the podcast. 
Something about getting behind the mic and producing quality content is 
satisfying. That passion can tax you, especially if the podcast is an emotional 
ride; and if a podcast reaches an “end,” it would make sense if the podcast’s 
host decided to step away from the mic.
Podcast sensation J.C. Hutchins, however, after concluding his roller-coaster 
thriller, 7th Son (http://jchutchins.net), came to a conclusion he 
shared with Tee in an interview: “I’ve forgotten how to sit still.”
Hutchins, a journalist who always nurtured a love for the art of the interview, 
on wrapping up his trilogy, took a breath and then launched Ultra-Creatives, a 
podcast that includes interviews with innovative minds in technology, busi-
ness, and arts. (Check out Figure 17-3.) “The world could be coming to an end 
outside my window,” Hutch says, “and I wouldn’t care because Charlie Rose 
is interviewing Spike Lee!” With that passion for the interview — equaled 
only by his passion for his own fiction — Hutchins developed a brand new 
podcast simply so he could stay connected to the community of fans he had 
developed but also to actively stay connected to the podosphere. “I do Ultra-
Creatives because I love podcasting so much.”  
The desire to continue recording, producing, and uploading shows simply for 
the love of the podcast is not uncommon. Many podcasts are created out of 
that need. These shows and their hosts stand out in their dedication, infusing 
raw enthusiasm for this medium into every new show. It is this passion that 
brings the podcaster back to the microphone and invites new podcasters 
(like you!) to take the host’s chair.

Holding Interest: Keeping a Podcast’s 
Passion Alive
You have your podcast underway. You’re planning to have a weekly show. 
The first month in, you feel strong, confident. But this is all in the first four 
episodes. How do you keep the momentum going? 
In the early days of a podcast, you can easily see yourself continuing banter 
a year from launch date — but remember that schedule you planned? Have 
you taken into account sick days? Vacation? The occasional stumbling block 
of inertia (“Do I really want to do a podcast today?”)? Even the best podcast-
ers need to step away from their mics, recharge their batteries, and then 
jump back into their recording. Personal health, well-being, and time to edit 
episodes if your episodes need editing (and if you’re human, sometimes they 
do) are factors you also must consider. Add in dealing with conditions such 
as background noise and having to tax the strength of your voice, and pod-
casting can become less of a joy and more like a chore or a second day-job. 
Plenty of podcasts begin strong out of the box, only to have their feeds go 
silent, and remain so.
Even with passion, momentum is difficult to sustain. How do podcasters keep 
that spark alive? Well — as with the answers to “Why do we do it?” — pod-
casters have a myriad of opinions and thoughts. Each show applies different 
tactics to keep each new episode fresh; even amid diverse topics, you can 
find common threads between all podcasts that provide the momentum to 
forge ahead 50 episodes later.

Podcasting on puree: Mixing it up
After you’ve racked up a few episodes of your podcast, take a look at its 
format. How do you have it set up? Is it all commentary? What can you do to 
vary the content?
Just because this is your first, second, third — or seventeenth, eighteenth, 
or nineteenth — episode, that doesn’t mean you’ve set your show in stone. 
(That’s where you find the fossils of all sorts of creatures that didn’t manage 
to evolve.) In this section, we look at ways to dodge that asteroid and keep 
your show from suffering an extinction-level event.
Don’t be afraid to try different things with your podcast’s format. For exam-
ple, you might
 
 Talk about a product, a service, or an idea that’s only loosely related to 
your normal focus.
 
 Interview a guest with a unique perspective on the focus of your show.
 
 Experiment with adding a co-host, even if only temporarily.
 
 Podcast from a remote location or from a studio if you normally do 
remote shows.
Technorama, hosted by one of your illustrious authors, has been in a near-
constant state of evolution since inception in May 2005. It started with a 
single host and acquired a second after the initial kickoff. Things stayed 
constant for a while, and then its hosts — Chuck Tomasi and Kreg Steppe — 
added an “On This Day in Tech History” segment to the show to review tech, 
science, and geek events that happened in history on the day the show is 
released.
With the addition of “On This Day in Tech History” segments, Chuck and Kreg 
started experimenting with production elements and other kinds of regu-
larly occurring features in the podcast. Soon the show, described as looking 
at the lighter side of technology, started covering odd news in the “Hacks 
and Strange Stories” segment and began scratching their heads at how silly 
people can get over tech with the “What the Chuck?!” segment. Following the 
wacky wake-up morning show format, Technorama became a favorite in the 
podosphere.
Fast-forward through the years (time travel saves belaboring the point), and 
the award-nominated show continues to offer something different than its 
normal fare. While taking pride in their lighter look at tech, Technorama has 
also featured interviews with Grant Imahara and Adam Savage of Mythbusters, 
oceanographer and Titanic-discoverer Dr. Bob Ballard, John Chatterton and 
Richie Kohler of Deep Sea Detectives, and renowned physicist Dr. Michio 
Kaku. The guys have also started to experiment with video podcasting, on-
location recordings, and elaborate audio spoofs ranging from “How You 

309
 Chapter 17: Podcasting for Passion
Tell He’s a Geek” (inspired by Monty Python’s “How You Can Tell She’s a 
Witch” sketch) and “The Beta Bunch” (a mash-up of The Brady Bunch and JC 
Hutchins’ 7th Son).
Your show may not have to go to elaborate lengths to stay fresh, but it does 
need to heed the creed: Evolve or die.
 
If you decide your podcast is going to be in a constant state of flux, keep in 
mind that the risk of alienating your listeners is ever present. Podcasting for 
podcasting’s sake is like improvisational comedy: It’s a skill. You can keep 
your passion alive by continuously changing the format of your show, but you 
run a gambit of making your show an acquired taste.
Starting a second podcast
Keeping the passion alive and well in one podcast can be found in variety 
and in allowing yourself to follow another passion in a second podcast. Okay, 
that may double your workload, but it also keeps your perspectives fresh and 
excited about what to focus on in upcoming podcasts.
If you have enough content to warrant a second podcast, don’t overload one 
podcast with this new content; why burn out? If your gut instinct is telling 
you to begin a second podcast, go for it. Variety, not only in a podcast’s origi-
nal content but also between the different podcasts you create, can benefit 
both shows. Now, instead of the same old podcast every week, you can allow 
yourself different avenues to explore — and maybe a whole new audience.
After focusing on books and authors for so many years, the hosts of The 
Dragon Page: Cover-to-Cover (http://dragonpage.com) wanted to expand 
into new areas in order to attract new listeners. They found a willing audi-
ence with the unfilled niche (more like a huge hole in the podosphere) of 
sci-fi TV and movies.
Attaching themselves to arguably the most enthusiastic of all fan crowds — 
Star Trek geeks — the hosts of Cover-to-Cover created Slice of SciFi (http://
sliceofscifi.com), a podcast that quickly grew to become an overnight 
success in the podosphere and one of many offerings on XM Satellite Radio.
If you’re thinking about branching out with a new show, consider these tips:
 
 Take your audience with you. If you’re podcasting about triathlons, 
yet hold a secret passion for seventh-century Gaelic text, expect only a 
handful of folks to subscribe to both shows. However, if you move from 
triathlons to a podcast on sports medicine, they may find the new topic 
an easier pill to swallow.

310
Part V: Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show 
 
 Cross-promote. Even if your podcasts are quite close in scope, there will 
be listeners to one who aren’t aware of the other. Although we caution 
against turning one podcast into a giant commercial for the other, plug 
the heck out of your other show. Within reason.
 
 Look for the niche within the niche. If your main topic is broad, break it 
out into chunks and see what needs further exploration. Granted, a deep 
dive into the minutiae of a niche topic may reduce the size of your lis-
tening audience. But so what? This is about exploring your passion, not 
about gaining market share. And (we promise) there’s always someone 
else out there who will want you to delve even deeper into the obscure 
topic you’ve just built an entire podcast around.
 
 Keep trying. Don’t expect to hit your stride in the new show by Episode 
2. You have to try different formats, flavors, and ideas, just the way you 
did to make your first podcast perfect. (Or is it? Maybe it’s getting a little 
stale. Time to spruce that one up, too. See the following section.)
When enjoying the journey of your first podcast, keep in mind that your next 
podcast may be closer than you think. Keep a close eye on your feedback; 
look for recurring themes that your audience likes to hear. If it’s a broad 
enough topic and you can speak on it with authority, you may be able to craft 
a show around audience suggestions instead of having to sweat bullets to 
come up with something brand new every time.
Moving forward with a plan
Reinvention for the sake of reinvention isn’t a bad idea, but it’s so 20th cen-
tury. You may find it a better idea to move forward with a plan. So here are a 
few do’s and don’ts — with the don’ts first.
What NOT to do (ack! run away! run away!):
 
 Don’t use shock-radio techniques. Hearing a podcaster drop a few 
words that would make most grandmothers blush isn’t anything new, 
and it’s a cheap way to get a laugh and attention. We personally don’t 
have any moral compunction against the more colorful aspects of the 
English language. If that’s your style, don’t change it; otherwise, try to 
use them sparingly, okay?
 
 Don’t swing between kid-friendly and adults-only. If you’re unhappy 
being a family show, give some advance notice so folks can unsubscribe. 
Hell hath no fury like a mother scorned (or even unpleasantly 
surprised). 
 
 Don’t get angry when you get dissenting e-mail. Not everyone will be 
happy with your decision to change things around or to add a new seg-
ment. Deal with it and move on. You can’t please everyone — or “cor-
rect” their opinions — so don’t even try.

311
 Chapter 17: Podcasting for Passion
What to DO with all your might:
 
 Cast your net wide. Be open to a variety of new ideas and concepts and 
don’t be afraid to try them out on your audience. Your loyal listeners 
will likely forgive you a few miscues along the way.
 
 Have a purpose for the change or addition. Find the common connec-
tion with what your show has focused on before and talk to your audi-
ence about it. You can do this before or after the “newness” goes in the 
show, but your listeners will enjoy knowing the method behind your 
madness.
 
 Encourage feedback about the change. When you do this, ask more 
than “do you like it?” Find out whether your audience members feel dif-
ferently about your show, if they think it’s “fresher” or perhaps more 
appealing — and ask why. The changes you put in place are designed to 
give your show a boost; be sure and ask for confirmation that it actually 
happened!
 
If you find yourself in need of a break, there’s nothing wrong with taking some 
time out. As a courtesy to those who are listening, however — whether it’s 20 
or 20,000 — let them know you’re holding off on new episodes for a few weeks 
so you can reorganize priorities, goals, and the whole momentum of your pod-
cast in order to make it even more rewarding for them to listen to. The same 
courtesy applies when you’ve had an unexpected illness: Give your listener-
ship a quick update on what happened; reassure them that your voice is back 
and that your podcast is back. As passionate as you may be about a podcast, 
always remember your health and your voice must come first. There’s nothing 
wrong with missing a week or two of a podcast while you get back up to par.
Truth and Honesty in Podcasting
“To me, ultimately, martial art means honestly expressing yourself. Now it 
is very difficult to do. I mean it is easy for me to put on a show and be cocky 
and be flooded with a cocky feeling and then feel, then, like pretty cool . . . 
and be blinded by it. Or I can show you some really fancy movement. But, 
to express oneself honestly, not lying to oneself — and to express myself 
honestly — that, my friend, is very hard to do.”
—Bruce Lee, from an interview on The Pierre Burton Show
When Tee was writing the first draft of this particular chapter, he had playing 
in the background Bruce Lee: The Way of the Warrior, a (really cool) docu-
mentary featuring recently discovered footage from Bruce Lee’s then-work-
in-progress Game of Death, rare commentary from The Dragon himself, and 

312
Part V: Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show 
interview footage. In one of the interviews came the preceding quote — a 
compelling moment when Bruce Lee sums up, in his own words, what the 
martial arts mean from his perspective. As Tee pondered his words, it struck 
him that Bruce was basically saying, Martial arts are all about keeping it real.
And (for whatever reason) he blurted out loud, “If Bruce Lee were alive 
today, he would have a podcast!”
Part of the passion in a podcast is cultivating honesty with yourself and your 
audience, and that honesty in your podcast is what keeps listeners coming 
back. “To thine own self be true . . .” — one of Shakespeare’s most-quoted 
lines from Hamlet — holds as true for podcasting as it has for every other 
intensely personal creative activity; let it serve as a mantra that fires up your 
drive to produce a terrific podcast. Honest passion, and honesty in general, 
cannot be faked in a podcast because many podcasters are producing their 
audio content without any other compensation save for ratings on Podcast 
Alley and Podcast Pickle, some feedback from listeners, and perhaps a dona-
tion. On the larger scale, podcasters, regardless of their agendas or goals, are 
on the podcasting scene because they want to be there, and if that honesty in 
wanting to deliver new content is even remotely artificial, listeners will lose 
interest in your podcast. 
It’s okay to ask yourself, before hitting Record, “Do I know for sure what I’m 
getting into?” — or, more to the point, “Do I really want to do this?” — but 
never ask yourself whether you can do this. That isn’t even a question to 
consider. Podcasting welcomes voices of all backgrounds, all professions, all 
experience levels (be they professional, semiprofessional, or amateur). You 
can do this — and you have as much right to as any of us. All you need is a 
mic, an application, a feed, and a server host. From there, it all rests on you. 
And once you start podcasting, produce your podcast because you want to, 
not because you have to.
 
Podcasting is a commitment of time and resources — to yourself and to your 
listeners. It’s a promise you make to bring to the podosphere the best content 
you can produce — and with the right support, passion, and drive, your pod-
cast will evolve, mature, and move ahead with the same zeal that inspired the 
first episode. Accomplishing this feat rests on remaining honest in your desire 
to sit behind the microphone and produce your next show. If you’re not sure 
about the answers to “Do I know for sure what I’m getting into?” or “Do I really 
want to do this?” ask yourself, “If I don’t want to be here, then why would lis-
teners want to hear my latest episode?”
“To express myself honestly — that, my friend is very hard to do.” Oh yeah, 
Bruce Lee would have produced an incredible podcast.

Part VI
The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
L
ike any For Dummies book worth its weight in com-
pressed MP3 files, this book contains a Part of Tens. 
Because podcasting is an evolving medium, this particular 
Part of Tens provides lists of ideas, thoughts, and philoso-
phies from the authors to take along on your podcasting 
trek. Chapter 18 helps to guide you in your selection of 
podcasts to listen to for ideas, inspiration, and fun. 
Chapter 19 covers some of the most influential people in 
podcasting. Chapters 20 and 21 are diametrically opposed 
views of how podcasting will, or will not, influence the 
future of traditional radio. (Isn’t life on the unexplored 
frontier exciting?)

Chapter 18
Top Ten Types of Podcasts to 
Check Out
A
h yes, narrowing down the thousands and thousands of podcasts out 
there to an elite ten: the Top Ten Podcasts You Should Be Listing To. 
The Best of the Best. In the podosphere, these higher planes are commonly 
referred to as The Pod Squad, Podcast Pickle’s Favorites, and Podcast Alley 
Top Ten List.
Where to begin? Where to begin? We sat down and put together our own top 
ten lists of podcasts. What we found was that one of us swore by some podcasts 
the others had never heard of, and vice versa. We started wondering, “How are 
we going to narrow down this list and eventually get it to ten?” Then we took 
a closer look at our lists and realized “Hey, we’ve got a pattern going on here!” 
Amongst us, we had a solid cross-section of types of podcasts, not just in the 
way of genres but in production values. So with a quick edit of the outline and a 
change of mindset, we present the Top Ten Types of Podcasts to Check Out.
There are other kinds of podcasts that are, perhaps, not showcased here, 
but with these ten kinds of podcasts as a starting point, you can easily begin 
to fill playlists and media player space. When you’re comfortable with what 
you hear, you can then follow the Favorite Podcasts links that your podcast’s 
companion blog offers. From this list given here, you can sample a wide cross-
section of audio content. Relax, download, and give your eyes and ears a treat.
 
Always check your favorite podcasting directory to see how active these 
shows are before you subscribe. The podcasts in this section are constantly 
changing. They were actively producing content when we wrote this book, but 
printed material is never as up to date as a good podcast directory.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Tech Podcasts
If you’re thinking about podcasting, you likely have a comfortable knowledge 
of computers, Web-surfing, and blogging. But regardless of how technologi-
cally savvy you are, like any aspect of life, you can never stop learning. That’s 
why your aggregator should be catching at least one tech podcast.
The agenda for a tech podcast is (surprise!) technology — usually computer-
oriented. All geek, all the time. Geeks, nerds, wizards, and Tech Help gurus sit 
behind a microphone and pull back the curtain on how your computer works, 
how a podcast’s RSS feed can be better, and how to make your time behind 
the keyboard more efficient.
Tech podcasts come delivered to you in a variety of skill levels and on a vari-
ety of topics:
 
 Macs: Some excellent podcasts for Mac users include MacCast (shown 
in Figure 18-1 and available at www.maccast.com), Typical Mac 
User Podcast (www.typicalmacuser.com), or Mac OS Ken (www.
macosken.com).
 
 PCs: Windows Weekly (http://twit.tv/ww), as the name implies, 
focuses on Microsoft Windows topics, trends, and technology — 
whereas the Mike Tech Show (www.miketechshow.com) is a bit more 
end-user/consumer focused to help you be more productive on your PC.
 
 General computing: Many of the tech podcasts out there like This Week 
in Tech (or TWiT, as it is so lovingly referred as by its hosts and listen-
ers, available at www.twit.tv/twit) or HomeNetworkHelp.Info, are 
generic in their approach to operating systems, following a mindset that 
a computer is a computer and the rest is mostly bells and whistles.
 
 Technology perspectives: Tech Talk for Families (http://techtalk
forfamilies.com) and Technorama (www.chuckchat.com/tech
norama) give personal and (in many cases) light-hearted perspectives on 
technology in society and go beyond the geek-speak, giving their own per-
spectives on issues and how technology can affect just about everything.
Whichever podcast you feed into your podcatching client, find a tech pod-
cast that’s right for you and either enjoy the new perspective or allow your-
self to grow into your geekdom. There is a lot to learn about computers, 
PDAs, Bluetooth, and other cool Q Branch gizmos that are available at your 
local electronics store. When you have the basics down, these podcasts 
allow you to unlock their potential and go beyond your expectations.

Independent Music Podcasts
Podcasting is audio content on demand, and after taking a listen to what is 
being offered on the radio, that is a very good thing. Maybe it’s a hazard of 
getting older, but some of us just aren’t hearing anything on the air that’s all 
that interesting or exciting . . . unless we happen to find an alternative sta-
tion that has a few up-and-coming bands we haven’t heard of, or independent 
musicians who are looking for the big break.
The good news is that those maverick sounds are alive and well and doing 
just fine in the 21st century, and they’re finding a new promotion channel 
with podcasting.
Independent labels, where the artists also work as promoters, producers, 
and holders-of-all-rights, have control over where their music plays, how 
often it is played, and how much it will cost you. Many indie musicians who 
are having trouble getting exposure and radio airplay will grant permission 
for podcasters to use their music. What does this cost the podcaster? A few 
moments of time and a spot or two, such as, “This music is brought to you by 
. . .” and “Visit this band online at w-w-w-dot . . .” And in return, the musician 
is exposed to a worldwide audience.

318
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Musicians such as The Gentle Readers (featured on Evil Genius Chronicles at 
www.evilgeniuschronicles.org), Moanin’ Michelle Malone (featured 
on the podcast novel Serve It Cold at www.dancingcatstudios.com), and 
Fumitaka Anzai (featured on the Rev Up Review at www.rev-up-review.
co.uk) have all enjoyed the benefits of associating themselves with a pod-
cast. Now indie musicians are turning to podcasts that not only are dedicated 
to the broadcast of podsafe music, but also spotlight independent musicians 
whose sound goes against the corporate music industry’s notion of “what the 
public wants.” Here are few such podcasts you may want to check out:
 
 The tartanpodcast (www.tartanpodcast.com): Podcasting from 
Glasgow, Scotland, Mark Hunter showcases unsigned or independent 
label music.
 
 LoveHouse Radio (www.lovehouseradio.com): Based out of 
Richmond, Virginia, host P.D. Love took his love of music, his apprecia-
tion for the independent artist, and his everyday life and turned it into a 
podcast that highlights featured artists on the Podsafe Music Network.
 
 Podrunner (http://podrunner.com): Podrunner is a great place to 
get an hour’s worth of great workout music every week. DJ Steveboy’s 
compositions (which happen on account of his master mixing skills and 
Beatport.com) are great for everything from bicycle riding to Karate.
Science Podcasts
The approach to science made popular by Bill Nigh the Science Guy, Mr. 
Wizard, and the Mythbusters Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman, is rampant in 
the podosphere. Here are some science podcasts that we recommend:
 
 Astronomy Cast (http://astronomycast.com): If you’ve always 
wondered about what’s really going on beyond our atmosphere, take a 
listen to a podcast descendant of the Carl Sagan Cosmos concept. For 
those who would never leave the planet without their attitude, Fraser 
Cane and Pamela Gay dubbed the show Astronomy Cast.
 
 Skepticality (http://skepticality.com): This Parsec-winning pod-
cast (shown in Figure 18-2) looks deeper into the news too weird for 
mainstream media, and it takes a critical microscope to the pseudosci-
ence of the paranormal, the supernatural, close encounters, and urban 
legends.
 
 MedSqod: Podcasting for Medical Professionals (www.podcasting
formedicalprofessionals.com): Hosted by Peter Beck, MedSqod is 
a podcast for medical professionals, a streamlined production focusing 
on the changing issues of healthcare, using both podcasting and blog-
ging to keep medical pros relevant in rapidly developing social media. 

319
 Chapter 18: Top Ten Types of Podcasts to Check Out
What makes the MedSqod’s podcast and blog so cool is how other sci-
ence podcasters (like Dr. Ginger Campbell of The Brain Science Podcast, 
http://brainsciencepodcast.blogspot.com) will chime in from 
time to time, making MedSqod a great venue for networking with other 
medical professionals.
 
Figure 18-2: 
The Parsec-
winning 
Skepticality 
takes a 
harder look 
at pop and 
pseudo 
science, 
debunking 
what some 
pass off as 
scientific 
fact.
 
Science shows are good for you — like vegetables, only better. Not only can 
you learn something new or broaden your scope in a field you may regard as 
a hobby, but you can marvel at how the hosts demystify concepts once com-
prehensible only to Ph.D.s and keep the ideas easy to grasp.
Educational Podcasts
Why not broaden your horizons with educational podcasting? For example, 
say you’ve always wanted to learn Spanish. You could shell out some bucks 
for the “Teach Yourself Spanish” series, or you could to listen to the free 
Spanish Connection Podcast (its companion blog is located at http://
myspanishconnection.com). Instructor David Spencer takes a conversa-
tional approach (mastered over an 11-year teaching experience) and turns 
his podcast into a survival guide series to help you navigate situations at the 
restaurant, at the bank, or if your car breaks down.
If you aren’t interested in learning another language, take a look at some of 
the other subjects offered in the podosphere. Here are just a few examples of 
what’s available:

320
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
 History: HistoryPodcast (http://historyonair.com) is completely 
devoted to history for the lovers of history. Or if you do want for a more 
specific era of discussion, my most gracious lord, check out the British 
History 101 (http://bh101.wordpress.com).
 
 Professional development: Whether you’re a CEO of a multibillion 
dollar company or an aspiring new hire for an upstart with your sites 
set on leadership, Manager Tools (http://manager-tools.com) is a 
“must listen” to increase your effectiveness in the workplace.
 
 Personal development: Are you looking to change your eating habits 
or maybe just find calm within the stress of daily life? Podcasting can 
bring a healthy alternative to your current digital lifestyle, and maybe 
even lower blood pressure and cholesterol points in the process. To find 
a bit of focus and flexibility in your life, give Elsie’s Yoga Class: Live and 
Unplugged (www.elsiesyogakula.com) a listen. Get more background 
on the martial art you study (or are thinking about studying) from the 
video podcast Inside Martial Arts (www.insidemartialarts.tv). 
Finally, visit Personal Life Media (www.personallifemedia.com) for a 
wide array of “life management” podcasts to choose from. 
 
 Money management: If you’re looking for advice on managing your 
money, check out Money Girl (http://moneygirl.quickanddirty
tips.com). Or if you have a friend or family member getting ready for 
that next step in education, try Financial Aid Podcast (www.financial
aidpodcast.com).
There is a lot to learn from the world, and whether you’re tuning in to one of 
numerous podcasts sponsored by universities and colleges or to an enthusi-
ast who wants to share and swap resources with you, all this continuing edu-
cation is available online, in audio, and at no charge.
Comedy Podcasts
There are times in life when you just need a good laugh. One of the joys of 
podcasting is having those good laughs categorized, digitized, and waiting for 
your call, whether it’s on the computer or your favorite MP3 player.
Humor, though, is in the eye of the beholder — or in this case, the ear of the 
listener. Performing a search on “Comedy Podcasts” will offer you many, 
many choices, ranging from kid-safe comedy to adults-only. Some podcasts 
(such as Technorama and Skepticality) pepper their podcasts with humor 
(always good to add), but straight-up comedy podcasts are not intended to 
do anything other than entertain and perhaps make you think.
The way these podcasts make you laugh covers a wide spectrum of how 
humor is defined. Here are a few comedy podcasts that we enjoy:

321
 Chapter 18: Top Ten Types of Podcasts to Check Out
 
 The Bitterest Pill (http://thebitterestpill.com): Perhaps you 
like your humor dry, witty, and maybe just a touch smarmy. Dan Klass 
and his podcast, The Bitterest Pill, should do the trick. With his back-
ground in stand-up comedy, Dan’s delivery is edgy and relentless. He 
takes a hard, cold look at the world and makes observations that you 
might think but would not have the courage to express openly. Dan not 
only gives you his opinions but also podcasts them for the world to 
hear.
 
 Bell’s in the Batfry (www.thebatfry.com): One of the best examples 
of a professional voiceover talent getting into podcasts is John Bell 
and his podcast Bell’s in the Batfry. In the world of classic movies, Lon 
Chaney was known as the man of a thousand faces; in podcasting the 
same could be said about John Bell and his cast of characters. The Batfry 
is a fun place with a different situation in each show within an overarch-
ing story. John isn’t just a master of voice; his editing talents really shine 
with the timing of each character interacting with the others in a way 
that really makes it believable.
 
 Calls for Cthulhu (www.callsforcthulhu.com): If Ask a Ninja 
(http://askaninja.com) still leaves your burning question concern-
ing life unanswered, it might mean time to turn to a higher power, a 
higher power hidden deep within the submerged city of R’ylah. This is 
where Cthulhu hosts a call-in show and offers counsel only the Old Ones 
would have on hand. Created by Brand Gamblin, this video podcast 
(shown in Figure 18-3) will not only keep you laughing but also show a 
softer side to this H.P. Lovecraft creation and maybe even enlighten you 
with a nugget of sage advice. (Or, Cthulhu might just swallow your soul. 
Hard to know for sure.)
 
Figure 18-3: 
Calls for 
Cthulhu is 
the video 
podcast 
that always 
promises 
helpful 
advice 
straight from 
the cephalo-
pod’s 
mouth. 

322
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
 Comedy4Cast (www.comedy4cast.com): Another fun podcast is 
Comedy4Cast. The unpredictability from the host, Clinton, is one of the 
elements that adds charm to the show. Sometimes you get a tongue-in-
cheek review of an electronic gadget, another time you hear a parody 
of another popular podcast like J.C. Hutchins’ 7th Son Trilogy (www.
jchutchins.net). Prepare yourself when listening to Comedy4Cast by 
pulling over to the side of the road so you don’t drive in to the ditch, or 
setting the hot coffee aside so as not to spit it on your keyboard — Clinton 
is not responsible for damages incurred while listening to his cast.
Slice-of-Life Podcasts
Comedy is prevalent in all the various genres of podcasting, especially with 
the podcasts that just take a look at life and give it a perspective. After all, 
sometimes you need humor to deal with loved ones, life’s unexpected pitfalls, 
or the headlines. You can find a variety of podcasts that follow the “some-
thing about nothing” approach, and here are a few we recommend:
 
 Dancing with Elephants (www.dwithe.com)
 
 Pizza Go Here (http://beckwithweb.com/podcast)
 
 The Dawn and Drew Show (http://dawnanddrew.podshow.com)
 
 The Big Show with Aaron and Jenny (www.bigshowradio.blogspot.
com)
 
 Kulture Kast (www.kulturekast.com)
These shows are difficult to describe because they change from day to day in 
their tone and approach to topics. These podcast are windows into the hosts’ 
world. True, most podcasts are, but in these podcasts, it’s about the moment, 
the here and now, and what is happening in their lives. There’s really no 
set subject or guest to interview. There is no burning topic, ripped from 
the headlines. It’s a group of people huddled around a microphone, giving 
their two cents on a week at work, what’s at the movies, and what band is 
currently dominating their iPods. From this slice-of-life approach comes a 
podcast that might make you laugh, might make you cry, and maybe — just 
maybe — make you think.
 
As it goes with slice-of-life podcasts, the general content can go in any way: 
G, PG-13, to “What did they just say?!” Always check the podcast’s listings (in 
directories, on their Web sites, or on iTunes for the Explicit tag) to see how 
“playfully blunt” these podcasts can get. For example, Dawn and Drew give a 
disclaimer on their homepage, a brief and simple warning that maybe they will 
dare to tread paths that few choose.

Spiritual Podcasts
In this book, we have referenced a few “critical thinking” podcasts 
(Skepticality, The Geologic Podcast), but alongside realists and skeptics in the 
podosphere are many podcasts of faith, spiritual studies, and meditation. It 
doesn’t matter what faith you follow or denomination you are a part of, there 
are all kinds of podcasts (also called Godcasts) offering everything from a 
prayer for the day to soothing music to meditate by.
Here are some examples:
 
 Catholic Insider (www.catholicinsider.com): When it comes to 
Godcasting, Father Roderick Vonhögen stands out as the trendsetter 
with his award-winning podcast, The Catholic Insider (shown in Figure 
18-4). He offers up commentary on Catholicism in the modern world, 
along with thoughts on Harry Potter, Narnia, and Star Wars. Father 
Roderick’s success inspired others to step into the podosphere, like 
Father Jay Finelli of iPadre (http://ipadre.net), Father Seraphim 
Beshoner’s Catholic: Under the Hood (http://catholicunderthe
hood.com), and Praystation Portable (http://sqpn.com/category/
spirituality/praystation-portable) offering divinities to go.
 
Figure 18-4: 
Want the 
inside scoop 
on the 
Catholic faith? 
Tune in to 
The Catholic 
Insider, a 
podcast that 
looks at life 
from the 
Archdio- 
cese’s point 
of view.
 
 
 Zencast (www.zencast.org): Zen is a study of Buddhism focusing on 
your present moment in life and how you are handling it. If this quick-
and-simple explanation has you curious, have a listen to the Zencast. The 
teachers featured there explore different Buddhist and Zen teachings. 
There are also episodes featuring new age music artists, techniques in 
meditation, methods of aligning bio-energies, and spiritual enlightenment.

324
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
 The Tarot Connection (www.tarotconnection.net): If your under-
standing of Tarot doesn’t reach beyond the 007 classic Live and Let 
Die, you need to know “There’s more to the cards than you realize, Mr. 
Bond.” A podcast like The Tarot Connection dispels many of the myths 
and misunderstandings of what card readings really mean and how 
they work. Host Leisa ReFalo, an author of two Tarot decks herself, 
talks Tarot on The Tarot Connection but also explores Journeywork, 
Astrology, Numerology, and other studies.
Podcasts of the Pen
When Tee stepped into podcasting, no author had yet set out to do what he 
was planning: to serialize a novel in podcasts, from beginning to end. Twenty-
two chapters of MOREVI and a preview of Legacy of MOREVI, over a period of 
23 weeks. But would anyone really want to listen?
Wow — people did want to listen and continue to do so months after its con-
clusion! And now, other authors have discovered the potential of this excit-
ing way to promote their works, their unpublished material, and (of course) 
themselves.
Podiobooks are podcast novels with the authors recording their works. 
Alongside Tee’s swashbuckling epic fantasy, MOREVI (www.morevi.net), 
many others have come on board, including
 
 The 7th Son Trilogy (http://jchutchins.net): J.C. Hutchins cap-
tured his audience from page 1 with his unpublished techno-thriller 
trilogy. From the twists, turns, and surprises, the podcast caught the 
attention of St. Martins Press and set the bar for podcast fiction at a new 
high.
 
 Crescent (www.crescentstation.net): From musician, podcaster, 
and author Phil Rossi, this science fiction/horror novel takes the 
“spooky, old mansion” and sets it not on Haunted Hill, but in the deepest 
corner of space. This podcast is best listened to with the lights on.
 
 The Immortals (http://podiobooks.com/title/the-immortals): 
Written and read by New York Times bestselling author Tracy Hickman, 
The Immortals is set in a not-so-distant future where the cure for AIDS 
mutates the virus into something far deadlier, and personal triumph 
must overcome the society this new disease has created. On listening 
to this, it’s no surprise Hickman’s podiobook won the Parsec Award for 
Best Novel of 2007.
Although many podcast titles available are science fiction, horror, and fan-
tasy, many other podiobooks step into other genres free of the scares, the 
deep space travels, and the dark magic. 

325
 Chapter 18: Top Ten Types of Podcasts to Check Out
 
 Jack Wakes Up (www.sethharwood.com): Movies had Dashell 
Hammet’s Sam Spade. Television had Mickey Spillane’s Mike Hammer. 
Podcasting has Seth Harwood’s Jack Palms, a one-hit-wonder of an actor 
who, after cleaning up his act, finds himself in a load of trouble. This 
time, there’s no stunt double around to take the fall.
 
 Marwan (http://podiobooks.com/title/marwan): On September 
11, 2001, America was attacked on three fronts. In Marwan, we see one of 
these battlefronts from the other point-of-view. This is 9-11 from the ter-
rorist’s perspective, and a look at how a terrorist is made.
 
 You’re Hired! (http://podiobooks.com/title/your-hired): 
Proving that you can podcast in any genre, You’re Hired! is a self-help 
podiobook for both the first-time job seeker and the seasoned profes-
sional looking for a change of pace. In these audio podcasts, helpful tips 
are handed down to help you get one step closer to that dream job.
Passionate Podcasts
There it is again! The P word — passion. Yes, yes, yes, there should be pas-
sion in every podcast you listen to, but some people do their thing simply as 
a celebration of something — a salute, dedication, or just plain declaration of 
love for a sport, TV show, or another interest that (for whatever reason) mat-
ters to a group of people. Here are some podcasts around such interests:
 
 The Signal (http://signal.serenityfirefly.com): This 
Parsec-winning podcast is a celebration of the prematurely cancelled 
sci-fi-Western-adventure television show Firefly. The Signal is a podcast 
from Firefly fans, for Firefly fans, and for people curious as to what the 
fuss is all about. The Signal continues to show support for an out-of-this-
world Western, its actors, and the crew behind the scenes as well as 
provide inspiration for other podcasts like the Parsec-winning ScapeCast 
(http://spacecast.org for the fans of Farscape) to start podcast-
ing their own passions about the innovative science fiction epic from 
Henson Studios.
 
 Steampunk Spectacular (http://steampunkspectacular.org): 
Curious about the subgenre where computers existed in the Victorian 
period, where airships rule the sky, and where incredible gadgets of 
unimaginable power were complex creations of gears, clockworks, and 
latches? It’s known as Steampunk, and Steampunk Spectacular is the 
podcast for anyone curious about this genre and a Gentlemen’s Club 
(ladies invited, with proper introductions and references, of course) for 
the hardcore fans. With book reviews, event announcements, interviews, 
and original fiction, Steampunk Spectacular is delightful camera obscura 
for the podosphere. 
 
 Cubscast (http://cubscast.com): If you are less into achieving 
inner peace and more into screaming from the cheap seats at Wrigley 
Field, then Cubscast may be what you’re looking for. As of the writing of 

326
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
this book, podcasts are available for the Boston Red Sox, the New York 
Yankees, the Oakland Athletics, and the new kids in the sport — the 
Washington Nationals. There are podcasts for professional wrestling, 
football (both American and European), and NASCAR, many of them fan-
based, fan-sponsored, and fan-hosted.
Podcasts about . . . Podcasting
It may sound redundant and feel a little odd to listen to a podcast about pod-
casting. It would be like having an electrician come over to another electri-
cian’s house to fix faulty electric wiring. But why not?
 
 podCast411 (http://podcast411.com): On this podcast about pod-
casting, Robert Walch picks the brains of podcasters from every genre, 
every recording method, and every work ethic, and asks them “So how 
do you do it?” and “Why do you do it?” The goal of podCast411 is to 
answer just those questions — and to keep podcasters informed about 
what is currently playing in the podosphere. Featuring these podcasts 
lets other podcasters tune in, listen, and use what they hear to make 
their own podcasts grow and improve.
 
 Podcast Junky (http://podcastjunky.com): Megan Enloe was, once 
upon a time, a fan of podcasting. Just a fan. Then her iPod started to 
fill up and so she got herself a larger one. When that iPod filled up, she 
upgraded again. Megan continued subscribing until her podcasts num-
bered well over 150 (and continued to climb!). She then discovered many 
of her favorites were still relatively unknown to other podcast listeners. 
“What are you listening to?” not only became her personal mantra, but it 
also became the motto for her own podcast review show, Podcast Junky, a 
show that spotlights new podcasts, laments over the ones that have pod-
faded, and talks with the voices that have been there from the beginning. 
If you want a podcast from the fan’s perspective, subscribe to Podcast 
Junky and you too can get hooked on a new media fix.
 
 Podcast Brothers (www.podcastbrothers.com): This podcast keeps 
the podosphere informed on the various trends, the experimental, and 
the really cool developments of podcasting. Tim and Emile Bourquin 
focus on the monetary side of podcasting — making quality media kits, 
best practices for calling on potential advertisers, and presenting your-
self as a professional. Again, two podcasters keep their attention on 
their passion of podcasting and keep their listeners and show producers 
in the know about what people are doing in this exciting medium.

Chapter 19
Top Ten Most Influential People 
in Podcasting 
I
f you’re reading this book, you’re likely new to podcasting and might have 
missed out on the trials and tribulations that went along with that huge 
growth spurt. As with any sudden rise, select individuals proved themselves 
to be instrumental to podcasting, as well as to other podcasters, during those 
formative times all those long months ago.
This chapter suggests ten (or so) of these individuals who will likely continue 
to influence the shape of things to come in the podcasting world. As you read 
these names, try to remember that these are regular people like the rest of 
us. True, some of them may seem larger than life (even in a field this new), 
but all of them put their pants on one leg at a time — unless they’re wearing 
kilts.
Although we encourage you to make your own decisions, a wise budding pod-
caster or future podcast star would do well to take a listen to the wisdom/
information/rants put forth by this group. Often controversial and usually 
informative, each of these people has a unique outlook on the world of pod-
casting. We’ve found these folks to be helpful guides in our own growth in 
podcasting. But (as we’ve said probably way too many times in this book for 
our editors’ tastes) your mileage may vary.
Dave Winer
Podcasting really wouldn’t be podcasting without the capability to enclose 
files inside an RSS feed — and Dave Winer is the one who made that happen 
with the development of RSS 0.92 and then RSS 2.0 specifications. Without 
that RSS extension, we’d all be downloading files in real time, wondering why 
anyone would put up a 65MB file.

Dave is one of the more interesting characters in the world of podcasting. In 
addition to his technical contributions, some would argue that Dave’s contri-
butions to the spirit of podcasting are every bit as important.
As of this writing, Dave continues to produce Morning Coffee Notes (http://
morningcoffeenotes.com). This podcast sticks with relatively rough-
and-ready production values, but it’s worth checking out as a pioneering 
approach. 
Dave’s show features Dave, a portable recording device, and his surround-
ings. Sometimes it’s a discussion about a piece of technology; sometimes it’s 
a conversation with an interesting individual. But listeners to Morning Coffee 
Notes are always treated to thought-provoking opinions and ideas from one of 
the progenitors of podcasting.
Dave is very much a “polarizing” individual with strong opinions he’s not 
afraid to share. He doesn’t pull any punches, and you always get the truth 
as he sees it. As is often true of strong opinions, the result is that some tech-
nologists bristle at the mention of his name, while others welcome his ability 
to look at challenges and conventional wisdom from a new perspective. Yes, 
he rambles — sometimes in directions that escape our personal interest or 
clash with our opinions on various topics. But he’s Dave Winer, a voice worth 
listening to. You can decide what to do with the information after that.
Adam Curry
In 1987, your authors were in college, and MTV (the icon of the generation 
that remembers when they actually played music videos) hired a new VJ 
named Adam Curry. Almost 20 years later, despite life experiences, diplomas, 
and other strange changes and artistic ventures, it’s still baffling to think 
that the same guy who was introducing the latest Madonna video is now “the 
Podfather.”
Adam Curry’s importance to the craft might be the single best example that 
illustrates the “just-do-it” nature of podcasting. It was Adam Curry, not some 
highly trained programmer, who hacked together the first podcatching client 
program to harness the power of the recently created enclosed-media files 
in RSS 2.0 feeds — and made them downloadable during the computer’s off 
hours.
Since that time, Adam has become the most recognized (and arguably the 
most popular) podcaster around. He continues to produce the Daily Source 
Code (DSC) at http://dailysourcecode.com, which was probably the 
first “podcast about nothing.” Listeners never know quite what to expect;

Adam could take them on a tour of his kitchen or discuss the latest round of 
talks that his company, BoKu Communications, is having or a content partner 
that will change the shape of podcasting. It’s the proverbial potluck show 
that contains its own joke.
It’s worth making time to listen to “the DSC,” even if you fast-forward through 
the parts that don’t appeal to you.
Steve Jobs and Bill Gates
To the best of our knowledge, neither Steve Jobs or Bill Gates have podcasts 
of their own, and you may be wondering why we’re listing them as influential. 
For those who don’t collect the Mega-Corporation Trading Card set, Steve 
Jobs and Bill Gates are the brains and founders of Apple and Microsoft, 
respectively. The actions of their companies have a distinct and unquestion-
able impact on the future of podcasting.
It’s not a big leap to assume that without the consumer adoption of the Apple 
iPod (which arguably has spurred sales of other portable audio-file players), 
podcasting would not have spread at the incredible rate it has. iTunes is, by 
far, the most popular podcatching client, making it easy for people to find, 
subscribe, and listen to podcasts. GarageBand continues to be developed 
with podcasters in mind, and it still remains an invaluable tool for even 
the seasoned veterans. When it comes to podcasting, Apple remains out 
front with the latest innovations with third-party software developers like 
Ambrosia eager to develop for the platform.
It may appear that Microsoft was late to the podcasting party, but as pod-
casts originate from, are transferred through, or wind up on a personal 
computer, the World That Bill Built is involved. Microsoft products are 
everywhere — from cellphones and PDAs to entire media centers and game 
consoles. In November 2006, Microsoft finally stepped into direct competi-
tion with Apple’s iPod by unveiling the Zune (www.zune.net), a portable 
audio and video player that offers many features iPod users have known and 
loved for years. On the Zune official Web site, The Marketplace — Microsoft’s 
music store where folks can find artists and their music — hosts a podcast 
directory where downloading podcasts remain only a click away.
Déjà vu, anyone?
This is only the beginning for Microsoft. Look for it to continue to turn out 
products that not only make use of podcasting technology, but also extend it 
in directions that directly benefit its bottom line.

Podcasting has been (and still is) a bootstrap movement, but with its popu-
larity, the big guns want to get into the game. Heck, they’re already here, 
changing the game as it’s forming. Such is the nature of all technology. Of 
course, other technology companies will exert their influence as well, but it’s 
worth remembering that market forces are in play already and will continue 
as podcasting progresses.
Doug Kaye
Doug Kaye is the driving force behind IT Conversations (itc.conversa
tionsnetwork.com), a collection of podcasts and programs that stay at the 
cutting edge of technology and innovation. With show hosts talking about 
everything from blogging to digital rights and new-media trailblazing, it’s easy 
to stay informed (though sometimes a challenge to keep up) if you listen to 
one or all of the programs Doug helps produce. (Good luck!)
Doug’s contribution to podcasting goes beyond simply assembling the best 
high-tech people to create the latest conversations about IT innovation — 
and providing them a vehicle for their thoughts. He’s actively seeking to cap-
ture speakers, panel discussions, and conversations from various events and 
expositions all over the world. There’s a vast amount of knowledge shared 
in these venues, and Doug’s opinion is that too few people get a chance to 
hear about it. He’s working hard to change that by capturing those discus-
sions as they happen and making them part of the IT Conversations family of 
offerings. In essence, he’ll be archiving this knowledge for future interested 
people. (Should be quite a future.)
It’s a great plan; one that takes an incredible amount of dedication. Doug 
works closely with his show hosts to make sure their podcasts are engaging, 
sound great, and are a joy for interested people to listen to.
Rob Walch
Every few weeks or so, Rob Walch releases another edition of podCast411 
(http://podcast411.com), often referred to as the Inside the Actor’s Studio 
for podcasters. His episodes feature an interview with another podcaster 
about . . . podcasting. Although that may sound a bit like navel-gazing, you 
might be surprised at how worthy the content is to add to your already over-
loaded subscription list.

331
 Chapter 19: Top Ten Most Influential People in Podcasting
Podcasters should be listening to Rob’s show because it’s about what they 
do. Who better to learn new tips and tricks from than the people actually 
doing the tricks on their shows every week? Most of the conversations stay 
focused at a fairly high level, avoiding the “detail dump” that would turn off 
most people.
Rob talks with other podcasters not only about how they podcast but also 
why they do it. For every question about a microphone or particular piece 
of hardware, Rob digs deeper into the goals of the show, the way the hosts 
approach their craft, and what their hopes and dreams are.
It’s a fascinating show for anyone interested in learning from others who are 
constantly refining their shows. If you’re podcasting, you should be listening 
to this one.
Mur Lafferty
Podcasting has never been a “Man’s World,” as female podcasters were 
blazing trails in 2004 alongside the boys. Some of those leading ladies of the 
RSS feeds have either podfaded — meaning they slowly stopped producing 
content without any announcement — or moved on to other pursuits, but 
one remains to this day as an outstanding podcast personality: Mur Lafferty 
(http://murverse.com). She is referred to (with great affection) as “The 
Grand Dame of Podcasting.” 
Mur Lafferty’s podcasting career began with Geek Fu Action Grip, a show that 
was commentary about what was going on in her life, what games she was play-
ing, and what bands she was listening to. Each episode of Geek Fu ended with 
an original essay of something that struck her funny bone in that particular way. 
This podcast spawned I Should Be Writing, the 2007 Parsec-winning podcast 
documenting her own tests and trials in getting her first novel published.
She has never stopped raising the bar for podcasters. Keeping many of her pod-
casts to the basics, Mur produces quality content from both sides of the brain: 
the analytical (I Should Be Writing) and the creative (The Heaven series, Playing 
for Keeps). Mur, with her talent in writing, also raises the bar for other creative 
podcasters, inspiring many to podcast their own fiction and even return to a 
writing passion they had stepped away from for many years. 
It’s hard to listen to podcasts and not hear the name of Mur Lafferty. It’s 
harder still to subscribe to any Mur Laffery podcast and not be completely 
taken by her. Her personality shines in every episode, with every work, and 
with every show.

Joe Murphy
April 1, 2007 can truly be called “the best of times, the worst of times” for 
podcasting. Horror-writer and popular podcaster Scott Sigler took the print 
version of his podcast, Ancestor (print version published by Dragon Moon 
Press), to number one on Amazon.com’s Science Fiction and Horror lists. 
That success was eclipsed slightly with the death of podcaster Joe Murphy.
Joe Murphy was one of the early voices in podcasting, first providing book 
reviews for The Dragon Page’s Cover-to-Cover and an extra opinion on Slice 
of Scifi. Although he was reluctant to create an original podcast, Joe’s no-
nonsense personality and opinions earned him a fan base of his own, a fan 
base that followed him between both aforementioned shows and then on to 
the Wingin’ It! and The Kick Ass Mystic Ninjas podcasts from FarPoint Media. 
In the winter of 2006, Joe’s voice chimed in less and less, and the community 
noticed. He came on Wingin’ It! to let listeners know that he had been diag-
nosed with Leiomyosarcoma, an extremely aggressive form of cancer. Six 
months later, Joe was gone.
Joe’s death galvanized the community of podcasters around the world. 
Letters of support and donations to FarPoint Media (which later, Leann 
Mabry used to put together the Joe Murphy Memorial Fund), podcasters like 
J.C. Hutchins, Philippa Ballantine, and George Hrab gave tributes on their 
shows, and many podcasts (both FarPoint Media and outside the network) 
went dark in Joe’s memory. Although many people in this international com-
munity had never met Joe, they “knew” him, and his loss is still felt.
Along with the memorial fund, the podcast Give Us a Minute (www.joemur
phymemorialfund.org) and the Joe Murphy Memorial Award (presented 
at the Parsecs for community outreach and awareness through the medium) 
remain as his legacy to a community that still misses him.
Brian Ibbott
We put Brian Ibbott on this list for two reasons. First, he’s one of the original 
music podcasters, and you might be thinking of starting a music podcast of 
your own. (Hey, lots of us wanted to be DJs when we were kids.) More impor-
tantly, Brian is a music podcaster who is doing it right — the legal way.
As mentioned in Chapter 4, podcasting licensed music legally is a challenge. 
With his podcast Coverville (http://coverville.com), Brian works 
directly with ASCAP, BMI, with the musicians, and other organizations that 
hold the rights to major-label music and songs. Although many music pod-
casters are just a process server away from a major lawsuit, Brian is sitting 
pretty.

333
 Chapter 19: Top Ten Most Influential People in Podcasting
Brian also serves as an example of how to create a niche podcast out of the 
music you love and fill a void not covered by the traditional outlets. Brian 
has a passion for cover songs and has built a show completely around songs 
that fit that bill. Not only that, but he’s taken it a step further, featuring 
groups of cover songs that have a common thread and producing themed epi-
sodes of his podcast. Simply brilliant — we don’t know of any radio stations 
or programs that provide this service.
So before you rush out to make the next hot music podcast, consider the 
legal ramifications. And while you’re pondering that, also ask whether your 
future podcast sounds like the same stuff people can listen to over their 
radios. Follow Brian’s lead and give the world something different with your 
podcast.
Grant Baciocco
If you were a child of the ’70s, you probably remember Schoolhouse Rock, 
ABC’s series of educational vignettes in between cartoon features that 
taught you something about American History, grammar, math, or science. 
These animated shorts were out to entertain as well as educate; and thanks 
to Schoolhouse Rock, a generation not only can recite the Preamble to the 
United States Constitution, but can sing it.
Grant Baciocco has created his own version of Schoolhouse Rock with The 
Radio Adventures of Dr. Floyd (http://doctorfloyd.com); and just like Bill 
on the steps of Capitol Hill, Naughty Number 9, and Interplanetary Janet, the 
cast of characters on this podcast are making impressions on their listeners, 
young and old.
Taking the approach of Schoolhouse Rock and throwing in a touch of Rocky & 
Bullwinkle for fun, show creators Grant Baciocco and Doug Price continue to 
produce a podcast that shows exactly how much you can accomplish in five 
minutes. Featuring original music from Jody Whitesides and the talents of 
guest actors like Lani Tupu (Farscape), Jeffrey Tambor (Hellboy), June Foray 
(Rocky & Bullwinkle), and Joel Hodgson and Frank Conniff (Mystery Science 
Theatre 3000), The Radio Adventures of Dr. Floyd keeps its delivery sharp and 
the content family-friendly, reaching audiences everywhere of all ages.
Don’t underestimate the influence of Dr. Floyd. As a testament of how much 
impact you can have in a short amount of time, The Radio Adventures of Dr. 
Floyd is bringing mom, dad, and the kid(s) around the iPod for a bit of the 
old-school radio drama with a high-tech sound. This podcast has become 
such a hit with parents that it’s being replayed in classrooms from coast 
to coast, laying down the groundwork for other podcasters to explore the 
educational application of the media. It’s likely that many other educational 
entertainment podcasts will follow.

Dave Chekan, Matt Hoopes, Marty 
Mulligan, and Dave Mansueto
Podcasting sucks. Bandwidth, that is. A lot of it, as we discuss in Chapters 
3 and 10. Without Dave Chekan, Matt Hoopes, Marty Mulligan, and Dave 
Mansueto (DMMD, as we like to call them), many podcasters would have 
folded up shop long ago because they couldn’t afford to pay their hosting bill.
DMMD gave the podcasting world Liberated Syndication (http://libsyn.
com) — now part of Wizzard Media — providing unbelievably cheap hosting 
and serving of podcast media files at a time when subscribers were flocking 
toward podcasts like lemmings off the cliff.
LibSyn is helping to change the paradigm of bandwidth and media-file deliv-
ery systems. Okay, nontechnical types may find it boring, scarily technical, 
and incredibly complicated — but it’s a complete necessity for any podcaster 
who receives a modicum of popularity. Luckily for everyone, these four guys 
make it a breeze to keep your podcasts going when the wave hits.
As with any small company, they’ve weathered some rough spots along 
the way. But DMMD are committed to sticking it out, and we hope podcast-
ers continue to stand by them or other companies like theirs. Because the 
thought of paying for incremental bandwidth is simply too scary to consider 
unless you win the lottery.

Top Ten Reasons Why Podcasting 
Won’t Kill Radio

o you remember when you tuned in to MTV and actually saw music 
videos? Good times, good times. If you ever want to throw out some 
fun trivia, ask, “What was the first video to ever play on MTV and what group 
performed in it?” The answer is the video for the song “Video Killed the Radio 
Star” by the Buggles.
As goofy, chintzy, and utterly new wave as that song is, there was a bit of a 
panic when MTV went on the air. Radio stations suddenly had to compete 
with television over rock stars! Listeners were listening to music on their 
TVs! What will become of the music industry as we know it?!
Well, radio is still here. MTV now shows a variety of programming, and very 
little of it includes music videos. Radio — much to the contrary of what bean 
counters and consultants convince program directors — has survived MTV, 
Napster, Internet radio, and Howard Stern’s jump to satellite radio.
Now comes podcasting, and what many in the broadcasting industry dis-
missed as the next wave of Internet radio. Even though podcasting is a 
new medium that’s easily disregarded, the radio industry is taking notice. 
Although it would be neat to think that podcasting is the people’s radio and 
will bring about the downfall of the radio, the radio industry won’t be closing 
its doors. No, the corporate radio business will continue to stand strong and 
still smell as pretty as a red rose in full bloom.
The Undiscovered Country: 
Podcasting Awareness
Podcasting has certainly come a long way since 2004, and yet it isn’t uncom-
mon to hear this question: “What’s a podcast?”

336
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Something like this happened to Evo when a mechanic at his local auto body 
garage spotted his license plate, which reads, simply enough, PODCAST. The 
mechanic asked, “What’s a podcast?”
When you use the word radio, even with the word satellite tacked in front 
of it, people understand the concept and know what you’re talking about. 
For some, podcasting sounds too much like something geeks do for fun, but 
we’re here to tell you that even geeks don’t know what podcasting is!
Radio has decades of history, ranging from Orson Welles’ War of the Worlds, 
to Abbott and Costello, to FDR’s Fireside Chats, to Edward R. Murrow bring-
ing the news from London during World War II. In contrast, podcasting’s his-
tory includes socialite Paris Hilton, a technical writer named Grammar Girl 
who helps the world communicate clearer, and Adam Curry, a former MTV VJ 
who refers to himself as “The Podfather.”
It’s the newness of podcasting, along with the comfort level and familiarity 
of the general public (geeks included), that will keep radio in the forefront of 
broadcasting audio content. Perhaps marketers see a potential here, and so 
they should, but it’ll be a few more feeds, a few more articles in print media, 
and a little more innovation before podcasting can truly unhinge radio.
Are You Sure You Want to Say That?: 
Benefits of the FCC
The origins of George Carlin’s famous rant “The Seven Dirty Words You 
Can Never Say on Television” stems from a routine appearing on the album 
Indecent Exposure. The monologue was played on Pacifica radio station 
WBAI-FM, bringing on the wrath of the Federal Communications Commission. 
Since then, the FCC has kept a watchful eye on what is said and done on the 
public airwaves of both television and radio.
The lack of restraints and restrictions of the FCC, allowing podcasters to go 
far beyond what is considered by the government as decent, is not only pod-
casting’s greatest strength but also its greatest weakness. Part of the appeal 
of on-air personalities like Howard Stern is watching how far they’re willing to 
go in order to challenge the FCC. However, without the restraints of the FCC, 
Stern can now cuss like a sailor, go way above and beyond what can be heard 
on conventional radio, and not care what he does or who he offends. Does 
this mean he loses some of the appeal he had on terrestrial radio? Perhaps.
But here’s a more obvious way the FCC gives broadcast radio an advantage 
over podcasting: You know that what you’ll listen to is deemed free from pro-
fanity and (generally) safe for various age groups. That can’t always be said 
for podcasting. On your podcast, if you’re swearing and producing content 

337
 Chapter 20: Top Ten Reasons Why Podcasting Won’t Kill Radio
that’s nothing better than prerecorded locker room talk, you’re probably in 
the clear because people know what to expect. However, if your podcast is 
on hobbies, politics, or sports, don’t blindside your audience with profanity 
just because you can.
So Many Podcasts, So Many Choices
An incredible thing about podcasting is how many choices listeners have 
in the way of content. Podcasting offers thousands of feeds, ranging from 
general topics of interest to narrower topics that appeal to more specialized 
audiences.
Conventional radio, however, has to vie for available airwaves and signal 
strength as well as fulfill a specific demand in the area. Sure, you may have 
choice in your listening area. For example, in the Washington, D.C. area, Tee 
can listen to either DC101 or Arrow 94.7 if he wants to hear classic rock. 
If both stations are playing music he’s not keen on, Tee must weather the 
storm and wait in the hopes of better programming. Podcasting, on the other 
hand, grants the freedom to choose from a variety that radio, be it public air-
waves or satellite, could never deliver.
But is it possible to have too many choices? From a marketing perspective, 
yes, there can be so many choices offered to a consumer that the brain can’t 
process that much information all at once. Then there’s an issue of time. Do 
you have that much time in the day to listen to however many podcasts you 
register for? When you’re searching for the right sports channel, you can 
more easily narrow down which show is best suited for your interests if you 
have 20 sports shows to choose from on satellite radio, as opposed to 188 
various sports podcasts.
So even though choice and variety are good things, too much can be a little 
overwhelming.
Quality versus Quantity
Someone once said, “Just because you own a camera doesn’t make you a 
photographer.” The same can be said for podcasting. Because of the low cost 
of entry to podcasting, a lot of people give it a try. Some have talent, and 
others — well, let’s just say they’re not photographers. With radio or TV, you 
have some baseline expectations of quality:

338
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
 Audio and video quality: Broadcast radio and TV stations hire people 
based on their qualifications, such as journalism, meteorology, commu-
nications, and so on and they invest in their equipment. Podcasters on 
the other hand need none of these qualifications to get started — only 
a $20 microphone. As a result, you get a wide variety of audio/video 
quality. Some podcasts sound and/or look like they were recorded in an 
expensive studio (which may be true), and some sound like they were 
done on a garage sale walkie-talkie. You never know what you’ll get.
 
 Delivery quality: Remember, the people on radio or TV are trained 
professionals — at least that’s what they want you to believe. Most went 
to school and studied, apprenticed, and competitively worked their way 
to the positions they hold. In general, they know how to deliver a mes-
sage about politics, sports, tech, music, comedy, or a variety of other 
topics. If the world doesn’t like them, they’re out of a job. Podcasting? 
Again, it’s hit or miss. To be fair, most podcasters are genuine. They 
have a passion — they get an A for effort. Some are good at delivering 
their messages, and others make Ben Stein sound like a caffeine addict.
 
 Content quality: In many cases, radio and TV have writers and editors 
to make the content rich. Trained professionals know how to direct an 
interview or change subject if it’s leading nowhere. Even the authors of 
this book wish they had writers and editors for their podcasts! That’s 
not to say that all podcast content is lacking for quality. Some of it is 
excellent, insightful, thought provoking, and controversial, but you’re 
going to have to search for it. 
I Can’t Name That Tune: Music in 
Podcasting
Music is a popular topic in podcasting. In fact, it’s the most popular podcast 
topic. At the time of this writing, over 7,000 podcasts are listed on Podcast 
Alley (http://podcastalley.com) in the Music/Radio genre. As impres-
sive as this may sound, hold your applause. As it was said in The Hitchhiker’s 
Guide to the Galaxy, “Things are not always as they seem.”
The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) is about as happy 
about podcasting as it was about Napster. With recent lawsuits following file-
sharing technologies and the swapping of music files, legal teams are merely 
waiting to hop into their fleet of Tumblers (thank you, Batman Begins) and 
hunt down copyright offenders, and podcasting (in particular, music pod-
casts) has the potential to be a favorite target of the RIAA.
If you want to podcast a tribute, for example, to Billy Joel — call it the Big 
Shot Podcast: All Billy Joel; All the Time — you have to pay licensing fees to 
the RIAA just as radio stations across the country do. These licensing fees 
can be costly to the average podcaster.

339
 Chapter 20: Top Ten Reasons Why Podcasting Won’t Kill Radio
If you want to play the new releases from Coldplay, Switchfoot, and U2, you 
won’t be able to do it for free. Because radio stations have the backing of 
corporate entities like Viacom, these fees are simply chump change for them. 
For the podcaster, that fee could be spent elsewhere . . . like rent.
A Prerecorded Show, Recorded Live: Live 
Remotes versus Remote Podcasting
Some podcasts are slice-of-life podcasts, recording a day in the life of the 
podcaster. These remote podcasts can be anything from a trip to the super-
market to the more-popular (and quite-fun-to-participate-in) beercasts, where 
friends just sit around and sample the beers of whatever establishment 
they’re visiting. However, this is what separates podcasting from traditional 
radio/TV: Podcasts are all prerecorded.
Radio will always have the advantage of immediate content. Radio broadcasts 
bring live concerts, sporting events, and news to listeners. Sure, podcasting 
can serve as an archive for legendary moments of sports or history, but — 
while it’s neat to hear Al Michaels scream, “Do you believe in miracles!?” — 
nothing can beat the moment itself, whether you’re watching it on television, 
listening to it on the radio, or fortunate enough to be there. The same can be 
said for the climax of Roger Waters’s The Wall Live in Berlin concert or the 
2004 Boston Red Sox breaking the curse.
Radio will always have the advantage of transporting audiences to history 
as it happens, keeping listeners in the know of current events, and deliver-
ing content at that very moment. Satellite radio now solves the problem of 
limited reception. Subscribers to satellite radio never have to worry about 
losing a signal, staying with the live coverage from the beginning to the end.
Some may argue that streaming and conferencing technologies like TalkShoe 
(www.talkshoe.com), Skype (www.skype.com), and UStream (www.
ustream.tv) allow the podcaster a sense of “live” reporting. However this 
requires the podcaster and the listener to be on a specific schedule. What’s 
more, only a very small percentage of the overall listeners “tune in” at the 
right time to hear the show being streamed live. Don’t get us wrong: This is a 
cool way to interact with your listeners. It just doesn’t compare with the con-
venience radio has.
Advertising: Show Me the Numbers
Potential advertisers will ask podcasters the same question they ask a radio 
station’s sales representative: “So, what kind of numbers does your show pull 
in? How can I justify the cost of running ads on your show?”

340
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
The radio executive can pull out a ratings chart for his or her morning show 
and tell the perspective advertiser that the show pulls in a 12 share, which 
means 24,000 people are listening to the show. He can also break down the 
ratings points into age and gender groups, to give the executive an idea of 
what kind of listener tunes in.
The podcaster says, “We measure by bandwidth and downloads.” Already, 
the podcaster has probably lost the potential advertiser with the word band-
width. So the advertiser asks, “How many downloads do you have a month?” 
He looks at the numbers and asks, “Is that men and women, 18–25?” The pod-
caster doesn’t really know for sure. 
Advertisers want to know who your audience is and how your podcast can 
make a difference in getting people to their business. True, a podcast — 
unlike radio — reaches a much wider audience. A global one, in fact. But for 
many local businesses, reaching a global market is less important than reach-
ing their “closer” clients. You can measure your podcast’s downloads many 
different ways, but when it comes to target groups (also known as demo-
graphics), radio holds an advantage with the ratings system in place.
Podcasting will eventually refine the various methods of measuring listener-
ship and subscribers, and there are various scripts available that can be down-
loaded and incorporated into feeds and Web pages that can produce accurate 
numbers. But they’re a far cry from the sophisticated ratings books generated 
for radio stations and their programming. Until computer programmers can 
come up with something more in-depth and easier for nontechnical types to 
understand, it will be radio’s ratings shares trumping the podcast downloads.
My Corner of the World: Local News
It’s early morning rush hour and time to head out with a cup of joe, a break-
fast burrito, and your newspaper. You get into the car and plug in your MP3 
player and listen to the latest installment of The Daily Source Code, a change 
of pace from the local news station that is your usual morning fare. Only ten 
minutes into your commute, you run into a traffic jam. Thirty minutes later, 
you haven’t moved. So you switch to your radio and hear:
“And as we have been reporting all morning, the trailer spilling biohaz-
ardous waste has caused a strange mutation to spread from car to car 
now trapped on the interstate. And it appears that some of the drivers 
closest to the tanker are eating the other commuters . . .”
You look up, just in time to see a small group of grey-skinned commuters 
with freakily glowing eyes walking toward you. What a different morning it 
would have been if you had listened to the radio. Broadcast radio can keep 
listeners informed with up-to-moment local news, a distinct advantage that

 Chapter 20: Top Ten Reasons Why Podcasting Won’t Kill Radio
If you want to entice listeners to visit your community, traffic reports and 
local headlines might not be what you want to use. Add the problem of being 
unable to perform true live reports, and the immediacy and urgency of local 
issues, traffic reports, and weather forecasts are lost. Local commercial- 
and community-sponsored radio continues to fill a demand that podcasting 
cannot: late-breaking news in the area.
So before plugging in your MP3 player for your morning drive, you might 
want to plug in to your local news radio station first, just to avoid any apoca-
lyptic backups on the interstate.
10-4, Good Buddy: Satellite Radio 
versus Podcasting 
Satellite radio (XM and SIRIUS leading the charge) exclusively holds one 
advantage over podcasting: continuous content. Satellite radio also solves 
the problem of traditional AM/FM radio in that the signal is clean, clear, and 
constant from one coast to the other. It is 24 hours of content that continu-
ously refreshes itself.
In a 14- to 16-hour nonstop trek across the country, satellite radio can offer 
new and original programming. To achieve the same thing with podcasting, 
you would have to program into a podcatching client at least 28 podcast feeds 
(provided the podcasts are an average of 30 minutes in length), download 
them, sync them with your portable MP3 player, and then take it on the road.
It isn’t impossible to have podcasts take you from one coast to the other and 
back again, but as far as keeping the content original and new from beginning 
to end, you’re looking at an impressive collection of feeds numbering in the 
30s to 40s. There’s also a bit more work involved with podcasting in program-
ming in the feeds, downloading, and then syncing the casts. With satellite 
radio, you simply have to turn on the unit.
Audio for the People, by the People, but 
Not Necessarily Embraced by the People
To listen to a radio broadcast, you need a simple transistor radio, a power 
supply, and a strong signal. Anyone can tune in, and you can listen anywhere 
within range of the transmission signal.

342
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
To listen to a podcast, you need the following:
 
 A computer
 
 A power supply
 
 An Internet connection
 
 An aggregator/podcatching client to subscribe and automatically down-
load the audio content
 
 An MP3 player on the computer for listening at home or a portable MP3 
player for the road.
The sad reality of a podcast is that you can tell your family about it, but that 
doesn’t mean that they’ll listen. Your grandmother might download and have 
a listen, but that’s if she’s up on the latest Internet trends. Otherwise, she’ll 
miss your podcast.
An advantage of radio is that you tell your family about your radio show. You 
give them the station and broadcast time. They tune in.
Listeners need to have some familiarity with technology and some Internet 
know-how to be able to set up their computers to receive feeds. Although 
iTunes has opened the door for podcasting to reach the general public, pod-
casters are still working against the technophobia in receiving a podcast 
versus turning on a radio, tuning in, and listening. 

Chapter 21
Top Ten Reasons Why Podcasting 
Will Kill (Or Seriously Dent) Radio
P
odcasting is just a fad.”
“This is nothing more than streaming audio, and that didn’t go anywhere.”
“I’ve listened to a few podcasts, and I’m not impressed.”
The nay-sayers of podcasting (especially those who have no idea what it is, 
have never listened to one, but are the first to dismiss it) have a plethora 
of reasons why podcasting will fail or never catch on in mainstream media. 
Even with the thousands of podcasts available, their listenership steadily 
rising, radio and other traditional media outlets have nothing to fear.
Or do they?
Chapter 20 gives you a few reasons why radio will continue to be radio for 
the foreseeable future. Here, we take the opposite vantage point. Although 
the chapter title may be a bit — okay, a lot — of blue skies and optimism, we 
believe the powers-that-be in charge of the large corporate media conglomer-
ates have been observing the podcasting phenomenon for the past few years 
with a wary eye.
Here are a few (ten, to be exact) reasons why.
Podcasters Don’t Need No 
Stinking Transmitters
The distance a terrestrial radio station can transmit a signal is dependent on 
three things: tower height, transmitter strength, and government regulations 
(which in the case of the United States is designated by the FCC). The first 
two are physical limitations that control how far a signal can travel. At some 
point, geography gets in the way or the signal-to-noise ratio simply gets too 

344
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
low to allow for continued reception. The latter serves as the rules and guide-
lines needed in order to control the competitive environment, ensuring that 
stations in different cities transmitting on the same frequency don’t have to 
worry about their signals crossing over one another.
Podcasting is free from all those trappings. Instead of traveling in relation to the 
topography of the land, podcasts travel along the topography of the Internet. 
A show released as a podcast in Arlington, Virginia, is just as easy to pick up in 
Perth, Australia, as it is for someone 20 miles away in Washington, D.C.
Syndicated radio programs rely on network relationships with various radio 
stations, each one picking up and rebroadcasting the program to its local 
area to achieve nationwide or sizeable regional coverage. Satellite radio 
doesn’t have those same limitations, but even it can’t boast of global cover-
age unless it adds a few more multimillion-dollar satellites to its arsenal.
Syndicated and satellite radio have nothing on podcasts. A podcast of excep-
tional quality and high personal appeal produced out of northern Scotland, 
for example, can (and occasionally does) enjoy worldwide distribution via 
RSS the moment the podcast is available online. Even the most popular pro-
grams on the largest radio networks in the world cannot make this claim.
 
Reality check time: Just because folks all over the world can listen to your 
podcast doesn’t mean that they will. Provided they can get your show, they 
first need to understand what language you’re speaking. And even if they all 
decide your program is the best thing since sliced baklava, listening to your 
program still requires a computer connection (high speed, preferable) and a 
player of some kind, be it on the computer or a portable one. So simmer down 
and get your head out of the clouds.
Podcasting Is Outside of 88.1 and 107.9 
(And 530 and 1690)
The FCC (or similar government agencies worldwide) allows a radio station 
to transmit on a specific frequency. That frequency falls somewhere between 
the end points of the AM and FM radio dial (88.1–107.9 for FM and 530–1690 
for AM). In other words, you can’t tune in to 87.3 or 108.7 FM, nor could you 
hear anything if you could get your little orange stick to move to 450 or 1710 
AM. (Yeah, okay, that dates us, doesn’t it?)
Really boring physics that you probably didn’t pay attention to in high school 
tells you that there’s a limited number of frequencies between those two end 
points of the spectrum. Rather than make you do the equations, trust us that 
fewer than about 200 radio stations are in any given area, split between the AM 
and FM spectrum. Two hundred may sound like a lot of radio stations, and it 

345
 Chapter 21: Top Ten Reasons Why Podcasting Will Kill (Or Seriously Dent) Radio
is. But due to a host of other incredibly mind-numbing physics issues and the 
hard facts of economics, you’re unlikely to find that many choices in your area. 
True, satellite radio differs from this. However, while satellite radio allows for 
many more channels than terrestrial radio, it still has very real limits.
But pretend for a moment that money and physics weren’t an issue and that 
station owners were willing to take any slot they could get on the spectrum. 
Two hundred stations is a drop in the bucket when you consider how many 
podcasts you can access with a click of the mouse.
Can you say “unlimited”? Seriously. The Internet wasn’t designed with a hard 
limit on the number of connections. When network traffic gets slow, the com-
panies that rely on those connections find ways to add more capacity. As the 
Internet has no end in sight (unless you go to www.shibumi.org/eoti.
htm), we aren’t in danger of filling it up anytime soon.
The Rats Are Leaving the USS 
Commercial Media
Though the mega-corp media companies will squirm to hear us say it, the 
populous is spending less time with their radios, televisions, and newspa-
pers. It’s not that these staples of news and information are somehow less 
effective than they were 50 years ago. People are discovering new, improved, 
and more interactive ways to get their content and are making the switch.
Do a quick Web search (hey look! another interactive media), and you can 
find all the supporting documentation you need. Blog posts, podcasts, and 
news articles both online and even in print talk about Web 2.0 and how 
consumers are turning to interactive television, online vendors (such as 
YouTube, iTunes, and Google News), and video games for their news, infor-
mation, and entertainment. A 2006 study from the Forrester Research, Inc., 
found that one-quarter of all online consumers (the people who log on to the 
Internet) subscribe to podcasts because they can access the audio and video 
on their schedule, not someone else’s. Traditional media, if not on a serious 
decline, has hit a plateau at best.
We can toss out a host of reasons for this exodus, but it all boils down to one 
thing: convenience. You’re still stuck with a 24-hour clock, and try as you 
might, you just can’t cram any more hours in the day. Leisure time for most 
people is decreasing, so the ability to consume media on the go is critical 
to many. With new devices like the iPhone, the iPod Touch, and cell phones 
that can do everything but cook your breakfast (but can they take a call 
and keep you connected, we ask), podcasting has become even easier for 
people to subscribe and listen. Podcasting offers audio and video on your 

346
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
time, wherever you may be, leaving the other forms of media consumption 
contemplating innovative ways to become more portable. Maybe that’s why 
so many media outlets (CBS, ABC, CNN, Comedy Central) are entering the 
podosphere.
Podcasters Don’t Have to Care That Most 
People Don’t Care
Because of the physical, legal, and economic limitations on traditional broad-
casters, they have to make every second of their programming day count. 
How well they perform this task is in the ratings, and the all-important rat-
ings share becomes the only thing that counts. When you try to appeal to the 
greatest number of people, the content often gets watered down. You trade 
intensity for density, and you sacrifice important and compelling programs 
for those that require a little less thought and are easily digestible.
As a natural result of this homogenization of radio, specialty and niche pro-
grams get pushed to the fringes of the clock, when listenership is already 
low due to the human body’s sleep requirement. The station owner needs to 
fill the time with something, and it’s a convenient way for him to say, “See? I 
carry cutting edge and meaningful content.” He leaves out the “. . . at 4 a.m.” 
part, though.
But podcasting is all about the niche because the podosphere has no prime 
time. No one has to make hard decisions about putting great, but laser-
focused, programs in a bad time slot. Whether a show has hundreds or thou-
sands of listeners, it makes no difference to the non-existent programming 
lineup. It’s a matter of personal preference in the hands of the people listen-
ing, and no sacrifices are required to appeal to anyone more than those who 
are interested in tuning in.
We’ll Be Right Back after a Brief Word 
from Our Sponsors . . . 
Podcasters, by and large, are more sensitive to the perception of too much 
commercialization. Many prefer to do it for the passion and the love of pro-
ducing something very personal; they prefer not to make money or “work for 
the man.” On the flip side of this very important coin, some podcasters want 
to run commercials to not only pay the bills but also to make money. (Getting 
paid to podcast! How cool is that?!) As podcasting works to try and come up 
with a reliable and standardized approach to measuring listenership (like 
The Nielsen Ratings), it’s a challenge to sell a podcast to advertisers. 

347
 Chapter 21: Top Ten Reasons Why Podcasting Will Kill (Or Seriously Dent) Radio
So why exactly is the advertising dollar turning to podcasts?
 
 Podcasts can create a ready made target audience. Many advertisers 
hope that consumers are watching or listening to the commercials on 
TV or radio. People who subscribe to a podcast are there because they 
are choosing to be there. Consumers are demanding this podcast, so if 
you’re advertising Mac accessories in a podcast about Macs, your audi-
ence is receptive.
 
 Portable devices have proven themselves a popular means of con-
suming media. With iTunes carrying television and movies and the 
prevalence of iPhones (with the one millionth iPhone sold within three 
months of its premiere) and PlayStation Portable devices, you can now 
expect your media to be as mobile as you are. Advertisers now have an 
even more direct way of reaching consumers through such devices.
 
 The podcast audience is a captive audience. Advertisers have tried 
to get consumers attentions by boosting the volume of commercials 
(pretty annoying) or offering “bonus content” that can be seen only 
during the commercials (pretty silly). With a podcast, people are listen-
ing because they want to listen. A captive audience is the advertiser’s 
dream. 
The podosphere still harbors a less-is-more approach and is very cognizant 
that over-commercialization can have a detriment on a podcaster’s ability to 
reach a wider audience. Also, as podcasting remains an undiscovered coun-
try of media, you won’t get rich quick with it. Still, why not get paid doing 
something you love?
Podcasting Can Extend Public Radio
Mention public radio to many people, and minds immediately turn to end-
less classical music, bluegrass and dry humor courtesy of The Prairie 
Home Companion, and in-depth analysis of the current political situation in 
Uzbekistan. It seems that public radio is acting as a counterbalance to the 
extreme sensationalism that is commercial radio by being anything but.
Say what you want about public radio, but we happen to like it. 
Unfortunately, much of the special-interest programming we would enjoy 
isn’t on at a convenient time. Similarly, we’ve heard great programs on other 
stations while traveling around the country that simply aren’t available in our 
local area.
Podcasting extends public radio beyond its airwaves’ limitations, whether 
you take that literally or figuratively. National Public Radio (www.npr.org) 
is often the first experience for listeners new to the podosphere, and NPR 

348
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
continues to repurpose its programming in podcasts, allowing listeners the 
freedom of time-shifting. Additionally, many NPR-esque podcasts (art maga-
zines, yoga tutorials, political discussions, and so on) are appearing, again 
spreading the feeling and spirit of public radio, minus the radio.
Of course you can find plenty of sensationalistic and commercialized pod-
casts in the mix, and these over-the-top podcasters go head-to-head (whether 
consciously or not) with the sensationalistic and commercial radio programs 
already on the airwaves. Because public radio is less about competition and 
more about cooperation, mutually beneficial relationships are developing 
between public broadcasters and podcasters.
John Q. Public — Program Director
Program directors are the people responsible for setting what you hear on a 
station. The program directors pick the content, sometimes with lots of help 
and guidance from the larger corporate body or from a computer keeping 
track of album sales and Billboard charts. If it’s a music station, the program 
directors pick the genre of music that’s played, the individual tracks, and the 
artists, which are usually in track with the station’s chosen market (country, 
jazz, contemporary hits, and so on). The same goes for talk and sports radio. 
In a nutshell, if something makes it on the air, it passed across the director’s 
desk for approval.
We’ve known a few program directors. Many have an uncanny knack for 
selecting the hosts, programs, and style of entertainment that resonates to 
the listeners in their community. But so far, none of them have made a sta-
tion we can listen to for more than a few hours straight.
This isn’t a negative comment about program directors, mind you. This is 
merely an observation about programming for one versus programming for 
many. Although podcasting networks — such as FarPoint Media (http://
farpointmedia.net) and SQPN: The Best in Catholic Podcasting (http://
sqpn.com) — have developed to provide listeners and subscribers with simi-
lar or related content, most podcast listeners create their own programming 
lineup by way of their subscription lists while the podcast hosts themselves 
provide the content based on what they want to do and what their audience 
might enjoy.
The Niche Shall Inherit the Podcast
All the specialty and niche content radio shows that are currently beating 
themselves up and doing everything they can to get that 4 a.m. time slot will 
discover and embrace podcasting sooner or later. We’re not saying they’ll 

349
 Chapter 21: Top Ten Reasons Why Podcasting Will Kill (Or Seriously Dent) Radio
stop airing their programs over the radio, but they will find a bigger and 
more dedicated audience via podcasting. Sure, you can likely still catch the 
show at 4 a.m., but on the very good chance you’re still catching some shut-
eye, you’ll be able to listen to it later, as a podcast.
Producing an independent syndicated radio program is hard work, but pro-
ducing a quality podcast is easy — at least it is with the help of this book. The 
latter has some benefits. The first is freedom: freedom from the FCC, freedom 
from a preset format clock that tells you exactly how long your show can be, 
and even freedom from the real clock and calendar in the time-shifted world.
Podcasters also don’t have to worry about keeping stations happy, nor do 
they have to spend countless hours on the phone trying to convince new 
stations to carry their programming. We know more than one independently 
produced syndicated program that has ceased all attempts at gaining new 
stations simply because their listenership expands greater with podcasting. 
At least one has taken it a step further and canceled its relationship with its 
previous network of stations. And why not, when podcasting allows you to 
dump those burdens and focus on building the best show you can? Sounds 
like a good plan to us.
Welcome to Your Own Reality
Everyone lives in a customized version of reality, even though you may not 
be conscious of it. Every day, you make choices that reinforce that reality. 
You select one particular grocery store as the best even though you could 
likely go to five different stores. You choose a particular model of car to buy 
based on who you want to be as much as any other choice. Your hair styles, 
the clothes you buy . . . it’s human nature.
Whether you do it for status, frugality, or to be good to the environment 
doesn’t matter — just as whether it’s a good or bad choice doesn’t matter. 
Unless you behave in a completely random pattern, you’re reinforcing your 
own reality with the choices you make.
Podcasting gives you one more thing to add to the inventory of you and who 
you project yourself to be. We’re sci-fi fans, and we listen to lots of sci-fi 
podcasts. Sure we like them, but they also help to reaffirm who we consider 
ourselves to be. Evo is into holistic health, thinks of himself as environmen-
tally responsible, and he digs trippy world music with lots of freaky drums 
and weird time signatures. Guess what sorts of shows are in his playlist? 
Tee loves thriller fiction, new gadgets, and true-life stories centered around 
espionage. It is no surprise that his iTunes is waiting for new episodes of The 
International Spy Museum’s SpyCast. And Chuck? He’s an IT guy who needs 
to keep up with the latest trends in tech. He also has a lot of friends over at 
Friends in Tech (http://friendsintech.com), producing podcasts that 
do just that.

350
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Radio can’t do this. Oh sure, you can make the assumption that all NPR lis-
teners are democrats and everyone who tunes in to the local classic rock 
station used to have a mullet. While that may be true in some cases, it’s likely 
not universally true, simply due to the complexity of the human psyche. 
We’re complicated guys, and we haven’t found a station that gets anywhere 
near summing us up. But take a listen to some of the podcasts in our play-
lists, and you’re a few steps closer to understanding where we’re coming 
from.
You Bought This Book, Didn’t You?
We end on the number-one reason podcasting will put a dent in radio: you. 
The three of us are betting you’ve listened to the radio at least once in your 
life. We’ll go out on a limb and say it was even more than that — a lot more. 
Yet here you are, reading a book that teaches you how to podcast. Even if 
you’re just curious, your actions speak volumes.
Hey, don’t get us wrong. We’re not assuming this book has some magical 
power or that you’re so stunned by the stellar quality of the writing that 
you’ll rip the radio out of your car. But you must be looking for something 
that radio is not providing, or by your perception cannot provide, to you.
Maybe it’s one of the reasons outlined in this chapter. Perhaps podcasting 
just sounds really fun, and you’d love to try it out. You sure can’t do that in 
radio. But whatever the reason is, we hope you enjoy the journey of finding 
your own voice in podcasting.
