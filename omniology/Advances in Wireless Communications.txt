PREFACE
In the last few years, Rutgers University's WINLAB has hosted periodic
workshops on third generation wireless information networks. The first
Workshop, held in 1990, was a pioneering effort in trying to define the needs
and technical challenges stimulated by this idea of integrated wireless
networking. Since that first one, the WINLAB Workshops have been a forum
for discussion of the issues arising in this research area, reaching out to diverse
fields and addressing scientific as well as business, regulatory and sociological
factors, which are also very important aspects to the development of the
“wireless age”.
Another characterizing factor of these meetings has been the effort to mix
industry and university, in a continuous effort to define research areas that can
be of long-standing impact as well as of immediate interest for commercial
application. The presence of authors from both companies and universities, and
papers jointly authored by industrial and academic partners, testify to the
success of this viewpoint.
The sixth Workshop was held in New Brunswick, NJ, on March 20-21, 1997.
Although, by now, the number of people talking about third generation networks
has dramatically increased and other conferences have sessions on this topic,
experts from all over the world still recognize the importance of this event as a
fruitful exchange of ideas, both during the presentations and during breaks and
social events, in which state-of-the-art technologies are discussed and new
solutions are sought. The papers presented at the Workshop, which are collected
in this book, cover a broad range of topics. Papers describing state-of-the-art
solutions are collected along with basic theoretical studies in information and
communications theory, to offer what we think is a far-reaching panorama of
this exciting field.
The 25 contributions have been grouped in 6 areas, which form as many
chapters in this book: Characterizing and Serving Mobile Users, ATM and
Broadband, Power and Energy Management, Capacity and Performance,
Propogation and Traffic Modeling, and Locating Mobile Users. It is seen that
the topics cut across all the protocol layers. In fact, as challenging as the more
standard communication theory related problems are, it is the multifaceted and
multilayer system problem of wireless and mobile communications that offer
the most significant opportunities for breakthroughs.

x
The first topic starts with a paper by James Katz and Philip Aspden of Bellcore
analyzing a survey of the demographics, attitudes, and social situation of
wireless communication users. It is a step towards giving an empirical
anchoring to speculations about wireless communications. The next paper by
Wierlemann of DeTeMobil describes results from the On the Move Project. The
objective is to provide personalized mobile-aware multimedia services and
applications available regardless of mobile hardware, user location, and wireless
network characteristics. The next paper by Tanabe of NTT Data Corporation is
concerned with adaptively deciding between on-demand and broadcast modes,
by characterizing data as popular or unpopular.
The next topic, ATM and Broadband, is concerned with going two steps beyond
the ubiquitous voice services of wireless communications. Integrating relatively
low rate data is the first step. Going up to broadband and using ATM are
essential ingredients of further development. A variety of issues need
reexamination for ATM and broadband. services and their requirements need to
be defined with a platform to support them (Leskinen and Niemi of Nokia
Mobile Phones). Other issues are access control (Narasimham, et al. of NEC
USA, Inc., Ebert, et al. of The Technical University of Berlin, Artale and
Winkler of Fondazione Ugo Bordoni), location management (Dommety of Ohio
State University and Veeraraghavan of AT&T Labs), phone number translation
delay (Jain of Bellcore), and handoffs (Campbell, et al. of Columbia). The paper
by Fong et al. of AT&T Labs is on bandwidth allocation in fixed broadband
networks, which are of great international commercial importance.
Over the last five years much work has been done on power control. The
centerpiece of this theory is a beautiful result stating the solution to a
formulation of the problem in terms of an eigenvalue and eigenvector of a
particular matrix. This result, for centralized control, has stimulated much
further work on extending the theory and developing distributed algorithms.
Two further contributions are by Mitra and Morrison of Lucent Technologies
and Rosberg of IBM Israel. Motivations for optimizing power control are to
guarantee the feasibility of accommodating the maximum number of users, and
to save energy and extend battery life. The papers by Röhl, et al., of The
Technical University of Berlin and Zorzi and Rao of UCSD directly address the
energy minimization issues.
The Capacity and Performance Sections address the seemingly unending new
issues arising in wireless communications. CDMA for high speed data are in
Kumar and Nanda of Lucent Technologies. Information theoretic considerations
are in Foschini and Gans of Lucent Technologies. Reconfigurable networks, in
which there are no base stations but rather all nodes are the same, are studied in
Haas of Cornell University. The interaction of source and channel coding, and
coding and multiple access with a multicode, variable bit rate embedded source
coding is studied in Babich and Vatta of the University of Trieste - Italy.
Trading off of C/I performance of users according to their service class and

location is considered in Khan and Zeghlache of the Institut National des
Télécommunications - France.
Capacity and performance may significantly depend on the models used for
propagation artifacts and traffic characteristics. It is therefore very important to
be able to develop more realistic models that make performance studies
meaningful for real-life scenarios. The issue of estimating the radio coverage in
a cellular systems is addressed by Bernardin et al. of Nortel. An accurate model
for the shadow fading taking into account spatial dependence of signal
attenuation is proposed in Kumaran and Borst of Bell Laboratories.
Characterization of new traffic sources, based on data communications patterns
of Internet sessions based on the TCP/IP protocol is described in Anderlin and
Zander of the Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden.
Tracking and paging users are the subject of the Locating Mobile User Section.
Optimal paging using search theory is in Verkama of Nokia. Location tracking
usually refers to location within a cell or location area. More precise position
location (needed, e.g., for 911) when line-of-sight paths may be blocked is
discussed in Wylie and Holtzman of WINLAB.
The contributions here collected have stimulated good discussion among the
Workshop participants, both during the technical sessions and informally during
the breaks. We believe it is worth offering this material to a wider audience,
who can find in this book some stimulating ideas and presentation of state-of-
the-art technologies relevant to wireless communications. We hope that with
this effort we can give a small yet significant contribution to the understanding
of this exciting and fast-growing field, and that the material here collected will
be useful to students and researchers in their own search for new and better
solutions towards the realization of the wireless information age.

MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS:
THEORIES, DATA,
AND POTENTIAL IMPACTS
A LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS OF
U.S. NATIONAL SURVEYS

ABSTRACT
This paper examines the extent to which ownership of mobile communications is
related to demographic variables and/or functionality needs. The study draws on data
from seven national mail or telephone random surveys carried out during the period
1993-5 and totaling over 10,000 respondents. We found that the key determinants of
mobile communications ownership were household income, race/ethnic background,
need to be in touch and social/work mobility. Further, we found that those owning a
cell phone plus a pager, those owning only a pager, and those owning only a cell
phone had quite different demographic characteristics. While no longer a “rich man’s
toy”, ownership of the cellular telephone is, nevertheless, still associated with the
more affluent. Two important variables, gender and feelings of overload, did not
appear to have any explanatory power. We speculate that ownership of mobile
communications is determined more strongly by location effects, for example, need to
be in touch or being highly mobile, than by gender. Regarding feelings of overload,
we found no evidence that ownership of mobile communications generates feelings of
overload, controlling for other variables.
INTRODUCTION
By 1999, it is expected that there will be more than 120 million cellular phone
customers worldwide. (Common Carrier Week 1994). In mid-1996, there were
already more than thirty-eight million subscribers in the US alone, or about 14.5% of
the entire U.S. population. (Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, 1996)
(This contrasts with about 1% in the mid-1980s. Mayer, 1994.) A cheaper but more
limited personal wireless system – the pager – had in 1996 about 8 percent penetration

2
overall but among older teens it was 17% (USA Today, August 27, 1996: D-1). Yet
this adoption rate is small compared to Singapore, where one out of three adults uses a
pager. (There are about 90 million pagers in the Asia-Pacific region.) (Associated
Press 9-6-96). Paging technology is becoming two-way, and predictions are for a five-
fold increase in world-wide subscribership by the year 2000. (Szaniawski, 1995)
What has been the impact wrought by this technology in people’s personal and
business lives? The mass media have presented sundry items ranging from a car-
jacked man being rescued from his car trunk to British royalty being eavesdropped.
But compared to media attention, the intellectual community has hardly probed the
uses and implications of mobile communication.
It appears to us that, from a social analytical viewpoint, wireless personal
communication has been overshadowed first by the proliferation of personal
computers then by the Internet. Like its intensively scrutinized, socially
transformative cousin, the personal computer, wireless personal communication has
experienced a revolution since 1983. And like its socially transformative forebear –
the telephone – personal mobile wireless technology has been largely ignored by
scholars who claim to study communication modalities and social processes.
Our purpose is to examine wireless personal communication in terms of the
demographics, attitudes and social situation of its users. We do this with an eye
towards giving an empirical anchoring to speculations about this technology’s impact.
The consequences and power of this technology have contemporary ramifications for
how individuals and groups communicate to pursue their needs. And, in light of the
emerging wireless potential of the Internet, these technologies and their extensions are
likely to have important consequences in a variety of areas from personal happiness to
social equity, and from economic success to personal safety. (On a technical note, we
use pager and beeper interchangeably, and exclude for our purposes dispatch radio.
We are also aware of the interaction between technology and social change, i.e., that
the causal arrow is not one way. But the bi-directional relationship, or mutual
structuration of technology and society, will be dealt with in a separate article.)
RESEARCH PERSPECTIVE
As discussed above, there are numerous questions about mobile communications
technology, regarding both how they affect society and human behavior as well as
what use reveals about social theory and policy. While by no means definitive, it
would for example be helpful to have data on how ownership patterns change over
time, particularly in terms of user’s educational attainment, gender, income, and age.
It would also be helpful to know how this technology affects people’s lives and
relationships. Does it improve them, or make them more difficult? Are there gender
differences in this regard?
Given concern about the commercial uses of mobile communications, there is much
riding on whether they are actually a useful tool for economic success. Assuming for
the moment that they are, questions of equitable distribution by social class or race
assume a great deal of importance. This would especially be the case if their
possession (or lack thereof) exacerbates equity problems, such as access to jobs or

3
information necessary to an informed citizenry. (This is related to the so-called
digital divide.)
There is also the interpersonal dimension. Here it remains an open question as to
whether ownership helps bind families, allowing “parallel mothering” (a term used in
Rakow & Navarro, 1993), or drives them further apart by yielding less “quality time”
or “face time.”
Another important question is whether wireless communication technologies are
fundamentally liberating or enslaving. While the answer is likely to be some
combination of both phenomena, it would be helpful to have data which could actually
illuminate the question. For instance, while by no means alone, Giddens (1990; 1991;
Bryant & Jary, 1991) has spoken of the subtle controls over individual movements that
technology might give, and Gary Marx (1985a; 1985b), Gandy (1994), and Katz
(1988; 1990) have spoken of the ways in which these technologies can be abused to
remove anonymity and freedom,
In light of our work and that of other scholars, we have reviewed some of the
numerous research questions that are pending concerning wireless communication’s
social impact. In an attempt to address them, we have conducted national opinion
surveys over a three-year span. The analysis that follows probes these relationships,
and presents data that suggest preliminary answers to some of the above questions.
METHOD
Our main source of data is a 2,500 person telephone survey (identified as Survey 95).
These data were taken from an October 1995 national random telephone sample,
surveyed by a commercial firm under contract from Bellcore. The survey sample has a
close match on socio-economic variables compared with the U.S. population as a
whole. Based on comparisons with 1990/91 U.S. Census data, respondents in our
sample are similar to the national average in ethnic mix, age composition and
household income, but slightly more female and better educated.
Where appropriate we have also sought to bring out longitudinal trends by drawing on
the results of several recent surveys we have carried out:
• 
a mail survey in early 1993 (identified as Survey early 93). A total of 1,870
questionnaires were completed and returned, resulting in a response rate of 35%.
• 
two mail surveys carried out simultaneously in late 1993 (Survey late 93.a and
Survey late 93.b). A total of 1038 questionnaires were completed and returned
for Survey a (response rate equals 24%) and 912 questionnaires were completed
and returned for Survey b (response rate equals 21%).
• 
three mail surveys carried out simultaneously in 1994 (Survey 94.a, Survey 94.b
and Survey 94.c). The response rates for these surveys were 36% for Survey a
(1,380 completed questionnaires), 34% for Survey b (1,345 completed
questionnaires), and 36% for Survey c (1,228 completed questionnaires).
Even careful surveys of users can be biased if they exclude those who at one time
adopted wireless communication, but then discarded it because of unsatisfactory

4
results. Further, early adopters must be distinguished from later adopters, and results
cannot be reliably extrapolated to non-adopters since their needs and effects might be
quite different from those of adopters. Finally, the data are from public opinion
surveys and have all the limitations that affect studies based on this technique.
Perhaps most problematical in this regard are the possibilities that our indicator
variables were not valid in the first place, or they were not reliably answered by
respondents. These caveats apply to all our comments about findings, but shall not be
repeated at each juncture their specter is raised.
RESULTS
Cell-Only And Pager+Cell Phone Usage Growing Faster Than Pager-Only Usage
Our approach has been to divide the sample population into four groups - those who
report owning or using:
1.
Neither a pager nor a cellular telephone (the “neither” group).
2.
A pager only (the “pager-only” group).
3.
A cellular phone only (“the cell-only” group).
4.
Both a pager and a cellular phone (the “both” group).
In our 1995 survey, 63 percent of respondents reported not owning a pager or a
cellular phone, 10 percent reported owning only a pager, and 16 percent reported
owning a cellular phone, while 11 percent reported owning both a pager and a cellular
phone (see Table 1). On the basis of historical data it would appear that over the past
few years when there has been significant growth in both cellular and pager usage,
pager-only growth has been slow if not static and certainly much slower than growth
in cellular-only usage and combined cellular and pager usage. Across our seven
surveys spanning more than two years, 6 to 10 percent of respondents report being
pager-only owners, while cell-only owners grew from 9 percent to 16 percent of
respondents, and owners of both grew even more rapidly, from 4 percent to 11 percent
of respondents.

The ownership rates in the 1995 survey for cell phones and pagers are higher than the
national subscriber rates quoted earlier. This difference can probably be ascribed to
the fact that individual pagers and cell phones can have multiple owners, for example,
one cell phone could be used by more than one member of a household. In addition,
an unknown proportion of owners are non-subscribers because they no longer use their
cell phones or pagers. Further, despite our best efforts we have a somewhat biased
sample regarding mobile communications ownership rates, and to the fact that. The
effect of this bias is reduced by seeking to explain ownership rates in terms of intra-
sample demographic and attitudinal variables. We elected not to weight our sample
due to its relatively small bias and the problems inherent in weighting (Katz, Aspden,
& Reich, 1997). However, we recognize we must be circumspect about longitudinal
(inter-sample) comparisons.
Cell-Only Usage - No Gender Difference; Pager Users More Likely To Be Male
In the 1995 survey 17 percent of male respondents and 16 percent of female
respondents reported being cell phone-only users (see Table 2). Our earlier surveys
suggest a growing convergence of male and female ownership rates for cell phones
only.
The gender ownership pattern of cell phones only contrasts with ownership of pagers
only and both cell phones and pagers, where proportionally more men than women
reported owning them. In the 1995 survey 13 percent of male respondents and 8
percent of female respondents reported owning only a pager. Most of the earlier
surveys also indicated that proportionally more men than women owned only pagers.
Similarly in the 1995 survey for the cell phone plus pager group, 13 percent of males
and 9 percent of females reported owning both a pager and a cell phone. Again, the
earlier surveys indicate that proportionally more men than women owned both pagers
and cell phones.

Our surveys show that the gender mix of mobile communications users has changed
from 1989 when Rakow and Navarro (1993) reported that “more than 90 percent of
subscribers were men.” Indeed our surveys suggest that the gender gap for cell phone-
only usage is on the verge of disappearing.
Declining Age Of Cell Phone Users; Pagers Mainly Owned By Young People
In the 1995 survey respondents who reported only owning a pager were predominantly
under fifty years old (see Table 3); moreover, ownership rates were approximately the
same for all the five-year age categories below 50. Over 50 years old ownership rates
declined significantly down to 1 percent for the over 65 category. Earlier surveys had
similar patterns.

For those in the 1995 survey who reported owning only a cell phone (see Table 4), the
age distribution of ownership was somewhat different from the 1995 pager-only age
distribution. Ownership of cell phones was spread fairly evenly over the age range 18
to 64 with ownership rates varying from 15 to 22 percent per five year age category.
This appears to be a change from the results of our earlier surveys where reported
ownership rates tended to be highest in the age range 35-55.

For the group reporting owning both a pager and a cell phone, the 1995 survey
suggests a gradual decline in ownership rates from a 16 percent ownership rate for the
youngest age category (18-24) to a 9 percent for the 55-59 category (see Table 5). For
the categories 60 years old and more, the ownership rates are about 3 percent. The
earlier surveys show a slightly different pattern; the 1994 and 1993 surveys indicate
peak ownership rates over the age range 35-49.

The results of our surveys provide further proof that cell phones are no longer the
preserve of “power elites”. Our earlier surveys do indicate highest ownership rates
across the age range 35-50; the most recent survey shows that the highest ownership
rates are spread over the age range 18-64, a much broader age range.
For the pager-only group, our surveys show that over the period 1993-95 ownership
has continued to be by predominantly younger people, that is people aged less than 45
or 50. There is some suggestion in the results of the 1995 survey that the highest
ownership rates are at the younger end of the 18-45 age range.
The Affluent/Better Educated Respondents More Likely To Own Cell Phones
For the cell phone-only group in the 1995 survey, ownership rates increase as
household income increases, from 6 percent for the under $15,000 category to 38
percent for the $100,000 or more category (see Table 6). Similarly for the group
which owns both a pager and a cell phone, ownership rates increase as household
income increases, from 4 percent for the under $15,000 category to 26 percent for the
$100,000 or more category. The earlier surveys showed a similar pattern of
increasing ownership rates as reported household income increases.
For the pager-only group, however, the results for the 1995 survey are somewhat
different. Here we see ownership rates independent of household income at around 12
percent of respondents. This is a change from earlier surveys which show a slight
increase in ownership rates as reported household income increases.

We also examined how ownership rates varied with the respondent’s highest achieved
education level. In the 1995 survey (see Table 7), ownership rates for the cell phone-
only group increase with higher educational levels, from 10 percent for the group who
left school without gaining a high school diploma (or GED) to 28 percent for the
group who gained a Ph D. The earlier surveys showed a similar pattern.
In the 1995 survey, for the pager-only and the pager plus cell phone groups the
relationship between ownership rates and highest education level achieved was less
clear and it could be hypothesized that these data indicate no relationship between
ownership and highest achieved educational levels. The earlier surveys do suggest a
weak trend for both groups toward higher ownership rates for those reporting higher
educational levels.

Our survey results suggest that the pager on its own has become a “classless” tool,
since ownership rates appear to be independent of income and highest educational
level achieved. On the other hand, higher ownership rates of cell phone, either alone
or in conjunction with ownership of pagers continue to be associated with higher
income and educational levels. It is possible there are independent “income” and
“educational” effects, but since income and highest achieved educational levels are
highly correlated, it is also possible we are seeing a purely income effect or a purely
education effect. Later analysis will probe these issues.

Differences in ownership rates across ethnic groups
Analyzing ownership rates by reported ethnic group shows significant differences
between ethnic groups. Blacks, Hispanics and Asians (with ownership rates in the
range 44-47 percent) are more likely than whites (ownership rate 36 percent) to own
mobile communications (see Table 8).
For the pager-only usage, blacks (ownership rate 19 percent), and Hispanics
(ownership rate 17 percent) have much higher ownership rates than whites
(ownership rate 9 percent) and Asians (ownership rate 5 percent) have. Asian and
whites (ownership rates 23 percent and 17 percent, respectively) are more likely to
own only cell phones than Hispanics and blacks (ownership rates 12 percent and 11
percent, respectively). Finally, Asians, blacks and Hispanics (ownership rates 19
percent, 17 percent and 16 percent, respectively) are more likely to own cell phones
pagers than whites (ownership rate 9 percent).

Those Mobile At Work/Socially More Likely To Own Mobile Communications
In the 1995 survey we asked some questions about the extent of mobility at work and
socially, since a priori highly mobile people should have a disposition to own mobile
communications. Respondents were asked the extent they agreed to the statement,
“Your job requires you to be frequently away from your place of work.” Non-owners
of mobile telecommunications systems were less likely to agree to this statement than
owners (see Table 9). For the group owning neither a pager nor a cell phone, only 5
percent strongly agreed and 10 percent agreed to the statement, whereas for the pager-
only group, 13 percent strongly agreed and 21 percent agreed, for the cell phone-only
group, 10 percent strongly agreed and 18 percent agreed, and for the group owning
both a pager and a cell phone, 14 percent strongly agreed and 24 percent agreed.

Respondents were also asked in the 1995 survey the extent they agreed to the
statement “In your social life you are frequently away from home.” Again, non-
owners of mobile telecommunications systems were less likely to agree to this
statement than owners (see Table 10). For the group owning neither a pager nor a cell
phone, 8 percent strongly agreed and 27 percent agreed to the statement, whereas for
the pager-only group, 12 percent strongly agreed and 38 percent agreed, for the cell
phone-only group, 12 percent strongly agreed and 34 percent agreed, and for the
group owning both a pager and a cell phone, 14 percent strongly agreed and 36
percent agreed.

We also used the number of children as a proxy measure for daily mobility and
examined whether the number of children in the household related to reported
ownership of mobile telecommunications. In particular, given Rakow and Navarro’s
work, we might have thought that the need to do parallel social and work activities
would result in those individuals whose households contained children would have a
greater need for communications, with the result they would be heavier wireless
communication users. For the 1995 survey the results suggest there may be a weak

11
relationship between number of children and ownership of mobile communications.
Households with no children were less likely to own mobile communications system
than those with children. For households with no children, 33 percent reported
owning either a pager or a cell phone or both. For households with one child, the
ownership proportion was 42 percent, with two children, 44 percent, and for those
with three or more children, 39 percent.
The results of our surveys regarding mobility support the idea proposed by Davis
(1993) that the use of mobile communications provides “a sense of personal control
over space and time.” In regard to control over space, it would appear that those with
greater mobility at work or in their social life are more likely to own mobile
communications.
Those Needing To Be In Touch More Likely To Own Mobile Communications
In the 1995 survey we asked respondents the extent they agreed to the statement,
“There are often times when you urgently need to get though to another person.” Non-
owners of mobile telecommunications systems were less likely to agree to this
statement than owners (see Table 11). For the group owning neither a pager nor a cell
phone, 10 percent strongly agreed and 36 percent agreed to the statement, whereas for
the pager-only group, 13 percent strongly agreed and 47 percent agreed, for the cell
phone-only group, 9 percent strongly agreed and 43 percent agreed, and for the group
owning both a pager and a cell phone, 20 percent strongly agreed and 45 percent
agreed.

In the only other survey where we asked this question, there was a very similar result.
In the late 1993.b survey, for the group owning neither a pager nor a cell phone, 8
percent strongly agreed and 36 percent agreed to the statement, whereas for the pager-
only group, 13 percent strongly agreed and 47 percent agreed, for the cell phone-only
group, 13 percent strongly agreed and 38 percent agreed, and for the group owning
both a pager and a cell phone, 8 percent strongly agreed and 53 percent agreed

12
Again in the context of controlling time, our results support the idea proposed by
Davis (1993) that the use of mobile communications provides “a sense of personal
control over space and time.” Our surveys indicate that those with a greater need to
keep in touch are more likely to own mobile communications.
Stressed Respondents Are More Likely To Own A Pager
We mentioned earlier the ongoing debate about whether mobile communications add
to or ease the stress of modern living. To see if we could throw light on this debate we
asked, in the 1995 survey, the extent respondents agreed to the statement, “You feel
that you have more to do than you can comfortably handle.” Those owning a pager
reported more agreement (see Table 12) with this statement - in the pager-only group
17 percent agreed very strongly and 37 percent agreed strongly, and in the pager plus
cell phone group 22 percent agreed very strongly and 26 percent agreed strongly. For
the group without mobile communications and the cell phone-only group, the reported
response rates were very similar - 17 percent agreed very strongly and 26-28 percent
agreed strongly.

In three earlier surveys we also asked this question about the extent respondents have
more than they can handle. Taking the four surveys together, the pager-only group
reported most agreement with the statement. In each of the surveys, fifty percent or
more respondents either agreed or strongly agreed with the statement.
Earlier we reported that the pager-only group was predominantly under fifty years old.
Generally, we have found that younger people are more likely to report that they have
more than they can handle, so we investigated whether the fact that the pager-only
group was the most likely group to report having too much to handle was just an age
effect. For the 1995 survey this proved not to be the case (see Table 13). We divided
the sample set into those up to 44 years old and those 45 and over. Anxiety levels for
the pager-only group did not decrease with age. For the younger half, 17 percent
strongly agreed and 35 percent agreed with the statement, while for the older half, 19

13
percent strongly agreed and 43 percent agreed with the statement. For the other
ownership groups anxiety levels decreased with age.

Similarly for the early 1993 survey, anxiety levels for the pager-only group did not
decrease with age, while anxiety levels for the other three ownership groups did
decline with age. For the younger half of the pager-only group, 15 percent strongly
agreed and 38 percent agreed with the statement, while for the older half, 11 percent
strongly agreed and 43 percent agreed with the statement. As in the 1995 survey, the
anxiety levels decreased with age for the other ownership groups.
Although our surveys did not explore changes in feelings of overload before and after
owning mobile communications, our surveys do indicate that the pager-only group is
particularly likely to express feelings of overload. Whether this is a group inherently
subject to stress or the ownership of pagers generates stress, we are not able to deduce.
Those Owning Mobile Communications More Likely To Own PCs
In the 1995 survey, those owning a cell phone were more likely to own a PC than
those without a pager and a cell phone and those owning only a pager (see Table 14).
Sixty-one percent of those only owning a cell phone and 59 percent of those owning
both a pager and a cell phone also owned a PC. The percentage of PC ownership in
the other two groups was much less - 40 percent for the group without mobile
communications and 43 percent for the pager-only group.
In our earlier surveys we observed a somewhat similar pattern with the group without
a pager and a cell phone having the lowest PC-ownership rates, about 30 percent. PC-
ownership rates for the pager-only group were significantly higher than the neither
group and were generally in the range 40-55 percent. In the 1993 and 1994 surveys,
PC-ownership rates for the cell phone-only and both groups were significantly higher
than the pager-only group. Ownership rates for the cell phone-only group were
generally in the range 55-65 percent and for the both group in the range 60-80

14
percent. In some cases the ownership rates for the both group were significantly
higher than for the cell phone-only group.

There are various plausible explanations for the relationship between mobile
communications ownership and PC ownership. (A similar relationship exists with the
ownership of answering machines, see Katz, Aspden & Reich, 1997). Those owning
mobile communications have lifestyles requiring the use of electronic tools such as
PCs and answering machines. Alternatively, there are people with a pre-disposition to
want to own new technological devices such as mobile phones, PCs and answering
machines.
MODELING PAGER AND CELL PHONE OWNERSHIP
To some degree, reported ownership of mobile telecommunications equipment
correlates with all the above demographic, mobility and attitudinal variables. To
determine which variables were relatively more important and to examine their
independent contribution to mobile communications ownership, we created three logit
models using the 1995 survey data.
We chose to use logit models (SAS, Software
Release 6.07.02) since our data is predominantly categorical, and the dependent
variable was dichotomous.
The logit models had the following dependent variables:
1.
Pager ownership in the combined group without pager and cell phone and the
pager-only group.
2.
Cell phone ownership in the combined group without pager and cell phone and
cell phone-only group.
3.
Pager and cell phone ownership in the combined group without pager and cell
phone and group owning both a pager and a cell phone.
The independent variables for these models are defined in Table 15.
The significance levels of the parameter estimates for the three models are given in
Table 16.

Interpretation of the statistical results
By considering those variables with the highest significance levels in the three models
we have developed the following model of mobile communications ownership, the
variables are listed in approximately decreasing order of importance:
1 .
2 .
3 .
4 .
5 .
Ability to pay – household income is the most highly significant variable in our
three models, particularly for ownership of cell phones either on their own or in
combination with a pager. This could suggest that for many people ownership of
a pager/cell phone is still perceived as a luxury item.
Racial/ethnic background – our results show that ethnic background (white as
compared to blacks/Hispanics - we left Asians and “Others” out of this analysis).
This possibly reflects family structure, cultural patterns, or symbolic aspects of
services. (These questions will be explored later in the article.)
The need to be in touch – this is a statistically important variable for ownership of
cell phones particularly in combination with a pager.
Work mobility – this is statistically important variable for pager and cell phone
ownership, but not important for the other two models.
Social mobility – this is statistically important in the pager-only and cell phone-
only models. Social mobility appears to be at least as important as mobility-at-
work in predicting ownership of mobile communications. The number of
children in the household, a variable which we thought might be a proxy for daily
mobility or need to be in touch, did not appear to be statistically important in
predicting mobile communications ownership for the 1995 survey.
Again, based on the size of the significance levels of the parameter estimates, there
are three variables (educational level, age and PC ownership) with weaker explanatory
powers than the above five variables:
1.
Educational level – this appears to be only statistically important for the pager-
only model. Earlier, we speculated on the separate existence of “income” and
“educational effects”. The results of our analysis suggest there are two separate
effects, but that the “income” effect has more explanatory power than the
“education” effect, overlapping and exhausting education’s independent
contribution.
2. 
Age – again, this appears to be only statistically important for the pager-only
model, with younger respondents more likely to own pagers, perhaps suggesting
that there could be a “fashion” element in owning pagers.
3.
PC ownership – only statistically important for the explaining ownership of both
pager and a cell phone. We speculate that someone who likes to own new
technologies might be more likely to own both a pager and a cell phone.

17
Alternatively, those owning mobile communications have lifestyles requiring the
use of electronic tools such as PCs and answering machines.
Two important variables, gender and feelings of overload, do not appear to have any
statistical explanatory power when the other variables are kept constant. These are
potentially important observations. Mobile communications have been held by many
to be a male power tool, yet our models do not suggest any statistical gender effect.
Our earlier analyses showed that ownership of mobile communications was related to
gender. We speculate that ownership of mobile communications is determined more
strongly by location effects, for example, having a highly mobile job or needing to
keep in touch, than by gender.
Feelings of overload do not appear to have any statistical explanatory power when the
other variables are kept constant. We speculate that the people who feel overloaded
do not perceive that pagers and cell phones can help them reduce overload anxieties.
By contrast our model supports the view that those who are highly mobile or need to
keep in touch perceive pagers and cell phones as useful to them.
CONCLUSION
Our data suggest many interesting relationships upon which theoretical interpretations
could be built. Space limitations preclude a full elaboration of these possibilities but,
guided by our discussions at the outset of the paper, we can highlight a few intriguing
possibilities.
Our investigation reveals, that while no longer “a rich man’s toy” cellular telephone
ownership is associated with income. And in contrast to some of the more pessimistic
speculations about cell phone ownership, including our own (Aspden & Katz, 1994),
there is as yet little evidence to suggest that cell phone ownership has a pernicious
impact on the quality of life. However, as we indicated earlier, we cannot be sure of
the antecedent situation in a cross-sectional study, so any claims about impact must be
extremely circumscribed.
In general ownership seems guided by what we might call “social location” variables,
that is a combination of socio-economic, demographic, and life style conditions which
influence decisions perhaps more powerfully than individual personality
characteristics. People may not personally wish to have wireless communication, but
due to conditions of their life – such as job exigencies, work and personal mobility –
they find they need to have wireless communication. Thus while we found no
relationship between certain personality measures, such as extroversion or phone
liking, perceived “needs” can be an important predictor of service utilization, in this
case a perceived need “to keep in touch.” This finding is somewhat at odds with an
initial analysis of some of the early data reported here, which purported not to find a
relationship between needs and telecommunications technology use. (Steinfield,
Dudley, Kraut & Katz, 1992) Certainly the relationship between needs and
gratifications is one that has been explored at length in the mass media literature; that
they should be connected in the telecommunications area as well should not come as a
surprise. Yet we anticipate that “social location” will eventually become recognized
as equal in importance, if not paramount to, the “needs”-based model.

18
Interestingly, racial/ethnic self-identification is an important variable. The
importance of this variable was somewhat surprising to us. While there are several
possible explanations, for example cultural patterns and geographic location of
respondents, the importance of this variable also fits with notions we have working
with, which may be characterized as “affordable luxury.” This concept means that
certain (apparently) high status items are available for purchase at relatively low cost.
This means that groups or individuals who might not have a high status, as defined by
the dominant society, might seek to enhance their status in various ways. Certainly
the more affordable a luxury is, the easier it would be for people to buy it.
Explanations along this path might help us to understand not only wireless
communication ownership, but a host of other behaviors as well. Currently we are
exploring this area, and hope to report on it soon. (See Katz, Aspden & Fussell,
1997)
In terms of policy issues, such as information rich-information poor, or the so-called
digital divide, some of our findings are troubling. Specifically the income dimension
of wireless communication ownership suggests that there is a possibility that those
who cannot afford may be shut out of many of society’s benefits, with severe personal
and political ramifications. (Aufderheide, 1987; Sawhney, 1994).
Summing up, we have seen some surprising data shedding light on wireless
communication relative to income, age, education, ethnicity/race, household ties,
social activity and job activity mobility and attitudes. These data reflect on important
theories of equity, innovation, gender relations, and quality of life issues. While we
have only scratched the surface, we believe we have shown that this much-neglected
area of wireless communication can have both substantive and theoretical import.

Introduction
Abstract
The ACTS [1] OnTheMove¹ project [2] is investigating mobile multimedia
services for the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) [3]. A
Mobile Application Support Environment (MASE) is being designed and
implemented to answer the challenges of providing personalised mobile-aware
multimedia services.
The MASE system will provide personalised access to multimedia applications.
These applications will be available to users irrespective of the mobile hardware,
user location, and wireless network characteristics.
A Mobile Application Programming Interface (Mobile-API) is being developed
which will provide a standardised means of accessing the facilities of the MASE.
The functionality of the system will be demonstrated to users and service
providers through the implementation of a multimedia business information system
which forms the basis of a series of field trials.
The project began in September 1995 and lasts for three years. This paper
introduces the background and rationale behind the OnTheMove project. An
overview of MASE functionality is given and the need for a distributed MASE is
explained. Experimental results from the first field trial with the business
application “Infomotion” are presented. Finally, the potential impact of the project
is assessed.
Mobile Office the buzz-word of todays portable computing is a rapidly growing
market sector. Recently the swedish company PC Card Distribution Scandinavian
AB has launched a PC card with a entire GSM phone on it including a modem for
sending and receiving of data and fax. Other mobility supporting devices like GPS
receivers, which are the key for location awareness, are estimated to have a market
potential of $10 milliard by 2000 following a market research done by “Forward
Concepts”. The value of the remote computing hardware market in 1995 was
estimated at $4.7 billion and is predicted to increase to $12.3 billion by 1997 [4]. It
is estimated that 48 million employees spend more than 20% of their working day
away from their desks [5, 6]. Portable computers are becoming increasingly
powerful, and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) now provide pocket-sized
computing [7].
On fixed networks the widespread use and popularity of the Word Wide Web
(WWW) has dramatically increased the volume, richness, and availability of
information. With its explosive growth and innovations, the Internet is changing the
nature of communications through the rapid adoption of Internet standards and
providing universal connectivity. The estimated total 300-500 million world-wide
Internet users by the year 2001, coupled with the continued growth in wireless
network penetration rates, will create the potential for a mass market for mobile

23
communications. It has been suggested that there may be 40 million mobile
connections in the European Union by the year 2020 [8].
Second generation GSM cellular mobile radio systems will evolve to third
generation wireless networks, such as the Universal Mobile Telecommunications
Service (UMTS). UMTS will offer greater access flexibility and bandwidth and
provide a communications platform for a wide range of mobile multimedia services
and applications for mobile devices. The IP-based traffic of the Internet and its
diverse content will have a major influence on these next generation mobile
communication networks. Much of this content makes use of video and audio in
addition to text and graphics.
Today’s wide area wireless networks cannot deliver the bandwidth necessary to
adequately support full multimedia applications and the mobile environment
imposes a number of challenges which impair the robustness of client/server
operation: adaptation to varying quality of service, robustness in the face of
disconnected links, roaming between different operators and network types,
movement between different geographical locations, reconfigurable real-time multi-
party connections, and personalised information filtering. Mobile terminals have
varying capabilities, ranging from a GSM phone or personal communicator, PDAs
with small screens to fully multimedia capable laptops. To maximise the benefit of
mobile multimedia solutions, an architecture is necessary which can answer the
challenges of mobility, and provide the user with robust, personalised applications
irrespective of the terminal or wireless network available.
The OnTheMove project is developing mobile middleware - a Mobile
Application Support Environment (MASE) and a Mobile-API which will enable a
new generation of “mobile-aware” applications and also provide additional
functionality to “legacy” applications. The prototypes are based on commercially
available products and near term research results. OnTheMove’s architecture will
help to facilitate and promote the development of a wide spectrum of mobile
multimedia applications.
Mobile Middleware
The MASE middleware [9] will hide the complexity of underlying networks and
provide a complete support environment for mobile applications. A diverse range of
mobile networks will appear as a seamless, homogeneous communications medium.
Differences in these networks appear to applications - and therefore the user - as
changes in Quality of Service (QoS). User profiles allow the user to influence the
behaviour of the MASE by specifying their communication preferences which
include cost, quality, time, and security. Terminal profiles provide a means of
determining the characteristics of the mobile device which has an important impact
on the way that information is presented to the application. For example, video
content should not be sent to a terminal device which cannot support video, even if
there is sufficient network bandwidth available. MASE functionality includes:
network adaptation, disconnected operation, multimedia conversion, Quality of

24
Service adaptation, location awareness, and user profile management. The MASE
and its relation to wireless networks and applications is illustrated in Figure 1.
Figure 1 Mobile Application Support Environment
Mobile-API
Mobile-API specifications allow “mobile-aware” multimedia applications to
communicate QoS requirements to the computing and communication subsystem
below them and receive information about currently available services. The API
will be a superset of a recognised API, or a number of APIs, in order to provide
backwards compatibility for legacy applications. The Mobile-API will be a key
factor in enabling the exploitation of MASE functionality and will be input to
standards bodies.
The Distributed MASE
It is intended that the MASE will support the widest possible range of mobile
terminals, from cellular phones, to PDAs, to fully functional multimedia laptops. As
a result of this diversity of equipment, in many cases it will not be possible for the
MASE to get all the necessary information and resources from the mobile terminal
itself. For this reason, a distributed approach will be taken using mobility gateways.
These systems are attached to the wired network and are aware of the current status
of mobile terminals and the underlying communications networks. Based on user
and application profiles, the MASE is then able to gather information and resources
from the mobile terminal and the mobility gateway in order to fulfill the needs of
the application.

25
Figure 2 The distributed MASE
Examples of functionality to be provided by the mobility gateway include:
multimedia conversion - adapting the information representation to match both the
capabilities of the mobile terminal and the QoS offered by the communications
network in use; disconnected operation - ensuring that when an unplanned
disconnection occurs, the application can continue to operate without loss of data or
unnecessary retransmission of data; transaction management - setting up distributed
transactions on behalf of the mobile terminal. Some caching mechanisms may also
be implemented in the mobility gateway to improve performance. Figure 2
illustrates the distribution of the MASE on mobile terminals and mobility gateways.
Experiments and Field Trials
The development process of the MASE is accompanied by a series of field trials
[10]. The objective of these field trials is to collect feedback and user reaction at
any stage of the development process and to address the user requirements by key
features of the application and supporting layer software. The first of these field
trials, “Experiment 0", has been already conducted in 1996 distributed over three
European cities in Sweden (Stockholm) and Germany (Munster, Munich). Two
further field trials are planned in at least 5 European cities and one test-site in
Singapore during 1997 and 1998.
Experiment 0
The actual execution of Experiment 0 was divided into two parts complementing
each other: a user part (application trial) focusing on user reaction and feedback
about the acceptance of a mobile multimedia business system called Infomotion and
a network part (technical trial) evaluating the performance of the underlying
communications infrastructure with respect to roaming, routing, throughput,
response time and jitter.

26
Figure 3 Multimedia Business Information System “Infomotion”
Experiment 0 - User Part
The user part of Experiment 0 has been conducted on the basis of commercially
available infrastructure and equipment. The business application lnfomotion offered
in experiment 0 was based on existing WWW technologies and provided user
feedback on a reduced set of mobile environment functions such as location
awareness and bandwidth management. The services of Infomotion consisted of a
portfolio based on Swedish stock exchange data, news services with data filtering
capabilities, a location aware travel service and personalised WWW-magazines.
The services layout is sketched in Figure 3.
Early MASE functionality could be demonstrated to the end-users by emulation
(MASE Emulator, Dashboard, User Profile Manager). The experimental testbed
(see Fig. 4) comprised two WWW information servers to run the services of the
Infomotion system. Both content servers were connected to the Internet via proxies
which allowed anonymous logging. The log files were part of the material used for
the evaluation of results. The networks have been carefully selected to encompass
important UMTS bearer services and mobility pattern. GSM thus represented a
circuit-switched bearer supporting full mobility, MODACOM¹ was a representative
for a packet-switched bearer supporting full mobility and the local Wave-LAN²
¹ MODACOM is a packet-oriented cellular radio network based on the DataTAC technology defined
by Motorola. The gross transmission speed amounts to 9600 bit/s per cell. Over the air interface,
DataTAC uses the Radio Data Link Access Protocol (RD-LAP) with the Slotted Digital Sense Multiple
Access (S-DSMA) protocol for media access.
² WaveLAN is a product from Lucent technologies (formerly NCR, formerly AT&T) which operates
over the 2.4 GHz band. The radio unit consists of a PC-Card and an antenna. The power is obtained
from the computer. Connection to the fixed network is realised through a bridge. WaveLAN has an
operating capacity of 2 - 4 Mbps, depending on the number of users and the radio environment.

27
served as representative for an office environment allowing for high bit rate data
communication.
Figure 4 Experiment 0 Infrastructure (User Part)
The multimedia information servers were globally accessible from any wireline
network and all radio network specific implementation details were securely hidden
in the IBM ARTour Gateway³ . Additionally, the GSM access to the Internet was
realised by PPP dial-up connections via analogue modems. Experiment 0 involved
48 long-term users equipped with laptops, GSM handhelds, MODACOM terminals
(only in Germany) and access to wireless LAN (only in Sweden).
Open questionnaires were performed with each test-user after a two weeks test
period to receive direct and subjective answers on how to improve the services of
Infomotion. The questionnaire itself was divided into 5 main parts: a network part to
judge the performance of the underlying communications infrastructure; a user
interface part for evaluation of personal profiling capabilities, user interface
realisation and location management; a content part to collect feedback on the
usefulness of the offered contents; a layout part to collect user feedback on the
general presentation and layout (colours, buttons, text styles, etc.); and a future part
to collect thoughts on what mobile communications should provide in the future, as
well as personal expectations on the future development of the multimedia-industry.
Altogether, about 60 questions had to be answered.
The analysis of the questionnaires gave indications about the attractiveness of
the Infomotion system and it’s performance as experienced by the test-users. In the
³ ARTour is IBM’s Open System communication platform for mobile computing. It gives access to
computer and network resources from portable computers via radio networks with the standard
protocols included in the TCP/IP Internet Protocol Suite. The focus of ARTour is on the communication
between a mobile unit and a stationary unit. The ARTour Gateway acts as IP router between radio and
wireline networks. Thus, transparent IP addressing can be applied between mobile and stationary units.

28
following, most meaningful results of the experiment are presented for the different
parts of the questionnaire.
Network part: The main problems with respect to the underlying mobile
communications infrastructure occurred during the connection set-up phase and
were not caused by the network itself, but by the client and server communications
software. In average, 30% of the times the test-users failed to establish a connection
with the information server (see Fig. 5).
Percentage of failed
Connection Establishments
Figure 5 Percentage of failed connection establishments over the whole test period
Independently of the nature of the failure, the test-users became easily frustrated
when their attempt had failed several times. Once a connection was found, it proved
relatively stable. Anyhow, sudden disconnection has always a severe effect on a
test-use! Those who experienced a lot of network problems in the first days of the
test soon lost interest. The time factor is probably also important. Re-establishing a
connection must be easy and swift in future applications. Transmission speed is
important. It is difficult to even imagine under what circumstances low data rates
would be acceptable to a professional user without additional service support from
the underlying network. The information value must then be of extreme height. The
network is a commodity and of as much interest to users as petrol chemistry is to
drivers. Capacity or price is the option one has, little else is of interest for the user.
User interface part: For the great majority of people participated in the
experiment, the user interface was practical and easy to handle, however, nearly all
test-users got lost when trying to move around, either by trying to change network,
reconfigure a setting or going backward to check e.g. a chosen keyword. Future
applications must reduce the number of clicks/choices considerably. Furthermore,
the design of the user interface (buttons, scroll bars, etc.) should be comparable to
legacy applications like Windows. The majority of test-users participated in
experiment 0 was familiar with interactivity and hyperlinking. They could not be
impressed by what is perceived as an ordinary web site. The user requires a simple
feedback mechanism showing the current status of the network: Which network am
I 
currently 
using? 
What 
are 
the 
costs 
(per 
unit/minute)? 
Am 
I

29
connected/disconnected? How much bandwidth is currently available? Which
service can I execute on top of this bandwidth?
The content part: Some users saw Infomotion as a well done Internet-Site,
others considered it as a real service. Especially the location aware travel service,
intelligent information filtering and personalisation are seen to make the step from a
well designed web site to a new service (see Fig. 6).
As time/bandwidth and money are scarce sources, the quality of the content is of
highest importance. Consequently, users should be enabled to profile the content
according to their individual needs. Furthermore, the requested information should
be close to the top layer and easy to find. Alerting and truly real-time feed could
help to make information more easily accessible. Personalisation, interactivity,
relevance and in-depth information are the main criteria for future content!
Figure 6 Usefulness of travel service
The layout part: This was probably the area where user trials of this kind can be
of best use and give the clearest answers. Complex screen design with too many
options given at the same time must be avoided. It is questionable whether a frame
design should be used for services intended to be viewed on laptop screens. One
common and recognisable layout for the whole service (simple, clear and self-
explaining) was requested, however, the layout was valued as less important,
content comes first, the layout only underlines it.
The future part: The network performance should be stable and reliable! This
was the most desired future condition to support mobile applications, of course
heavily affected by the fact that the test-users could not distinguish between the
network access software and the network itself. End-user devices should be small,

30
lightweight and integrated, capable of voice and data communication (smart-
phones), with improved battery standby times. For future developments, robustness
and user-friendliness are perceived as golden goals.
User Part Results Summary: The majority of the users involved in the user part
of experiment 0 fell into the category of ”knowledge workers” as defined by the
Electronic Publishing report [11]. This category is not cost sensitive, but time
sensitive. They also used the PC as an information terminal. Building on the
conclusions of this report, it is evident that this user category is a probable user
market for future broadband mobile services which the OnTheMove project is
designing, and that services should be designed with them in mind.
Data transmission speed offered by current cellular networks is too slow, to
overcome this bottleneck, enhanced data compression and media conversion
technology is needed. Wireless connections in general are too unreliable, different
modes of operation (on-line, off-line, disconnected), packet or asynchronous
message based, are required to handle these problems. Alerting mechanisms are
required to make information more easily accessible and mobile-aware applications
that can adapt to different networks and make best use of available network
resources.
To summarise, there is an emerging need for mobile multimedia applications and
services. However, the feedback given upon the Infomotion system clearly showed
that present available cellular networks are not very well suited to cover the
demands of multimedia communications. Current cellular networks lack of mobility
support environments! The MASE represents such an environment and can alleviate
most of the problems specific for mobile multimedia communications (limited
bandwidth, disconnection, etc.). The Mobile-API allows applications to make use of
this environment and to become mobile-aware.
Experiment 0 - Network Part
Future cellular networks like UMTS have to be designed to support ubiquitous
communications, regardless of media types (voice, image, video, etc.), making best
use of available network resources by means of adaptation to bearer types. The
UMTS Adaptation Layer (UAL) as a lower layer part of the developed MASE will
encounter this. The UAL will select and configure the appropriate networks, bearer
services and protocol stacks transparently to the user, according to the requested
QoS of the involved applications.
The general functional requirements of the UAL are threefold: to select the
appropriate transport- and network protocols (e.g. UDP for unreliable datagram
service or XTP for multipoint connections; e.g. IPv6 in order offer network layer
security features) and configure it for efficient use (e.g. adjusting packet size and
timers to the bearer service parameters), to select and configure an appropriate
bearer service if more than one is available, to measure and monitor bearer service
and protocol stack activities to respond to changes in the QoS and network state.

31
In the network part of experiment 0 the behaviour of TCP/IP traffic over wireless
links was evaluated to identify basic design constraints for the UAL in terms of
throughput, delay and jitter.
The measurements involved mobile hosts with access to the GSM network
connected to a fixed host on a high speed LAN (see Fig. 7). Preliminary tests with
different applications showed that interactive network applications such as
TELNET, do not cause performance problems for such kind of heterogeneous
networks. On the other hand the bulk data transfer is the hardest performance test as
the optimum utilisation of the available bandwidth is evident to guarantee a good
QoS. Therefore, the FTP application was chosen for these measurements.
The experiments were conducted under three conditions: static mobiles with high
quality of the radio signal, static mobile with poor quality of the radio signal, and
moving mobiles to obtain results under representative real life situations. The data
transfer was performed in both directions, up- and down-link. For the measurements
files of 250 Kbytes were used to be able to observe possible retransmissions due to
transmission errors, and to measure the influence of TCP slow start and congestion
recovery mechanisms. For the experiment data transfer performance, and dial-up
connection establishment characteristics were measured.
For this environment it was observed that the down-link transmission speed was
almost 2 times slower than on the up-link for all three test conditions (see Fig. 8).
For further measurements the cellular network was substituted by a serial-line cable.
With this set-up it could be proven that the reason for this difference in up- and
down-link transmission speed is the slow start mechanism of the TCP/IP protocol
due to a buffer congestion, as within this experiment the throughput could be
increased proportionally with changing window sizes.
Figure 7 Experiment 0 Infrastructure (Network Part)
The maximum transfer rate (868 bytes/s) was achieved under static conditions
with high quality of the radio signal on the up-link. Whereas the minimum transfer

32
rate (214 bytes/s) was measured on the down-link for static mobiles with poor
quality of the radio signal.
On the up-link all data transfers could be completed successfully under all three
test conditions. This high value of reliability decreased dramatically for moving
mobiles to 17% successful transfers on the down-link. This shows that the buffer
congestion problem on the down-link has a severe impact on the reliability of the
data transmission in general.
Connection establishment time (time between call command and receiving
“connect” message) for static conditions and good quality of the radio signal was at
a maximum 35.1 seconds and the minimum time was 30 seconds. All attempts were
successful for this condition. For the poor quality condition the connection
establishment time was between 52.1 seconds and 30.5 seconds. Normally the
successful connection establishment took 30 - 40 seconds and 22% of all dial-up
attempts were unsuccessful. For moving mobiles the connection establishment time
increased to 83.3 seconds maximum and the minimum was 29.5 seconds. With 33
% the percentage of unsuccessful attempts was much higher as for the static
conditions. But it was almost always possible to establish a connection on the
second try despite the difficult conditions (handover, changing quality of the radio
signal) which can be experienced by moving mobiles.
In a multi dimensional approach the influence of IP parameter settings for
Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) and Window Size (WS) was evaluated. With a
careful selection of parameter values the transfer rate could be increased by almost
100% (see Fig. 9). For static conditions with good quality of the radio signal the
transfer rate could be increased form 3.6 Kbit/s to almost 7 Kbit/s for a MTU of 808
byte and a WS of 2304 byte.
Figure 8 Transfer rate for static mobiles with good quality of the radio signal

33
Network Part Results Summary: Optimum selection of types and adaptive
configuration of transport protocols according to application requirements is very
important to guarantee satisfying QoS.
The UAL developed as part of the MASE enables users to receive mobile
multimedia services with satisfying QoS over heterogeneous networks.
Especially, for moving mobiles the measurement and monitoring of the bearer
services and protocol stack activities is necessary to improve the reliability of the
involved connections.
The design of the UAL concerning GSM data bearers should take the following
points into consideration: for optimum throughput small TCP window sizes (2-3
segments) should be used. For the non-transparent GSM data bearer the maximum
TCP segment size should be used as the GSM Radio Link Protocol guarantees error
free transmission on the radio path. For the transparent GSM data bearer the
minimum TCP segment size should be used as the transmission on the radio path is
not error free.
Future measurements will reveal which parameters can be optimised for an
adapted TCP/IP protocol stack..

Conclusion
In this paper we have presented the architecture of a mobile middleware (MASE)
capable to support legacy and mobile aware applications. This MASE is a direct
answer to the changing business requirements of mobile professionals towards the
end of this millennium. Through the Mobile-API of this new MASE application
programmers and end users have access to a set of new services (disconnected
operation, scalability of services, location awareness, and personalisation) which
give optimum support for ubiquitous mobile computing.
To fully exploit the services of this architecture a new multimedia business
information system Infomotion has been developed. This system was provided to
end users during an application trial. The results from this first Field trial can be
exploited manifold (MASE-, application development, and future field testing).

34
Most remarkable was the feedback given by the end-users which clearly reflects
the need and usefulness of applications like Infomotion. The end users, which were
faced for the first time with this new kind of services, were extremely keen on
personalisation, and location awareness. This services are seen as the step from a
new well designed WWW site towards a real new value added service.
Further results from both the user and network part clearly showed that present
available cellular networks are not very well suited to cover the demands of
multimedia communications. Especially the QoS in terms of reliability and
throughput requires the services provided by the MASE. More specifically, the
services of the UAL are required to enable users to receive mobile multimedia
services with satisfying QoS over heterogeneous networks.
Outlook
For future field trials, the business information system Infomotion will be
continually upgraded to encounter user requirements identified from experiment 0.
A MASE at different level of development will be available for the next trials and
the infomotion system will be adapted accordingly to make efficient use of the
services provided by the MASE through the Mobile-API.

Abstract: 
People with portable computers are to be able to retrieve a
variety of information at any time and at any location by using wireless com-
munication systems. Since the bandwidth of wireless communication systems
is narrower than that of wired communication systems, however, it is difficult
for servers to use wireless systems to send much information to many clients.
This paper proposes an information-providing mechanism combining broadcast
and on-demand modes of data delivery. The broadcast mode enables a server
to support many clients via narrow bandwidth and the on-demand modes en-
ables each client to access different data. An algorithm deciding which data
should be broadcasted is presented. It minimizes expected length of waiting
time of clients to get needed data from the server. Evaluation results show the
effectiveness of this algorithm.

Recent advances in wireless communication technologies have made it possible
for portable computer users to access databases in remote servers at any time
and at any location. A variety of information services for many users will be
provided soon, but the limited bandwidth available in wireless communication
systems causes following problems[1] [2]:
(a) When many users access databases at the same time, the communication
channel becomes busy and some clients have to wait until others finish
their access to the databases.
(b) Since the data transfer rate is generally lower than those of wired com-
munication systems, users need to wait a long time whenever they access
large amounts of data, such as graphic, audio and video data.
To relax the problems caused by the bandwidth limitation, broadcasting
should be utilized in nature of wireless communication. However, it will take
a long time to broadcast a large amount of data due to their low data transfer
rates. This results in very long waiting time for users to get data they need. We
are developing an information system with a mechanism combining broadcast
and on-demand modes of data delivery. Our assumptions on the environments
where our system will be used are the following:
(a) Data which depends on each location is provided in the fixed area such
as museums and exhibition halls.
(b) Each user with a portable computer wants to get the information while
in the fixed area.
(c) A wireless communication system with relatively narrow bandwidth and
low speed is used to deliver data from servers to users.
(d) There may be many users in each area, and they may want to get data
from the server at the same time.
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes two kinds of conven-

2 INFORMATION-PROVIDING MECHANISMS USING A
WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
There are two modes of information-providing mechanisms using a wireless
communication system: on-demand mode and broadcast mode.
(A) On-demand mode
In this mode a client sends a request to a server which then provides the
requested data. Although the client can get exact data from the server, the
server needs to provide a data for each request. If the number of clients
increased, the response time would therefore increase and the network would
be busy. Dynamic Documents [3] is a mechanism that enables servers to send
data in qualities fitted to each client’s resource limitations (such as display
size and resolution), but the amount of data increases when many users access
the servers at the same time.
(B) Broadcast mode
In this mode servers periodically broadcast a fixed set of data to clients, and
the response time is constant regardless of the number of clients. Since the
data is sent periodically, however, there may be a long waiting time until the
necessary data is sent next time. The Broadcast Disks [4][5] is a mechanism
for broadcasting data that many users access more frequently than data that
few users access, but the waiting time is still very long when a lot of data is
being provided.
3 COMBINING BROADCAST AND ON-DEMAND MODES
3.1
Information-providing system
When data is sent in the on-demand mode, users can get the exact data they
need. And when data is sent in the broadcast mode, many users can get
the data at the same time. So we propose an information-providing system
combining broadcast with on-demand modes so that many users can get the
exact data they need. Data that servers provide is divided into popular data,
which is frequently accessed by many users, and unpopular data, which is rarely
accessed because it is not of a common interest. The proposed mechanism
broadcasts only the popular data. This means that users do not have to send
a request to the server in order to get the popular data. When users want to
access the unpopular data, on the other hand, they have to send a request to
the server.

40
In an exhibition hall, for example, users may frequently access a guide map.
If such data is sent in the broadcast mode, the bandwidth of the wireless com-
munication system can be used efficiently because clients do not need to send
the same requests to the server. A user may access data of a product displayed
in the exhibition hall. If the data in which he is interested is not common
interest among the users, it is not broadcasted. But our system allows each
user to access any data of individual interest in the on-demand mode. The new
mechanism combining broadcast and on-demand modes can thus provide a lot
of data to many users.
3.2 
System Structure
Figure 3.1 shows the structure of the proposed information-providing system,
which we call MobiCaster. MobiCaster consists of servers and clients, and their
roles are as follows:
(A) Servers
The servers select the way to provide data to clients and sends data to
the clients in a fixed area that server is in charge of. They determine which
data is popular by counting users accesses, and they send popular data
in the broadcast mode. They also send a time table of broadcasting, and
they update this time table and send it again whenever the popular data
changes. When unpopular data is requested, the server sends it to the
requesting client in the on-demand mode.
(B) Clients
The clients recognize whether data requested from users is popular or
unpopular. The clients use a time table to recognize the popular data. If
the data is popular data, clients get it when it has just been sent in the
broadcast mode. If the data is unpopular data, clients send requests to
servers and receive the data sent by the server.
Figure 3.2 illustrates the roles of servers and clients, and data flow how each
client gets data from a server in MobiCaster.
3.3 Mechanism
Single-downlink broadcast mechanism
If there are many channels to receive data, clients have to select a channel
that the data they need is transmitted. As the result, a procedure of the
channel selection is necessary for clients. However, if servers send data in

41

Structure of our information-providing system.
Figure 3.2
Data flow in MobiCaster.
only one channel, this procedure is not necessary for them. We propose a new
mechanism using the same channel to deliver both popular and unpopular data.
This Single-downlink broadcast mechanism (SDB) has one downlink channel
and one uplink channel:

(a)
(b)
data.
42
The downlink channel carries popular data periodically and carries un-
popular data after the server received a request from a client.
The uplink channel carries users’ requests to the server in the on-demand
mode.
Each server has its own SDB mechanism and can send data without being
influenced by other servers. Therefore, if the requests for unpopular data in-
crease, the server can decrease the rate of sending popular data and increase
the rate of sending unpopular data. And if the requests for unpopular data
decrease, the server can increase the rate of sending popular data. Like this
case, because the server change the amount of popular data, the server can
efficiently use bandwidth in accordance with the conditions.
Assignment of the data to the downlink channel
The SDB mechanism uses time slots (Fig. 3.3) to send data in the downlink
channel. Some of the slots in one period are used for popular data in the
broadcast mode, and others are used for unpopular data in the on-demand
mode. Popular data appears in the same order again in the next period, but
unpopular data may not appear again in the next period because clients may
not request it.
The ratio of the number of slots for popular and unpopular data in a period
is decided according to how frequently the data is accessed by users. Popular
data is assigned to the slots in order from the beginning of the period so that we
can easily calculate the expected length of time a client waits for the requested
Figure 3.3
Time slot assignment.
3.4
Deciding data which is to be broadcasted
To implement the proposed information-providing mechanism, we have to an-
swer the following two questions:

43
1. How does the system distinguish popular data from unpopular data ?
2. When the server broadcasts popular data, how much does the server
send per unit time ?
In this section, we describe the assumptions used to decide which data is
popular and describe ways to calculate the expected length of time clients wait
until they get data. We also describe the way to decide which data should be
sent in the broadcast mode.
An algorithm to calculate an expected length of the waiting time
The assumptions under which the expected waiting time is calculated are the
following:
1. Size of each data provided by servers is fixed.
2. The requests from each client occur according to the M/M/1 queuing
model.
3. There are N pieces of data, k of which are broadcasted and the rest of
which are sent when requested by clients.
Equations to calculate the expected length of the waiting time until clients
get the data are following.
(a) Expected length of waiting time in the on-demand mode
Clients who want to get unpopular data have to wait while popular data
is being sent in the broadcast mode because the SDB mechanism sends
unpopular data in the on-demand mode after it sends popular data in the
broadcast mode. The waiting time while data is being sent in the broadcast
mode added to the waiting time in the sending queue of the server gives the
expected length of the waiting time until clients get data in the on-demand
mode:
D y Waiting time when clients get unpopular data in the
on-demand mode.
ρ 
Ratio of slots which unpopular data uses.
S b Number of slots used to send popular data (per unit
time).
S
Number of slots per unit time.
Wb Waiting time until popular data is being sent.
(3.1)

44
ρ is the ratio of slots used to send data in the on-demand mode The number
of all requests from all clients multiplied by the ratio of the requests in the
on-demand mode is the number of slots used in the on-demand mode. And
the number of the data requested from clients divided by the number of the
slots in the on-demand mode is ρ.
λy Rate at which data y is accessed per unit time.
Q Total number of requests per unit time.
N 
Total slots in a period.
k 
Slots used in the broadcast mode.
(3.2)
Then we calculate the average waiting length Wb  until unpopular data is
sent. The average waiting time while the popular data is sent in the broadcast
mode added to the time until a slot used in the on-demand mode begins is
the average waiting time. k slots are used to send the popular data. So the
average waiting time in the broadcast mode is the time taken up by half of k
slots. And the probability of data being sent in the broadcast mode is k/T.
The probability with which data is sent in the on-demand mode is (T-k)/T
and the average waiting time in the on-demand mode is the half-time of one
slot. The half-time of one slot is 1/2 because we suppose the length of a slot
to be 1 unit time. So the average waiting time until unpopular data is sent
is given by
(3.3)
T Number of slots until the same data which is sent in the
broadcast mode is sent again in the next period.
(b) Expected length of the waiting time in the broadcast mode

Because the SDB mechanism broadcasts the popular data periodically,
a period is divided by both the half of a period and the number of slots per
unit time gives the expected length of the waiting time until clients get the
popular data.
45
(3.4)
Bx Waiting time when clients get popular data in the
broadcast mode.
S Number of slots per unit time.
(c) Expected length of the waiting time until a client gets a data which is
either popular or unpopular
The expected length of time the clients wait until they get popular data
multiplied by probability with which each item of popular data is received
by clients, added to the expected length of time the clients wait until they
get unpopular data multiplied by probability with which each item of un-
popular data is received by clients, is the expected length of a waiting time
until clients get the data which is either popular or unpopular:
Pi
Di
Bi
N
k
Probability with which users get data i.
Expected length of a waiting time in on-demand mode.
Expected length of a waiting time in broadcast mode.
Total number of data items.
Number of popular data items.
(3.5)
The SDB mechanism decides k so that W is the smallest and sends k
data items as popular data in the broadcast mode.
3.5
Deciding which data to send in the broadcast mode
MobiCaster determines popular data according to the probability of its being
accessed:
1. MobiCaster calculates the expected length of the waiting time (Equa-
tion 3.5). k is beginning with 1 and k is increased by 1 each to N.

46
Namely, it calculates the expected length of the waiting time in each
case that one data item is broadcasted, that two data items are broad-
casted, ..., N data items are broadcasted. Data is sorted in order of its
probability of being accessed.
2. MobiCaster broadcasts k data items in order, starting with data that
has the highest probability of being accessed.
For example, suppose the following conditions:
1. Server has seven data items.
2. Eight requests per unit time are sent from clients.
3. Server can send seven data items per unit time.
The probabilities of accessing each data item are listed in Table 3.1. When
one item (Data A) is sent in the broadcast mode; that is, when k = 1, the
expected length of the waiting time is 9.31. When two items (Data A and B)
are sent in the broadcast mode, (that is, k = 2), the expected length of the
waiting time is 0.656. The expected length of the waiting time is 0.475, which
is the shortest, when three items (Data A, B and C) are sent in the broadcast
mode (k = 3).

Therefore, in the case where data are accessed according to the probabilities
listed in Table 3.1, the server sends three data (k = 3) in the broadcast mode.
4 EVALUATION
In the first half of this section we evaluate the relation between the expected
length of time clients wait until they receive a needed item of popular data in
the broadcast mode. And in the second half of this section we evaluate the
relation between transmission speed and the number of data which servers can
send.
Suppose that there are many requests from users and the server cannot send
all data to the clients. The server thus has to send some data in the broadcast

47
mode and other data in the on-demand mode. We let the length of the time
unity to normalize the length of the time. In the evaluation environment the
parameters of the equations in Sec. 3.4 are the following:
1. Length of the time slot is one unit of time.
2. There are seven slots per unit of time.
3. There are eight user requests per unit of time.
Figure 3.4 shows the relation between the ratio of access to the popular data
and the expected length of time clients wait until they get the data. It shows
three cases differing by the number of slots used in the broadcast mode. In
Case 1, one slot is used in the broadcast mode and six slots are used in the on-
demand mode. In Case 2, two slots are used in the broadcast mode. In Case 3,
three slots are used in the broadcast mode. The X-axis is the ratio of requests
to access popular data to total number of requests per unit time. For example,
when the ratio of the accesses is 0.65, if 100 data requests are received from
clients, the number requests for popular data is 65 and the number requests
for unpopular data is 35.
If one popular data were sent in the broadcast mode and the ratio of access
was 0.65, the expected length of the waiting time would be about 0.401 unit
time. If the ratio of access to one data item were 0.5 and the ratio of access
to another data item were 0.2, the expected length of the waiting time would
be about 0.433 when both items were sent as popular data in the broadcast
mode. However, when only the item for which the ratio was 0.5 was sent as
popular data in the broadcast mode, the expected waiting time would be about
0.452. So, in this case, the expected time is longer when the server sends two
data items in the broadcast mode. This shows that the expected length of
the waiting time depends both on the number of the data items sent in the
broadcast mode and on the ratio which the data is accessed by clients.
Figure 3.5 shows the speed of data transmission:
(3.6)
If some of the data were sent as popular data in the broadcast mode, clients
which requested that data could get it at the same time. So the expected
speed in the broadcast mode multiplied by the number of requests for popular
data is the transmission speed for the broadcast mode. If a data item were
accessed by 75% of the clients and only that data was sent as popular data in
the broadcast mode, the maximum number of clients the server could send it
would be 27. The SDB mechanism limits the number of requests from users

48

Expecting length of the waiting time.
because the number of slots used in the on-demand mode is limited. That is,
Di is not less than 0. If the probability of accessing a data item is 0.75 and
the number of requests is 27, Di is equal to 0. When the number of request is
more 27, Di is less than 0. So the maximum number of clients to which the
server can send is 27 when the probability of accessing a data is 0.75. When
MobiCaster provides data in a suitable way, it can provide data to more clients
than it could if it used only on-demand mode.
If only the on-demand mode were used, whenever there were more than
seven requests, the SDB mechanism would pile the data the server has to send
into the sending queue of the server because the transmission speed of SDB is
low. For example, when the single downlink can send seven data items per unit
time, if there were eight requests per unit time, the data for all requests could
not be sent.

RELATED WORK
Imielinski et al. proposed a way of combining broadcast and on-demand modes
to reduce energy consumption [6][7]. Their proposal has the following features:
(a) The system has several channels (called multicast channels) that can
be used to carry data. One of these channels is used for sending data
required on demand, and the others are used in the broadcast mode.
(b) Each channel carries single data periodically. That is, there is only one
slot in each channel.
This mechanism can be called a Multiple Downlink Broadcast (MDB) mech-
anism in contrast to our SDB. MDB requires as many channels to broadcast
as kinds of data, but the number of channels available is usually limited in
commercial wireless communication systems. For example, there is only one
channel in a wireless LAN using TCP/IP. Our mechanism fits better to such a
wireless communication system.

50
When the system has many channels, data are sent through one. Thus,
clients select the channel in which the data is sent, and then they wait until the
data is sent. It is more difficult to make a structure that selects a channel and
waits for the data than to make a structure that only waits on a single channel
until data is sent.
6
CONCLUSION
The bandwidth of wireless communication systems is so limited that it is diffi-
cult to provide much information to many users. Broadcasting information is a
partial solution to this problem but it cannot provide the exact data each user
wants. We have therefore proposed an information-providing system, called
MobiCaster, that combines the broadcast and on-demand modes. MobiCas-
ter broadcasts the popular data accessed by many clients, but it sends seldom
accessed data only when it receives requests from clients.
We also proposed a single-downlink broadcast (SDB) mechanism in which
popular and unpopular data are sent using one channel. Some slots are assigned
to popular data and other slots are assigned to unpopular data, and the length
of time clients wait for data is shorter than it is when only the broadcast mode
or only the on-demand mode is used. We have shown a formula for calculating
the waiting time and have shown a criteria for selecting data to be sent in the
broadcast mode in order to minimize the waiting time. We have also shown
results of evaluating the proposed mechanism.
The SDB mechanism needs to monitor the probability of data access. We
are developing a prototype MobiCaster system that has a mechanism for this
requirement and are planning to evaluate the actual waiting time in a wireless
communication system.

Abstract
The need to provide multimedia services in the wireless environment has
increased remarkably. This is being driven by the rapid service development
in the computer environment as well as by the increasing penetration of
wireless communication systems. In this paper we describe the development
of wireless multimedia services and their requirements. A gradual
introduction of multimedia capabilities to the users is discussed. For each
phase of this process a corresponding wireless system is identified. Finally,
Wireless ATM is presented as a potential technology to be able to provide
enough bandwidth along with a good Quality of Service (QoS) support for
new multimedia services in a wireless environment.
1. Introduction
Communications services have evolved from pure speech, text or computer
data towards more rich and easily interpretable forms commonly know as
multimedia. As the services have become more attractive to users, people
have started to utilise them extensively. An outstanding example is the
Internet and especially the World Wide Web (WWW). So far these services
are available mainly for wired users. However, there is an increasing need
to use these multimedia services also in wireless manner. This need evolves
from the wired multimedia service environment; users want to have similar
environment, i.e., applications and services, in wireless use as in wired use.
Most of the computer environment multimedia services as well as some
niche
services
could
benefit
remarkably
from
wireless
means
o f
communication. In addition, for some services, such as messaging, wireless
means of communication is essential. Furthermore, wireless communication
opens up possibilities for service developers and providers to introduce

54
new, innovative services taking full advantage of the wireless
communication.
Wide range of wireless systems are being standardised in different foras. A
common nominator for all of these efforts is that they aim towards more
attractive services, higher bit rates for the end user and try to achieve
similar capabilities than available in wired environment, especially this
concerns multimedia capabilities. Existing digital cellular mobile systems,
like GSM and PCS 1900, are being developed to contain higher bit rate data
services at the same time as 3rd generation mobile systems are being
developed. Most recently started activity is wireless ATM standardisation
work carried out in ETSI STC RES10 and in ATM Forum wireless ATM
group. [2]
In this paper we focus on the multimedia services in the wireless
environment. These services are introduced and their characteristics are
analysed. We consider wireless as a transmission media for these services
and discuss some of the special characteristics of the wireless platforms.
Furthermore, a few existing wireless systems are briefly analysed and their
properties are discussed. Special attention is paid on Wireless ATM. It is
investigated as a solution for wireless short range multimedia
communication and it’s capabilities as a wireless multimedia platform are
analysed. Special attention is paid on the justification for the wireless ATM
based applications and services. Chapter 2 describes the multimedia
services. Introduction to the multimedia service characteristics in the
wireless environment is given in Chapter3. Chapter 4 discusses the
development of different platform, wired and wireless. In Chapter 5 we
briefly investigate the different wireless systems relevant for the wireless
multimedia service provision. Wireless ATM is investigate more
thoroughly in Chapter 6.
2. Multimedia Services
Multimedia services are emerging rapidly in the computer environment as
well as in telecommunications environment. Such services as WWW
information access, multimedia data base access, entertainment, news
services, video telephony and video conferencing are existing examples,
many others are expected in the near future. The possibilities for new
multimedia services are unlimited and new services can be expected to
evolve with time.
Multimedia services consists of several simultaneous media components,
e.g. speech, audio, data, images and video and they can be categorised into
several different classes each having different requirements. Here we

55
•
•
•
•
•
classify services according to ITU service classification [5]. The most
relevant classes from the wireless point of view are retrieval services (non-
real-time) and conversational services (real-time) [1].
Compared to traditional services, like speech and data transmission,
multimedia has stringent requirements. Due to the existence of different
components, especially video, low error rates are a necessity. Combination
of all media components tend to increase the bandwidth requirement and
the burstiness of the transmission. In addition, conversational multimedia
services calls for short delays to fulfil the real time requirement.
Furthermore, different media components are synchronised between each
other and have to be transferred between two communicating ends
maintaining the timing synchronisation.[3] It should also be noted that the
quality of multimedia services is subjective and depends on the personal
preferences and expectations of the user. These subjective aspects are still
very uncertain and unknown due to the low amount of available experience
in usage of multimedia services.
2.1 Multimedia services in wireless environment
Due to the limited capacity available in the current wireless systems, the
introduction of multimedia services should be gradual. The introduction of
new wireless transmission systems and enhancements of existing systems
will increase system capabilities stepwise. The introduction is going to be
started in near future when the capacity and required QoS support will be
available. The driving forces for the introduction of new services are:
user expectations based on computer environment,
wireless systems development,
development of the coding techniques (speech coding, video coding),
development on the terminal implementation technology, and
development of the regulatory environment.
Table 1 below describes envisaged phases of a gradual introduction of
wireless multimedia services.
Table 1. Phases of wireless multimedia service introduction.

56
Phase
3  -
High quality wireless multimedia services. All relevant
multimedia services could be provided in a wireless manner. Phase 3 is a
major step towards full multimedia capabilities in a wireless environment.
Same multimedia services could be available as in wired environment. This
phase sets the most stringent requirements to the underlying network. This
phase, as well as phase 2, are strongly dependent of the overall multimedia
development in the near future. Without a large scale penetration and
acceptance of high quality multimedia for everyday routines there will not
be strong demand for the wireless equivalent. Furthermore, a development
Phase 2 - Combination  of several media components with flexibility will be
available with 3rd generation mobile communications systems. System have
to be optimised for multimedia in order to support multimedia services in
an efficient way. Multimedia services envisaged to be available in Phase 2
consist of conversational services like good quality video telephony, audio
graphics and video conferencing. Flexibility of conversational services
allows dynamic managing, i.e. adding, modifying and dropping, of media
components during a call. Retrieval services available are, e.g., WWW
information access containing integrated audio-visual information,
entertainment, electronic  (3-D) shopping and traffic information delivery
(maps and traffic information). Phase 2 introduces a significant step from
Phase 1, in terms of quality. However, the offered services stay mostly
similar.
Phase 1 - Combination of two media components with low QoS is a
continuation of phase 0. Combination of existing components, speech and
data and possibly addition of new components, e.g. still pictures or low bit
rate video. Development is mainly based on the enhancements of current
mobile communications systems to provide higher bit rates. Bit rates
between 28.8 kbit/s and 64 kbit/s will be available.
Phase 0 - Current situation, provides currently available single 
media
services. No real multimedia services available in wireless systems. Good
quality speech or low bit rate data is available in most of the digital mobile
systems.

57
of transmission capabilities in the backbone networks of these multimedia
applications has to be remarkable.
3. Multimedia Service Characteristics
Multimedia data bases and multimedia applications of the future are
envisaged to contain huge amounts of high quality information, audio,
video as well as data. Access to this information could be interactive and
require highly flexible transmission capabilities in order to be able to
transmit all required multimedia information, e.g. images, 3D-graphics,
high quality video, data base information, high quality audio and speech.
The importance of accessing the information in real time is rising in the
business community as well as in the leisure time access. Real time access
to information requires possibility for location independent access. This
requirement can be best fulfilled by wireless systems.
Wireless real time access to information is crucial in order to be able to
make successful business decisions. Leisure time access requirements are
also increasing as applications evolve. Electronic shopping being a good
example to introduce an everyday requirement to access multimedia
information. Electronic newspaper is another similar application concerning
vast amount of users. In addition to these services there will be services that
are targeted to wireless environment and benefit of being accessible in
wireless manner. All location dependent information such as maps, city
information, hotel and restaurant information and traffic information, are
extremely valuable as being available in wireless environment.

Encoding video sequences equals to encoding of consecutive still pictures
each containing temporal variations, i.e. different amount of information.
The encoder output bit rate is therefore of varying nature (see figure 2).
Video encoders normally include an output buffer which adapts the output
of the whole encoder to the available channel rate. A video sequence
containing a lot of movement at one time produces large amount of
information, which cannot be transmitted on the channel or even stored into
the buffer. To cope with this kind of varying situations the encoder is
In wireless environment transmission errors have a strong affect to the
transmitted multimedia information and especially to video information.
Video coding is basically based on transmitting the changes between the
subsequent pictures, i.e., the temporal redundancy being eliminated. A
much higher compression ratio can be achieved compared to transmission
of actual subsequent pictures. This however introduces an drawback of
being much more sensitive to the transmission errors. An error on the
transmitted information equals to an visual artefact in the encoded video
stream. Furthermore, due to the transmission of only change information
the artefact is not eliminated from the picture, until the whole picture is
transmitted again. Transmission of a whole picture, introduces huge bit rate
increase to be handled by the channel. Erroneous environment could have
drastic effects to the QoS offered to users. Therefore a wireless multimedia
system should be able to guarantee the negotiated transmission , e.g., BERs
from 10 -6 or even up to 10-8.
The throughput requirement of multimedia cannot be explicitly defined.
Each multimedia application and service have slightly different throughput
requirement due to the varying content and available user interface. Table 2
lists some example throughput values for encoded multimedia applications.
Values vary from very low bit rate, i.e., several kbit/s, to very high bit rates,
i.e., several Mbit/s. The flexible nature of multimedia adds complexity to
throughput definition, because of dynamically varying amount of involved
media components and their parameters. For high q multimedia (phase 3) a
throughput of several Mbit/s is required, respectively.

controlled to produce less bits, i.e. buffer signals the encoder to use lower
quality for each consecutive picture.
Figure 1. Video encoding structure and behaviour of produced bit rate.
In order to provide a constant quality encoded video sequence the varying
output of the encoder should not be smoothed by controlling the quality of
consecutive pictures. The variable output should be transmitted as such to
the transmission channel, capable of variable rate behaviour. The required
rate of variability depends of the actual sequence, but can be extremely
demanding. A very efficient packet based transmission system or a flexible
circuit switched system would be optimal transmission media to support
variable rate transmission. [10]
4. Service platforms
4.1 Wired platforms
In fixed networks, multimedia services are transmitted over various
platforms. Recent advances in video coding techniques enable relatively
good quality video conferencing over ISDN. The rapid development of
PSTN modem technology suggest that this platform could be used for video
transmission as well. The phenomenal success of Internet has had an
enormous impact for the technical development of these systems and is a
good example of service driven technology development. Also in local area
networks, development has been rapid. Especially the evolvement of
Ethernet is worth noting. These systems have their indisputable merits in
the tasks they were designed for. None of these systems, however, are
especially suited for the transmission of different kinds of multimedia
information. ATM, on the other hand, promises to fulfil these requirements.
ATM provides an easily scaleable, high-speed switching technology for
different types of services. The ability of ATM to offer guaranteed Quality
of Service (QoS) to individual connections according to their needs
provides good support for large scale of different service types. This

60
property along with highly efficient transmission enables ATM to support
the demanding requirements of new phase 3 multimedia applications.
4.2 Wireless platforms
Portable terminals, including laptops and Personal Digital Assistants
(PDAs), are rapidly gaining prominence and the sales expectations are high.
Due to the mobility of these devices there is a natural need to be able to
perform information transfer in different places and situations. Wireless
communication is a natural solution to fulfil these needs. Keeping this in
mind, it is not surprising that wireless communication features are
becoming an integrated part of portable devices. A good example of
integrated sophisticated computer and communication features is Nokia
Communicator 9000, which is a cellular phone integrated with rich PDA
features. The development of these equipment towards more user friendly
interfaces is an inevitable trend. High resolution colour displays are the
obvious target also for portable small terminals.
Another terminal category with different kind of properties are laptop
computers. So far, laptop computers can be equipped with adapters
providing wireless communication features. These adapters can be either
Wireless LAN (W-LAN) cards enabling short range wireless access to the
wired LAN or short range terminal to terminal communication. On the
other hand, cellular data cards are also available for laptop users. These
enable wider coverage but the transmission capacity is rather low. The
recent high growth in penetration of laptop computers and trend to include
multimedia capabilities will also increase the requirement for wireless
multimedia.
However, both of these system categories have their own shortcomings.
Mobile telephone systems are primarily designed for circuit switched
transmission of speech and data, one information component at a time. The
W-LAN systems, on the other hand, are designed for a wireless extension of
a LAN. In this context, it is natural that either of these communication
systems, although they have their own merits, do not meet the demanding
requirements of high quality multimedia information transmission. Further
development steps of both these systems are described more thoroughly in
the Section 5.
To overcome these problems and in order to be able to better fulfil user
needs, QoS guarantees should be provided to the end user in a wireless
environment. Wireless ATM will make new types of services possible for
the end users by offering ATM QoS, higher capacity and efficient
interworking to ATM backbone networks. Wireless ATM is targeted mainly.

for indoor office-like usage (domestic premises and business premises).
However it can be deployed also in public places like airports, shopping
malls and other densely populated places. [4]
5. Wireless systems
Wireless communications systems developed have been targeted to
different environments due to the characteristics of these environments.
Outdoor systems normally contain efficient mobility management and
support moving users. On the other hand indoor systems can be targeted to
more stationary users moving occasionally. Figure 2 describes the available
bit rates in different environments and in different types of systems.
61
Figure 2. Wireless communications environments vs. available bit rates.
5.1 Cellular systems
Mobile communications systems, i.e., cellular systems, are the most popular
wireless systems available. These are mainly designed to provide speech
service for the subscribers. Digital cellular systems also support low bit rate
data services which corresponds to the phase 0 in service development
scenario described in Chapter 2.1. These systems provide wide area
coverage and support mobility, being therefore suitable for various
environments and usage scenarios. The requirement for higher data rates
and better support for enhanced data services, including multimedia, have

62
initiated future development of these systems. The development of e.g.,
GSM is based on HSCSD (High Speed Circuit Switched Data), GPRS
(General Packet Radio Service) and 14.4 kbit/s data services. These services
enhance the data rate up to 115 kbit/s for single user. The capability to
support multimedia services increases remarkably with these higher data
rates and most probably fuels the introduction of first multimedia services
in wireless, wide are coverage environment. This corresponds to the phase 1
in service development scenario, which was described in chapter 2.
Research and standardisation work towards 3rd
generation mobile
communications systems has been going on for several years. UMTS
(Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) and FPLMTS (Future
Public Land Mobile Telephony System) are standardised by ETSI and ITU,
respectively. The target is to get first phases of these systems ready
somewhere between year 2000 and 2002. The objectives of 3rd generation
mobile communications systems is to provide global roaming, support
multimedia services, offer comparable service quality to fixed networks,
provide flexible service capabilities up to 2 Mbit/s, etc. As being optimised
for data and multimedia, rather than speech, 3rd generation mobile
communications systems introduce distinct advantages compared to 2nd
generations systems. Higher bit rates, negotiable transmission parameters
(e.g. delay, BER) and flexible bearer management will make the QoS of the
multimedia services much better compared to earlier mobile systems. Phase
2 in service development scenario is fulfilled technically with 3rd generation
systems. [3]
Further development of the 2nd and 3rd generation mobile communications
systems from the technology point of view is not more limited than the
development of any other system. Limiting factors are rather different, the
major limitation being the lack of adequate amount of available spectrum.
Current frequency allocations are seen as inadequate for large scale
provision of full range of services from mass market speech up to high
quality multimedia. However, provision of these services using currently
assumed allocations is viable. Availability of additional frequency spectrum
for 3rd generation mobile communications purposes are being studied. [9]
5.2 Wireless short range systems - State of the Art
Wireless short range networks primarily intended for unlicensed use on the
private premises. These wireless customer premises networks can be stand-
alone networks or they can used as extensions to the wired networks.
Typically these networks are used for wireless access to a local LAN. Ad-

63
hoc configurations of these networks enable wireless computer to computer
communication without the need of a fixed infrastructure.
Currently, these wireless networks operate at speeds from a few 100 kbit/s
to a few Mbit/s. However, bitrates up to 155 Mbit/s are being studied. These
networks are privately deployed and they operate in "unlicensed spectrum"
meaning they have to accept interference from other users of these
frequencies.
The private deployment typically means limited geographical range.
Currently, the services these network are able to provide networks are
almost exclusively data oriented; most of them are targeted to Ethernet
networks. This category of wireless premises data networks is known as
wireless LANs. Standards for this type of networks have been developed by
IEEE and ETSI.
A wireless LAN standard developed by IEEE committee P802.11 operates
in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz ISM band. The 802.11 standard is primarily
Ethernet oriented and provides bit rates from 1 to 2 Mbit/s. The standard
includes some features which enable the provision of limited service
dependent support. However, these features are not enough to be able to
provide high quality wireless multimedia services to the users. Furthermore,
the 2.4 GHz ISM frequency band is a very hostile environment due to many
unpredictable interference sources, such as microwave ovens, utilising the
same frequency band. In addition, the characteristics of the access rules for
this band make the provision of predictable QoS difficult [7,8].
In Europe, ETSI RES10 is developing a family of standards for wireless
broadband communications serving variety of applications, including
wireless LANs, mobile wireless ATM access networks and wireless ATM
infrastructure networks. These standards operate in the 5 GHz and 17 GHz
frequency bands which are assigned for HIPERLAN equipment on a non-
protected and a non-interference basis. Furthermore, similar band in the
U.S., called Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (U-NII) band
have been designated specifically for high speed wireless premises
networks on a unlicensed basis.
HIPERLAN Type 1 - Wireless 8802 LAN standard is primarily intended for
providing high speed, short distance radio links between computer systems.
This standard is intended to be used for local, on-premises networking.
Operation is based on Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) peer-to-peer
(Ethernet based) communication with decentralised architecture. The
functional standard is completed. HIPERLAN Type 1 provides bit rates
from 1 up to 20 Mbit/s per channel. This bandwidth is enough for most
multimedia services. The problem with HIPERLAN Type 1, however, is

64
that under heavy load the transmission delay increases significantly and
cannot be controlled. Furthermore, being an purely shared system anyone
willing to use the channel is allowed to do so, i.e., the channel load cannot
be controlled. This inevitably results in a somewhat unpredictable QoS.
Another significant problem with the HIPERLAN Type 1 standard with
regard to the multimedia services is that the system is designed for the
transmission of relatively long (Ethernet) packets. The transmission
efficiency of short (e.g., ATM) packets is rather low [6].
As the discussion above suggests, none of the existing wireless networks
are able to satisfactorily fulfil the demanding requirements of true
multimedia services. In order to be able to provide users new real phase 3
(Chapter 2.1) multimedia services, several Mbit/s, small delay and small
BER is required. Clearly, this is not possible using existing wireless
systems and even the future 3rd generation cellular systems will not be able
to fulfil all these requirements. This calls for a new wireless system being
able to meet these demands.
Today, the concept of wireless ATM is being studied extensively and there
seems to exists agreement that wireless ATM is one of the most promising
technique to meet these stringent requirements.
Wireless ATM is seen as a wireless extension of fixed ATM. As such it
should be able to support the main features of fixed ATM networks
including the capability to provide bandwidth on demand, and the capability
to give support for different traffic types taking their individual
requirements into account.
The research on wireless ATM has been going on for some time and many
ambitious research projects, for example within the ACTS research
programme framework in Europe, are currently underway. Recently, also
two standardisation activities have been launched [2]. The wireless ATM
air interface work will include Radio Physical layer (PHY), Medium Access
Control (MAC), Logical Link Control (LLC) for error control and a
wireless control protocol for radio resource management. Special wireless
functionality is needed at MAC and PHY levels to cope with the QoS
requirements of ATM. Support is needed also to the ATM network to
support terminal mobility e.g. handover and location update.
Technically, the most challenging issue is to transmit short cells efficiently
over the wireless interface. In addition to these technical challenges, there
are many other issues that have crucial meaning to the real (commercial)
6. Wireless ATM

65
success of the concept. These issues include, e.g., the progress of the
standardisation work, frequency allocation and frequency etiquette issues
both in Europe and in the U.S. Other regulatory issues will also have a
significant impact. Many of these questions are still open. In the following,
we will focus on some of these issues, along with an general technical
overview to the wireless ATM concept.
6.1 Requirements
As discussed earlier in this document, different media components have
different bandwidth requirements. Furthermore, their requirements vary
also in terms of delay, delay variation, bit error rate, and other Quality of
Service (QoS). ATM solves this problem by dividing traffic into different
service categories. These are [12]:
•
Constant Bit Rate (CBR)
•
Real-Time Variable Bit Rate (rt-VBR)
•
Non-Real-Time Variable Bit Rate (nrt-VBR)
•
Available Bit Rate (ABR)
•
Unspecified Bit Rate (UBR)
These service categories together with the quality of the radio link set
requirements on the radio subsystem performance. This interaction is
illustrated in Figure 3 below.
Figure 3. Requirements for the WATM radio subsystem performance.
Here, the application requirements for wireless ATM MAC are simplified
into a need to support all of the existing ATM service classes. ATM service

66
classes are more stable and solid base for deriving requirements when
compared to evolving applications.
Mobility is maybe the most important feature gained by wireless
transmission. On the other hand, mobility introduces some additional
requirements for the network. Especially handovers have an important
effect to the performance of a system operating in a microcell environment
where handovers occur frequently.
The wireless ATM Medium Access Control (MAC) has to connect wireless
and wired worlds. The constraints imposed on the MAC are extremely
stringent. ATM is a connection oriented technology guaranteeing certain
QoS to the user and relying on the statistical multiplexing of ATM cells.
Therefore, true wireless ATM MAC should provide service comparable to
fixed network and hide the unreliable wireless link.
The radio physical layer (PHY) has to be able to transmit short ATM cells
(53 bytes) efficiently. First of all, there is a need to find a suitable frequency
band for wireless ATM operation in the unlicensed, unregulated basis.
6.2 Spectrum Allocations
The 5 GHz band is one of the most interesting targets for wireless ATM
systems.
In Europe, the CEPT has designated the following frequencies for
HIPERLANs in the 5 GHz band and these are also candidates for the
Wireless ATM frequencies in the 5 GHz band (see Table 3). In addition,
200 MHz spectrum is available for HIPERLANs in the 17 GHz band (17. 1-
17.3 GHz).
Table 3. HIPERLAN allocation in the 5 GHz band in Europe.
Band (GHz)
5.15-5.30
Peak power density (e.i.r.p.)
1 W
In a recently approved Technical Report, ETSI RES10 has estimated that at
least 250 MHz of spectrum, in addition to existing allocation, is needed to
fulfil the future application requirements. Therefore CEPT has been
requested to designate more spectrum for the HIPERLAN family; this
process is on-going.
In the beginning of 1997 the following frequencies were made available in
U.S. by Federal Communication Commission (FCC). The allocation was

67
made for Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (U-NII) devices
on unlicensed basis (see Table 4).
Table 4. U-NII allocation in the 5 GHz band in the U.S.

5.15 - 5.25
200 mW

It should be noted that U.S. U-NII allocation and European HIPERLAN
frequency band are partly similar in terms of frequency range and power
limits. This harmonious development of frequency allocations in a global
basis provides a strong support for high speed wireless data devices and
gives a good background for further work.
6.3 Standardisation
ETSI RES10 sub-technical committee was the first standardisation body to
start a work item on ATM compatible wireless multimedia standardisation.
The Wireless ATM group within ETSI RES10 started working in October
1995. Shortly after this the discussions on wireless ATM started also in the
ATM Forum. The work item on Wireless ATM within ATM Forum was
officially approved in June 1996.
The standardisation work within ETSI RES10 is concentrating to the air
interface related areas of wireless ATM system operating in the 5 GHz
frequency band. The ATM Forum, on the other hand, will cover both the air
interface issues and subject areas related to mobility support in the fixed
ATM network (see Figure 4).

68
Figure 4. WATM concept.
ETSI RES10 has now a working assumption of altogether four different
HIPERLANs. This HIPERLAN family is grouped under concept of high
speed wireless access networks and customer premises networks. Short
descriptions of the three ATM oriented HIPERLAN types follow:
Type 2 - Short Range Wireless Access to ATM Networks. Standardisation
work has started recently and it is active work item at RES10 at the
moment. The work aims to standardise wireless access to the fixed ATM
networks offering a peak bit rate of at least 20 Mbit/s. The architecture will
be a microcell like. Type 2 networks will operate in the 5 GHz frequency
band.
Type 3 - Remote Wireless Access to ATM Networks is an outdoor
application of the technology of HIPERLAN type 2 that will also use the 5
GHz band. It will be able to deliver multi-megabit ATM services over
distances of up to 5 km. Different antenna configurations and protocol
adaptations will be required to achieve this. HIPERLAN Type 3 is the high
speed member of a family of wireless local loop networks being addressed
within ETSI.
Type 4 - Wireless Interconnect to ATM Networks is intended for short
range, high speed interconnection applications, e.g., point-to-point
interconnection of ATM switches and wireless access points at data rates up
to 155 Mbit/s. Type 4 is intended for operation in the 17 GHz band
allocated to HIPERLANs. Highly directional antennas will allow high
frequency re-use as well as wideband, high speed operation.

69
Different HIPERLAN types and their properties are briefly summarised in
Figure 5.
Figure 5. Different HIPERLAN Types.
The wireless ATM air interface work will include Radio PHY, MAC, Data
Link Control (DLC) for error control and a wireless control protocol for
radio resource management. Special wireless functionality is needed at
Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical layer (PHY) level to cope
with the QoS requirements of ATM. The ATM Forum is expected to
establish liaisons with the RES10 which has good knowledge of and
experience with the high speed radio technology and standards.
The work related to mobility support in ATM networks will cover hand-off
control (signalling/NNI extensions, etc.), location management for mobile
terminals, Internet Protocol (IP) over ATM with mobility, routing
considerations for mobile connections and Connection Admission Control
(CAC) & QoS control for mobile connections. These items are being
considered by the ATM Forum.
6.4 Reference Model
The overall system reference model corresponding to the WATM model
presented in Figure 4 can be observed from the Figure 6.

70
Figure 6. WATM Reference model.
The WATM-User includes functions for enabling and disabling of the
WATM-Terminal Adapter (TA) and the selection of the wireless network to
connect to.
The WATM-TA comprises functions for the use as well as the control of
the wireless link. In case the WATM Node is mobile, the WATM-TA
communicates with the WATM-Access Point (AP) (or optionally WATM-
Switch, depending on the division of functionality between the functional
elements) using a protocol that supports mobility of the Node within the
environment controlled by the WATM-Switch.
Further, the WATM-TA comprises the low level functions for establishing
and using connections at radio subsystem level between the WATM User
Node and the WATM-AP.
The WATM-AP comprises low level functions for establishing, changing
and using connections between the WATM Node and the WATM-AP as
well as functions for the monitoring of the RF channel loading, for the
hand-over of connections between Access Points, as well as network
management functions for configuration management and other
management functions.
The WATM Reference Model identifies following reference points and
corresponding interfaces that are subject to standardisation.

6.5 Functional Architecture
Based on the presented reference model different implementations and
interoperability configurations are envisaged. In addition, these reference
configurations consider both stationary and mobility specific
implementations.
The main objective of the functional architecture is to define a flexible
system with a wireless specific elements separated from the standard wired
specific connection control elements. The separation should allow standard
Connection Control (CC) functions, such as Q.2931 or UNI3.1/4.0, to exist
as such in the higher protocol layers while they only have a clearly defined
interface for the wireless sub-system. It should be noted that some of the
mobility and authentication related information will still exist in the higher
protocol layers when these are seen as a terminal level of control actions
having a counter part in the network side. Figure 7 gives an overview to the
envisaged WATM protocol architecture and to required interfaces.

7. Conclusions
In this paper an overview to the wireless multimedia services and their
characteristics was given. A phased introduction of wireless multimedia
services was described. Phases will be mainly based on the development of
multimedia capabilities in the wireless systems, user behaviour and
development of terminal implementation technologies. The characteristics
of these multimedia services set stringent requirements for the underlying
transmission media. However, the wide variety of multimedia applications
and services makes the definition of service requirements difficult.
Throughput, as well as other requirements, can vary from one extreme to
another. Fulfilment of these requirements is especially challenging in a
wireless environment. Recently started activities for enhancing the
capabilities of existing mobile communications systems towards
multimedia will make first multimedia services available (phase 1). Also
new systems for mobile communications have been developed. These so
called 3rd generation mobile systems, such as UMTS and FPLMTS, are
targeted for provision of multimedia services (phase 2). Wireless ATM was
discussed as a most potential technology to meet these challenges of high
quality multimedia and therefore enabling the introduction of new
multimedia services (phase 3). Finally a brief technical overview to the
wireless ATM was given. Furthermore some issues that have crucial
meaning to the real (commercial) success of the concept, such as the

73
progress of the standardisation work, frequency allocation and frequency
etiquette issues and other regulatory issues were discussed.

Abstract:
In this paper, we provide an experimental view of radio access protocol
design in wireless ATM networks. A proof-of-concept prototype, WATMnet, was recently
developed at NEC USA C & C Research Labs, Princeton, NJ. WATMnet operates in the 2.4
GHz ISM band at a channel rate of 8 Mbps and provides an environment supporting video,
audio, and data applications via a standard ATM API with both packet mode (ABR, UBR)
and stream mode (CBR, VBR) services. The prototype consists of notebook computers
(NEC Versa) and base stations both equipped with wireless Network Interface Cards
(WNIC). This prototype system is used to discuss the design of proposed Medium Access
Control (MAC), and Data Link Control (DLC) protocols. Experimental results from
the performance evaluation of these protocol layers, and their impact on transport layer
services in the prototype system are presented.

INTRODUCTION
Wireless ATM, as proposed in [Raychaudhuri and Wilson, 1992, Raychaudhuri and
Wilson, 1994], provides a framework for next-generation wireless communication
networks supporting Quality-of-Service (QoS) based multimedia services. One of the
key features in wireless ATM is to provide seamless support of qualitatively similar
multimedia services on both fixed and mobile terminals. In recent years, wireless
ATM has become an active topic of research and development in many organizations
worldwide [Eng et al., 1995, Porter and Hopper, 1995, Hyden et al., 1995, Umehira
et al., 1995] and is now under standardization within applicable bodies such as the
ATM Forum [Raychaudhuri et al., 1996].
Figure 1.1 shows a simplified version of a formal reference architecture for wireless
ATM, now under consideration within the ATM forum [Raychaudhuri et al., 1996]. To
support the above reference architecture, the standard ATM transport protocol stack
is augmented with radio access channels and mobility related functions. This enables
the support of ATM network layer and control plane services on an end-to-end basis.
Figure 1.1
Wireless ATM reference architecture
The requirements for wireless ATM specifications can be clearly separated into
two categories, namely the radio access protocol layers to handle the wireless channel
specific functions, and the mobile ATM protocol extensions for mobility management
functions to handle personal terminal mobility [Acharya et al., 1996]. The radio access
protocol layers consist of



a radio physical layer, capable of high-speed physical level transmission and
reception,
a Medium Access Control (MAC) layer for efficient sharing of the available
bandwidth among multiple users, along with QoS management,
a Data Link Control (DLC) layer to overcome radio channel impairments, and

77

a wireless control layer for radio resource management.
In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of the radio access protocol
layers using our proof-of-concept prototype wireless ATM system, WATMnet [Ray-
chaudhuri et al., 1997], as a platform for experimental evaluation. We present the
performance, based on measurements obtained from the WATMnet prototype, of the
radio access protocol layers and their impact on the performance of the transport layer
services. For example, the measurements show that the presence of the DLC layer
significantly improves the performance of TCP applications. This is because cell level
error recovery means retransmission of just lost cells rather than whole TCP segments,
which is the case if the errors are recovered by the TCP layer.
This paper is organized as follows. The key issues in the design of the radio access
protocol layers are discussed in Section 1.1. Section 1.5 describes the implemen-
tation of the radio access protocol layers in the WATMnet prototype and includes a
description of the hardware and the software architectures of the prototype. Results
of performance evaluation of the MAC, DLC, and the transport layer protocols is
presented in Section 1.7. Finally, conclusions are provided in Section 1.1.
RADIO ACCESS PROTOCOLS
The basic idea in wireless ATM is to provide support for ATM virtual connections
(VC) with QoS control on an end-to-end basis. Network level functions are handled
with standard ATM cells which are augmented with a wireless-specific header/trailer
on the radio link to support wireless-specific protocols such as MAC, DLC, and
wireless control. Standard ATM signaling functions are terminated at the mobile
terminal. Extensions to the ATM signaling protocols have been proposed to handle
terminal mobility related functions such as handoff and location management [Acharya
et al., 1996]. Thus, wireless ATM network specifications can be partitioned into two
categories:


Radio access protocols to handle wireless channel specific functions, and
Mobile ATM for radio independent, mobility management functions.
The wireless ATM protocol stack corresponding to the reference architecture (Fig-
ure 1 .1) are shown in Figure 1.2. In this paper, we focus on the design and performance
evaluation of the radio access protocols. For a discussion of the mobility manage-
ment functions, the reader is referred to [Acharya et al., 1996, Veeraraghavan et al.,
1997, Akyol and Cox, 1997].
Radio Physical Layer
Wireless ATM requires a high-speed radio modem capable of providing reasonably
reliable transmission in microcells and picocells with estimated cell radius in the

78

Wireless ATM protocol stack
range of 100-500m. The wireless ATM systems may operate in various frequency
bands depending on national and international regulatory policies. They are usually
associated with the recently allocated 5 GHz U-NII band in the US and the HIPERLAN
band in Europe. Operation in higher frequency bands, for example 20-30 GHz or 60
GHz, may also become viable in the future. The expected operating frequency range
is of the order of 20-25 MHz. Typical target bit rates for the radio physical layer are
around 25 Mbps, with a goal of supporting per-VC service bit rates of around 6 Mbps
sustained and 10 Mbps peak. Also, the modem must be able to support burst operation
with relatively short preambles consistent with transmission of short control packets
and ATM cells. In this paper, we assume that a reasonable radio physical layer would
be available and concentrate on the design of the other radio access protocol layers.

79
Medium Access Control
A MAC layer is required to share the available bandwidth efficiently among multiple
users. It must provide support for standard ATM services including Constant bit
rate (CBR), variable bit rate (VBR), available bit rate (ABR), and unspecified bit
rate (UBR) traffic service classes along with their associated QoS requirements. An
important requirement for a suitable MAC protocol is that it should support these
services (along with QoS requirements) while maintaining high utilization of the radio
link.
Figure 1.3
TDMA/TDD frame format for use in wireless ATM
A dynamic TDMA/TDD protocol with centralized control was proposed in [Ray-
chaudhuri and Wilson, 1994] as a radio access protocol for wireless ATM (Figure 1.3).
Downlink information from the base station (also referred to as radio port or access
point in the literature), including control information and ATM cells, are multiplexed
into a single burst and transmitted at the start of the TDMA frame (following the
preamble and frame header). The base station controls the uplink bandwidth (one or
more time slots, in this case) allocation for ATM cells to each mobile, taking into
account the number and type of active connections and their bandwidth requirements
at that mobile. Even though the base station allocates bandwidth on a per-VC basis,
it is desirable that slots allocated to VCs from a single mobile, in the uplink direction,
be grouped together so that the mobile terminal can transmit it in one burst. This
reduces the overhead due to uplink preambles. Uplink control information, which in-
cludes bandwidth allocation requests, uplink wireless control packets, mobility-related
control packets, etc., is sent in a slotted ALOHA contention mode.

80
There are two necessary components to a MAC protocol suitable for wireless ATM
– a supervisory MAC (S-MAC) and a core MAC (C-MAC). The S-MAC, as its name
implies, performs higher-level, supervisory functions, while the C-MAC performs
the lower-level functions like multiplexing and demultiplexing data from the buffers
associated with active VCs according to the allocation schedule determined by the
S-MAC.
Since the bandwidth allocation is centralized, the S-MAC at the base station receives
requests for bandwidth allocation from the mobile terminals for uplink transmissions
and from the DLC for downlink transmission. The total bandwidth is then partitioned,
taking into account QoS requirements, among the active connections. The S-MAC
prepares a schedule table for each frame containing slot allocations for each VC. This
information is used by the C-MAC at the base station and is also transmitted in the
downlink control slots for the benefit of the C-MAC at the mobile terminals. The
S-MAC at the base station also participates in the connection admission control (CAC)
functions for its coverage area. The S-MAC at the mobile terminals receive requests
for bandwidth allocation from the DLC and is responsible for relaying these requests
to the S-MAC at the base station. Also, the S-MAC at the mobile terminal processes
the schedule table that is broadcasted at the start of each TDMA frame and prepares
it for use by the C-MAC during that frame. Some of the radio resource management
functions are also handled by the S-MAC.
The C-MAC is responsible for multiplexing data from different VCs (the associated
data buffers) for transmission according to the schedule table supplied by the S-
MAC. On the receiving side, it filters the received data and notifies the DLC of the
appropriate VC of any received data. The wireless control messages and bandwidth
allocation requests are passed to the S-MAC. The functions of the C-MAC make it a
suitable candidate for implementation in hardware. These functions are also more or
less identical at both the base station and remote terminal.
CBR VCs are allocated slots periodically according to their bit rate. CBR bit rates
are allocated in integral multiples of 32 Kbps and to ensure support of bit rates that
require less than one slot per TDMA frame, a group of 6 frames (12 ms) is considered
as a MAC superframe. The CBR slot allocation algorithm operates over the CBR
slots in a MAC superframe, which produces a recurring CBR slot assignment from
one superframe to the next. We propose that CBR slot assignments be maintained
relatively static since these assignments are periodic and, hence, do not have to be
broadcasted periodically to the mobile terminals. The other key motivation is to
enable support for low-complexity telephony devices in wireless ATM networks. An
adaptive slot allocation scheme [Biswas et al., pear] that tracks the short and long term
bit rate variation of each individual VC is considered for VBR VCs. Based on the
instantaneous rate and MAC buffer state information, the slot requirement for each VC
for the next MAC frame is determined. The S-MAC at the base station, then, uses a
User Parameter Control (UPC) based proration rule for deriving appropriate allocation

81

Logical representation of the Data Link Control layer
for each frame. UBR VCs are assigned slots on a burst-by-burst basis with dynamic
allocation of UBR slots and unused CBR/VBR slots in each frame. A round-robin
slot scheme for allocating slots among many UBR VCs is proposed to avoid one long
UBR burst from delaying other shorter ones. UBR slot allocation is demand-based
and in a best-effort mode, in contrast to CBR slot allocation which is periodic and
guaranteed. Also, bandwidth for retransmissions of lost cells for CBR and VBR VCs
are allocated in the UBR mode. A priority scheme for these retransmissions may
be considered under heavy loads to ensure that the error recovery can be completed
within the allowed error recovery window. The slot assignment for ABR connections
is currently under study and is beyond the scope of this paper.
Data Link Control
This section presents a design outline of the data-link control (DLC) protocol [Xie
et al., 1995] which was designed for transporting multiclass traffic across the radio
physical links in a wireless ATM network. The primary motivation of developing
such a protocol was to reduce cell error rate and to provide sequential cell delivery
(over wireless), which are two major lower layer protocol requirements within the
ATM framework. In addition, the DLC also provides the interface between MAC and
higher layer protocols needed to support a demand driven medium-access strategy for
multiservice ATM traffic.

82
A group acknowledgement scheme is used for error recovery where a receiver sends
eight octet acknowledgement (ACK) packets, each with a bitmap vector, indicating
the error status of certain number of WATM cells (Figure 1.4). Upon reception of an
acknowledgement packet, the transmitter executes a selective retransmission algorithm
for recovering the erroneously transmitted cells. Note that the DLC execution takes
place in a per-VC mode and that requires the wireless nodes (both base and terminal)
to store separate DLC state information for each individual VC.
Figure 1.5
WATM data cell and acknowledgement packet format
Since this group acknowledgement and selective retransmission scheme requires a
notion of Cell Sequence Number (CSN), which is otherwise absent in fixed ATM cell
header, a data-link layer CSN is added into WATM cell header. Cell Sequence Number
and other additional fields of WATM data cells and acknowledgement packets are
illustrated in Figure 1.5. The shaded regions in figure denote the additional header and
tailer information carried by wireless ATM cells. Both data cells and acknowledgement
packets carry 16-bit CRC trailers for transmission error detection.
Our current DLC design supports both UBR and CBR services, and will be extended
to include VBR [Biswas et al., pear] and ABR traffic classes. A demand driven medium
access strategy is used for UBR where a transmit DLC needs to send medium access
requests to the MAC layer before the DLC layer can actually send cells to the MAC. At
the transmission side, when a burst of ATM cells arrives at DLC, an access allocation
request is sent to the S-MAC and upon reception of a reply, the transmitter DLC
sends the cells to the C-MAC layer for transmission. The receiver DLC sends a group
acknowledgement back after receiving the whole burst and the acknowledgement
information is used at the transmitter to retransmit the erroneously transmitted cells.
Since a zero cell loss data-link is desired for UBR traffic, no specific time limit for
error recovery is imposed. Retransmission requires the transmitter DLC to buffer cells

83
Hardware/Software Configuration
WATMnet PROTOTYPE IMPLEMENTATION
In this section, a brief description of the hardware/software configuration of the WATM-
net, the wireless ATM network prototype is presented, followed by the discussion of
the implementation of the radio access protocol layers in the prototype.
The WATMnet prototype system consisted of two identically configured base stations
supporting adjacent microcells, notebook computers for portable terminals, and a
mobility enhanced ATM switch connecting the rest of the ATM network to the two
base stations. Each base station is a VME chassis containing standard off-the-shelf
components comprising one i960 processor card with supporting RAM, one ATM
until a group acknowledgement indicating proper reception at the other end is received.
Also note that the receiver needs to buffer the WATM cells in order to ensure sequential
delivery to the ATM layer.
In the constant bit rate (CBR) mode, the DLC attempts to correct cell errors within
a fixed time window, specified at the connection setup time. During call setup, the
S-MAC allocates slots on a periodic basis for the CBR VCs depending on their bit-
rate requirements. While this periodic allocation is used for CBR cell transmissions,
additional on-demand bandwidth (supported by the MAC’s UBR mode) is used for
retransmission of the lost cells. Note that, unlike in the UBR mode, the constant bit
rate data-link control maintains a constant end-to-end delay over the wireless link.
Although the cells may arrive periodically at the transmit side of the DLC, at the
receiving side some cells will be lost due to the channel error. This causes cell delay
variation and out of sequence delivery over the wireless link. In order to alleviate this
we use fixed length buffers both at the transmit and the receiver ends. At the receiver
side, the cells are clocked out of the buffer and sent to the ATM layer at the specified
data-rate. In addition to cell de-jittering, the receiver side buffer also helps to maintain
a fixed recovery time window for each lost cell. The size of the buffer is determined
by the bit-rate of the call and the allowable time window for error recovery. The
transmit side also maintains a FIFO which is used for buffering a transmitted cell until
its recovery time elapses.
Wireless Control
The wireless control sublayer is needed for support of control plane functions at the
radio access layer and its integration with the ATM network. Its functions include radio
resource management, and metasignaling capabilities needed for terminal migrations
and handoff control. The reader is referred to [Yuan et al., 1996] for a more detailed
discussion.

84
Medium Access Control
As mentioned earlier, there are two components to the MAC layer – the C-MAC and
the S-MAC. The C-MAC is implemented in hardware in the WNIC, while the S-MAC
is implemented as a software module in the WNIC device driver.
Figure 1.7 presents the key components of the C-MAC as it is implemented in
the WNIC [Johnston, 1996]. A NEC v53 microprocessor is used as the embedded
controller to implement the WATMnet NIC system initialization and to perform partial
WATM Cell Queue Management in firmware. WATM Cell Queue management is
implemented in the WNIC to partition the local memory in different size queues, which
interface card, and one VME-to-PCMCIA adapter which connects to the WATMnet
Network Interface Card (WNIC). The i960 runs a real-time embedded operating system
called pSOS. The mobile terminals were NEC Versa notebook computers running the
Linux operating system (kernel version 2.0.29). The WNIC plugs into the mobile
terminal’s PCMCIA interface.
At the base station, a software driver library has been defined to control and transfer
information to the WATMnet network interface card, and is fully dependent on the
NIC’s hardware architecture. The WATMnet custom NIC supports multiple transmit
priority queues, each assigned a traffic class such as Control, CBR, VBR, ABR, and
UBR. Four receive queues are supported by the hardware, each having a circular buffer
of configurable size. The WNIC driver interface library offers C callable functions
for NIC configuration, buffer management, and for queue management in both the
transmit and receive direction. All data flow between the base station host and the
wireless NIC hardware is thorough a VME/PCMCIA interface.
Figure 1.6 shows the key components of the WATMnet support software running
at the mobile terminal. The WNIC device driver at the mobile terminal presents two
interfaces to the higher layers. One is a network interface that is exported to the IP
layer and appears as just another network device to the system. To enable support for
native ATM applications, a second network interface that supports AAL0 and AAL5
is provided. Upon receiving an IP packet for a new destination host, the ATM network
layer uses the ARP module to resolve the destination IP address to an ATM address
(if the mapping from IP address to the ATM address is not already known). Then
the signaling module sends a connection request to the destination host and once the
ATM connection is established, the queued IP packets are sent over that VC. Thus, one
VC is used for each new destination IP address. These connections are closed after a
designated period of inactivity.
The data received at the WNIC over the wireless link is demultiplexed by the core
MAC on the WNIC. Once the data is validated, the core MAC generates an interrupt to
the host processor. The data is read into the host in the interrupt service routine (ISR)
at the host and is processed outside of the ISR.

85
Figure 1.6
Mobile terminal software architecture
are allocated to each active connection. At the hardware, the Memory Pointer Processor
module complements the v53 firmware to support WATM Cell Queue Management.
The Memory Pointer Processor relieves the v53 from data movement functions. A
hardware TDMA/TDD Framer controls the transmission of WATM cells into the proper
TDMA slot. The requirement of the WATM layer to generate CRC-16 overhead on a
per WATM cell is supported in hardware at the Cell Formatter/Deformatter block.
In the transmit direction, PDUs are processed by the ATM and SAR processing layer
and cells are handed to the DLC. Once the wireless ATM header/trailer information
has been formatted, the DLC, upon instructions from the S-MAC on slot allocations,
moves the data to the appropriate transmit queue on the WNIC.
In the receive direction, downlink frames are synchronized and delineated at the
Mobile’s TDMA/TDD Framer. When a WATM control or data cell arrives, the v53
is informed, which, then, instructs the Memory Pointer Processor by indicating the
Memory locations where incoming WATM cells are to be stored in a FIFO manner.

86
The receiver supports receive FIFO queues, one for each traffic class: i.e. Control,
ABR, UBR, VBR, and CBR. While WATM cells are stored in the Memory block
CRC-16 checking is performed at the Cell Formatter/Deformatter block. In the Cell
Formatter/Deformatter block, a CRC syndrome is attached to each cell to be interpreted
at the Host WATM Software block. Flexibility for dropping or processing cells with
errors is handled in software by checking the CRC syndrome. Once the received
WATM cells are stored in their respective queues, a hardware interrupt is generated
to the host processor indicating the availability of information. The host implements
queue control software to determine priority-based movement of data into the host
memory.
Figure 1.7
Implementation of C-MAC in the WNIC
The S-MAC is implemented in software on the host side. It maintains information
on the current active connections, their bandwidth requirements, and their QoS control
information. A bandwidth allocation policy based on satisfying QoS requirements is
implemented, which generates a schedule table containing information on which cells
are to be transmitted in which slots in the current frame. This table is passed to the
C-MAC which then performs the actual act of multiplexing and formatting data so that
it is ready to be processed by the modem for transmission over the radio channel.

87
Data Link Control
Two different implementations of the data-link protocol were necessary for the present
system. At the base station (which runs a real-time OS, known as pSOS, on an
i960 processor) a separate pair of transmission and reception tasks are used for the
DLC processing of each virtual circuit. All the data-link tasks communicate with
a fixed ATM cell relay task and a MAC task using a fairly straightforward set of
inter-task communication primitives (messages queue and shared memory). Both the
transmission and reception DLC tasks for a VC are created during its setup time within
the base station. This per-VC DLC task allocation scheme aids the implementation of
quality of service (QoS) by specifying the allocated buffer space and scheduling priority
of a DLC task based on the QoS requirement of the corresponding VC. Since all these
tasks run in a single address space in pSOS, the expense of frequent context switching
is small enough to be outweighed by the advantages of QoS-based scheduling.
Linux, a multitasking operating system, is used at the personal terminal side where
the data-link and S-MAC software are integrated within the kernel as a part of a
dynamically reloadable device driver. Since Linux kernel does not support multiple
tasks within the kernel, a single threaded version of the same DLC protocol is imple-
mented where the communication between MAC and DLC is realized as a function
call interface.
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section, some performance evaluation results from measurements on the WATM-
net prototype are being presented. The objective of this study was to evaluate the
performance of the radio access layers and their impact on the performance of the
transport layer protocols. We have observed that a combination of video and audio
multimedia applications running in the CBR mode can achieve a MAC layer through-
put of around 4.4 Mbps, which is roughly a utilization of 0.75 (after accounting for the
physical layer, forward error correction (FEC), and control channel overheads).
The DLC for CBR VCs operates with a fixed size buffer for error recovery and jitter
removal purposes [Xie et al., 1995]. We studied the performance of the DLC in terms
of its ability to recover lost cells as a function of the size of this buffer. The trade-offs
here are that a longer buffer increases the ability of the DLC to recover lost cells, but
adds to the end-to-end delay on the connection. A shorter delay limits the ability of
the DLC to recover lost cells and hence increases the cell loss rate (CLR) faced by the
connection. Figure 1.8 presents the CLR faced by the connection as a function of the
DLC cell buffering time. The observed bit error rate (BER) was around 3e – 5, derived
from an observed cell loss rate of 0.014. When the CBR load was high, a short DLC
buffering time for the CBR cell resulted in almost no recovery. A higher rate of the
CBR calls resulted in a lower bandwidth for the retransmission. Hence, the ability of
the system to recover lost cells decreased rapidly with a short lifetime of the CBR cell.

88
Figure 1.8
CBR cell loss as a function of the DLC buffering time
Figure 1.9 shows the net ftp throughput as a function of the maximum available
UBR bandwidth, which is a function of the number of CBR and VBR VCs present
in the system and also on the total bandwidth requirements of these VCs. A file of
size 5984960 bytes was downloaded into the mobile terminal using ftp. The net ftp
throughput was then averaged over 10 samples for each value of the maximum UBR
bandwidth. There are two curves, one with the DLC layer activated and the other
without the DLC layer in the wireless ATM protocol stack. This plot builds a strong
case for including the DLC layer in the wireless ATM protocol stack. The presence of
the DLC layer results in the doubling of the achievable net ftp throughput (as compared
to without the DLC). This can be explained by the fact that cell level error recovery
(at the DLC layer) is better than packet level error recovery (at the TCP layer). Also,
error recovery at the DLC reduces relatively the amount of traffic that flows through
the end-to-end TCP connection (this is shown in greater detail in Table 1.1). Also,
we noticed that the sample variance of the download times was higher without the
DLC than with the presence of the DLC. This can be explained by the fact that the
amount of retransmitted data (by the TCP layer when the DLC is deactivated) depends
on the position of the error and the current size of the TCP window. Even though the
error recovery times at the DLC could interact with the TCP timers and cause the TCP
window to shrink, this seems to happen less frequently and thus does not cause a lot
of variation in the download times.
In Table 1.1, we present measurements to show the effect of the presence of the
DLC in the wireless ATM protocol stack. The first set of numbers show the numbers

89
Figure 1.9
FTP throughput as a function of the maximum available UBR bandwidth
measured with the DLC layer activated. For the second set of measurements, the DLC
was deactivated to study the effect the DLC has on TCP performance. A file of size
2559251 bytes was downloaded using ftp. With the presence of the DLC the download
time was 27.15 seconds yielding a net ftp throughput of 754 Kbps. Without the DLC,
the same file was downloaded in 59.87 seconds yielding a net ftp throughput of 342
Kbps. The offered loads at the MAC and the physical layer are also given in the table.
There are two costs of having the DLC in the protocol stack. One is the cost of
transmitting acknowledgments (ACKs) in both directions to aid in error recovery of
lost cells. The other cost (which can be reduced by better software design) is due to
the phenomenon of retransmission of cells that were received right the first time thus
resulting in waste of bandwidth. This occurs if the timers that the DLC uses to transmit
ACKs are very aggressive. If the ACK transmission intervals are set longer, then the
delays in error recovery interact with the timers at the TCP layer resulting in the TCP
layer retransmitting packets that would have been recovered at the DLC layer.
But as the results in Table 1.1 show, the additional burden of carrying the ACKs
and the duplicate transmissions is more than compensated for by the gain in the TCP
throughput achieved by the presence of the DLC. Also, the amount of information
transmitted over the wireless link due to input from the TCP layer is lower with the
presence of the DLC. This shows that error recovery at the DLC layer is always better
than error recovery at the TCP layer.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this paper, we have presented the key issues in the design and implementation of the
radio access protocols for a wireless ATM network. We have used WATMnet, the wire-
less ATM network prototype developed at NEC USA C & C Research Labs, Princeton,
NJ to present an experimental view of the design, implementation, and performance of
the radio access protocols. The WATMnet prototype, as well as the experiences of other
organizations working in this field, has established the feasibility of wireless ATM as
a future mobile, multimedia networking solution. The WATMnet prototype has shown
that current implementations of MAC and DLC protocols can provide reasonable per-
formance at throughput levels of about 0.65-0.75 (after accounting for physical layer,
FEC, and control channel overheads). The presence of the DLC in the wireless ATM
protocol stack is critical for the performance of transport layer protocols (such as TCP)
since error recovery at the cell level over the radio link offers higher utilization and

91
net data rates compared to end-to-end error recovery at the transport layer, which is
the case with TCP. The performance measures summarized in this paper are from the
initial prototype system. We are in the process of designing the next version of the
prototype (WATMnet 2.0), which will support a data rate of about 25 Mbps and will
operate in the 5 GHz U-NII band. The experience we have gained from the work on
the current prototype system is being applied in the design and optimization of the
various radio access protocol layers discussed in this paper.

Abstract:
In this article we present RNET MAC - a novel MAC protocol to
be used in wireless ATM (WATM) environments. The MAC protocol features
a distributed control for media access. Therefore RNET MAC fits well for
spontaneous network setups and frequent network configuration changes. We
discuss some design options and show basic performance results of RNET MAC
in different network scenarios such as fully meshed, hidden terminal and client
server.
Evolving WATM systems (e.g. [9, 11]) often require a media access control
and data link control due to multiple access to the communication channel and
the error prone medium respectively. For the sake of minimum changes of the
ATM protocol functions and QoS enforcement, the MAC protocol has to pro-
vide dedicated mechanisms for bandwidth reservation, priority handling, low
access delays as well as jitter. One can find several proposals of MAC protocols
in the recent literature (e.g. [6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13]), which all provide in some way
QoS enforcement. However, all of them are based on the assumption that there

is a dedicated entity (BS)² controls the access to the communication channel.
Furthermore, the traffic has to be transmitted via this BS. The first assump-
tion leads to mobiles with a small MAC functionality and therefore potentially
smaller battery capacity requirements of the mobiles. On the other side, a
relative expensive BS is always required and spontaneous networking events
(for instance conferences or meetings), where no pre-installed infrastructure is
given, are not possible. The latter assumption leads to a waste of bandwidth
in case two mobiles (M) want to communicate with each other, since the data
has to be transmitted twice (from M to BS and vice versa). We present in this
paper RNET MAC (section II) that features a distributed MAC and point-to-
point communication. In the next section (III) some performance results are
given showing the capability of RNET MAC to work in ATM environments and
different network scenarios. In section IV we conclude with a rough comparison
to MACs with centralized control.
2 RNET MAC PROTOCOL
The basic idea of the MAC is derived from the RNET proposal (Radio Network,
see [10]) as it has been proposed for HIPERLAN /2³ systems to the ETSI4 in
1995 by Thomson. RNET is characterized by free physically separated channels
(FDMA). Two of these channels are used for signaling purposes and one is for
data transmission. The signaling channels are slotted (TDMA). Data will be
transmitted by an ascending ramp (see Figure 1).
2.1 RNET MAC channel structure
We consider an arbitrary amount of buffered mobiles in a wireless micro-cell.
As outlined above there are two signaling (header and feedback) and one data
Figure 1:
RNET channel structure

Figure 2:
Channel structure with ramp spanning over three slots
(payload) channel. The payload channel consumes considerably more band-
width than the signaling channels together. Header and feedback channels are
slotted. About 56 bits fits in every slot for signaling and paging purposes.
There is no fixed defined format yet. The payload channel is accessed by sev-
eral ascending but independent frequency ramps at a certain point in time. One
frequency ramp can carry one or more ATM cells as outlined in the following
sections.
2.1.1
Framing and transmission blocks
A frame is defined as a group of consecutive header slots, associated feedback
slots and payload ramps. The length of a frame is determined by the spanning
width of a ramp. If a ramp spans over x (e.g. 3) slots then a frame consists of
x+1 (e.g. 4) slots (see Figure 2). A header slot at time x, a feedback slot at
time x+1 and a ramp, starting immediately after the header slot, are associated
with each other and form a transmission block. There are guard times between
the slots to encompass signal delays and clock variances.
2.1.2 Frame synchronization
Following the idea of distributed control, there is no common frame in RNET
MAC. Instead, a synchronization of all mobiles with respect to frame start and
frame end is not required. This simplifies the protocol (e.g. registration proce-
dures). Rather than having a superframe to which all mobiles are synchronized,
framing is locally. Every mobile maintains its own frame. Therefore, there may
be offsets between the start point of frames. A local frame starts as soon as a
mobile is switched on.

96
2.1.3
Frame size and ramp capacity
For the sake of achieving an optimal bandwidth utilization at a certain band-
width and modulation scheme, the ascend of the ramp has to be chosen care-
fully. If the ascend is too low then two consecutive ramps will overlap each
other. In the other case the payload channel is used only for a short time 5.
Therefore an optimum ascend m is
m = B B /LT
where B B (e.g. 5 MHz)6 is the base bandwidth and L T is the slot time. L T  is
defined as
L T = L L / T R
where L L is the slot length (e.g. 56 bit) and TR (e.g. 5 Mbit/s) is the transmis-
sion rate. With the given values the optimum ascend m is equal to 446428.57
Hz/msec. To compute the number of slots per frame K the following formula
has to be applied
K = 1 + R T / (L T + I T)
where R T is the ramp time and IT is the intergap time (e.g. 3.8 msec). IT
is determined by signal delays and synchronization clock variances among mo-
biles. RT is determined by the ascend of the ramp and the bandwidth for the
payload channel B P (e.g. 190 MHz)
R T = B P /m
With the given values the number of slots per frame K results in 29 approxi-
mately. We can also compute the capacity of the ramp
C R = R T * TR
which results in 2128 bit or about 5 ATM cells. If one considers a higher
transmission rate (TR) and/or a higher base bandwidth we will get an higher
ascend of the ramp which can result in a smaller number of slots per frame
and a smaller capacity of a ramp. The same is valid for a larger intergap time
between the slots.

97
The access control is based on a completely distributed mechanism. We assume
that every mobile’s MAC is associated with a buffer.
2.2 RNET MAC access control
A mobile which wants to transmit data by means of radio packets must have
sensed the header and feedback channel at least for one frame duration. Thus,
the mobile is able to gather information about the receiving state of other
mobiles and the availability of transmission blocks. The check of receiver state
is necessary since a mobile can neither synchronize to two frequency ramps (see
Figure 3) nor receive packets while sending.
If a transmission block is not reserved, a mobile can transmit a header on
the header channel. Immediately after the header transmission follows the
packet transmission on a frequency ramp (payload channel). If a mobile re-
ceives correctly a header with its own address it responds immediately with
an acknowledgment in the next time slot on the feedback channel and starts
packet reception. Note, the feedback is not the acknowledgment for the correct
packet transmission in the payload channel. It serves as an packet sending cut-
off criteria if there is no feedback. However, we assume, that a correct header
reception implies the correct reception of the packet in the payload channel,
because the transmission quality is considered to be stable for sufficient short
time intervals.
A transmission block is considered to be available (not reserved), if the same
block was not used in the last frame. The decision of availability can depend
on the received header information, the feedback information or on both. This
information differentiation for reservation evaluation purposes very much affects
the channel efficiency in hidden terminal scenarios as discussed later.
Figure 3: Single receiver station

98
2.2.1
Figure 4:
Temporal Channel
Header channels access
Header slots of non-reserved transmission blocks are accessed in a Slotted Aloha
principle. In any error case (e.g. collision of header, header/feedback get lost
... ) the mobile switches to a backlog state and has to wait k free slots whereby
k is uniformly distributed in a certain interval. The error case is determined
if the feedback is not received. The mobile will chose the first non-reserved
header slot (1 persistent) for transmission.
2.2.2
Temporal channel concept
After a successful header transmission determined by the reception of the feed-
back a mobile has reserved automatically the same transmission block in the
next frame. This extends the header channel access to an Reservation Aloha
based scheme. Thus, a mobile is able to transmit constantly at a certain data
rate (see Figure 4). In other words, if a mobile has gained access for one trans-
mission block, it has contention free access to the same transmission block in
all consecutive frames as long as there is data to transmit. This reservation is
lost if the mobile has nothing to send and the header slot remains empty.
As an design option, an extended reservation scheme is possible. For in-
stance, only in every second (third ...) frame the same slot is reserved. This
would fit very well for low bit rate CBR traffic.
The concept of temporal channels can provide a very good bandwidth uti-
lization in high load cases. However, an increasing load per mobiles can result
in a very unfair bandwidth sharing!
2.2.3 
Channel Holding Time (CHT)
Since the temporal channel concept causes unfairness under high system load
conditions, a Channel Holding Time is introduced. The Channel Holding Time
defines the number of packets, which may be sent consecutively by a mobile.
With respect to the header channel access, the CHT defines the maximum
number of transmission block reservations without disruption.

99
As an design option the channel holding time could be determined in a
distributed dynamic fashion by every station. For instance CHT could be
set with respect to QoS requirements of certain applications or due to the
evaluation of network load condition. The latter could be done on the feedback
channel information.
2.2.4 STOP Bit
A header slot plus the ramp in a frame can be used if no reservation exists.
That is, the header slot has to be free (not used) at least in the last frame. This
leads to waste of bandwidth. To eliminate this bandwidth waste, a stop or a
follow bit in the header can be used to declare the next header as non-reserved.
The stop/follow bit has to be switched on/off if the temporal channel holding
time is over.
2.3
Access control in hidden terminal scenarios
In a scenario, where each mobile is in coverage distance of another mobile
the evaluation of the slot reservation is quite simple, since all the header and
feedback information is globally available. In a hidden terminal scenario it
makes a difference as to which information (header, feedback or both) is taken
in order to decide whether a transmission block is reserved. As known from the
literature [2, 5] an evaluation based on receiver information should be preferred
for the following reasons. The slot reservation evaluation is only done at the
sending mobile. A receiving mobile responds in every case if the received header
was correct. In case the header is not correct, as the header slot would be in
use, the receiving mobile will not respond (see Figure 5 c).
2.3.1
Slot reservation evaluation based on header information
The main drawback of this method is waste of bandwidth and higher collision
risk. The reason for the waste of bandwidth is, that the bandwidth is reserved
around the sender. No other mobile hearing a header signal in a certain slot
is allowed to use the slot although there would not be any contention at the
receiver (see Figure 5 b). The higher collision risk results from the lack of
information about slots already in use, if a mobile can hear the receiver but
not the sender (see Figure 5 d).
2.3.2
Slot reservation evaluation based on header and feedback
information
This method will reduce the problem of a higher collision risk, but the problem
of wasting bandwidth still remains.

100
Figure 5: a) Coverage of header and feedback signals, b) c) d) hidden terminal scenarios
2.3.3
Slot reservation evaluation based on feedback information
If the feedback information is taken to evaluate the slot reservation then only
a bandwidth reservation around the receiver will happen. This results in an
optimal use of bandwidth since the sender does not care about contention in his
coverage area if other mobiles transmit to mobiles outside its area (compare
Figure 5 b, d). The problem which arises from this method is the chance
of feedback contention. The sending mobile is not able to receive a correct
feedback signal (see Figure 5 d, e).
Therefore, we assume the reception of any feedback signal (e.g. a burst
signal) is a sufficient assumption of reception of the header signal at the receiver.
In case the feedback signal contention is caused by more than 3 receivers³, there
is still a good chance of a proper header signal reception at the mobiles which
justify the assumption made above. Furthermore, the corresponding header
slot in the next frame is considered to be free if there is no feedback.
2.4 Time synchronization
Since RNET MAC uses a TDMA scheme, a basic working condition is the
time synchronization of all mobiles. There is no explicit synchronization signal
defined in RNET MAC. For synchronization purposes header and/or feedback
signals are taken into account. Local timers are adjusted with the reception
of every header or feedback transmission. To encompass signal delays and
variances of clocks, an appropriate intergap time between two consecutive slots
must be found. There are well known problems in distributed timing control

101
related with time shift and erroneous timing of mobiles. Even the hidden
terminal scenario’s may have influences on timing control because of distance
and possible different synchronisation signals for a mobile. For some of these
problems there are several distributed time control solutions proposed in the
literature (e.g. [1, 3]). A further evaluation of that topic is necessary.
3 PERFORMANCE RESULTS
The performance of RNET MAC was evaluated by simulation. For the sake
of simplicity we assume no link errors and synchronicity of mobiles. Further a
frame consists of 5 slots and a message consists of a fixed number of packets,
each filling up a complete ramp (about 300 bits).
The simulation scenario are shown in Figure 6. First, we took a fully meshed
scenario, where all mobiles cover each other. There are 20 stations whereby
mobiles 1,2 ... 10 send to mobiles 11,12 ... 20. This has the effect that the
mobile compete only for channel access. Contention at the receiver is excluded
(see section II B.). A sender has not to wait for the end of another ongoing
transmission to the chosen receiver, since there is always only one sender for
a certain receiver. We took this scenario to exploit the potential of the access
mechanism.
Second, we took a hidden terminal scenario, where mobile 1 is out of recep-
tion distance of mobile 10 and vice versa, but the rest of mobiles are able to
receive signals from all other mobiles including 1 and 10. We made again the
assumptions of single sender/receiver pairs.
Third, we simulated a client server scenario. As outlined in section III B., a
mobile can only send data to another mobile if this mobile is not receiving or
sending data. Since the receiving phase is exactly one frame, the mobile can
again receive data only when this phase is over. As this phase can be longer
than one frame (CHT > 1) and/or other mobiles get access first, the waiting
time can be very long. To evaluate such a scenario we took a fully meshed
scenario, where 9 mobiles (clients) requesting access to 1 mobile (server).
3.1
Fully meshed working scenario
3.1.1
RNET MAC with/without stop bit
To investigate the influence of the stop bit, the channel holding time (CHT)
was varied. Every mobile worked under full load, that is, at any point in time
there was a message in the MAC buffer. A message consists of one packet.
As anticipated, the use of the stop bit has advantages (Figure A.1). The
advantage is lowered as the CHT becomes larger. If the CHT is infinite, the
³If there is a feedback contention caused by 2 mobiles then clearly both response to different
but correct header receptions. If two or more mobiles are involved in feedback contention
then at least 2 mobiles are responding to a correct header reception.

102
Figure 6: 
Simulation scenario: 20 mobiles in a 200 × 250 meter cell
throughput of both curves would be equal. But as the CHT increases the access
fairness decreases. In a more realistic region of 1 to 20 CHT the gain of the stop
bit is around 10%. Furthermore, at CHT 1 the performance of RNET MAC is
comparable to slotted Aloha under full load. In case no stop bit is used, the
performance is lower because one slot is wasted after every transmission. In all
following simulations the stop bit is used and CHT is set to 5.
3.1.2
RNET MAC burst handling (handling of short and long
messages)
Beside CHT, the length of the messages have to be considered. This has con-
sequences on the throughput, queueing delay and collision rate. To evaluate
the influence of the message length, two constant message sizes are chosen (1
packet per message and 5 packets per message (burst case)) and the load is
varied. That is, the interfamily time between to consecutive messages is larger
for messages consisting of 5 packets than for messages consisting of one packet
at the same load.
At a first glimpse, the throughput curves (Figure A.2) are very similar even
though the curves of collisions (Figure A.3) show a completely different behav-

103
ior. There are only some marginal throughput differences in the load region
from 0.75 till 1.0.
The collision rate grows rapidly for short messages and stabilizes at a load
of one. For long messages, the collision rate increases slower than for short
messages and stabilizes at the same points as for short messages. The reason
for the similar throughput curves are based on the following facts: In lower load
regions there is enough capacity to resolve collisions of short (as well as long)
messages. Therefore, there is no performance degradation for short messages.
As the load increases, the short messages are treated by RNET MAC as long
messages since the probability, that the buffer is not empty and a temporal
channel is built up is higher. This effect reduces the collision rate for short
messages, if the load becomes more than 0.5.
As anticipated, the queueing delays (Figure A.4) are slightly shorter for short
messages in lower load regions (<0.5) since packets do not have to wait very
long for transmission. For messages consisting of 5 packets, the 5th packet
has to wait at least 4 slots before it is transmitted. There is a break point at
a throughput of around 50%. The delay here is around 27 slots. After this
point the delay for short messages will grow exponentially because of retries
resulting from a large number of collisions and later on through the infinity of
buffer space. Delays for long messages remains stable for loads up to 65% and
also grows exponentially afterwards.
From the curves above, one can conclude that RNET MAC shows a nearly
equal handling of short and long messages. Long messages only have advantages
in terms of delays in higher load regions.
3.2 Hidden terminal scenario
For the sake of comparability the fully meshed is chosen. There is only one
change: mobile 1 (left upper edge) and mobile 10 (right lower edge) are hidden
from each other. The objective of the simulation is to show how RNET MAC
behaves in a hidden terminal scenario; header information or feedback infor-
mation is used to evaluate reservation of slots. As shown in [14] for the IEEE
802.11 MAC protocol4 with a similar network configuration, hidden terminals
can lead to an excessive degradation of the performance.
As anticipated in section II C, header slot reservation based only on feedback
(HSRF) information outperforms header slot reservation, which is only based
on header information (HSRH) (Figure A.5). The reason for that is two-fold.
First, HSRH is not able to resolve collisions between the two hidden mobiles
because the feedback information is not evaluated. Clearly this results in a
4It should be mentioned, that the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol has an optional feature to
avoid collision through a per packet bandwidth reservation mechanism. This mechanism is
based on two additional signalling messages: RTS (ready to send - bandwidth reservation
around sender) and CTS (clear to send - bandwidth reservation around the receiver). RTS
is comparable to the header information and CTS is comparable to the feedback information
in RNET.

104
higher collision rate (Figure A.6). Second, if two mobiles start the transmission
at the same time even in the full coverage area (mobile 2-9, 11-20) they cannot
recognize them. As outlined before, one can find more basic scenarios which
show the superiority of HSRF.
If the performance results from section III A are compared with the results
of HSRF one can only find marginal differences even though there are hidden
terminals. RNET behaves nearly optimally in hidden terminal environments.
3.3 Client server scenario
As shown in the results, the performance of RNET MAC in this scenario (9
mobiles sends to one server) is relatively poor. Therefore other concepts like
ramp sharing or cutting will be investigated. It should be mentioned that
this effect is improved, if the server sends data to the mobiles as there is no
concurrence (collision) and the clients could be served one after the other.
However, data would still have to wait in the transmit queue.
A comparison with the throughput curve of the fully meshed scenario from
section III A (compare Figure A.2 and A.8) shows a throughput degradation
of about 70%. Less than 20% of the available bandwidth is used. But there
is still a positive point; the maximum achievable throughput in this specific
configuration is about 20% which is nearly achieved.
In contrast to the scenario chosen in section III A and III B, the collision rate
goes up very early and to a high level (compare to Figure A.3 and A.6). Also
the queueing delay (Figure A.10) becomes infinite at a low load level. This is
because RNET MAC is only able to serve at maximum 1 slot per frame (about
20% throughput) in this network configuration. If the load increase above this
level the queueing delay grows infinitely.
The simple idea of multiple transmitter/receiver at the server can improve
the performance of RNET MAC in the client server scenario substantially.
This is justified by the assumption, that a server is always more expensive than
”simple” mobiles.
4 CONCLUSIONS
We presented a novel MAC protocol, which features point-to-point communi-
cation and distributed access control. The features of this MAC as well as
performance results have shown, that RNET MAC is applicable in principle in
WATM environments.
The distributed access control of RNET MAC results in a good applicabil-
ity for environments without pre-installed infrastructure as for instance base
stations, which are the more expensive part wireless networks with central-
ized control. However, centralized control reduce the functionality of mobiles,

105
which makes them less expensive. Also, the implementation of QoS control is
easier. The point-to-point communication paradigm improves the bandwidth
efficiency, because communication via a BS divides the available bandwidth by
the factor of two. RNET MAC is flexible with respect to packet sizes. Accord-
ing to the chosen parameter (for instant ascend of ramp), a ramp can carry a
packet with an arbitrary number of bits. For the sake of transparency the ramp
size should be a multiple of an ATM size. As well as WATM MAC based on
centralized control, RNET MAC supports ATM QoS enforcement by means of
reservation and the channel holding time. In particular, CBR services as well as
efficient support of best effort services (UBR) are possible. RNET MAC gives
also indirect means for error control. In case of collisions, a retransmission will
be executed. Note, that RNET MAC bases on the assumption, that correct
header reception implies a correct reception of data. That is valid for sufficient
short time intervals only.

1. Introduction
Wireless ATM has recently emerged as an appealing solution to support broadband
communication services taking advantage of both the deployment flexibility of
wireless networks and the information transfer capability of ATM [1]. A specific
application of this new technology is in the access segment of the ATM network to
provide service in rural areas and in historical city centers, where cabling has proved
to be uneconomical and unfeasible, respectively.
Usually, a wireless ATM network has a star topology, in which a central device,
the Base Station (BS), provides for the interworking between the access and the
core networks and centralizes some protocol functions. The link between the BS
and the associated Customer Equipment (CE) is organized into at least a down-
channel, from the BS to the CE, and an up-channel, from the CE to the BS. The
BS uses in broadcast mode the capacity of the down-channel and the CE share the
capacity of the up-channel.
The last feature introduces one of the key open issues for wireless ATM: the
provision of the capabilities required to coordinate the transmissions on the shared
channel, so as to support efficiently the broadband communications services targeted
by ATM. ATM has been designed for transmission over point to point channels
and does not provide these capabilities; instead the utilization of a Medium Access
Control (MAC) protocol layer is commonly considered for the resemblance of this

110
currently carried out by ETSI on Broadband Radio Access Networks [2] in liaison
with the ATM Forum “Wireless ATM” Working Group.
This paper proposes a new MAC protocol, called On-Demand Allocation with
Centralized Scheduling (DACS). DACS implements a connection-less service, that
distinguishes between two levels of priority: ATM connections belonging to the
CBR and the rt-VBR service categories receive high priority and are handled by
means of a Time Bounded Service; the other connections are handled by means of a
Best Effort Service and share the residual capacity. In a CE, each one of these two
classes is associated to a MAC level buffer that is served according to the relevant
DACS strategy.
DCAS is based on an on-demand assignment mechanism that either reserves or
allocates dynamically the available radio resources to the established connections,
provided that the CE’s have requested them. The request of resources is operated
according to a random channel access scheme, called Contention and Collision
Resolution (CCR) strategy, that is distributed among the CE and is based on the
well known 2 cell stack algorithm. The allocation of resources is operated by the
Up-Channel Scheduling (UCS) mechanism, centralized in the BS, that allocates
Contention-based Transmission Opportunities (CTO’s) and Grant-based
Transmission Opportunities (GTO’s). A CTO may be used by those CE’s that
need to transmit information belonging to a connection that was previously inactive
at the MAC level, i.e. for which there were no cells backlogged in the MAC level
buffer; the concurrent utilization of a CTO by multiple connections results in a
collision. A GTO is given for exclusive utilization to one CE, that uses it to
transfer collision-free one MAC data unit belonging to one ATM connection for
which a backlog of cells exists at the moment. The allocation of the CTO’s is
determined as a function of the current requirements of the CCR and of the number
of active connections: a new strategy is proposed, that utilizes a threshold on the
number of the established connections to determine when it is appropriate to start a
new contention. The GTO allocation policy is a simple round robin with First In
First Out discipline, with the optional utilization of the residual lifetime for the
information units relevant to real time communications. This design is very simple
and attains a very low overhead: it is therefore useful to evaluate its effectiveness
with respect to various traffic profiles and levels, in order to understand the
suitability of a MAC protocol that does not coordinate the medium access control
to the current status of the ATM connections.
The section 2 describes the DACS protocol, with main reference to the dynamic
allocation of the contention opportunities. The section 3 discusses the results of a
simulation based performance evaluation of DACS.
2. ON DEMAND ALLOCATION WITH CENTRALIZED SCHEDULING
The On Demand Allocation with Centralized Scheduling (DACS) is a novel MAC
protocol for wireless ATM networks.
DACS supports two connection-less information transfer services, best effort and
time bounded (see the Fig. 1), and associates a logical queue to each one of these
two service classes. One queue is used by the ABR, UBR and VBR-nrt ATM
service categories and aims at providing a low loss ratio without stringent delay

111
requirements; the latter aims at delivering the information with a pre-defined
maximum tolerable delay. DACS operates by taking into account that, usually, an
ATM connection alternates between “on” and “off” periods and this gives rise to
the activation and deactivation of the MAC level queues, where only an active
queue contains ATM cells to transmit on the up-channel.
Figure 1 Relationship between DACS services and ATM service categories
Consequently, DACS shares the up-channel capacity between Contention-based
Transmission Opportunities (CTO’s) and Grant-based Transmission Opportunities
(GTO’s). A GTO is allocated to one CE to transfer collision-free one MAC data
unit. An allocated CTO allows the CE to attempt the notification of the activation
of a queue by transmitting the current head of line MAC data unit. The concurrent
utilization of one CTO by multiple queues results in a collision and the
transmission attempts are not successful.
The header of every MAC data unit transmitted upstream piggybacks a binary
indicator to update the status of the relevant queue. This indicator is set (reset) if
the queue is currently active (not active), i.e. if there is at least one backlogged cell
for the relevant MAC level service class. This is a rather simple and overhead-free
solution to make sure that the MAC layer does not allocate GTO’s to empty
queues. This information is anyway not sufficient to handle appropriately the
queues relevant to the Time Bounded Service and the additional specification of the
residual lifetime of the head of line cell may be appropriate for this purpose. The
implementation of this facility is left for further study and is not straightforward in
the considered environment.
DACS consists of two algorithms called Up-Channel Scheduling (UCS) and
Contention and Collision Resolution (CCR): the UCS allocates the CTO’s and the
GTO’s; the CCR resolves the collisions and utilizes the allocated CTO’s for new
contention attempts. The CCR is distributed among the CE, the UCS is
centralized in the BS.
2.1. Contention and Collision Resolution
In the basic version of the CCR, called Free Access (FA), a CE that is presently not
contending may use the first allocated CTO to attempt the transmission of the head
of line MAC data unit on a recently activated queue, irrespectively of its instant of

112
activation and of the relevant traffic class. The BS notifies the outcome of the
contention attempts; channel sensing by the CE is not considered for
implementation because not always reliable over a wireless channel and to simplify
the CE structure. A Contention Interval (CI) is the set of time slots on the
up-channel that include all the consecutive CTO’s that result in at least one
contention attempt and the first unused CTO after them. A relatively more complex
version utilizes a Gated Access (GA) to speed up the resolution of a contention. In
this case the BS has the additional task of notifying the end of a CI.
Although both the GA and the FA strategy are able to support disjoint CI’s for
the two information transfer services, the implementation here considered relies on
the undistinguished utilization of any allocated CTO by every queue that needs to
advertise its activation, whether relevant to the time bounded or the best effort
service.
The requirements for the fast resolution of the current contentions and for the
easy identification by the BS of the end of a CI are met, among the others, by the 2
cell stack algorithm with binary feedback [3]. In this algorithm, selected also for its
ease of implementation and robustness against noise and interference, the end of a
CI is always and only in correspondence to the second consecutive collision-free
CTO. This may be easily verified from the operation of the algorithm, whose
pseudo code is shown in the Fig. 2 using the following notations:
•
fj is the binary feedback for the contention attempt carried out on the j-th CTO;
fj  = ‘c’ (f j = ‘nc’) means collision (no collision), respectively;
• ci,j is the binary counter of the i-th contending queue upon the allocation of the
j-th CTO; ci,j = 1 (0) if the queue can (cannot) contend.
if (ci,j  = 1) then
the i-th contending queue may use the j-th CTO
if (fj = ‘nc’) then
the i-th contending queue wins the contention
else
ci,j+1=0 with probability 0.5  and c i,j + 1  = 1 with probability 0.5
else
if (fj = ‘nc’) then
ci,j + 1 = 1
else
c i,j + 1 = 0
Figure 2 Two cell stack collision resolution with binary feedback
After a contention attempt, a CE waits for the feedback from the BS: in the case
of collision free transmission the queue is activated and waits for the allocated
GTO’s to send the following MAC data units; in the case of collision the CE
draws at random the value of a binary counter: the queue may use the next allocated
CTO if the counter is equal to 1, otherwise it is forced to miss it and the next value
assumed by the counter is determined by the outcome of the next contention
attempt.

113
Since the up-channel is dynamically shared between CTO’s and GTO’s it is not
easy to dimension a finite and non null window to admit in contention the
activated queues; this is an important difference with respect to [3]; where the
contentions are supposed to be carried out on a dedicated channel.
The proposed CCR relies on a slot based contention, in which one CTO results
in the attempt to transmit at least one ATM cell per contending queue, depending
on the slot length. Instead, other papers [4, 5, 6] have proposed the utilization of
short MAC data units (minislots) to carry out a contention attempt; in this case a
successful contention attempt does not result in the transmission of an ATM cell.
The reason for this choice is that a BS will likely cover a relatively small area and
serve a limited number of CE; accordingly, there is a reasonable small number of
queues needing concurrently to contend and the complexity to handle the minislots
is usually not counterbalanced by a performance improvement.
2.2.
Up-Channel Scheduling
The UCS allocates a GTO whenever there is at least one urgent (i.e. with
expiring lifetime) MAC data unit belonging to a queue relevant to the Time
Bounded Service, otherwise it may either allocate a CTO or a GTO to a queue
relevant to the Best Effort Service and this decision is taken on the basis of two new
criteria, specifically proposed for DACS.
The first one allocates the CTO’s as fast as possible when there is a contention
in progress, to resolve it in the shortest possible time. The rationale is to contain
as much as possible the additional random delay due to contention and collision
resolution, with main reference to time bounded communications. This is
constrained by the fact that the BS cannot allocate a CTO if it has not yet
determined the outcome of the previous contention attempt. In addition, if the
outcome of a contention attempt and the allocation of CTO’s and GTO’s are
notified by means of specific MAC data units, their transmission on the
down-channel has a delay that depends on the current backlog of data units relevant
to high priority queues and on the operation of the down-channel scheduling
mechanism. The minimum delay between two consecutive CTO’s is
T down +Tup+2*Tp, wherein Tp is the one way propagation delay and Tdown
and Tup are the slot duration on the down-channel and the up-channel, respectively,
and results when the feedback to the previous contention attempt and the allocation
of the next CTO are notified by the same data unit, transmitted immediately after
the reception by the BS of the MAC data units involved in the previous contention.
The second policy utilizes a threshold to control in a dynamic way the
allocation of CTO’s when there is not a contention in progress. If the number A of
queues established and currently active is higher than or equal to a given threshold,
set as a percentage of the total number E of established queues, than the UCS
allocates a GTO to one active queue, otherwise it allocates a CTO to give a
transmission opportunity to the recently activated queues (if any exists). The
threshold does not take into account the traffic contract of the established queues and
the status of the system and gives a qualitative picture of the current need for
contention.

The pseudo code of the UCS is shown in the Fig. 3, without any details about
the adopted criteria to select the active queue to be granted, if multiple choices exist
at one instant. These criteria may be easily derived from the previously introduced
choices to utilize round robin with FIFO for the queues relevant to the Best Effort
Service and to regulate the priority of the queues relevant to the Time Bounded
Service with respect to the residual lifetime of their head of line units.
114
if (there are no active queues) then
if (the BS has not notified the outcome of the last contention) then
the next slot on the up-channel is empty
else
allocate a CTO
else
if (there is an urgent MAC data unit to be transmitted upstream) then
allocate a GTO to the relevant queue
else
if ((there is a CI in progress) and (the BS has notified the outcome of
the last contention)) then
allocate a CTO
else
if (there is not a CI in progress) then
if (the number of active queues is below the threshold) then
if (the BS has notified the outcome of the last contention) then
allocate a CTO
else
if (the active connections have some backlogged MAC data
units) then
allocate a GTO to one of these queues
else
else
the next slot on the up-channel is empty
allocate a GTO to one of these queues
Figure 3 Pseudo code of the Up-Channel Scheduling
The UCS may be applied to realize either a slot by slot scheduling, in which a
single run of the algorithm determines the utilization of the next time slot on the
up-channel, or a cycle-based scheduling, in which the algorithm is iterated to
determine the utilization of multiple consecutive slots on the up-channel and all the
decisions are notified in a single instance. It is relevant to point out that the receiver
to/from transmitter switching delay preclude the implementation of the slot by slot
scheduling if TDMA / TDD is used.
3. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
The performance evaluation of the CCR and the UCS has been carried out by means
of computer simulation, focusing on the quality of service experienced by

115
communications supported by the Best Effort service. The UCS is applied to realize
a slot by slot scheduling mechanism, less appropriate that the cycle-based
scheduling from the point of view of the actual implementation but more
appropriate to assess the performance bounds of the proposed strategies in the ideal
case that any decision is taken exactly when needed, according to the operation of
the proposed strategies. The outcome of a contention attempt and the allocation of a
transmission opportunity are notified by means of specific fields in the header of the
MAC data units transmitted on the down-channel; with this assumption the UCS
is made independent from the scheduling mechanism for the down-channel and
every MAC data unit transmitted downstream may notify any decision relevant to
the UCS and the CCR. This assumption is realistic only for the assumed slot by
slot scheduling, as a cycle based scheduling requires the utilization of specific MAC
data units to notify the information relevant to a whole cycle.
The two channels are ideal, free from transmission errors and have equal
capacity; the latter assumption does not affect the performance results as long as
only one MAC data unit out of every R transmitted downstream notifies the
allocation of a single transmission opportunity, wherein R> 1 is the ratio between
the capacity of the down- and the up-channels. The propagation delay is set to zero,
a reasonable assumption for most access networks. The CE are all in visibility
range from the BS and each of them is involved in a single call. Mobility issues are
not considered.
The user traffic is generated by E homogeneous queues, each one associated to a
single ATM connection that offers cells according to an on-off process with peak bit
rate F p,n  and mean bit rate Fm,n normalized with respect to the up-channel
capacity C; the burst length follows a truncated negative exponential distribution
with mean burst length Lb,mean (cells) and maximum burst length Lb,max (cells).
The number E of established queues is kept constant during each simulation and
determines the offered load, whose values are shown in the Table 1 normalized with
respect to the up-channel capacity. This model is not able to show the effects of a
MAC level multiplexing of ATM connections at a CE, but highlights the
implications of the proposed CCR and UCS mechanisms on the quality of service
of the established ATM connections. The three queue profiles described in the
Table 2 are considered to evaluate the impact of the traffic model on the performance
of DACS.

Each MAC data unit carries a single ATM cell. The size B of the MAC level
buffer is either 30 or 70 cells.
The mean value and the variance of these performance parameters are evaluated:

116
-
the Cell Loss Ratio is the ratio between the number of ATM cells lost for MAC
transmission buffer overflow and the number of generated ATM cells;
-
the Scheduling Inefficiency is the ratio between the number of wasted GTO’s
and the total number of allocated GTO’s for each queue; a GTO is wasted if
allocated to an active queue that currently has not a cell completely available for
upstream transmission;
-
the Admission Delay is the delay from the instant of complete generation of the
first cell after the activation of a queue and the time this queue contends for the
first time;
- the Contention Delay is number of slots required by a cell to contend
successfully.
In all the plots, the value 1E-9 of the Cell Loss Ratio means that no loss has
been experienced during a simulation and is used to draw the plots with a
logarithmic scale. The confidence interval is not shown to simplify the figures, it is
always smaller than 5% of the average value for any value of the delay and for Cell
Loss Ratio greater than 1E-5.
The first group of simulation experiments has been carried out to compare the
performance attained by the proposed slot based CCR against those attained when
the contention attempts are carried out using minislots. Each slot conveys 4
minislots, each of them carrying the data necessary to identify the contending
queue, and the 2 cell stack algorithm is generalized to accommodate multiple
collisions or successful contentions per slot. The GA strategy is used.
The Fig. 4 shows that the minislot based contention is able to improve the Cell
Loss Ratio performance, but the advantage is often limited, if not negligible, for the
queue profiles P1, P2 and P3. In fact, the Cell Loss Ratio attained by the two
arrangements is similar for threshold set to T = 0.5 * E, (this is the considered
default threshold value) because the number of concurrently contending queues is
limited to at most a few units and the slightly faster collision resolution of the
minislot based contention is compensated by its higher overhead, due to the fact
that an ATM cell is not transmitted in the case of successful contention. The only
appreciable difference is when 22 queues with profile P3 are set-up, in which case
the long persistency of the time interval in which the number A of established and
active queues is greater than T has the effect of blocking the allocation of the CTO’s
for a significant period: the faster collision resolution of the minislot based
contention is beneficial to attenuate this disadvantage. The plots of the Cell Loss
Ratio are similar for P3 and P2 and tend to the same value for increasing offered
loads; in fact both these sources waste many GTO’s for low and medium offered
loads, due to the inability of the round robin scheduling in tracking the actual
requirements of the active queues, and this effect looses its relevance only at high
offered load, in which case the inter GTO delay (i.e. the time elapsing between two
successive allocation of GTO to the same queue) becomes critical. As for P1 the
Scheduling Inefficiency is often very low and the sharp increase of the Cell Loss
Ratio is due to the round robin scheduling that operates irrespectively of the
number of cells backlogged at the MAC buffer of the active queues, with the result
that the inter GTO delay becomes larger than the inter-cell time at the source peak
rate and the MAC level buffers overflow. The oscillations of the plots are due to the
truncation carried out when E is odd to meet the natural requirement of integer
threshold value. In the same figure the Cell Loss Ratio for normalized offered load

117
equal to 0.25 is larger than that for normalized offered load equal to 0.37 because of
the effect of the threshold value that is too high when 6 queues are established.
Figure 4. Minislot vs. slot contention: Cell Loss Ratio for the default threshold
The effect of the threshold value on the Cell Loss Ratio is shown in the Fig. 5
for normalized offered load equal to 0.92. P1 needs a small threshold to receive
more GTO’s than CTO’s and its Cell Loss Ratio increases always with the
threshold; the Cell Loss Ratio of P2 and P3 is very sensitive to the threshold value
and presents a minimum value in correspondence to a threshold value lower than
1 / Fp,n for both of them. This value is meaningful only if enough queues are
established, otherwise the Cell Loss Ratio decreases with the threshold increasing
up to E.
Figure 5. Effect of the threshold value on the Cell Loss Ratio

118
The Scheduling Inefficiency is plotted in the Fig. 6 for the GA strategy with cell
based contention, for variable threshold and normalized offered loads 0.62 and 0.75.
The Scheduling Inefficiency is higher for lower offered load and for lower values of
the threshold, because many GTO’s are allocated to the active queues that may not
have an entire cell available for upstream transmission. The Scheduling Inefficiency
assumes high values for P2 and even more for P3, because the number of sources
concurrently active at one instant is likely to interrupt for a long period the
allocation of CTO’s and the UCS allocates more GTO’s than those actually
needed.
Figure 6. Scheduling inefficiency as a function of the threshold value
The average Contention Delay is plotted in the Fig. 7 for the GA strategy. For
P1 the Contention Delay is equal to a few slots and lower than the inter-cell time at
the source peak rate, whatever the offered load is. This is also true for P2, with the
exception of the case 22 queues are established, and is not true for P3 that stresses
the different behaviors of the slot based and the minislot based contention. Again,
the reason is the long persistency of the period in which A is larger than the
threshold and the resulting increase in the number of queues waiting for a CTO to
notify their activation. It is anyway worth highlighting that the Contention Delay
for E = 22 is about 2 cell times for P2 and less than 3 cell times for P3.
The difference between the minislot based contention and the slot based
contention is magnified by the histogram plotted in the Fig. 8 for P1 and P3, for
the default value of the threshold and normalized offered load equal to 0.62. This
figure shows also the impact of the system latency, due only to the transmission
time because the propagation delay is set to zero: the Contention Delay may only
assume odd values because every CTO is always followed by either a GTO or an
empty slot, to guarantee that the BS has received the contending data units before
issuing a new CTO.

119
Figure 7. Minislot based vs. Slot based contention: Contention Delay
The Fig. 9 plots the Cell Loss Ratio for B=30 and B=70, for the default value of
the threshold and for the slot based contention. The role played by B is evident and
makes it one of the key design parameters for non real time traffic. The Cell Loss
Ratio of P2 and P3 tends to very low values for low to high offered load and is
significant only for very high offered load. The Cell Loss Ratio of P1 is acceptable
only for low to medium values of the offered load because this profile presents tight
service requirements that cannot be easily accommodated by the round robin
scheduling, as explained above.
Figure 8. Minislot vs. Slot contention: histogram of the Contention Delay

120
Figure 9. Short vs. long MAC level buffer: Cell Loss Ratio
The second group of simulations compare the FA and the GA strategies. No
significant differences emerge between the Cell Loss Ratio (see the Fig. 10) for the
low number of contending queues. This is confirmed by the fact that a CI has
average duration of about 1 slot and, so, the operation of the GA strategy becomes
equivalent to that of the FA strategy.
Figure 10. Free Access vs. Gated Access: Cell Loss Ratio
The Admission Delay decreases with the increase of the threshold (see the
Fig. 11) because this entails the allocation of shorter sequences of consecutive
GTO’s, for any offered load. Conversely, the FA strategy entails slightly higher

121
Contention Delay (see the Fig. 12) because the on-the-fly contention admission
may interfere with an in progress contention attempt.
Figure 11. Free Access vs. Gated Access: Admission Delay (variable threshold)
Figure 12. Free Access vs. Gated Access: Contention Delay (default threshold)
To conclude, the performance results collected so far and discussed in this
section show that the rationale behind DACS seems worth of consideration but
several issues are yet to be solved before it can be considered an appropriate
solution for the MAC protocol in wireless ATM networks. The key open issue is
to find a balance between the simplicity of the proposed mechanisms, able to
operate without any coordination to the ATM protocols and thus providing a true

122
low overhead solution, and their actual ability in meeting the quality of service
requirements negotiated at the ATM layer. A connection-oriented approach would
allow a higher level of compliance to these requirements, at the expense of a higher
design complexity. Alternatively, it may be appropriate to rely on a more complex
piggybacking scheme, like the notification of the current backlog size at the Best
Effort MAC queues; this entails anyway a larger overhead than the binary scheme
here considered. Then, a heuristic to place the threshold is to be found to deal
effectively with the large spectrum of source profile. Last, the simple two cell stack
algorithm does not behave properly if the number of contending queues is high: in
this case alternative approaches are required and some of them are being evaluated at
the moment of writing this paper.

ABSTRACT1
This paper addresses the location management problem in wireless ATM
(Asynchronous Transfer Mode) networks based on the PNNI (Private Network-to-
Network Interface) standard. There are two approaches to performing location
management: the “mobile computing” approach and the “cellular telephony”
approach. In this paper we present two mobile location management algorithms, the
mobile PNNI scheme and the LR (Location Register) scheme, for wireless ATM
networks. The mobile PNNI scheme represents the “mobile computing” approach and
builds on the PNNI routing protocol. It uses limited-scope (characterized by a
parameter S) reachability updates, forwarding pointers and a route optimization
procedure. The LR scheme represents the “cellular telephony” approach and
introduces location registers (such as the cellular home and visitor location registers)
into the PNNI standards-based hierarchical networks. This scheme uses a hierarchical
arrangement of location registers with the hierarchy limited to a certain level S. A
comparison of the two schemes indicates that at low CMRs (Call-to-Mobility Ratios),
the LR scheme incurs a lower average total cost (consisting of the average move and
average search costs) than the mobile PNNI scheme, while at high CMRs, the mobile
PNNI scheme incurs a lower cost. We also observe that the two schemes show a
contrasting behavior in terms of the value to be used for the parameter S to achieve
the least average total cost. At low CMRs, the parameter S should be high for the
mobile PNNI scheme, but low for the LB scheme, and vice versa for high CMRs.

INTRODUCTION
Mobility management algorithms enable networks to support mobile users allowing
them to move, while simultaneously offering them incoming calls, data packets and/
or other services. In connection-oriented networks, mobility management consists of
location management and handoff management. Handoff management deals with
rerouting connections, on which the mobile user was communicating while moving,
with minimal degradation of quality of service. Location management deals with
tracking mobiles and locating them prior to establishing an incoming call. Location
management schemes provide mechanisms to track and locate mobiles. The two
aspects of this problem, mobile tracking and mobile locating, are also referred to as
MOVE  and  FIND  operations, respectively in [1][2]. Mobile tracking is the procedure
by which the network elements update information about the location of the mobile.
Mobile location is the procedure by which the network finds the exact location of the
mobile. The information acquired during the tracking phase is used in the locating
phase.
Since both ATM networks and cellular telephony networks are connection-ori-
ented, the IS-41 and GSM MAP (Mobility Application Part) standards [3][4] offer a
natural starting point for the design of location management algorithms in ATM net-
works. On the other hand, the PNNI (Private Network-to-Network Interface) routing
protocol standard proposed by the ATM Forum [5], for propagating network topol-
ogy, loading, and reachability information, is also a candidate starting point for an
ATM location management algorithm.
Using these two starting points, we propose two algorithms for location manage-
ment in PNNI standards-based ATM networks. In the first algorithm, we add features
to the PNNI routing protocol to enable it to handle mobile users. We refer to this solu-
tion as the mobile  PNNI  scheme. In the second algorithm, we introduce location reg-
isters of the type used in cellular telephony networks, into the PNNI standards-based
ATM networks. These location registers are databases that track mobile locations and
respond to location queries. This solution is referred to as the  LR (Location Registers)
scheme.
We review prior work on location management in Section 2. Next, we describe
the proposed mobile  PNNI scheme  and the proposed  LR scheme  in Section 3. A dis-
cussion of these two schemes based on an analytical comparison [6] is included in
Section 4. Our conclusions are presented in Section 5.

PRIOR WORK
There are two approaches to performing location management: the “cellular tele-
phony” approach and the “mobile computing” approach. The cellular IS-41 MAP
(Mobility Application Part) standard [3] and several improvements proposed in [1, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11] are representatives of the cellular telephony approach, and mobile IP [12,
13] is a representative of the mobile computing approach.
Fig. 1 shows the cellular network architecture and the mobile tracking scheme
defined in the IS-41 standard. The network elements consist of BS (base stations),
MSCs (Mobile Switching Centers), VLRs (Visitor Location Registers) and HLRs

125
(Home Location Registers). Base stations provide wireless access to mobiles. MSCs
are the switching centers through which connections to and from mobiles are made.
HLRs and VLRs track the location of mobiles and answer queries for mobile loca-
tions. The cellular standards allow for a variation of this network architecture in
which VLRs are collocated with the MSCs.
Mobile tracking begins with mobiles generating registrations to the network. For
the purposes of this paper, we assume that power-on, power-off, and zone-change
registrations are generated by each mobile. The power-on (and power-off) registra-
tions allow the network to maintain a list of mobiles enabled to receive calls. Zone-
change registrations allow the network to track a mobile user as he/she moves from
one zone to the next as illustrated in Fig. 1, where a zone is defined to include all the
base stations under an MSC. Each base station emits a periodic broadcast beacon car-
rying the zone identifier of the base station. This allows a listening mobile to identify
when it moves into a new zone. An effect of this form of tracking is that a page needs
to be generated by the MSC to determine the exact base station at which a mobile is
located during call setup. In Fig. 1, when a user moves from base station 1 to base sta-
tion 2, it does not generate a registration, since both base stations are in the same
zone. A zone-change registration is sent by the mobile when the user moves from
base station 2 to base station 3. REGNOTs (Registration Notifications) are generated
from MSCs to VLRs, and from VLRs to HLRs (only if the VLR changes) as shown in
Fig. 1.
To deliver an incoming call to a mobile, the calling party’s switch (originating
switch) sends a LOCREQ (Location Request) message to the HLR of mobile. The
HLR sends a ROUTEREQ (Route request) to the VLR from which it received the last
registration message for mobile and the VLR in turn sends it to the MSC. The MSC
allocates a TLDN (Temporary Location Directory Number) for this mobile and
returns this value in its response. Routing of the connection through the network is
done using the TLDN which indicates the far end MSC (of the called mobile). When

126
the call setup message reaches the MSC of the called mobile, the MSC issues a page
to locate the exact base station at which the mobile is located. If VLRs and MSCs are
collocated, then the message exchange between the VLR and the MSC is avoided.
However, HLRs experience a heavier registration (tracking) load.
Among the improvements proposed to this scheme are the extremes of the “flat”
scheme [8, 9] and the “hierarchical” scheme [10, 11]. The former proposes using a
single-level hierarchy of location registers, while the latter proposes building a rooted
tree of location registers. In the flat scheme, upon receiving a LOCREQ, the HLR
assigns a temporary address (TLDN) based on the VLR/MSC at which the called
mobile is located rather than require an additional message exchange from the HLR
to the VLR/MSC to obtain a temporary address assignment. The mobile’s permanent
address is tunnelled in the call setup message while the temporary address is used to
route the connection from the call originating switch to the mobile’s current switch
(see Fig. 3). The hierarchical scheme uses a hierarchy of location registers to localize
both mobile tracking and mobile locating messages. A registration is propagated up
the hierarchy until it reaches a location register beyond which there is no change of
information regarding the mobile’s location. The call setup message (or an explicit
location query) is sent up the hierarchy until it reaches a location register that knows
the location of the mobile from which point the hierarchy is traced in the downward
direction to reach (or determine) the exact switch where the mobile is located. Fig. 4
shows the network architecture assumed in the hierarchical scheme. If the mobile,
whose home is node 1, moves to node K, a chain of pointers are set up as shown in
Fig. 4 from the home node (node 1) to node K. If an endpoint at node L calls the
mobile, node L sends a call setup message to node M (in the direction of the home
node of the mobile). Since node M has a pointer for the mobile (indicating node K), it
sets up a connection to node K. Thus, long-distance signaling is avoided by using this
chain of pointers to cut short searches.
The flat scheme results in lower computation costs but incurs larger communica-

127
tion costs than the cellular scheme, while the hierarchical scheme achieves the oppo-
site (lower communication costs, but higher computation costs). Other improved
schemes, such as the forwarding scheme of [1] and the anchor scheme of [7], are in
between these two extreme schemes in terms of computation and communication
costs. In contrast, the Location Registers (LR) scheme for wireless ATM networks is a
hybrid scheme whose parameters can be set to default to one of the two improved
schemes, i.e., the flat scheme or the hierarchical scheme. It essentially uses a hierar-
chy of location registers but limits the hierarchy by lopping off the tree at some level
S, beyond which it resorts to the flat scheme approach of updating/consulting a home
location register.
Other related work on location management includes mobile IP [12, 13] with
caching and route optimization extensions [14]. Mobile IP is an extension to the Inter-
net Protocol (IP), which enables hosts to change their point of attachment to the inter-
net with out changing their IP address. In this protocol, a packet for a mobile host is
routed to the home network of the mobile as identified by its permanent IP address.
The home network tracks the current location of the mobile and tunnels the packet to
the current network of the mobile. In order to prevent this “triangle” routing, route
optimization extensions have been proposed [14]. These extensions provide a means
for communicating-nodes to maintain a binding between the mobile and its current
location, and use this binding to tunnel datagrams directly to mobile. Extensions are
also provided to allow datagrams in flight when a mobile node moves, and datagrams
sent based on an outdated binding information, to be forwarded directly to the mobile.

PROPOSED LOCATION MANAGEMENT SCHEMES
In this section, we present two location management schemes for wireless ATM
networks. We propose both location management schemes for ATM networks based
on the PNNI standards [5].
The first scheme enhances the PNNI routing protocol to handle mobile users, and
is referred to as the mobile PNNI scheme. The PNNI routing protocol provides a fea-
ture to convey reachability information about the endpoints to ATM switches. This
feature is exploited with minimal change to convey reachability information about
mobile endpoints. In order to limit the region of nodes that receive reachability
updates as mobiles move, the “scope” parameter (set to some number S) available in
PNNI routing protocol messages is used. In this scheme, there is no explicit mobile
location phase prior to connection setup. Instead, connections are set up to mobiles
according to the reachability information at the switches. Switches within the region
defined by S (relative to the position of each mobile) have the correct reachability
information for mobiles. Calls originating from such switches will be routed on
“shortest paths.” However, calls originating at switches outside the region defined by
S will be routed toward the home switch of the mobile, and subsequently forwarded
to the current location of the mobile. This requires a procedure for setting and updat-
ing forwarding pointers at the home switch of the mobile, and creates the need for a
procedure to optimize the routes of calls set up on circuitous routes.
The second scheme isolates the effect of mobility from the PNNI routing protocol.
The cellular concept of using location registers to handle mobile users is introduced

128
into PNNI standards-based ATM networks. Location registers (databases) are placed
within the peer group structure of these ATM networks. In this approach, location
registers track the location of mobiles, and respond to location queries generated prior
to connection setup. Thus, unlike the mobile PNNI scheme, the second approach,
named the LR (Location Registers) scheme, has an explicit mobile location phase
prior to connection setup.
3.1
Mobile PNNI scheme
We first give an overview of the PNNI routing protocol in Section 3.1.1 to show how
fixed endpoints are supported in networks based on the PNNI standards. Next, we
describe our proposal for supporting mobile endpoints in such networks. In Section
3.1.2, we describe the architectural addition needed to support mobile endpoints. In
Section 3.1.3, we describe the mobile tracking procedure. Section 3.1.4 describes how
incoming calls to mobiles are set up using this location management scheme. Finally,
route optimization is briefly addressed in Section 3.15.
3.1.1
Overview of the PNNI routing protocol
PNNI standards-based ATM networks are arranged in hierarchical peer groups as
shown in Fig. 5. At the lowest level (l = L ), ATM switches are shown connected in
arbitrary topologies. A PGL (Peer Group Leader) is elected in each peer group. This
node represents the peer group at the next higher-level peer group. In this role, it is
termed the LGN (Logical Group Node) representing its lower-level peer group.
Nodes within a peer group exchange detailed PTSPs (PNNI Topology State Packets)
and hence have complete information of the peer group topology and loading condi-
tions. A PGL summarizes topology/loading information received in its peer group,
and generates PTSPs in its role as LGN to members of the higher-level peer group.
Each member of the higher-level peer group receiving this summarized information
will send information to members of its child peer group (downward flow). This
exchange of topology and loading information constitutes the PNNI routing protocol
[5]. Using this mechanism, each node in the network has the complete topology/load-
ing information of its lowest-level peer group, and also the topology/loading informa-

129
tion of its ancestor peer groups. This information is used to determine routes of
connections when a call arrives.
As part of the PTSPs, reachability information is propagated among nodes to
indicate where endpoints are located. Endpoint addressing in the ATM Forum stan-
dards is based on the NSAP (Network Service Access Point) addressing format [15].
All three forms of NSAP addressing support hierarchical addressing, where the pre-
fix of the address indicates the peer group in which the endpoint is located. A switch
will have exact reachability information for endpoints within its level-L peer group
indicating the switch at which each such endpoint is located. However, for endpoints
in other level-L peer groups, the switch will only know the higher-level peer group
through which the endpoints can be reached. PTSPs carrying reachability updates
also propagate up and down the hierarchy as explained earlier for the PTSPs carrying
the topology and loading information. Reachability information advertised by a node
has a scope associated with it. The scope denotes a level in the PNNI hierarchy and
represents the highest level at which this address can be advertised or summarized
[5].
As an example of a PNNI based network, consider the network shown in Fig. 5.
The numbering scheme used for the nodes reflects the peer group structure. Node
A.1.4 belongs to peer group A.1 at level 2, and to peer group A at level 1. Node A.1.4
is the peer group leader of peer group A.1. It advertises that all A.1 nodes are reach-
able through itself in peer group A. Upon receiving this advertisement, LGN A.2
sends a PTSP to all its lower-level nodes. Using this process, nodes in A.2, such as
A.2.1 and A.2.2, learn that all A.1 endpoints are reachable through A.1. Similarly,
nodes A.2.1 and A.2.2 learn that all nodes with the address prefix B are reachable
through LGN B, since they maintain the topology, loading conditions and reachabil-
ity data for all their ancestor peer groups.
3.1.2
Architecture to support mobile endpoints
Mobile endpoints can be supported in the PNNI hierarchical architecture in the
following manner. Mobiles are located at base stations, which are assumed to be
organized as in cellular networks, with multiple base stations connected to each
switch as shown in Fig. 6. The set of all the base stations under a single switch is
defined to be a zone. The concept of zones are used to limit air interface registration
traffic. Instead of tracking the exact base station at which each mobile is located, the
network tracks the zone locations of mobiles. This is done using zone-change
registrations1. The configuration shown in Fig. 6 ties in with the architecture of Fig. 5
at the lowest level. In other words, some of the switches in Fig. 5 are connected to a
set of base stations as shown in Fig. 6. Besides zone-change registrations, mobiles are

130
assumed to generate power-up and power-down registrations allowing a network to
track only powered mobiles.
3.1.3
Mobile tracking
When a mobile powers on or changes locations (moves), the mobile tracking pro-
cedure uses a combination of setting forwarding pointers at the home and old (in case
of a move) locations of the mobile, and sending limited reachability updates (with a
scope S) using the PNNI routing protocol to track the location of the mobile. For-
warding pointers are set at the home in order to route the calls generated by nodes
outside the neighborhood (defined by scope S), and at the old location (in case of a
move) of the mobile to route calls generated prior to the complete propagation of the
reachability information updates (resulting from the move).
Setting of forwarding pointers: If the registration received from the mobile
(through the base station) is a power-up registration, then the switch receiving the
registration sends a message to the home switch of the mobile. A pointer is set at the
home to point to the current location. When a mobile moves, if the old location is out-
side the neighborhood (defined by scope S) of the new location, the forwarding
pointer at the home is updated to point to the new location. A forwarding pointer is
set at the old location of the mobile before distributing reachability updates to handle
any calls that arrive prior to the propagation of reachability information. If the old
location is within the neighborhood of the new location, the forwarding pointer at the
old switch is set to point to the new location. For example, consider the mobile
B.1.1.5 located under a base station connected to its home B.1.1 as shown in Fig. 7.
Let S = 3. If the mobile moves to a base station under switch B.1.2, then a Registra-
tion message will be sent from B.1.2 to B.1.1 (as shown in Fig. 7). Further, if it moves
to B.3.1, two Registrations are sent to set forwarding pointers at home and old loca-
tions (B.1.1 and B.1.2, respectively) of the mobile. The pointer at the old location can
be deleted after the updated reachability information has reached all the intended
nodes. In an implementation, this pointer can be deleted after a certain amount of time
(with the help of a timer).
Reachability updates: After setting forwarding pointers, the feature of sending
triggered updates of topology information for significant change events in the PNNI
1. Each base station emits a periodic broadcast beacon carrying the zone identifier of the base sta-
tion. This allows a listening mobile to identify when it moves into a new zone.

131
routing protocol is used to generate reachability updates. The scope S, as explained
earlier, is used to set the stopping point for reachability information propagation. If a
mobile powers on at a node within the neighborhood (defined by scope S) of its
home, the reachability updates will propagate only up to some level K, beyond which
there is no change of reachability data. For example, in Fig. 5, if S = 2 and a mobile
A.1.1.5 powers on at A.1.2, the reachability updates only propagate to nodes in peer
group A.1. No PTSP is sent from A.1 to A.2, since there is no change of reachability
data stored in A.2 nodes regarding mobile A.1.1.5. If a mobile powers on at a node
outside its home neighborhood, the reachability updates propagate up to level S. For
example, in Fig. 5, if S = 2, reachability updates for a mobile A.1.1.5 that powers on
at a base station connected to node A.2.2 will spread through peer group A.2, and
then upwards (i.e., PTSPs carrying the reachability updates are sent from A.2 to all
nodes of peer group A) and finally, downwards from LGNs in peer group A other
than A.2 to their child peer groups. As mobiles move, if the old location is within the
neighborhood of the new location of the mobile, reachability updates are sent up to
some level K, beyond which there is no change of reachability data. If not, it spreads
up to level S from the new location of the mobile. In addition, a reachability update
procedure is initiated by the old switch to notify all the nodes within a region S rela-
tive to the old switch that the reachability of the mobile is now through its home.
Details regarding how registration messages are transported are two-fold. First,
each mobile maintains the identifiers of its old and home switches, allowing it to
communicate this information when registering at a switch (power-on, power-off or
move). This information is used by the new switch to generate the registration mes-
sage to the home or old switch. Second, we assume the availability of connectionless
transport to send location management messages, such as registrations. One such
transport mechanism is connectionless ATM (CL-ATM) proposed in [16]. Without
this assumption, on-demand connections would need to be set up and released for the
transport of every Registration message, which creates a considerable processing and
signaling overhead.
3.1.4
Connection Setup/Mobile locating
In the mobile PNNI approach, there is no explicit mobile location procedure prior
to connection setup. Instead, connection setup proceeds with every switch “believ-
ing” its reachability information. Therefore, if the calling party is within the neigh-
borhood (defined by scope S) of the called mobile’s location, since all the switches on
the path have correct reachability information, the call is delivered directly to the
mobile. If the calling party is outside the neighborhood of the mobile, since the reach-
ability information in the switches outside the neighborhood indicate that the mobile
is at its home, the call setup proceeds towards the home. In this case, the following
two scenarios are possible: i) called mobile is within the neighborhood of its home, or
ii) mobile is outside the neighborhood of its home.
If the called mobile is within the neighborhood of its home, the call is delivered
directly to the mobile as illustrated in the following example. Consider that A.1.1.1
issues a call setup to the mobile B.3.1.4, currently located at B.1.2 (as shown in Fig.
8). The call setup proceeds through peer groups A.1 and A.2 and arrives at peer group

132
B (at a node B.1.1, which is in the peer group B) since the reachability information in
the nodes of peer group A indicate that the mobile is in its home peer group (B). Once
the call setup message arrives at peer group B, it is routed efficiently to B.1.2, if S, the
scope of limited reachability updates is 2, in which case all the nodes in the peer
group B have the correct reachability information. Note that, if the call setup arrives
at a switch before it is updated with the correct reachability information about the
mobile, then the call is set up to the old location, which, then forwards the call to the
current location. For example, consider the situation in which the mobile B.3.1.4 has
just moved from B.3.1 to B.1.2. If the call setup arrives at switch B.1.1 before B.1.1 is
updated with reachability information for the mobile endpoint B.3.1.4, then switch
B.1.1 may choose1 {B.1.1, B.1.4, B.2, B.3} as the shortest path by which to reach
peer group B.3 based on its current reachability information for mobile B.3.1.4
(which points toward B.3). In this case, the connection route will be inefficient as
shown in Fig. 8 (with the arrows indicating the connection route).
If the called mobile is outside the neighborhood of its home, the call setup pro-
ceeds to the home of the called mobile, which then forwards the call towards the cur-
rent location of the called mobile. For example, consider that S=3, and a call setup
request to B.3.1.4 is generated by an endpoint attached to switch B.2.1. Since S=3 ,
the B.2 nodes are not updated about the move of mobile B.3.1.4 from B.3.1 to B.1.2.
Hence, the connection will be inefficiently routed to the home and then to the new
location (from B.2.1 to B.3.1, back to B.2.1, and then to B.1.2). The above two exam-
ples illustrate that if a call setup request for a mobile arrives between the time instant
a mobile moved and the time instant that the reachability update is complete, or if it is
generated in a node outside the neighborhood of the called mobile and the called
mobile is not in its home neighborhood, it may be set up on a circuitous path. If the
called mobile is within its home neighborhood or is in the neighborhood of the calling
party, then this location management scheme results in the shortest possible connec-
tion.
3.1.5
Route optimization
As shown in the examples of Section 3.1.4, connections may be inefficiently
routed due to a lack of correct reachability information. Therefore, route optimization
needs to be performed. Route optimization consists of two steps. First, a "switchover

nection through that peer group.

133
node" at which the connection is to be rerouted from the old path to the new path is
found, and a new segment is set up from the route optimization-initiating switch to
the switchover node. Second, using "Tail" signals, user data is switched over from the
old path to the new path without loss of cell sequence [17, 18]. Details of the route
optimization scheme are presented in [19].
3.2
Location Registers (LR) scheme
In this scheme, the PNNI routing protocol reachability information is disregarded
for mobile endpoints. Instead, an explicit tracking and locating procedure is overlaid
on a PNNI based network using location registers. The LR scheme architecture, the
mobile tracking procedure and the mobile locating procedure are defined in the fol-
lowing subsections.
3.2.1
LR scheme architecture
Fig. 9 shows hierarchically-organized location registers (LRs). The switches are
represented by circles. Location registers only exist from level L up to some level S
(as explained in Section 2, we lop off the tree at level S). We make an assumption that
each peer group is assumed to have one LR. This assumption can be relaxed and mul-
tiple LRs may be located in each peer group. This is effectively equivalent to creating
a sublayer under the lowest layer of switches, and applying the same concept of allo-
cating one LR per peer group of this new sublayer.
Location register A.1.L (we use the .L extension to avoid confusing this node with
the A.1 logical node shown in Fig. 5 for the mobile PNNI scheme) is assumed to track
all mobiles attached to switches within peer group A.1 (i.e., mobiles located at base
stations connected to switches A.1.1, A.1.2, A.1.3 and A.1.4). Similarly, A.2.L is
assumed to track all mobiles located at base stations connected to switches A.2.1 and
A.2.2. A home LR is assigned to a mobile based on its permanent address, e.g. A.1.L

134
is the home LR of the mobile A.1.2.3.
The hierarchy of location registers helps localize mobile tracking and locating
costs. However, if the hierarchy is carried to the topmost level (l = 1) as in the hier-
archical scheme of [10], the processing requirements could be high. If computation
costs are more than communication costs, it is more expensive to stop and process
REGNOT (Registration Notification) or LOCREQ (Location Request) at each LR in
the hierarchy, than to send one such request as a connectionless message to the home.
Hence, we limit the hierarchy to level S and resort to the flat scheme approach of
updating and/or querying the home LR of the mobile (see Section 2). However, if the
home LR were to track the lowest level (l = L) LR currently tracking the mobile as
in the flat scheme, the long-distance signaling costs of updating or querying the home
LR would be high. Hence, the home LR only tracks the S
th level LR for each mobile,
and only receives location queries if none of the LRs up to level S of the calling
mobile’s switch can respond to the query. The parameter S allows the LR scheme to
be flexibly implemented as a flat structure, or as a rooted hierarchical tree, or as a
mixed structure combining these extremes.
3.2.2
Mobile tracking
When a mobile powers on, the switch connected to its base station receives a
power-on registration message. This switch sends a REGNOT (Registration Notifica-
tion) to its LR at level L. This, in turn, causes REGNOTs to be generated to the
ancestor LRs upstream up to an LR at level S. If the visiting switch is distinct from
the home switch, the LR at level S sends a REGNOT to notify the home LR of the
mobile that the mobile is currently in its domain. REGNOTs are sent as connection-
less packets using the ATM NSAP address of the mobile as the destination [16]. The
home LRs of all mobiles visiting at switches other than their home switch track the
S th  level LR of the mobile in its current location. Power-off registrations are handled
in a similar manner as power-on, whereby LRs up to level S are informed that a
mobile powered off, and if the mobile was visiting (away from home), its home LR is
also notified.
Next consider zone-change registrations, which are generated as mobiles move
from a base station connected to one switch to a base station connected to another
switch. The hierarchy of LRs is exploited to limit the propagation of registration
information for such movements. On receiving the registration message, the new
switch sends a REGNOT message to its level L LR. This, in turn propagates the
REGNOT message upwards up to the LR which is a common ancestor of the LR cor-
responding to the old switch and the LR corresponding to the new switch, or up to
level S, whichever is lower in the hierarchy (higher in numerical value). A message
is sent by the new switch to the old switch, informing the old switch about the move-
ment of the mobile. The old switch then generates a REGCANC (Registration Can-
cellation), which is sent to its level L LR. This, in turn is propagated upwards,
cancelling the old information in the LRs. If the S
th level LR tracking the mobile
changes due to the move, then the home LR of the mobile is updated.
For example, if the mobile A.1.1.4, shown in Fig. 9, moves to a base station con-
nected to switch A.1.2, only LR A.1.L needs to be updated. One cancellation is

135
required at the switch. On the other hand, if it moves from switch A.1.1 to a switch
A.2.2, then REGNOTs are sent to LR A.2.L from switch A.2.2, and subsequently
from LR A.2.L to LR A.L, since LR A.L is the common-ancestor LR of the LRs cor-
responding to the old and new switches. Since the LR at level S (A.L) did not
change, there is no REGNOT sent to the home LR of the mobile. However, a cancel-
lation message is sent from A.2.2 to A.1.1, which in turn generates a REGCANC
from A.1.1 to A.1.L. Finally, if the mobile moves from switch A.2.2 to switch B.1.1,
REGNOTs propagate from switch B.1.1 to LR B.1.L, and then to LR B.L. Since there
is a change in the S th level LR tracking the mobile, LR B.L notifies home LR A.1.L.
In addition, a REGCANC is generated by B.1.1 to A.2.2, which passes upwards to LR
A.2.L, and then to A.L.
3.2.3 
Mobile Locating
To find a mobile prior to call setup, a chain of location registers is traced. The
length of the chain depends on the location of the calling party and the current loca-
tion of the mobile. The called party’s switch begins by checking to see if the called
mobile is located at a base station in its domain. If so, it completes the call without
generating any LOCREQs (Location Requests).
If the called mobile is not located at a base station within its domain, it generates a
LOCREQ to its LR. Such requests are forwarded upwards in the hierarchy of LRs. If
an LR at some level k has information (pointer to a child LR) regarding the location
of the mobile, then it sends LOCREQs downwards toward the called mobile’s current
location. The location query will be resolved by the level L LR of the switch at
which the called mobile is located, and the response will be sent directly to the calling
party’s switch.
If, however, none of the LRs, from the level L LR of the calling party’s switch to
the S th level LR know the location of the called mobile as shown in Fig. 10, the S th
level LR sends a LOCREQ to the home LR of the called mobile. The called mobile’s
home switch will then forward this message to the home LR of the mobile. Since the
home LR tracks the S
th level LR of its mobiles, it forwards the LOCREQ to the  Sth
level LR tracking the mobile in its current location. This LR generates downward
LOCREQs according to the information it has about the called mobile. The LOCREQ
will reach the level L LR of the called mobile’s switch. The response is sent directly
from this LR to the calling party’s switch as shown in Fig. 10. The address tunnelling
concept of the flat scheme described in Section 2 is also used in the LR scheme.
As examples, we consider call originations from three endpoints, B.2.2.5, B.1.1.5
and A.2.2.5, all targeted at mobile A.1.2.3 (see Fig. 9). In the first example, when
switch B.2.2 generates a LOCREQ for mobile A.1.2.3 to its LR B.2.L, the latter can
immediately respond since the called mobile A.1.2.3 is located within its region. In
the second example, switch B.1.1 sends the LOCREQ (in response to the call setup
request from its endpoint B.1.1.5 to mobile A.1.2.3) to its LR B.1.L. Since it has no
pointer regarding this mobile, it simply generates a LOCREQ to the higher-level LR
B.L. This register has a pointer indicating that B.2.L is tracking the mobile. Hence a
LOCREQ is sent to this LR. Since B.2.L is the level L  LR for the called mobile, it
responds indicating that the mobile is located at switch B.2.1. This response is sent

136
directly to switch B.1.1 (instead of retracing the pointers backwards) allowing it to
initiate call setup to the called mobile’s switch. In the third example, where endpoint
A.2.2.5 generates the call setup to mobile A.1.2.3, the LOCREQ sent by switch A.2.2
traverses the chain of LRs, A.2.L and A.L. Since neither of these LRs have informa-
tion on the location of the called mobile and S = 2, A.L sends a LOCREQ to the
home LR of the called mobile A.1.L. This LR forwards the LOCREQ to LR B.L,
since each home LR tracks the S
th level LR of its mobiles. LOCREQs are then sent
downwards from B.L to LR B.2.L, which responds with a temporary address for the
mobile indicating that the mobile is located at switch B.2.1.
4. DISCUSSION
A comparative study of the tracking and locating costs (move and search costs) of the
two schemes using analytical models is presented in [6]. Based on this study, we
provide a qualitative comparison of the two schemes in this section. We also discuss
the effect of key parameters of these algorithms, such as S, the reachability update
limiting scope, which is also the highest-level of the hierarchy of location registers in
the LR scheme, h, the cost of “long-distance” signaling (needed to characterize the
cost of setting forwarding pointers at the home and old switch in the mobile PNNI
scheme and updating or querying the home location registers in the LR scheme, if
outside the scope S of the sender), and CMR (Call-to-Mobility Ratio).
Tracking cost in the mobile PNNI scheme depends on the cost of updating reach-
ability information, and the cost of sending messages to the home and the old loca-
tions of the mobile. Tracking cost in the LR scheme depends on the cost of updating
location registers, and the cost of sending messages to the home and the old locations
of the mobile. Both the cost to update and the cost to send messages depend on the
relative distances between the old, new, and the home locations of the mobile, and the
value of S.
Search cost in the mobile scheme is not easily quantified since there is no explicit
mobile location phase in the mobile PNNI scheme. However, since some of the con-
nections are first established on non-optimal routes, we consider the number of extra
hops needed to route forwarded connections as the “search cost” associated with the
mobile PNNI scheme. Thus, the search cost depends on the relative positions of the

137
calling party, called party, and the called party’s home. If the mobile (called party) is
with in scope S from its home or the calling party is with in scope S from the
mobile, then the mobile PNNI search cost is zero (we expect this to hold for majority
of calls). As S decreases (lower in value) the extent to which the reachability infor-
mation is spread increases, therefore, the mobile PNNI search cost decreases. In the
LR scheme, there is an explicit mobile location phase. The search cost in the LR
scheme depends on the relative positions of the calling party, called party, and the
called party’s home. The search cost is small for all short distance calls, irrespective
of the location of the mobile (home or remote location).
Typically, the search cost of the LR scheme is more than the search cost of the
PNNI scheme. The intuitive explanation for this trend is that the LR scheme incurs a
search cost for all calls, whereas the PNNI scheme incurs a search cost only for a
small fraction of calls. In general, the tracking cost in the LR scheme is less compared
to the tracking cost of the mobile PNNI scheme. The intuitive explanation for this
trend is that in the LR scheme the number of databases to be updated is less compared
to the number of databases in the mobile PNNI scheme. From these trends, it can be
argued that the LR scheme performs better at lower CMRs, and the mobile PNNI
scheme perform better at higher CMRs.
A second level of comparison is to understand the behavior of the two schemes
relative to increasing CMR and S. As the value of S increases (the extent of spread
of the reachability updates decreases), the tracking cost in the PNNI scheme tends to
decrease and the locating cost tends to increase. Thus, in the mobile PNNI scheme, at
higher CMRs, a low value of S should be selected, while at low CMRs, high values
of S should be chosen. This is illustrated in Fig. 11. In the LR scheme, as the value of
S is increased (there are fewer levels of hierarchy), the search cost decreases and the
tracking cost increases. Thus, in the LR scheme, at higher CMRs, a high value of S
should be selected, while at low CMRs, low values of S should be chosen.
The trend shown in Fig. 11 is dependent on the value of the parameter h , which is
the cost of “long-distance” signaling. The trend shown in Fig. 11 is quantitatively
determined in [6] for a value of h that was determined as being of “medium range.”
We discuss the effect of different values of h on the move and search costs of the
two schemes in the following paragraphs.
Fig. 12 and Fig. 13 show the trend in the variation of the average move and search
costs in the two schemes, at different ranges of h (arrows pointing upward indicate
an increase in cost). These trends provide important information in helping us select
values of S , at which to operate the two schemes, for a given value of h. For the
mobile PNNI scheme, Fig. 12 shows that at “low and medium values” of h, the aver-
age move cost decreases with increasing S. However, at high values of h, the move
cost decreases with increase in S up to a value, Smax , as shown in Fig. 12, beyond

138
which it increases. At high values of S, the mobile moves out of scope S more fre-
quently than at low values of S . Since the home is updated, whenever the mobile
moves out of scope S from its current location, at high values of S, h becomes a sig-
nificant parameter. The search cost in the mobile PNNI scheme is not effected by the
value of h . Since the mobile PNNI scheme search cost increases monotonically with
increasing S , to minimize the average total cost, for the mobile PNNI scheme, the
values of S should be chosen such that S ≤ Smax.
The LR costs show a slightly different trend. At “low” values of h, the LR
scheme experiences decreasing average move and search costs with increasing S , at
“high” values of h , both costs increase with increasing S , and at “medium” values of
h , both costs first decrease and then increase, as shown in Fig. 13. The reason for

such behavior is that if h is small, the LR scheme should be operated more like the
“flat” scheme of Section 2, by choosing a large S. In other words, all nodes know the
home LRs of mobiles and directly send registrations and location queries to the home
LRs. At large values of h, the LR scheme should be operated more like the “hierar-
chical” scheme of Section 2, by making S equal to 1, since the best result (lowest
average total cost) is obtained at the smallest value of S. For the medium range of h,
the optimal value of S depends upon the CMR. In this range, the average move cost
decreases with increasing S up to S min, and the search cost decreases up to a value
of S = S
. The minimum value of average total cost is obtained for some value of
S that lies between S
max

139
In summary, there are three important parameters, S, the reachability update lim-
iting scope, which is also the highest-level of hierarchy in the LR scheme, h, the cost
of “long-distance” signaling, and CMR (Call-to-Mobility ratio). As to which location
management scheme incurs a lower average total cost, depends on these three param-
eters. Typically, at low values of h, operating the LR scheme at high values of S,
leads to a lower average total cost than the PNNI scheme. On the other hand, if the
cost of long-distance signaling h is high, either LR scheme or the mobile PNNI
scheme could lead to minimal average total cost, provided the correct value of S is
selected. For the mobile PNNI scheme, this depends on the CMR expected, but in the
LR scheme, one needs to select a low S (preferably S = 1). Finally, if h is in the
medium range (which we expect will be the range of operation), there will be a break-
point CMR below which the LR scheme will perform better, and above which the
PNNI mobile scheme will incur lower costs. A significant point to note is that for a
number of cases, for example, when mobiles are located close to their home locations
(which we expect will be a high-percentage), or if the calling party is close to the vis-
iting location of the called mobile, the mobile PNNI scheme incurs a zero search cost.
This leads to the mobile PNNI scheme performing better in most regions of operation
expected in low-tier (i.e., slowly moving users) PCS applications.
5. CONCLUSIONS
This paper presented two mobile location management algorithms for ATM networks
based on the PNNI (Private Network-to-Network Interface) standard. The first
solution is called the mobile PNNI scheme because it builds on the PNNI routing
protocol. It uses limited-scope (characterized by a parameter S) reachability updates,
forwarding pointers (setting and clearing of these pointers occur at a cost h) and a
route optimization procedure. The second solution is called the LR (Location
Registers) scheme because it introduces location registers (such as the cellular home
and visitor location registers) into the PNNI standards-based hierarchical networks.
This scheme uses a hierarchical arrangement of location registers with the hierarchy
limited to a certain level S. It also requires the update of home and old location
registers at a cost h.
Discussion of the effect of key parameters on the average move, search, and total
costs, of these two schemes for different values of the CMR (Call-to-Mobility Ratio)
is presented. This discussion provides guidelines for selecting the critical parameters
of these algorithms. It showed that at low CMRs, the LR scheme performs better than
the mobile PNNI scheme. We also observed that the two schemes show a contrasting
behavior in terms of the value to be used for the parameter S to achieve the least
average total cost. For the mobile PNNI scheme, the parameter S should be high at
low CMRs (within the range in which the mobile PNNI scheme should be used), and
low at high CMRs. However, in the LR scheme, the parameter S should be low at
low CMRs (within the range in which the LR scheme should be used), and high for
high CMRs. These observations are made for a region of operation in which h, the
cost of setting forwarding pointers and updating distant LRs, is of medium value. If
this cost is low, the LR scheme always outperforms the mobile PNNI scheme. For
other ranges of h, the scheme selected, and the S at which the scheme is operated,
depends on the CMR.

ABSTRACT
Future wired networks with an ATM backbone will need to support PCS and wireless
subscriber services. One of the key functions required to support PCS and wireless
subscribers with non-geographic phone numbers (NGPN) will be the ability to effi-
ciently identify which Home Location Register (HLR) database serves the subscriber.
(Note that the same functionality is also needed to serve subscribers with portable
phone numbers.) In a previous paper we have presented a scheme for NGPN trans-
lation based upon distributed, dynamic hashing. The scheme uses a hash function
in the Visitor Location Registers (VLR) and a set of distributed Translation Servers
(TS) which store the NGPN-to-HLR mapping.
In this paper we present a preliminary investigation of the additional call setup delay
introduced by the NGPN translation scheme we have proposed. We develop a queuing
network model for both the one-stage and two-stage versions of our NGPN translation
scheme, and we investigate the impact of two key aspects of our scheme, namely the
use of hashing and of caching. A poor choice of hash function can lead to imbalanced
loading at the TS. We quantify the impact of this imbalance for an example scenario.
We also show that caching at the VLR can substantially reduce the mean translation
delay. Finally we consider the use of the two-stage scheme and a second-level cache
when the translation load increases.

INTRODUCTION
One of the key functions required to support Personal Communications Services
(PCS) and wireless subscribers in PCS systems is mobility management, i.e.,

142
determining the location of a mobile user so that calls can be delivered to and
from that user. In current and proposed standards for PCS and cellular systems
a set of databases, called Home Location Registers (HLR) and Visitor Location
Registers (VLR), is used to maintain the information about the current location
of a user, and this information is consulted or updated whenever a user moves
across geographical regions called Registration Areas (RA), or when a call is
to be delivered to and from a user. For a tutorial on mobility management
procedures, see [7, 10].
This paper considers an issue that arises when two important trends in the
development of future PCS systems converge: (1) the use of high-speed ATM
networks for the fixed network backbone which supports mobile users, and
(2) the rise in the number of PCS users with non-geographic phone numbers
(NGPN), i.e., phone numbers which do not indicate the home geographical
region or the service provider of the mobile user. In this scenario, as part
of the mobility management procedures, it is important that the system be
able to efficiently translate the NGPN of a PCS subscriber to the identity of
the HLR which maintains the current location of the subscriber. In previous
work [5, 6] we have presented a scheme for NGPN translation which uses a
set of distributed Translation Servers (TS). In this paper we develop a model
for estimating the mean delay introduced by the NGPN translation scheme we
have proposed.
We begin by describing, in this section, the NGPN translation problem and
summarizing the solution we have proposed. In sec. 2 we describe our perfor-
mance model for the one-stage and two-stage versions of our NGPN translation
scheme, and in sec. 3 we demonstrate its application for an example scenario.
Finally, we end with some conclusions.
1.1
Background on NGPN Translation
The problem of NGPN translation is to determine the identity of the signal-
ing network database which serves a Personal Communications Services (PCS)
subscriber, when the only relevant information available is a non-geographic
phone number (NGPN).
Currently, fixed telephone subscribers are assigned a geographic phone number,
which contains enough information to determine how the signaling messages
required to set up a call to the subscriber are to be routed through the signaling
network. For proposed PCS systems, subscribers will be assigned NGPNs (e.g.,

143
1-500-XXX-XXXX), which do not contain this information; a process called
Global Title Translation (GTT) has been designed for this purpose [2, 4]. GTT
is executed at signaling switches called Signaling Transfer Points (STPs), and
essentially translates a subscriber’s NGPN to the identity of the Home Location
Register (HLR) database which serves that subscriber. For future PCS systems
in which the wired backbone is an ATM network, however, signaling traffic will
be likely to use the same physical transport as the user data traffic [3]. Thus
STPs may not be used for signaling and GTT cannot be performed [11].
NGPN translation is required in three situations:
1. When a PCS subscriber with a NGPN is called (by a fixed or PCS sub-
scriber), its HLR ID is required to set up the call.
2. In some implementations, NGPN translation may be required when a PCS
subscriber crosses Registration Areas (RAs) served by different VLRs,
since the ID of its serving HLR needs to be determined in order to up-
date the subscriber’s location information.
3. In some implementations, NGPN translation may also be required when
a PCS subscriber originates a call, in order to obtain authentication and
service profile information.
We will simplify the discussion by assuming that for all three cases above, the
NGPN is presented to a VLR, which has the burden of performing a translation
or obtaining a translation from other entities in the network, although it is
understood that for call delivery from wireline phones to PCS subscribers, the
operations may in fact have to be performed at a serving Service Control Point
(SCP) [1].
Clearly, the process of NGPN should be fast (in order to reduce overall call
setup time), efficient (in terms of signaling network and database loads), and
scalable (as the translation load increases.) Another key requirement is that
the process allow the NGPN-to-HLR mapping for any user to be changed easily
and efficiently, since the mapping may need to be changed any time the user
changes service providers, or if the service provider changes the HLR serving
that user (for performance or administrative reasons, e.g. if the user moves
permanently from one region of the country to another.) This requirement for
efficient mapping modification, along with the requirement for scalability, are
the main reasons that naive schemes for performing the NGPN translation do
not suffice, necessitating the scheme that we have developed.

The proposed NGPN translation scheme
In order to keep this document self-contained, the scheme presented in [5, 6] is
briefly described here.
One-stage NGPN Translation Scheme
We

first describe the one-stage version of the scheme [5]; see Fig. 1.
When any of the situations requiring NGPN translation occur, the non-
geographical PN is presented to a switch; depending upon the architecture
deployed, this may be a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) or Broadband
Wireless Switching Center (BWSC), or a Service Switching Point (SSP).
The switch forwards the NGPN to the VLR serving that switch. The VLR
performs a hash function upon the binary representation of the NGPN, to
obtain a value ƒ(NGPN), where ƒ is the hash function. This specifies

3.
145
the ID of an entity called a Translation Server (TS). Translation servers
are entities not present in current and proposed PCS architectures; they
were introduced for the purpose of NGPN translation. Note that TSs are
logical entities; physically they may be implemented as databases and be
co-located with HLRs.
The VLR launches a query to the TS specified by ƒ(NGPN), passing it
the value NGPN. The TS contains a table mapping the NGPN to the ID
of the HLR serving that NGPN.
4. The TS responds to the VLR by returning the HLR ID.
5. The VLR uses the HLR ID to continue with the registration, call delivery,
or call origination signaling operations as usual.
The VLR can maintain a cache of NGPN translations to avoid querying the
TS. Thus when presented with a NGPN for the first time, the VLR performs a
hash and queries the indicated TS to obtain the ID of the serving HLR. It then
stores the NGPN-to-HLR mapping for that NGPN in its cache. If presented
with the same NGPN a second time, the VLR can search its cache first. If
the mapping is found (a cache hit), a hash and a query to the TS is avoided;
otherwise (a cache miss), the VLR performs a hash and queries the TS as usual.
A simple example of the hash function, f, is the function even(), which returns
0 if the argument is even and 1 otherwise. Obviously, this function can only
be used if there are only two TSs. In addition, if the way in which NGPNs are
chosen is non-uniform (e.g., a disproportionate number of subscribers request
phone numbers ending in 0), the load on the two TSs will not be balanced;
similarly, if the service provider assigns NGPNs to new subscribers using some
administrative process which somehow introduces some non-uniformity, the
load on the TSs will not be balanced. The effect of load imbalance at the TSs
will be a factor we will consider in our model.
As we have discussed in [6], we believe the one-stage NGPN translation scheme
offers speed and efficiency, and the use of indirection (storing the NGPN-to-
HLR mapping in the TS) offers efficient mapping modification. In order to
improve scalability, we have proposed the use of a dynamic hashing method
which can be used if necessary to increase the number of TS as the translation
load grows.

 146
Two-Stage NGPN Translation Scheme
We have also presented a two-stage version of our NGPN translation scheme
in order to improve scalability (see Fig. 2). The two-stage translation scheme
is identical to the one-stage scheme described above as far as step 2, i.e., the
VLR applies the hash function ƒ and determines the identity of a TS. However,
step 3 is modified by introducing a second stage of TS, as follows:
3(a) The VLR launches a query to the TS specified by ƒ(NGPN), passing
it the value NGPN.
3(b) This first stage TS applies another hash function, g(NGPN), and
obtains the identity of a second stage TS.
3(c) The first-stage TS launches a query to the second-stage TS, passing
it the NGPN.
3(d) The second-stage TS contains a table mapping the NGPN to the ID
of the HLR serving that NGPN.
Step 4 for the two-stage scheme is identical to that for the one-stage scheme,
except that it is the the second-stage TS which responds to the VLR by return-
ing the HLR ID. Similar to the VLR cache, the first stage TS can maintain a
TS cache for speeding up the translation process.

PERFORMANCE MODEL
We have developed a queuing network model for estimating the delay entailed
by our proposed NGPN translation scheme. In this section we briefly describe
the model and its assumptions.
The model is developed for the two-stage NGPN translation scheme; by an ap-
propriate choice of parameters it models the one-stage scheme also. A schematic
diagram of the model is shown in Fig. 3, and a list of the parameters is shown
in the first two columns of Table 1.
The model focuses on the path taken by a single translation request as it arrives
at a given VLR, which we call VLR1, and travels to a selected TS, TS1, and
its second- stage TS, TS 1.1 . Referring to Fig. 3, translations arrive at VLR1

at a rate λ ; a fraction p 1 enjoy cache hits, i.e., are served immediately by
the cache and exit the system, while the remaining (1 – p1 )λ require further
processing.
Recall that a hash function is applied at the VLR, so that this
remaining traffic is (ideally) divided among all the T TSs in the system, i.e.,

(2)
In order to model the effect of load imbalance, the traffic from VLR1  t o
a selected TS, T S1, is given in terms of a load imbalance factor ƒ1 , where
1 ≤ ƒ 1  ≤ T . Thus, the traffic from VLR1 to T S1  is
and the
traffic from VLR1  to each of the other TSs is
Observe that this is a conservative model of load imbalance since only the load
from a single VLR is assumed to be split non-uniformly.
To keep Fig. 3 intelligible we do not show the model for traffic to the other
TSs; it is simply indicated in the oval marked “Traffic to other TS”. We assume
that an ATM Switched Virtual Circuit (SVC) connection setup is required to
forward the translation request, and on average, there are N switches between
the VLR and the (first-stage) TS, each of which has a mean service time of

149
1/µ sw . The traffic into the switches connecting VLR 1 and TS1 is λ ƒms , and
the traffic into the switches connecting VLR1 to the other TSs is λoms .
When the traffic from VLR 1 reaches the first-stage TSs, it is combined with
the traffic from all the other (V – 1) VLRs in the system, which we denote  λO .
We assume that all the other VLRs also have an incoming load of λ each, and
that the cache hit ratio is also p1 at each. Then, assuming that the load at the
other (V – 1) VLRs is perfectly balanced,
(3)
Thus the total traffic reaching the first-stage TS TS 1 from all the VLRs (in-
cluding VLR 1) is
while that reaching the other the first-stage
TSs is
The total traffic entering the first-stage TS can be satisfied directly by the cache
with hit probability p 2. The remaining traffic is assumed to be equally divided
amongst the second-level TSs, where 1/β ≥ 1 is the ratio of second-stage to
first-stage TSs.
It is worth pointing out that the second stage is modeled as 1/β separate queues,
rather than a single queue with 1/β servers. This is because the second-stage
hash function g completely determines which second-stage TS an incoming
translation request is sent to, i.e., incoming requests are not indistinguishable
jobs which can be arbitrary sent to any of the 1/β queues.
After this second stage the traffic from the other VLRs, which is now (1– p2)λO,
returns to those VLRs. The traffic from VLR1 , which is (1–p2 )λf m s at TS 1 and
( 1 –p2 )λoms at the other TSs, returns to VLR 1 ; it is joined by the traffic which
enjoyed a cache hit at the TS cache, so that the total returning traffic at VLR1
is λrv = (1 – p1 )λ. This returning traffic undergoes final processing at the VLR
before exiting the translation process (and moving on to other processing, i.e.
HLR querying.) Finally, we assume that the VLR and the switches both have
background traffic of λbv and λbs respectively. For simplicity these background
flows are not shown in Fig. 3.
For the purposes of this paper we consider that translation requests are Poisson
arrivals and all the queues in the model are independent M/M/1 queues [8].
(Note once again that the second-stage TS is modeled as 1/β separate M/M/1
queues, rather than a single M/M/(1/ β) queue.) We can then calculate the
total response time R, i.e, delay, of the translation process using well-known
techniques [9, 8]. In the following, Ri is the residence time for the traffic from
V L R1 to TS 1 at entity i, where i = v, vc, sw, t1, t1c, t11 respectively represents

and 1 for a two-stage system.

We can derive expressions for the terms in Rother in a manner similar to those
in Eq. 4.

EFFECT OF CACHING AND LOAD
IMBALANCE
In this section we illustrate the use of the model described above for an example
scenario. We focus on investigating the effect of caching and translation load
imbalance. We use the values of the parameters given in Table 1 and plot the
mean delay given by Eq. 4.
The translation workload is calculated assuming a low-tier PCS system, with
small cells. We assume n active users per cell (base station), b base stations
per base station controller, B base station controllers per Broadband Wireless
Switching Center (BWSC), v BWSC per VLR, and c call originations and
terminations per user during the busy hour. The translation traffic due to
registrations is ignored since it is much less than that due to call originations
and terminations [5]. Then the total translation workload per VLR is λ =
nbBvc. For this paper we will first consider an example PCS system with n =
15, b = 96, B = 8, v = 1 and c = 3 calls/hour, so that λ = 9.6 trans/sec during
the busy hour. We will plot the total translation delay for the range 1 ≤ λ ≤ 15
trans/sec. We will later also consider a scenario where PCS penetration has
increased and n = 30, so that λ = 19.2 trans/sec during the busy hour; for
this case we will plot the delay in the range 1 ≤ λ ≤ 30 trans/sec. As a rule of
thumb, it is desirable that the mean delay due to translation alone be about
0.5 second or less.
3.1 One-stage version
To model the one-stage version using Eq. 4, we set Stage = 0, p2 = 0, β = 1
and arbitrary positive values for 1/µt11 and 1/µ t1c.
In Fig. 4 we plot the mean delay as a function of the translation load, assuming
no caching at the VLR (p1 = 0), the service time at TS1 is 1/µt 1 = 5ms, the
load imbalance factor f1 is varied, and the remaining parameters are as in Table
1. There is a sharp increase in the total delay R around λ = 11 trans./sec.. This
occurs because the first-stage TS, TS1 , becomes saturated. The load imbalance
factor is insignificant for λ < 8 trans/sec.; this is because the load imbalance
at T S 1 results in higher load at TS1 but lower load at the other TSs, so that
the increased delay at TS1 due to load imbalance is mitigated by the reduced
delay at the other TSs. For λ > 8 trans./sec, the load imbalance factor begins
to have some noticeable effect on the overall delay.

152
Figure 4 One-stage version: Mean translation delay for p 1 = 0 (no cache
at VLR) and 1/µ t 1 = 5m s. The load imbalance factor ƒ1 is varied; the three
curves are for ƒ1 = 3.0, 2.0, 1.0 respectively.
In Fig. 5 we plot the mean delay assuming some load imbalance due to hashing
at V L R1, and that a cache is installed at all the VLRS. (We continue to
assume that the hashing at all VLRs other than VLR1 results in perfect load
balance.) It is clear that caching can result in very substantial reductions in
total translation delay.
3.2 Two-stage version
To model the two-stage version, we set Stage = 1. In addition, we assume that
processing at the first-stage TS now simply consists of performing a second-level
hash function and other minor tasks, so that 1/µt 1 = 1/µt 1c = 1.25ms, while
the actual database lookup is done at the second level TS, so that 1/µ t11 = 5ms.
We assume that the two-stage version of the scheme will only be used when
translation rates have become very high due to high PCS and NGPN penetra-

tion. Thus we consider the scenario where the number of active users per PCS
cell, n = 30, and λ = 19.2 in the busy hour.
Fig. 6 shows the variation of the mean delay with translation load when there
is some load imbalance at VLR 1 (ƒ1 = 2), and there are two second-level TSs,
i.e., 1/β = 2. (We continue to assume that the hashing at all VLRs other than
V L R1 results in perfect load balance.) We consider the situation where no
caching is used at the VLRs (p1 = 0). We can see that even without the use of
a second-level cache (i.e, p2 = 0), the effect of the second-level TSs is to allow a
much greater translation load to be processed; saturation occurs at an offered
load of around λ = 22 instead of the λ = 11 trans/sec in the one-stage case.
The use of a second-level cache is very effective for 0.1 ≤ p2 ≤ 0.25 in this ex-
ample; for p > 0.25 the second-level cache provides diminishing returns. Since
there are far fewer TSs than VLRs, second-level caches may be more cost-
effective than caching at the VLRs. Note, however, that at low loads (λ ≤ 20
trans/sec.) the VLR cache reduces the mean translation delay while the second-

level cache does not; this is because at low loads the delay due to VLR process-
ing and SVC setup is still a significant fraction of the total delay, and is not
affected by second-level caching.
4 CONCLUSIONS
We have developed a simple model for the mean translation delay due to the
one-stage and two-stage versions of our proposed NGPN scheme. Example cal-
culations with the model show that the mean translation delay can be kept low
(under 0.5 second), with appropriate use of caching and second-level transla-
tion servers if necessary. The model is fully parameterized and can be used
to investigate other example scenarios if desired. At present the model does
not provide variances or percentiles of delay; these can be incorporated if the
translation delay becomes a more significant proportion of the total call setup
time.

Abstract
Currently, the ATM Forum’s Wireless ATM (WATM) working group is in the pro-
cess of developing a set of new specifications for ATM mobility. The work encom-
passes the definition of a new 25 Mbps air-interface, suitable location management
and a fast handoff scheme. To date, most of the working group contributions have
focussed on extensions to existing signalling specifications with little regard for the
type of Quality of Service (QOS) which could be achieved during handoff. The work-
ing group considers WATM to be a direct extension to the standard ATM specifica-
tion with uniformity of end-to-end QOS. In this paper we advocate an alternative
approach. We argue that large-scale mobility requirements, limited radio resources,
and fluctuation network conditions make the delivery of hard QOS guarantees in the
wireless domain very difficult. To address this challenge, we are implementing a
QOS-aware middleware platform called “mobiware” which operates between the
application and radio ATM link layers. At the heart of the mobiware platform lies a
QOS controlled handoff algorithm which exploits the inherent scalability of audio
and video flows. Implicit in the term “QOS controlled” is the notion that audio and
video flows can be represented as multi-layer scalable flows and adapted during
handoff to meet fluctuating network conditions based on a user-supplied QOS adapta-
tion policy. Novel aspects of the mobiware QOS controlled handoff signalling algo-
rithm include the use of mobile-soft-state to represent mobile flows, aggregation
techniques for bundling and transporting mobile flows to and from mobile devices,
and re-routing and QOS re-negotiation anchor points which limit the impact of small-
scale mobility on the wireline network.

1 Introduction
Next generation wireless communications systems such as wireless ATM (WATM)
will be required to support the seamless delivery of voice, video and data with high
quality. In this context, WATM is intended to be a direct extension of the existing
fixed/wireline broadband ATM networks with uniform end-to-end QOS guarantees.
Delivering hard QOS guarantees in the wireless domain is, however, rather difficult
since assumptions made in providing QOS guarantees in wireline ATM networks do
not always hold in their wireless extension due to large-scale mobility requirements,
limited radio channel resources and fluctuating network conditions [3]. Bandwidth
made available to a set of mobile devices during admission control may vary due to
changes in the link quality caused by the prevalence of channel impairments and high
transmission error rates. In addition, a connection with certain capacity reserved for a
mobile device at a particular cell may have to be re-routed to another cell during
handoff, and the new path may not have the originally required capacity. Therefore,
re-negotiation of resources allocated to the connection is needed. At the same time
though, the flow (e.g., audio or video) should be transported and presented ‘seam-
lessly’ to the destination device with a smooth change of perceptual quality. These
conditions impact our ability to deliver hard QOS guarantees in WATM networks.
Although researchers have addressed the isolated areas of handoff criteria, connection
rerouting, signalling extension [6]-[13], and QOS provision [14] in mobile ATM net-
works, little attention has been directed toward the development of a handoff algo-
rithm which supports the seamless delivery of scalable multimedia flows with
controlled QOS. The term “controlled QOS” is used to distinguish it from the hard
QOS guarantees offered by wireline ATM networks. Implicit in this term is the notion
that multimedia flows can be represented and transported as multi-layer scalable
flows which can be intelligently and perceptibly scaled-up or scaled-down to match
the available resources at the bottleneck base-to-mobile links during handoff. In this
paper we propose a unique solution to the overall problem of providing handoff with
QOS assurances. This proposed signalling algorithm is a part of a novel QOS-aware
middleware platform called mobiware.
The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we present an overview of the
mobiware platform. Following this in Section 3 we describe the QOS controlled
handoff design goals, architecture and algorithms. In Section 4 we present a walk-
through of the QOS controlled handoff scheme. Finally, we present our concluding
remarks in Section 5.
2 Mobiware Platform
Mobiware is a software middleware platform that runs seamlessly on mobile devices,
base stations and mobile-capable ATM switches. The platform is built on distributed
system and Java technology and incorporates new architecture and novel adaptive
algorithms to support QOS controlled mobility. Mobiware is based on xbind [18] and
CORBA technology [17] and is designed to operate between the application and
radio-link layers of future wireless media systems. The platform provides value-
added QOS support by allowing mobile multimedia applications to operate transpar-
ently during handoff and periods of persistent QOS fluctuation. The goal of the mobi-

ware adaptive algorithms is to transport scalable flows, reduce handoff dropping and
improve wireless resource utilization.
Figure 1: Mobiware Platform
Mobiware promotes the separation between mobile signalling and adaptation man-
agement on the one hand and media transport on the other. As illustrated in Figure 1
mobiware utilizes xbind (based on CORBA) and Java for signalling and adaptation
management during handoff or periods of persistent QOS fluctuation. The Java Vir-
tual Machine executes on mobile devices, base stations and mobile-capable ATM
switches and supports the dynamic execution of active transport objects (ATOs).
These transport objects constitute an ‘active’ component of the mobiware transport
system which can dispatch ATOs to strategic points in the network or end-systems to
provide value-added QOS support.
The realization of end-to-end QOS control and the exploitation of scalable flows is
achieved in mobiware through: i) resource binding between mobile devices, base sta-
tions and ATM switches; and ii) provision of a set of QOS-aware adaptive algo-
rithms. These algorithms operate in unison under the control of mobiware:
QOS controlled handoff, provides signalling for handoff which exploits the use
of: i) mobile soft-state and hard-state to represent mobile flows; ii) aggregation of
mobile flows to and from mobile devices; and iii) re-routing and QOS re-
negotiation anchor points to limit the impact of small-scale mobility on the wider
fixed network;
adaptive network service, provides hard QOS guarantees to base layers (BL) and
soft QOS guarantees to enhancement layers (viz. E1 and E2) of flows based on
the availability of resources in the wireless environment; and
active transport environment, supports the transfer of multi-layer flows through
the provision of a QOS-based API and a set ATOs (e.g., media scaling [19]) and
static transport objects (STOs), e.g., playout control. STOs are statically
configured and execute at mobile and fixed devices only. In contrast, ATOs are
dynamically dispatched to the mobile devices, base stations or ATM switches to
support valued-added QOS at strategic nodes.
For full details on the mobiware platform see [4].
3 QOS Controlled Handoff

160
In this section we describe the mobiware QOS controlled handoff architecture and
algorithms. First, we introduce a number of design goals which motivate the design of
our scheme. Following this we present an overview of the QOS controlled handoff
algorithm.
3.1 Design Goals
A number of goals motivate the design of the QOS controlled handoff scheme. These
goals are based on certain assumptions concerning the nature of multimedia flows,
providing QOS guarantees in the wireless domains and handoff dropping policy.
First, the handoff algorithm must support bidirectional flows where a mobile device
can be both sender and receiver. For multicast flows, individual receivers (both wired
and wireless) may have differing QOS capabilities to consume flows. This could be
due to either fluctuating network resources with mobility or imposed by individual
applications. Bridging this heterogeneity gap [3] in mobile multicast environments
while simultaneously meeting the individual mobile device QOS requirements is
addressed by mobiware.
Second, the approach should limit the impact of handoff on the smooth delivery of
data. This is of paramount importance when considering the delivery of continuous
media flows during handoff. Continuous media has a strong sense of isochronous
delivery and smooth playout at receivers. In order to achieve this requirement the
handoff algorithm should provide fast connection rerouting without significantly
interrupting flows in progress. In addition, handoff should provide for a smooth
change of the flow’s perceptual quality in the case where the new location does not
have sufficient resources.
Third, an important goal of QOS controlled handoff is to limit the routing and
resource reservation disturbance of small-scale mobility of a mobile device on the
other members of a multicast flow and on the fixed wireline network. We model
small-scale mobility by limiting the amount of re-routing and QOS re-negotiation
during handoff. However, handoff takes into account any potential sub-optimal rout-
ing which may evolve from this policy through the activation of a periodic route opti-
mization algorithm.
Fourth, the handoff scheme interacts with media scaling agents [18] to filter audio
and video flows to match available bandwidth. Our goal here is to reduce the handoff
dropping probability and to provide better resource utilization in the wireless domain
by admitting as many mobile devices as possible during handoff. Providing hard QOS
guarantees in the WATM environment (as advocated by the ATM Forum) is very dif-
ficult to achieve in practice. To address this mobiware provides a QOS adaptive
approach which we argue is more suitable in the wireless media environment.
Our final design goal accepts that it is better to scale-down audio and video flows and
admit them during handoff rather than drop them when the maximal desired capacity
is unavailable. To address this mobiware represents audio and video flows as multi-
layer scalable flows.
3.2 Handoff Network Model
An important contribution of our architectural approach is the consideration of two
normally conflicting design goals: supporting the dynamic, transient and adaptive

nature of device mobility and mobile flows while limiting any potential disturbance
incurred by QOS re-negotiation during handoff.
•
•
•
To achieve these design goals we introduce three novel architectural concepts:
mobile soft-state, models the dynamics of mobility and service adaptation such as
media scaling through the periodic re-routing and QOS re-negotiation of flows as
a mobile device roams. Mobile soft-state is established between a per mobile
routing anchor point (RAP) and the mobile device, and hard-state between the
RAP and the wireline network. In this context the RAP provides an interface
between the hard-state and soft-state portions of flows;
logical anchor points, limit the impact of small-scale mobility of a mobile device
on the wireline network. Per mobile RAP and QOS re-negotiation anchor points
(QRP) localize the periodic re-routing and QOS re-negotiation during handoff,
respectively; and
connection groups (CG), provide a common routing representation for all virtual
paths and virtual circuits to and from mobile devices. Connection groups are
maintained between a per mobile RAP and mobile devices and decouple handoff
re-routing from resource allocation. The RAP allows collective control of all
mobile flows associated with a mobile device during handoff. By aggregating
flows through a single reference point (i.e., RAP) mobiware supports a fast and
efficient handoff algorithm.
161
Figure 2: QOS Controlled Handoff Model
QOS controlled handoff supports multicast flows where a mobile device can be both a
source and receiver. The handoff scheme uses a soft-handoff approach for flows
which terminate at a mobile devices and hard-handoff for flows which originated at
mobile devices. This approach helps reduce the complexity of managing flows during
handoff while supporting QOS needs. The QOS controlled handoff scheme is classi-
fied as a forward handoff type with partial re-routing. As illustrated in Figure 2 the
crossover switch is optimally chosen to be along the path between the mobile device
and the RAP.

162
As illustrated in Figure 2, the concepts of mobile soft-state, connection group and log-
ical anchor points (viz. RAP and QRP) are modeled in the wireline and wireless
domain providing QOS controlled mobility. The mobiware platform models the
wireless portion of the ATM network as being divided into pico-cells each served by
a base station connected to a wireline ATM network. Base stations are cell relays
which translate the ATM cell headers from radio ATM format to that used by stan-
dard ATM. Each base station supports signalling, QOS control and adaptation man-
agement of flows based on the semantics of an adaptive network service. The existing
wireline ATM network provides connectivity between base stations. We organize the
wireless network into domains. A domain consists of a set of base stations which are
under the management of mobile-aware ATM switches. A domain corresponds to a
logical partition of the wireline network and the physical location of the base stations
in hierarchies for scalable routing (in ATM Forum PNNI routing, these domains
would be peer groups).
3.3 QOS Controlled Handoff Algorithms
Mobiware models mobile flows through the semantics of an adaptive network service
and QOS controlled mobility. The semantics of the adaptive network service dictate
that base layers undergo full end-to-end admission testing and support hard end-to-
end QOS guarantees. In contrast, enhancement layers are admitted without any such
test but compete for residual capacity between the QRP and the mobile device. Mobi-
ware assumes that network resources are scarce in the WATM domain and abun-
dantly available in the wireline ATM domain. The semantics of QOS controlled
mobility assume that as mobile devices migrate between cells then mobile flows are
scaled by media scaling ATOs to match the available bandwidth in the target cell. To
meet these QOS requirements, mobiware models mobile flows through a combination
of mobile soft-state, logical anchor points and connection groups.
3.3.1 Mobile Soft-State A significant contribution of the QOS controlled handoff
scheme is the use of mobile soft-state. Mobile soft-state is admirably suited to support
the dynamics of mobile flows which operate in mobile and QOS fluctuating environ-
ments. Mobile soft-state combines self-removable routing state and periodic QOS
adaptation between mobile device and the RAPs. Mobile soft-state is designed to
model the dynamics of small-scale and large-scale mobility in WATM environments.
As illustrated in Figure 2, mobile devices periodically send reservation (resv) mes-
sages toward the RAP in the wireline network. These resv messages carry the mobile
devices desired QOS requirement and are interpreted by the base station and fixed
network infrastructure according to the rules of the mobiware adaptive network ser-
vice. As illustrated in Figure 2, resources are allocated to a mobile device over a par-
ticular wireless/wireline route for the duration of the mobile soft-state timeout. This is
achieved when a QRP responds to a resv message by sending an adaptation (adpt)
message back toward the mobile devices with an indication of the allocated resources.
Soft-state provides a receiver-driven QOS adaptation mechanism for the mobile
device to periodically probe the wireless network for better quality. This approach is
particularly suitable when individual receivers of a multicast flow have differing QOS
needs. The mobiware QOS model also operates on very fast traffic control time scales
where traffic variations are countered by buffering and scheduling algorithms with
resources allocated by a measurement based admission control algorithm.
The periodic resv message is used in combination with an adpt message to continually
probe for better QOS between the mobile device and QRP. This probing occurs on the

163
QOS re-negotiation time scale. If during that time the infrastructure receives another
resv message it refreshes the mobile soft-state held in the base station and switches
between mobile devices and the RAPs. As mobile devices handoff between adjacent
cell periodic resv messages re-establish the appropriate QOS between the mobile
device and the new QRP. At the same time the mobile soft-state between the old base
station and the new crossover switch expires; that is, the appropriate switch table
entries and resources are automatically deallocated and made available to the remain-
ing mobile devices.
Soft-state plays three important roles along the path between a mobile device and its
logical anchor points:
•
to refresh the soft-state timer between a QRP and the mobile device,
•
to re-negotiate QOS between the QRP and the mobile device based on the
semantics of the mobiware adaptive network service and support the active
transport environment, and
•
to update the connection group to ATM VP/VC mapping between the RAP and
the mobile device.
As illustrated in Figure 2, hard-state is installed in the wireline environment above the
RAP and mobile soft-state in the wireless domain between RAPs and mobile devices.
QOS adaptation operates in the wireless domain between mobile devices and QRPs to
share limited radio resources between mobile devices. By limiting QOS adaptation to
the wireless domain, we isolate the wireline environment from periodic QOS re-nego-
tiation that is active in the wireless domain.
Mobiware provides a receiver-oriented approach to QOS adaptation where individual
members of a multicast flow specify their QOS requirements and adapt to available
resources. In contracts, sources continuously send the full complement the flow. This
limits the impact a source of a multicast flow can have of all receivers.
3.3.2 Logical Anchor Points A RAP and QRP are defined for each mobile device.
The major goal of mobile-to-QRP signalling is for QOS adaptation using the resv/
adpt messages pair. The QRP is located in the same local domain as the mobile
devices to minimize the impact that small scale mobility has on the wireline portion
of the network. The RAP serves as a gateway for a mobile device to the outside net-
work as all the flows to and from this mobile device are routed through the associated
RAP. The RAP’s major function is soft-state management, which includes anchoring
the connection group, interfacing soft/hard states, consolidating resv and generating
adpt messages.
The QRPs are fixed for intra-domain handoffs and relocated for inter-domain hand-
offs. In general, the location of RAP remains fixed. When the mobile device comes
on line for the first time a RAP and QRP are instantiated. The RAP is initially co-
located with the QRP, and is fixed for the duration of the handoff to preserve the
mobile soft-state connection group path as a basis for future handoff. The RAP is a
constraining point regarding routing to and from the mobile device after handoff.
During handoff the location of the crossover switch has to be chosen between the
RAP and the mobile device. By extending the soft-state connection group path the
handoff re-routing algorithm can select the optimal location of the crossover switch,
as presented in Figure 3 which illustrates a zigzag handoff which is common in the
pico-cellular environment.

164
As illustrated in Figure 3, originally the RAP and QRP are co-located in the same
domain. After the first handoff, the QRP is located to the new domain while the RAP
stays in the same location to maintain the existing connection group. The mobile
device then migrates back to the old cell. The crossover switch is optimally chosen to
be near the new location of the mobile device. The mechanism for locating QRP and
RAP is simplistic. During the first connection setup, with the knowledge of the pre-
assigned location of the QRP (queried from PNNI peer group leader), the soft-state is
set up between the mobile and the QRP/RAP. During handoff, a handoffSetup mes-
sage will also set up the soft-state between the new QRP and RAP.
Figure 3: An Inter-domain Handoff Scenario
The RAP and QRP handle small-scale mobility and inter-domain handoff re-routing.
However, suboptimal routing can still occur. This develops when a mobile device
migrates further away from its initial RAP location during multiple inter-domain
handoffs. To resolve this mobiware executes a path optimization algorithm. The path
optimization algorithm is conservative and executes on longer time scales than hand-
off. The reasoning behind this conservative approach is that the path optimization
requires a complete rebuild of all the flows to and from the mobile devices. This will,
by its nature, be quite disruptive to all flows in operation. Hence the need to limit total
rebuilds to those times when it is absolutely necessary.
3.3.3 Connection Group QOS controlled handoff uses the concept of a connection
group (CG), which is analogous to virtual paths in ATM, to aggregate all flows
between the mobile devices and the RAPs. Mobiware extends the connection bun-
dling concept first introduced in [7] [13] from a VP to a higher level of aggregation
allowing VC/VPs with different QOS requirements to be grouped together and trans-
ported. The connection group concept promotes the idea of supporting individual VC
and VP with different QOS requirements at ATM switches and base stations.
The connection group is maintained by the resv/adpt mechanism. The resv message
probes the path between the mobile device to the RAP to detect any individual VC/
VP setup or timed-out/torn-down. On the return path, the adpt message updates con-
nection group mapping tables in all the intermediate switches and the base station.
During handoff, a new portion of connection group is set up using the multicast oper-
ation addBranch. After handoff, the removal of the old branch from a connection
group tree is managed automatically through the soft-state operations used in the
mobile environment.

165
4 Handoff Walk-through
In this section we provide a step-wise walk-through of the QOS controlled handoff
algorithm. Each phase of the handoff is considered in turn. These phases comprise the
handoff initiation, path setup and path teardown phases. Figure 4 presents each phase
and it respective constituent parts.
4.1 Handoff Initiation Phase
The first phase of QOS controlled handoff determines whether a new base station can
provide a stronger signal at the desired level of QOS. A QOS monitoring algorithm
resident at mobile device monitors the beacon messages which are periodically broad-
cast by all neighboring base station. In addition to indicating the signal strength of
neighboring cells, beacon messages indicate the residual capacity currently available
at the neighboring base stations. By periodically monitoring beacons from all neigh-
boring base stations the mobile device is able to determine link qualities and occu-
pancy of adjacent base stations and use this QOS state information as a basis to
initiate handoff after a suitable dwell time.
The next step in handoff is the establishment of a new signalling channel between the
mobile device and the new base station. A mobile device issues a (1) signalRequest to
the new base station over a dedicated meta signalling channel using the base station
address found in the beacon message. This results in the creation of a signalling chan-
nel when the base station responds with a (2) signalResponse. The signalling channel
carries all signalling and resv, adpt messages between the mobile and wireline net-
work.
Figure 4: Mobiware Handoff Walk-through
4.2 Path Setup Phase
Once the signalling channel has been successfully created the mobile device initiates
a forward handoff to the new base station. It does so by issuing a (3) handoffSetup
message which includes connection group route state information and the desired

QOS required. Mobile devices express their desired QOS in terms of the semantics of
the adaptive network service which are mapped into connection group QOS require-
ments in terms of connection group base layer requirements and enhancement layer
requirements, respectively. Admission control located at the new base station first
determines whether sufficient resources are available to support the minimum QOS of
the requested handoff.
The base station’s parent mobile switch uses connection group routing information in
combination with PNNI routing to (4)locateCrossover within the range of the old
mobile soft-state path and establish the shortest branch between the new base station
and the crossover switch on the existing connection group tree with the desired QOS.
The PNNI peer group leader is interrogated in the case where the mobile device
roams outside the current peer group domain of the old base station. This suggests
that the existing crossover point would provide a suboptimal routing point. An opti-
mal re-routing point could to be established by end-to-end hierarchical routing algo-
rithm as described in section 3.3.2.
The mobile switch then issues a (5)handoffSetup message to the newly identified
crossover switch. The QOS values in handoffSetup message can be modified by the
distributed handoff algorithm based on the availability of resources at the traversed
nodes as the handoffSetup messages is forwarded toward the RAP. The returned
(6)handoffAck message commits switch and base station resources for the new con-
nection group branch. The semantics of the adaptive network service provides hard
guarantees to the base layers and admits enhancements layers based on the availabil-
ity of residual resources. Existing mobiles’ reservations above the base layer may be
altered to allow a new mobile device to enter a cell. The base station drops the hand-
off call (6)handoffDrop if insufficient residual capacity is available to meet the group
connection base layer resource requirements of the new mobile device.
The handoff algorithm interacts with the adaptive transport media scaling agents at
either the base station or the mobile-aware switches during connection group setup. In
the case of media scaling, the level of media scaling is dependent on the current utili-
zation of the wireless link, application specific desired QOS and the semantics of the
adaptive network service. Media scaling may result in the “scaling-down” of mobile
delivered quality when a mobile device enters a pico-cell and “scaling-up” when they
leave. QOS filters support the delivery of different combinations of layers to particu-
lar mobile devices based on the available resources, which is essential for multicast to
heterogeneous receivers. For full details on mobiware media scaling see [19].
Handoff registers new mobile devices with the domain location management which in
turn allocates a new proxy ATM address as mobile devices roam into cells within a
new PNNI Peer Group. A (7) locationUpdate message is used to register the mobile
devices at the home location in this case and update the cache register at the old base
station.
4.3 Path Teardown
QOS controlled handoff is based the notion of soft-handoff for roaming receivers and
hard-handoff for roaming senders. In the case of soft-handoff, the mobile device
simultaneously receives flows from the old and new base stations. Once the crossover
switch sends a handoffAck message to the mobile device it begins to forward the new
from  both the old and new base stations. The crossover switch uses cell tagging to
flow to the mobile devices. This results in duplicate cells arriving at the mobile device
166

167
4.4 RAP Relocation Optimization
preserve ATM cell level sequence integrity at the mobile device during handoff. This
is achieved by inserting an end-to-end OAM cell for both flows for every K data cells.
After tagging has commenced mobile devices determine suitable synchronization
points in the old and new flows and initiate flow switching from the old to the new
flow. After flow switching the old flow is rendered redundant. Old flows continue to
arrive at the mobile devices as long as the route between the old base station and
mobile switching point is active; that is, old flows are switched through to the mobile
while the mobile soft-state is still installed and has not timed-out. Mobile devices do
not, however, have to process old flows. One advantage of this mobile soft-state tear-
down approach is to allow path re-use if a mobile device comes back before the path
states time-out. This is equivalent to pre-reserving network resource following the
tracking of a mobile device, which can speed up handoff in a pico-cell environment.
The mobile device at the new cell starts its QOS adaptation and mobile soft-state
management procedure by sending (8)resv message toward its QRP and RAP. The
resv messages probes for higher quality enhancement layers and consolidates connec-
tion group to VP/VC mapping between the mobile device and QRP point. The resv
message is also used to consolidate the connection group mapping between the QRP
and RAP point. Note that there is no QOS adaptation between these points. The full
complement of connection group base and enhancement layers are delivered to the
QRP. QOS adaptation is active from the QRPs to the mobile devices. The RAP
responds to a resv by sending an adpt messages back toward the mobile. This mes-
sage confirms the connection group mapping, refreshes the mobile soft-state between
the RAP and QRP. In addition, the adpt message also informs the mobile device of
the resources available to it over the next interval and scales the available resources
for the mobile device. Media scaling filters the flow at the base station or at the QRP.
After flow switching the mobile device refrains from sending any further periodic
resv messages to the old base station and closes the signalling channel to the old base
station. Once the mobile soft-state timer expires the old branch of the connection
group tree between the old mobile switching point and the old base station is timed-
out and removed. Media scaling is once again invoked at the old base station to deter-
mine if deallocated resources can be utilized by the any existing mobile devices at old
base station. If the resv and adpt message pairs of these mobile devices confirm the
residual bandwidth availability, the media scaling agent scales up the corresponding
media flows.
As illustrated in 4c mobiware avoids potential sub-optimal routing to the RAP for
new calls. A RAP relocation feature allows the routing algorithm to route a new con-
nection to a merge point between the current RAP and QRP point as oppose directly
to the RAP. RAP relocation optimization is illustrated in 4c. This procedure does not
require any re-routing of existing flows from the old RAP location to the new one. All
that is required is that the RAP is relocated and the soft-state between the new and old
RAP points in hardened (10) and (11).
5 Conclusion
In this paper we have argued that large-scale mobility requirements, limited radio
resources, and fluctuation network conditions make the provision of hard QOS guar-

168
antees in the wireless domain rather difficult. Currently we are implementing a QOS-
aware middleware platform called mobiware and its QOS controlled handoff algo-
rithm which exploits the inherent scalability of audio and video flows. Novel aspects
of our QOS controlled handoff include the use of soft-state and hard-state to represent
mobile flows, aggregation of flows to and from mobile devices and RAP and QRP
which limit the impact of small-scale mobility on the wireline network. Mobiware
contrasts approaches taken in WATM working group which advocates extensions to
the traditional ATM Forum UNI and PNNI signalling stacks. Implicit in mobiware is
the notion that audio and video flows can be represented as multi-layer scalable flows
which can be adapted during handoff to meet fluctuating network conditions.
The mobiware testbed consists of 4 ATM switches (viz. ATML Virata, Fore
ASX100/ASX200s, NEC Model 5, Scorpio Stinger) and 4 base stations. The base sta-
tions are multi-homed 200 MHz Pentium with 25 Mbps wireline access to the wire-
line ATM network and 2 Mbps WaveLAN air-interfaces to a number of mobile
devices based on Pentium PCs and notebooks. The PCs run Linux, Windows/NT and
xbind (based on CORBA). An early version of mobiware runs on PCs, base stations
and the ASX100 ATM switch. Finally, we have implemented a beta version of the
handoff protocol which supports mobile soft-state, connection groups and RAPs and
QRPs. In addition we have completed the implementation of active transport object
for mobile filters to scale media during handoff [19].

Abstract:
We consider use of fixed broadband wireless networks to provide packet services for
telecommuting and Internet access. Each cell in such networks is divided into multiple
sectors, each of them served by a sector antenna co-located with the base station (BS),
and user terminals also use directional antennas mounted on the roof top of homes or
small offices and pointed to their respective BS antennas. To support a target data rate of
10 Mb/s, a bandwidth of several MHz is required. Since radio spectrum is expensive, the
bandwidth need to be reused very aggressively. Thus, efficient strategies for frequency
reuse and managing co-channel interference are critically important. We propose here
a dynamic radio-resource allocation method, to be referred to as staggered resource
allocation (SRA) method, that uses a distributed scheduling algorithm to avoid major
sources of interference, while allowing concurrent packet transmission and meeting a
specified signal-to-interference objective. The performance of the method is studied by
analytic approximations and detailed simulation.
Our results show that the combination of directional antennas plus the SRA method is
highly effective in controlling co-channel interference. For reasonable system parameters,
the SRA method delivers a throughput in excess of 30% per sector while permitting
a given frequency band to be re-used in every sector of every cell. It also provides

172
higher than 90% probability of successful packet transmission at appropriate traffic load
conditions. In addition, a simple control mechanism can be applied in the method to
improve performance for harsh radio environments.
1 INTRODUCTION
As work-at-home, telecommuting and Internet access become very popular, the demand
for broadband packet services will grow tremendously. Customers are expecting high
quality, reliability and easy access to high-speed communications from homes and
small businesses. High-speed services are needed in the very near future for: a)
accessing World Wide Web for information and entertainment, b) providing data rates
comparable to local-area networks (LAN) for telecommuters to access their computer
equipment and data at the office, and c) multimedia services such as voice, image and
video.
In this paper, we consider a wireless approach to this problem: fixed (i.e., non-
mobile) broadband packet-switched TDMA networks with user data rates of 10 Mb/s,
link lengths typically less than 10 kilometers and operating frequency in the range of
1 to 5 GHz. We specifically focus on networks using sector antennas at base stations
and narrow-beam antennas at roof tops of homes and small offices. Physical and link-
layer issues arising in the design of such networks include modulation, equalization,
access techniques, co-channel interference, bandwidth usage, error control and multi-
access schemes [1]. Our focus here is to address just one of these issues, namely, the
co-channel interference.
Microwave spectrum is expensive, so efficient strategies for re-using frequencies
and managing co-channel interference are critically important. To support a user
data rate of 10 Mb/s in an interference-limited wireless environment, a bandwidth
of several MHz is needed for TDMA. In contrast to narrowband cellular networks
where radio spectrum is divided into multiple channel sets, which are re-used only in
relatively distant cells [6], broadband wireless networks must re-use bandwidth very
aggressively, ideally reusing the same frequency band in every cell. The need for reuse
of a common radio bandwidth in all cells has also been noted by [3] and [2] for mobile
broadband wireless networks. Note that although CDMA uses the same frequency
band in all cells, the radio bandwidth required for supporting the target data rate of 10
Mb/s will be excessive and the associated high processing speed has not yet shown to
be technologically feasible.
In the context of packet-switched networks, time slots naturally become the band-
width resources, which are shared by all users in a sector or cell. We need to dy-
namically allocate time slots to various transmitters to send data packets such that a
given signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) can be guaranteed at the intended receiver for
successful packet reception. This results in the concept of dynamic resource alloca-
tion. By using a central controller, [10] and [8] propose approaches to assigning time

173
slots. In our fixed wireless networks, cell sectorization and directional antennas at
fixed locations are key components in reducing the amount of interference from neigh-
boring sectors and cells. In this paper, we propose a strategy for managing co-channel
interference that does not require a central controller. It permits reuse of the same
bandwidth in every cell, resulting in a high degree of spectral efficiency.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the bandwidth
allocation problem in fixed broadband wireless networks. Section 3 introduces the
staggered resource allocation (SRA) method for bandwidth allocation, and discusses
its properties. We outline performance models for the SRA throughput in Section
4. Using typical parameters, Section 5 presents several numerical examples, and
discusses the performance characteristics of the proposed methods. Finally, Section 6
is our conclusion.
2 BANDWIDTH ALLOCATION IN FIXED BROADBAND WIRELESS
NETWORKS
Consider a broadband wireless network where each cell is divided into multiple sectors,
each of which is covered by a sector antenna co-located with a base station (BS) at the
center of the cell. Because of the co-location, sector antennas are also referred to as
BS antennas. Terminals (users) use directional antennas mounted on the roof top and
pointed to their respective BS antennas. The beamwidth (angle) of each BS antenna
should be just wide enough to cover the whole sector, while a terminal antenna pointing
to a designated BS antenna can have a smaller beamwidth to avoid interference. The
ratios of front-to-back-lobe gain (abbreviated by FTB ratio below) for BS and terminal
antennas may be different, and are assumed to be finite. Time is slotted such that a
packet can be transmitted in each slot. In addition, the downlink and uplink between
terminals and BS are provided by time-division duplex (TDD), using the same radio
spectrum.
To make our ideas concrete, let us consider a hexagonal cell layout. Each cell is
divided into six sectors, each of which is served by a BS antenna with 60° beamwidth.
Terminal antennas can have an angle smaller than 60°. For the hexagonal layout, using
a simple path-loss model [9], we can find the major sources of interference for the
downlink and uplink in a given sector. Our challenge is to develop resource allocation
methods that avoid most of the major interferers.
3 THE STAGGERED RESOURCE ALLOCATION (SRA) METHOD
In the staggered resource allocation (SRA) method, the frame structure and the sector
labeling are presented in Figure 1. Basically, a fixed number of time slots for a downlink
(or uplink) are grouped into subframes and they are labeled by 1 to 6. Sectors are also
labeled by 1 to 6 anti-clock-wise. The labeling patterns for adjacent cells differ by a

174
120 degrees rotation, thus creating a cluster of 3 cells whose patterns can be repeated
across the whole system.
A special slot assignment order is established and followed by each sector. As
shown in Figure 2, for example, a sector with label 1 first schedules packets for
transmission in time slots of subframe 1 (denoted by a). If it has more traffic to send,
it then uses subframe 4 (b), subframe 5 (c), etc. until subframe 6 (f). The idea here
is that, if interference due to concurrent packet transmission in the same cell can be
tolerated, then after using all slots in the first subframe a, a sector should use the first
subframe of the opposite sector in the same cell, in order to make the best use of the BS
directional antennas. Following that, time slots in the first subframes for the sectors
next to the opposite sector are used. To avoid interference due to imperfect antenna
patterns of neighboring sectors, their first subframes are used as the last resort. As
the figure shows, the assignment order for the next sector is "staggered" by a right
rotation by one subframe based on the order for the previous sector. For this reason,
this method is called the staggered resource allocation (SRA) method. The benefits of
the SRA method in terms of interference avoidance and control of concurrent packet
transmissions are explained in the following.
Avoidance of Major Interference
First, let us consider the intra-cell interference. It is easy to see from Figure 2 that if all
sectors have traffic load of less than one-sixth of total channel capacity, all packets are
transmitted in different time subframes, thus causing no interference within the same
cell. Of course, as the traffic load increases, packets are transmitted simultaneously,
thus increasing the level of interference. Nevertheless, the special assignment order
exploits the characteristics of directional antennas to allow multiple concurrent packet
transmissions while maximizing the SIR.
Besides managing intra-cell interference, the SRA protocol also helps avoid inter-
ference from major sources in the neighboring cells. This is particularly so when traffic
load is low to moderate. To see this, let us consider the downlink for Sector 1 in the
middle cell of Figure 1. Sector 2 in the bottom cell and Sector 3 in the upper cell are
the major sources of interference. By examining the assignment order for Sectors 1,
2 and 3, one finds that they will not transmit simultaneously, so they will not interfere
with each other provided that all of them have a traffic load of less than one-third of
total channel capacity (i.e., using only subframes a and b for transmission). The same
comment also applies to the uplink where Sectors 2 and 5 of the bottom cell in the
figure now become the major sources of interference. Due to the symmetry of the
assignment order and cell layout, this same comment applies to each sector in every
cell.

175
A Control of Concurrent Transmissions for Enhanced Quality of Service
According to a given radio environment and antenna characteristics, the SRA method
can be used in conjunction with a control mechanism to improve the reception quality in
terms of SIR at the receiving ends. Specifically, the control limits packet transmissions
only in the first few subframes for each sector. For example, for the given radio
environment, if at most three packets can be sent simultaneously by various BS or
terminal antennas in the same cell to ensure the required reception quality, only time
slots in subframes a, b and c as indicated in Figure 2 can be used for transmission
by each sector. In general, we have shown in [5] that if each sector schedules packet
transmission in the first k subframes in the SRA method, there are at most k packets
transmitted simultaneously by various antennas in each cell at any time. The control
limits the degree of concurrent transmissions, thus the amount of interference, to
achieve the desirable SIR. When different grades of quality of services (QoS) such as
for voice, secure data, non-realtime data calls are defined in terms of the SIR threshold,
the control can be used as a mechanism for providing the required QoS. The ability
of the mechanism to control the exact number of major interferers is also useful for
systems using adaptive antennas [11] for suppression of interference where a specific
number of interferers can be tolerated.
Optimality of the SRA Method in a Single-Cell Setting
Consider the downlink performance of the SRA method in a simple, single cell setting.
Assume that the cell is divided into N equal sectors and each sector BS antenna has a
perfect antenna pattern (i.e., it has a front lobe and a back lobe with a sharp distinction
between them) with beamwidth of 360°/N , but with a finite FTB ratio. All antennas
transmit at a fixed power level, and always have packets ready for transmission. A
power-law path-loss model and lognormal shadowing are also assumed. By consider-
ing the success probability of a packet transmission, the SRA method is shown in [5]
to yield the maximum achievable throughput.
4 THROUGHPUT MODELS FOR THE SRA METHOD
An analytic approximate model and a detailed simulation model have been developed
to study the downlink throughput of the SRA method. Both models consider a fixed
number of terminals (users) in each sector, finite FTB ratios for BS and terminal
antennas, radio path loss and lognormal shadowing effects. They treat a packet
transmission as successful if the SIR at the intended receivers exceeds a given threshold
and the SRA throughput defined as the number of packets successfully transmitted per
time slot in each sector.

176
Analytic Approximate Model
Success of a packet transmission depends on the traffic load of various sectors, and
the radio environment and antenna characteristics. So, the exact throughput analysis
requires consideration of the interdependency among all BS antennas, thus becoming
intractable. To develop an approximate model, we assume that traffic process for
each BS antenna is statistically independent, but yet packet transmissions by all BS
antennas are considered in estimating the probability of successful reception at a re-
ceiver. Our simulation results reveal that such an approach yields excellent throughput
approximations.
Our approximate model consists of two submodels: a) a Markovian traffic submodel
to capture the traffic characteristics for each sector in the SRA method, and b) an
interference submodel to consider the radio environment and antenna characteristics.
For simplicity, we assume here all sectors have identical offered traffic load. Thus, the
same traffic submodel is applicable to all sectors. This assumption can be relaxed by
applying different traffic parameters to the submodel for various sectors. Due to space
limitation, details of the submodels are omitted here and they can be found in [5].
Simulation Model
The simulation model also considers the 7-hexagonal-cell layout in Figure 1. Each
cell is divided into 6 sectors, each of which is served by a BS antenna co-located at
the center of the cell. The beamwidth of each BS and terminal antenna is 60° and 30°,
respectively, while each terminal antenna points directly to its BS antenna. The FTB
ratios for the BS and terminal antenna are finite and adjustable as input parameters for
the simulation. The model uses ideal antenna patterns in a way that if a receiver antenna
sees the front lobe of a transmitting antenna, the radio signal is attenuated only by the
path loss. Otherwise, the signal is also attenuated according to the FTB ratio. Each
radio path between a pair of BS and terminal antennas is characterized by a path-loss
model [9] and lognormal shadow fading. For the downlink, since there is only one radio
path between all BS antennas in the same cell (which are co-located) and an arbitrary
terminal, the intended signal and interference experience the same lognormal fading
and path loss. However, the fading from BS antennas in different cells are different
and independent. For each packet transmission, if the SIR at the intended receiver
exceeds a threshold, the packet is considered to be successfully received. Otherwise,
the packet is retransmitted later. Since our focus is on the throughput, the simulation
model assumes no retransmission delay and that new and transmitted packets in each
sector are scheduled for transmission effectively in a random order.
There are 20 terminals (or users) randomly placed in each sector. For downlink
traffic, as in the analytic approximate model, each BS antenna is assumed to have a
buffer to hold one packet for each user. When the buffer is occupied, subsequent packet
arrivals for the user are blocked and cleared. Packets are scheduled to transmit by each

177
BS antenna according to the SRA method as discussed above. To avoid non-uniform
performance in the outer layer of cells, only the statistics in the middle cell in Figure
1 are collected and reported below.
5 THROUGHPUT PERFORMANCE AND DISCUSSION
In this numerical study, each subframe has 12 time slots, each sector has 20 terminals,
the standard deviation of lognormal shadowing is 4 dB and the path loss exponent is 4.
Figure 3 presents the downlink throughput of the SRA method as a function of
normalized aggregated load from the analytic approximate model and the simulation
model (represented by curves and symbols, respectively). A set of typical FTB ratios
for BS and terminal antennas, denoted by B and T respectively, are considered in
the examples. Clearly, the throughput depends on the SIR detection threshold. With
straightforward modulation and equalization schemes (e.g., QPSK and DFE), the
threshold probably lies between 10 to 15 dB. As shown in the figure, the maximum
throughput in each sector for the SRA protocol with these parameters ranges from
30% to 80%. That is, while re-using the same frequency to support high user data
rates in every sector of every cell, we can still achieve a throughput in excess of 30%,
which translates into a very large network capacity! For the 30% to 80% throughput
per sector, each cell effectively has a data capacity of 1.8 to 4.8 times of the channel
data rate. Evidently, this happens because, as intuitively expected, the SRA protocol is
capable of selectively allowing concurrent packet transmission to increase throughput
while avoiding major interference to yield satisfactory reception. It is possible that
the SRA throughput can be improved further if the FEC code and power control are
adopted in a way similar to that in [2] and [3].
In terms of the quality of the analytic model, as shown in Figure 3, the approxi-
mations closely match the simulation results, except for the case with 15 dB detection
threshold, and the FTB(B,T) ratios of 20 and 10 dB at high traffic conditions. Given the
stringent detection threshold and antenna characteristics, packet transmission is likely
to fail and subject to retransmissions in this case, thus yielding high aggregated traffic
load and strengthening the interdependence among all BS’s. When this happens, the
approximate model, which only captures part of the correlation among BS’s by use of
success probability, becomes inadequate for predicting accurate throughput. For other
less stringent parameter settings, the approximations are excellent.
Another way to quantify the merits of the SRA method is the success probability
of packet transmission. That is, the probability that the SIR for a packet transmission
exceeds a given threshold for successful reception. From our simulation results, Figure
4 shows that the probability decreases as the traffic load grows. To avoid excessive
retransmission delay, it is expected that the success probability should be higher than
90%. In light of this, we observe that except at high load for the most stringent case, the
probability is above 90% for all other three settings. Combining this with the through-

178
put results discussed above, the SRA method is capable of sustaining a throughput of
70% to 80% per sector, while yielding the satisfactory success probability. Even for
the most stringent case, the target success probability can be maintained by keeping
the throughput below 30%, which still represents a large network capacity.
As discussed earlier, the SRA method can be used in conjunction with a control
mechanism to limit the degree of concurrent packet transmission for enhancing the
reception quality. Figure 5 portrays how the SRA throughput can be improved for the
most stringent case, namely, FTB(B,T)=(20dB,10dB) and the SIR threshold of 15dB.
Let the degree of concurrent transmission be limited by the control to C packets per
cell. Note that when the control is not applied, C = 6 as time slots in all six subframes
can be used for transmission by each sector. As C decreases from 6, the maximum
throughput first increases and reaches the peak when C = 3. This is so because
with a smaller C value, the control effectively limits the degree of concurrent packet
transmission, thus enabling more packets to exceed the SIR threshold and improving
the throughput. However, as C decreases further, the throughput starts to decrease
because only a small fraction of time slots are available for transmission by each sector
when C is too small. Note that when C = 1, the SRA method has a maximum
throughput of about 1/6.
We also observe from Figure 5 that for C = 4 to 6, the throughput first increases,
reaches a peak at a certain aggregated load, and then starts to decrease if the load
increases further. In contrast, the throughput for cases with C = 1 to 3 always
increases, perhaps marginally with the traffic load. This is because for the given
parameter setting, if the degree of concurrent transmissions is higher than 3, packet
transmissions become more likely to fail as more packets are transmitted at high loads.
On the other hand, for C = 1 to 3, the throughput is limited mainly by the control.
Thus, the throughput still increases slightly as the traffic load increases.
In a separate study, we find that for the most stringent parameter setting, even when
C = 1, only a few percent of randomly chosen locations such as those at the boundary
of adjacent cells may have difficulty in achieving the SIR threshold of 15dB. The
percentage is reduced for a lower threshold and/or higher antenna FTB ratios, and
may increase for antenna patterns that are more practical than the ideal one assumed
here. To provide close to 100% coverage in harsh environment, it may be desirable to
enhance the SRA method to serve those "bad" locations. Other strategies to allocate
radio resources to "bad" and "good" locations can also been found in [4].
In addition to improving the throughput, the control mechanism also enhances the
packet success probability in the SRA method. This can be seen in Figure 6 for the most
stringent case. As one would expect, at a fixed traffic load, the probability increases as
C decreases simply because less concurrent transmission implies less interference. It is
interesting to observe that the probability is only marginally improved when C changes
from 2 to 1, while the corresponding throughput improvement is much larger in Figure
5. This characteristic of the SRA method can be explored by network designers to

obtain a balanced tradeoff between the throughput and success probability for a given
radio environment and the desired QoS.
6 CONCLUSION
We have shown that the combination of directional antennas plus dynamic resource
allocation in the time domain is highly effective in controlling co-channel interference
in fixed wireless systems. For reasonable choices of system parameters, our staggered
resource allocation (SRA) technique delivers high throughput while permitting a given
band of frequencies to be re-used in every sector of every cell. The SRA method
also provides satisfactory probability of successful packet transmission. In addition, a
simple control mechanism can be applied in the SRA method to improve the throughput
and success probability for harsh radio environments and poor antenna characteristics.
We believe the proposed approach is a significant step forward in establishing the
viability of fixed broadband wireless access networks.

Abstract: The paper proposes a distributed power control algorithm for integrating het-
erogeneous transmitting sources, which have a broad range of statistical/burstiness char-
acteristics and quality of service requirements, in wideband cellular CDMA networks.
Speech sources with silence detection and data are canonical examples of service classes.
Each service class is characterized by on-off transmissions with characteristic probabili-
ties, desired minimum carrier-to-interference ratio and minimum probability with which
the latter is required to be satisfied. In the power control algorithm given here, the received
power for each service class at each cell is adapted locally based on only local measure-
ments of the mean and also, importantly, the variance of the interference. The algorithm is
derived from an asymptotic analysis in which the bandwidth as well as the number of mo-
biles are large. The analysis leads to a Gaussian approximation to the interference at each
cell, which depends on the power levels. The algorithm is remarkable for its simplicity in
the decoupling between classes. This is due in part to an attractive product-form in the ex-
pression for the dominant term in the asymptotic expansion of the desired power for each
service class and cell. A condition for geometric convergence of the adapted power to
the ideal power is obtained. The condition is remarkably unburdensome and only slightly
more demanding than the condition based on the mean values of source activities. The
condition also defines the capacity of the cellular CDMA network.

INTRODUCTION
The paper addresses the challenge of integrating heterogeneous transmitting sources
with a broad range of burstiness characteristics in wideband cellular CDMA networks.
Provided the right power control can be devised, CDMA offers the potential of ex-
tracting significant gain from the statistical multiplexing of such sources. In this paper
we propose a new distributed power control algorithm for a range of service classes
in cellular CDMA wireless networks. Each service class is characterized by its mo-
biles’ distinctive bit rates, statistical and burstiness properties, and quality of service
parameters consisting of the desired minimum carrier-to-interference ratio (CIR) and
the minimum probability with which this requirement on the CIR must be satisfied. A
canonical service class is voice sources with silence detection, which are modelled as
on-off sources. Data sources, if also present, typically have quite different burstiness
characteristics and, importantly, more stringent quality of service requirements on the
CIR. In the power control algorithm that we give here, the power is adapted locally
based on only local measurements of the mean and variance of the interference.
The paper is in two parts. In the first part the probabilistic quality of service speci-
fication is described. Also given is an asymptotic framework for estimating the orders
of magnitude of quantities which affect the quality of service. The asymptotic scaling
reflects wideband characteristics, i.e., the bandwidth as well as the number of mobiles
are large. The key result of the first part are expressions for the asymptotically ideal,
i.e., minimal, powers at each cell site for each service class (see (53)). The second part
of the paper gives our distributed, measurement-based algorithm for solving the afore-
mentioned expressions for the ideal powers. The analysis of the dynamical behavior of
the algorithm yields a condition for the geometric convergence of the powers to their
ideal values. This condition is also important because it determines the capacity of the
cellular CDMA network. The condition obtained is remarkably unburdensome. The
condition is only slightly more demanding than the condition based on the mean val-
ues of source activities, i.e., where the variabilities of the sources are eliminated.
This work extends some recent results in [MMO96], where the following notions
were introduced: stochastic on-off traffic sources, probabilistic quality of service spec-
ifications, an asymptotic scaling for wideband networks, a Gaussian approximation for
the cell-dependent interference and, importantly, a distributed power control algorithm
driven not only by the mean of the local interference, which is conventional, but also
the variance. New to this paper is the concept of classes of service. The power control
algorithm given here (see (56)) is remarkable for the simple, decoupled dependence
on the classes of service. This, in turn, is due in large part to a result obtained in the
analysis, which states that the dominant term in the asymptotic expansion for the ideal
powers at each cell site for the various service classes has a simple product-form, in
which a term common to all service classes is multiplied by the desired minimum CIR
for the service class. Moreover, the common term is the ideal power at the cell of a
simple cellular network construct having a single class of service.
An important limitation of the analysis of the paper is the assumption of time-invari-
ant path gains. The conventional argument to support this assumption is based on a sep-
aration of time scales of the power control convergence and variations in the path gains.
We believe that the algorithm’s sensitivity to randomness renders it more effective in

189
the presence of path gain variations and fluctuations. That is, the measurement-based
terms in the power adaptation algorithm which reflect the mean and variance of the in-
terference will take into account not only the effects of randomness in transmissions, as
postulated in the model, but also time variations in the path gains. It should, however,
be noted that this is not established here.
For the benefit of readers this paper has been written to be self-contained, which has
necessitated some overlap with [MMO96]. Otherwise, given the complicated develop-
ment, it would be excessively distracting and tedious.
Prior work on power control has been done in distributed [ZAN92(a), ZAN92(b),
BPO92, FMI93, HAN93], distributed-asynchronous [MIT93, GZY95] and centralized
[GVG93] frameworks. Hanly [HAN93] considers a cellular model with interference
fluctuations. Early work on power control in spread spectrum networks is reported in
[NAL83]. Recent work which unifies power control and cell site selection is reported
by Hanly [HAN95] and Yates [YAT95]. Works which integrate power control and ad-
mission control are [BCP95] and [BCM95], the former focussing on active link protec-
tion and the latter on channel probing. On-off sources are considered in [VVI93] and
[MMO94]. Recently, Everitt and Evans [EEV95] introduced the concept of effective
interference to quantify the effects of variability in interference on the network capac-
ity in the context of multiple service classes and cellular CDMA networks. However,
the investigation is essentially independent of power control. Andersin and Rosberg
[ARO96] develop a framework for power control in cellular networks, with some fea-
tures in common with [MMO96], where the focus is mobility and time varying path
gains. While this paper deals with CIR, and only indirectly with bit error rates (BER),
it is possible to connect power control directly to BER, as in [KYH95]. The source for
CDMA, specifically for matters related to interference and capacity, is Viterbi [VIT95].
2 MODEL
Let Xm be the activity indicator for mobile m, i.e., Xm ∈ {0, 1} and X m  = 1 if and
only if the mobile is active at a point in time. An active mobile m transmits at power
p , and the gain to cell site j is g

We assume that the received power at any cell site k from all the active mobiles of class
i in that cell is common and given by Pk i, i.e.,

Since our system is spread spectrum, the interference to an active mobile’s transmis-
sion is closely related to the total received power at its local site. In order to calculate
mobiles in cell k of class i, i.e.,

The total power received at cell j is
 W(1 ≤ j ≤ J) is the local receiver noise power at cell site j, and W is the
spread bandwidth (and also the processing gain). Since we are considering a wideband
system, W is large. For any active mobile m in cell j of class i, X m  = 1 and the
interference to its transmission is
The quality of service requirement in terms of the carrier-to-interference ratio (C/I)

Now consider the stochastic traffic model of a bursty mobile m of class i to be on-
off, i.e., in cell j it is on, i.e. active, with probability wji:
(10)
Although wji may not depend on the cell index j, we are retaining the generality for
possible future applications. On account of the random source behavior, the quality of
service requirement has to be probabilistic, with probability of compliance at best less
than unity. Let the requirement be

In summary, we have shown that for our model of many mobiles and class-dependent,
random, on-off transmission of mobiles, the component which is independent of power
in the expression for the received power at cell site j due to all mobiles of class i in cell
k is a Gaussian random variable given in (17).

ASYMPTOTICS, ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE
We introduce a natural scaling, which allows us to make order of magnitude estimates
and to develop meaningful and efficient approximations by dropping negligibly small
terms.
3.1
Asymptotic Scaling
Inherent to wideband systems in which the bandwidth (W) is shared by a large number
of users is the following scaling, in which the large parameter K is the average number
of mobiles in a cell, i.e.,

where ai  = O (1) and γji = O (1) as K → ∞ and W → ∞.  Note that α  and η

j are
other O(1) parameters. With a small loss of generality, consider these O(1) parameters
to be fixed in this scaling. Also, note that, importantly, W and K are of the same order.
Let

and second order terms in the above expansion of Pj i are dictated by consistency, as
may be checked later.

Solutions to Leading Order Terms in the Asymptotic Expansion
Now let us investigate the implications of (18) and (19) on the terms Pji and
i I j ap-
pearing in the quality of service specifications (11). By substituting (17), (18) and (19)
in the expression for Ij in (5), and using (9), it may be verified that

Similar capacity defining constraints occur in price studies on deterministic narrow-
band systems and stochastic wideband systems.The condition (28) is especially note-
worthy for the particular composition of the mean intercellular gain matrix F, see (25)
and (26). On the other hand, since it as a condition applied to a matix of mean  gains, it
is the least burdensome condition we may hope for in hte determination of the capacity
of the stochastic system. Also, note that rF and W are O(K) and hence the left hand
quantity in (28) is O(1).
We assume that F is an irreducible matrix and since it is also nonnegative, it has an
eigenvalue of maximum modulus, called the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue, which is
real, positive and simple. We denote this eigenvalue by rF, and we make the important
assumption that

the mean value of the power-independent, random component M jk

at cell j due to all mobiles of class l in cell k. Hence, it is reasonable to call F (l) the
mean class l, intercellular gain matrix.
Now define

equalities in (24) in the following sense: any other solution to (24) will have every
element not less and at least one element greater than the solution in (33).
The product-form in (33), wherein the multiplicative factor dependent on the class
index i is simply αi , is of crucial subsequent importance. Note that p* , see (32), is of a
familiar form, see for instance [FMI93, HAN93, MIT93], since it is the minimal power
solution of a network construct with a single class having CIR requirement α and mean
intercellular gain matrix F.

ALGORITHM AND ITS CONVERGENCE
 
We now propose a distributed algorithm for power control, based on (53). In view of
(5), (13) and (15), we introduce the measured quantities at cell j during time period n:

values of the mean and variance of the total interference at cell j in time period n. The
distributed algorithm for power control that we propose is
where {vi}, defined in (37), are fixed, known quantities. The adaptation of power is
thus driven by local measurement of the mean and variance of the total interference.

O(1/
). Since, as noted in Sec. 3.2, αrF / W = O(1), the above condition for ge-
ometric convergence is only slightly more stringent than αrF /W < 1, the condition
which arises from consideration of just mean activity values. The condition in Proposi-
tion 3 is also the condition which determines the capacity of the cellular CDMA system.

CONCLUSIONS
We have given an algorithm in (56) for distributed power control in cellular CDMA
networks which supports heterogeneous transmitting sources having diverse statisti-
cal/burstiness characteristics and quality of service requirements. The algorithm is de-
rived from an asymptotic analysis based on a scaling appropriate for wideband systems.
The analysis of the dynamical behavior of the algorithm considers the geometrically
fast convergence of the adapted power levels to their optimum values.
A topic for future work is the extension of the approach developed in [MM096] and
here to correctly incorporate random fluctuations in the transmission medium. Since
we are already taking into account statistical fluctuations in the interference due to trans-
missions, it should be possible to extend the calculations to take into account explicitly
fluctuations in the medium.

Abstract:
The fast transmission power control problem in a cellular network is
studied when the signal attenuation is subject to a fast time-varying multipath
Rayleigh fading. An asymptotic representation of the link gain evolution in time
is first derived, and then used for constructing a Fast Time Variant distributed
constrained Power Control (FTVPC). The proposed FTVPC power control suc-
cessfully counteracts Rayleigh fading and demonstrates significant lower outage
probabilities in comparison with the Constant-Received Power control (CRP).
It is shown that a potential improvement of 4/3 in the spectrum utilization
can be obtained by FTVPC compared to CRP. A comparison with a network
without Rayleigh fading under a previously studied Time Variant Power Control
(TVPC), is also made. Not surprisingly, it turned out that Rayleigh fading is
very difficult to counteract, and it adds a substantial amount of outages.
INTRODUCTION
Transmitter power control has proven to be an efficient method to control
cochannel interference in cellular PCS, and to increase bandwidth utilization.
Power control can also improve channel quality, lower the power consump-
tion, and facilitate network management functions such as mobile disconnec-
tion, hand-offs, base-station selection and admission control.
Distributed Quality-based power control, where transmitters adapt their power
to meet a signal quality target at each receiver, have been extensively studied in
the literature under various assumptions. Recent studies with continuous power
levels and stationary conditions are given in [1, 6, 8, 9, 12, 15, 23, 21]. Algo-
rithms for random interference, have been studied in [16, 18, 20]. Distributed
power control with discrete power levels and a SIR quality measure, has been
studied in [2, 22], and with continuous power control and Bit Error Rate (BER)

204
quality measure, in [14]. Power controls which cope with time-dependent link
gains have been studied in [3, 4].
In all the studies above, it has been assumed that the power control con-
verges much faster compared to the changes in the link gains result-
ing from mobility. This assumption has motivated a snapshot evaluation of
the algorithms (where link gains are fixed in time), which over looks the ran-
dom changes in the link attenuation. Such analysis under-estimates the outage
and the signal quality measure target (see e.g., [4], and [3]). To compensate
this under-estimation, coarse over-allocation of bandwidth is being used for de-
signing a cellular network. In future PCS environments bandwidth would more
carefully be allocated, and snapshot analysis should be refined by a time variant
analysis to provide better quality measure targets.
Power controls which cope with time-dependent slow shadow fading have
been studied in [4] and [3]. It has been assumed in these studies, that fast
multipath Rayleigh fading is resolved by coding and interleaving, and therefore
not included in the model. Preliminary results in [4] have revealed that the
quality measure target must be set significantly higher than the target deter-
mined by a snapshot analysis. This study however, has not provided concrete
rules to determine that quality target. In [3], an asymptotic representation of
the link gain evolution in time (without Rayleigh fading) has been derived, and
a framework to evaluate the channel quality in a time varying system is spec-
ified. Using that framework, a time-dependent power control algorithm which
successfully copes with slow shadow fading has been devised and evaluated.
In this paper we study a network where the signal attenuation is subject also
to a fast time-varying multipath Rayleigh fading. We show that our proposed
Fast Time Variant distributed constrained Power Control (FTVPC) obtains an
improvement of 4/3 in the spectrum utilization compared to CRP.
RADIO LINK MODEL
Consider a generic channel in a cellular network which is being accessed by
N transmitters, where each is communicating with exactly one receiver. For
the uplink case, the transmitters are the mobiles and the receivers are their
corresponding base stations; and for the downlink case, their roles are reversed.
When transmitter j (1 ≤ j ≤ N ) is transmitting at time t, it uses power
pj (t) ≤
, where
is its maximum transmission power. Given that at time t,
the link gain between transmitter j and receiver i is gi j (t) (1 ≤ i, j ≤ N ), the
Signal to Interference Ratio at receiver i, SIRi (t ), is defined by
where vi > 0 is a time independent background noise power. The numerator is
the received signal power at receiver i, and the denominator is the interference
power experienced by receiver i. The SIR is a standard measure to evaluate the
channel quality, and it is highly correlated with its error rate. Let γ i be the SIR
target for the channel between transmitter i and its corresponding receiver. We
say that channel i is supported at time t, if
SIR i(t) ≥ γi .

205
To incorporate transmitters and receivers mobility resulting in the time vari-
ant link gains, we have to specify the process (gi j (t ) | t ≥ 0) for every pair
1 ≤ i, j ≤ N. To investigate slow shadow and fast multipath fading affects on
power control, we incorporate both into our link model. For every time instant
t, the link gain (in power units) is modeled as a product of a distance depen-
dent propagation loss, a slow shadow fading component, and a fast multipath
Rayleigh fading. That is,
(1.1)
is the standard normal random variable. The third factor
is the power
attenuation due to fast multipath fading which is assumed to be governed by a
Rayleigh distribution R i j (t), with σR =
. That is,
We assume that the link gain processes are mutually independent, and the
evolution of each link gain process (gi j(t) | t ≥ 0) is governed by the following
correlated processes.
Let v be the average mobile velocity, and t0 be an arbitrary time reference.
For the slow shadow fading process we assume that for every t > 0,
(1.2)
where
are independent standard normal random variables, and X is
the effective correlation distance of the shadow fading. The parameter X is
environment dependent and determines the rate at which the shadow fading
correlation is decreasing with the distance. We further assume that for every
t > t 0 ,
and Z i j(t0) are independent.
The time variant shadow fading process with the exponential correlation
function in (1.2), has been proposed in [11] based on field experimental data.
For notational convenience, we introduce the normalized velocity, u = 2v/X .
The evolution in (1.2) then becomes,
The time variant Rayleigh fading is represented by the following Jake’s
model, [13] (see also [7] and [17] for substantiating studies). Let
k = 1, 2, be two independent Gaussian processes with stationary means and
variances, 0 and σ2
R , respectively. Each process evolves independently of the
rest of the system according to the following correlated process. For every time
reference t0, and time distance t > 0,
(1.3)
We assume that
, where Di j(t ) is the distance between trans-
mitter j and receiver i at time t, and α is a propagation constant. The S ij(t)
is assumed to be log-normally distributed with a log-mean of 0 dB, and a log-
variance of σ2
S dB. That is,

206
where
are independent normal random variables with mean 0 and
variance σ2
R , and ρ(t ) is the zero order Bessel function of the first kind evaluated
at
That is,
Here, ƒ is the carrier frequency and C is the speed of light.
Observe that the Rayleigh process {Ri j(t ) | t ≥ 0 } is the envelope of the
complex correlated Gaussian process
, whose
evolution is modulated by the correlated processes defined in (1.3).
The derivation of a fast power control algorithm can be facilitated by an
asymptotic representation of gij (t0 + t), for small t. Assume that mobiles move
with constant velocity v. It has been shown in [3] that the distance dependent
and the slow shadow fading factors have the following asymptotic representa-
tions.
(1.4)
0.
where a = 
ln(10), and o(x) is a function of x with the property lim x → 0 o(x )/x =
From the Rayleigh power definition and (1.3) we have,
(1.5)
where
are independent exponential random variables with mean 1 (i.e.,
with the same marginal distribution as
The expansion in (1.5) is difficult to apply, and therefore we develop a
stochastically dominating approximation whose tail distribution is very close
to the approximated tail. As will be seen below this is required for our power
control construction.
Applying numerical methods we obtain the following approximation for small
values of t.
(1.6)
Here, a(t) and b (t) are constants which depend on the time horizon t, the
carrier frequency and the mobile speed. E.g., for 900 MHz and 90 K m/h,
a(10ms) = 2, b (10ms) = 1.25 and a(t) = 1.1, b(t) = 1.25, for t = 0.1, 1 ms.
For 30 Km/h, a(10ms) = 2, b (10ms) = 1.5, and a (t) = 1.1, b (t) = 1.25, for
t = 0.1, 1 ms. The complement distribution functions (CDF) of
and
are depicted for different values of
and t’s, in
Figures 1.1 - 1.2. It can be observed that our approximation objectives are met
and that the smaller t is, the better is the approximation. For practical power

207
update rates in our system, we need the approximations for t ≤ 1ms, which are
very good.
To derive a fast power control we apply the following asymptotic represen-
tation of the link gains. From (1.4) and (1.6) it follows that for a short time
horizon t, the distance dependent and the slow shadow fading time variation is
negligible compared to the fast Rayleigh fading variation. Therefore, gij (t0 + t)
can be approximated as follows. Let
denote the link gain after averaging out the Rayleigh fading. Then we have
from (1.4) and (1.6)
(1.7)
Remark 1.0.1 Observe that for a short time horizon, each link gain can be
represented by weighted sum of its previous value, and an independent expo-
nentially distributed random variable. The mean of the random component is a
factor of the previous link gain without the Rayleigh fading.
FAST TIME VARIANT POWER CONTROL
In this section, we propose a Fast Time Variant distributed Power Control
(FTVPC) which utilizes the known correlation function of the multipath Rayleigh
fading. This power control is build upon the following Distributed Constrained
Power Control (DCPC) from [9]. For time variant link gains, DCPC updates
the power according to
otherwise,
where U(t ) is an arbitrary set of transmitters.
Observe that the right element within the curled parenthesis is the SIR target
times the ratio between the interference power (including the background noise)
at receiver i, and the link gain g i i(t ). Since the interference power can be
measured, and gi i(t ) can be detected by the transmitter from the base station
pilot signal (assuming a reciprocal system), this algorithm can be implemented
in a distributed manner. Another SIR estimation procedure which is based on
subspace estimation is devised in [5].
Since link gains vary in time, the interference and the gain of the allocated
channel i, are evaluated by intensive sampling and averaging. Hence, the im-
plemented DCPC would update the powers according to
otherwise,
(1.8)

208
where 
 are the link gain averages in a small time interval around t.
In this study we exploit the following fundamental property of the iterations
in (1.8) (see [9] and [21]). If the link gain averages are stationary in time (i.e.,
then from every initial power vector, the iterated powers in (1.8)
converge to a unique and positive fixed-point solution (p1, p2, … , pN),
Stationary
(t )’s in (1.8) are essential for convergence, however in
practice, they are not. We will show how to force “short-term stationarity”
in the power iterations, and how to anticipate a near future random variation in
the SIR values. Let t0 be an arbitrary time reference and (p1(t0), … , pN (t0)))
be its corresponding power vector. For every t > t0 we will consider the iterated
powers in (1.8), conditioned on the link gain values at time t0. (In probability
theory terminology, we examine the iterated powers given the sub-σ-field at
time t0.)
Let 
denote the time between two consecutive power updates, and assume
intensive sampling within the time intervals [t0, k · ], k = 1, 2, … For small
values of
’s and k ’s (i.e., fast power control), (1.4) - (1.5), and highly significant
sample averages imply that
(1.9)
where
is the sample average of X(t ) in the interval [t0 , k · ], and
x ≈ y means that | x – y | is negligible and vanishes as 
→  0. Thus, from (1.1)
and (1.9) it follows that for small ’s and k’s
(1.10)
That is, the average power attenuation after a short time period is a weighted
average of the previous power attenuation, with and without Rayleigh fading.
Hereinafter, t0 and
are fixed and will not be carried over the following nota-
tions. For every k, let
and denote
(1.11)
(1.12)
(1.13)

209
From (1.10) - (1.13) we have,
(1.14)
Observe that with these notations, the power under DCPC in (1.8) can be
approximated for small 
’s and k’s by,
The objective of our power update iterations is to drive the powers (within
a pre-specified number of iterations k* ) to a level where the SIR targets at
time t0 + k *
are met with a high probability. From (1.7) and (1.14), it is
apparent that the power iteration must involve
Hence, every transmitter-receiver pair needs to estimate them based on local
measurements. The estimation procedure will be presented below after the
power iteration definition.
Accounting for the random link gains, the channel quality requirement has
to be probabilistic. We require that for every time reference t0, the conditional
probability given the link gains and powers at time t0, will satisfy
Here,
and β is a given positive
parameter.
To address this requirement we first use the approximation in (1.7) to project
appropriate percentiles for the SIR levels at time t0  + 
k *. We also assume ideal
conditions where “convergence is reached” within k* iterations.
Remark 1.0.2 The practical role of k* is twofold. One is to stabilize the power
oscillation within the anticipated convergence horizon. The other is to be used
as a time buffer between the power update rate and the SIR information update
rate. Whereas the former is performed by the transmitter, the latter is done
at the receiver and requires more resources. Thus, k* can be set to the ratio
between these two update rates.
In practice, cochannel interference is dominated by a small number of inter-
ferers, to be denoted by N0 (usually 2 to 4). Even when the dominant interferers
are unknown, we may still regard the interference as if it is being generated by
N0 transmitters. Let 0 < β1 < 1 and 0 < β2  < 1, be two parameters such that
where (1 – β) is the SIR quality parameter in (1.15).
The 1stversion of our Fast Time Variant Power Control (FTVPC) is pa-
rameterized by (β1, β2, , k* ). Let ξ 1 be the
percentile of the
exponential random variable with mean 1,
and ξ2 be its β2 percentile.
From the exponential distribution function and (1.16), we have
(1.17)
(1.15)
(1.16)

210
Define,
(1.18)
where a(t) and b(t) are defined in (1.6). FTVPC Version 1 is then specified as
follows.
FTVPC Algorithm - Version 1
For any given set of parameters (β1 , β2,
k*), each transmitter i updates its
transmission power according to the following cyclic loop with k = 0, 1, ..., k * –
1:
(1.19)
otherwise.
Remark 1.0.3 Note that as in DCPC, powers are factored by the inverse pro-
portion of their corresponding signal to interference ratio. However, under
FTVPC, the interference and the signal powers are taken as weighted aver-
ages of their values with and without the Rayleigh fading. Further, percentiles
factors are used to anticipate with high probability, the SIR values in the near
future.
It is straightforward to verify that the right-hand side of equation (1.19)
satisfies the convergence conditions of Yates’ Theorem in [21] (i.e., it is a “Stan-
dard interference function”). Therefore, under the ideal convergence conditions
above, it follows from (1.19) that
is a fixed point
solution satisfying
(1.20)
for every given realization of the link gains and power vector at time t0 .
Ignoring negligible elements (reasonable for small 
’s and k*’s), it is easy to
verify by simple inequalities that for every channel i, if the equality in (1.20) is
attained by
(1.21)
(i.e., whose power converges to a value below the maximum transmission power),
then (1.7), (1.12), (1.13), (1.16) - (1.18) and (1.21) imply that
This is the condition we were aiming at in a time variant case. That is, within
short time windows, powers are driven toward a level where the SIR targets are
met with high probability.
Note that there are many pairs of (ξ1 , ξ2 ) which satisfy (1.16). It can be
shown that
 is minimized, if in every iteration the

211
selected (ξ1 , ξ 2) minimizes the right-hand side of (1.19). This motivates the
following algorithm.
FTVPC Algorithm - Version 2
For any given set of parameters (β, , k *), each transmitter i updates its trans-
mission power according to the following cyclic loop with k = 0, 1, ..., k * – 1:
otherwise .
From [21], a minimum of “standard interference functions” is also a “standard
interference function”, and therefore the convergence to a fixed point solution
also applies.
Estimation Procedure
A method to estimate
and
which are required for
the FTVPC algorithm, is as follows. Consider the equations
(1.22)
where,
(1.23)
Observe that Vi (k) and W i(k) are the actual interference powers at time (t0  +
k ·
) and at time (t0 + (k – 0.5) ·
), respectively (which are used by any
DCPC variant algorithm). Since they can be measured by the ith transmitter-
receiver pair, and
(t)’s are known and sharply decreasing with t, I 1
i (k) and
I 2
i ( k) can be resolved from the last two equations in (1.22). The values of
gii (t0 ) and
(t0) are resolved in a similar manner from two equations based
on the measurements from the receiver pilot signal at time (t0  + k ) and time
( t0 + (k – 0.5) ) .
In cases where ρ(t) varies in time, one may apply standard coefficient corre-
lation estimators to adapt to its variation (see, e.g. [19]). To conclude, notice
that the FTVPC algorithm applies two essential principles. One is the separa-
tion of the interference and the signal powers into two components, one with
Rayleigh fading and another without it. The other principle is the construction
of a confidence interval which anticipate the SIR values in the near future, with
a desirable probability.
NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section we evaluate the outage probabilities of our FTVPC power control
algorithm in a Manhattan-like microcellular system, and compare them to those

212
of the Constant-Received Power control (CRP). We also reference them to the
outage probabilities in a network without Rayleigh fading which uses the
TVPC power control.
The cellular system under investigation is a typical metropolitan environ-
ment consisting of building blocks of a square shape. Each cell size is half a
block in each direction, and base stations are placed in intersections with an
asymmetric pattern as depicted in Figure 1.3. This cell structure is proposed in
[10] and is termed Asymmetric Half Square (AHS). We assume that the channel
assignment is fixed and divides the cells into 3 different cochannel cells in one
case (AHS(1,1,3), see Figure 1.3), and 4 different cochannel cells in the other
case (AHS(1,1,4), see Figure 1.4). In AHS(1,1,3) we simulated 48 cochannel
cells, and in AHS(1,1,4) 64 cochannel cells.
From the measurement data in [11], we set the standard deviation of the
shadow fading to σ = 4 dB, and the correlation distance to X = 8.3 m. The
median Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) at a cell border under the maximum trans-
mission power is calibrated to 82 dB. That is, we take a strongly interference
limited system.
We confine our examples to the uplink case and synchronous power updates.
We assume a constant SIR target, γi  = γ t, for all mobiles. Under the Constant-
Received Power control, the transmitters update their power according to
where the power target C is determined by a desired SNR of 53 dB above γ t.
The algorithms are compared with respect to their outage probabilities using
a value of β = 0.05, and evaluated by simulation. The outage probabilities are
evaluated within time windows of 1, 2 and 5 seconds over more than 2,000 win-
dows. Mobiles start from random positions which are independently sampled
from a uniform distribution over each cell area, and travel along the streets
with a constant speed of 30 km/h. At street corners, they turn left or right,
or continue straight ahead with equal probabilities. Also, a mobile can hang
up with certain probability, in which case it is replaced with a new one at a
random location. A mobile transition to another cell is regarded as an hang up.
We assume a carrier frequency of 900 MHz.
Within every simulated time window, we accumulate the proportion of time
where SIRi (t ) ≥ γi. If this proportion is greater than 1 – β, then the corre-
sponding mobile is supported, otherwise it is not supported. The proportion of
non-supported time windows is defined as the outage probability, and it reflects
the bit error rate. In the simulations, we use β = 0.05.
Findings
Figures 1.5 and 1.6 depict the outage probabilities as a function of the SIR
target in the AHS(1,1,3) and AHS(1,1,4) cell plans, respectively. Three power
controlled systems are compared, a system with Rayleigh fading under the CRP
and the FTVPC power controls, and a system without Rayleigh fading under
the TVPC power control. Each power control is represented by four update
rates, 1000, 2500, 5000 and 10,000 updates per second. The FTVPC power
control uses a convergence horizon parameter k *  = 3, for 1, 000 updates per

213
second, and k* = 5, otherwise. These parameters turned out to best suit our
network.
As to the statistical significant of the results, it should be noted that indis-
tinguishable values are obtained for average window sizes of 1, 2 and 5 seconds,
as well as for 1/3 of the simulated windows, except AHS(1, 1, 4) and update rate
of 10,000. In the latter, we need the entire sample for convergence.
Most notable is the observation that Rayleigh fading is very difficult to coun-
teract. The system without Rayleigh fading experiences significantly less out-
ages compared to the system with Rayleigh fading. Another observation is that
FTVPC substantially outperforms CRP. The outage probabilities of FTVPC
are much lower than those of CRP. Note that by increasing the update rate,
the outage probabilities under FTVPC reach to a level where error correcting
codes can tolerate (20 – 25%). In the AHS(1, 1, 3) cell plan (reuse factor of 3),
the outage probabilities at SIR targets 9, 10, 11 dB are 0.15, 0.175 and 0.225,
respectively, when the update rate is 10,000 per second. With 5,000 updates
per second the outage probabilities are 0.20, 0.265 and 0.33, respectively.
The outage probabilities become significantly lower when the reuse factor is 4
(in the AHS(1, 1, 4) cell plan). With 10,000 updates per second, the probabilities
are 0.055, 0.08, 0.95 and 0.0125 for SIR targets of 9, 10, 11 dB and 12 dB,
respectively. With 5,000 updates per second, the probabilities are 0.055, 0.065,
0.085 and 0.11, respectively. With 2,500 updates per second, the probabilities
are 0.055, 0.08, 0.125 and 0.185, respectively.
The CRP fails to reduce the outage probabilities below a 0.25 level in all
cases except those with a SIR target less than or equals 8 dB in a cell plan
with reuse factor of 4. Thus, a potential improvement of 4/3 in the spectrum
utilization can be obtained by replacing CRP with FTVPC.
Also observe that at an outage level of 25% in a cell plan with reuse factor
of 4 and update rate of 5,000/sec, a SIR gain of about 7 dB can be achieved
by FTVPC compared to CRP.

Abstract:
This paper describes simulations of the power saving mechanism of
the upcoming standard for wireless Local Area Networks IEEE 802.11[1]. They
were performed in order to see how typical parameters influence the perfor-
mance. Simulations were made for a ad-hoc-network with 8 stations. Figures
for optimum Beacon intervals and ATIM window sizes were obtained.
1 INTRODUCTION
Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) are a rapidly growing area in network-
ing. This is basically due to the upcoming of portable devices like notebooks
and mobile phones. A key feature of these devices is the limited battery ca-
pacity, which limits their time in action. This results in a need of power saving
mechanisms, which prolong the life time of the batteries.
The next chapter describes in short different ways to address the power saving
problem. Chapter 2 shows the way power saving is implemented in the IEEE
standard 802.11. After that we describe the simulated environment, the source
model and the parameter set used for the simulations. In chapter 4 we come to
†also with GMD FOKUS

220
the simulations and their results. A discussion of the results and conclusions is

POWER SAVING IN THE IEEE 802.11 DRAFT STANDARD
In general, the best way to save power for wireless communication devices would
be to switch them off. Unfortunately, one can not do this without losing the
capability to communicate in both directions, i.e. a station in this kind of a
power saving mode would not know of any packets arriving for it at this time.
Therefore there are two problems to be addressed in power saving:
1. How does a station in power save mode receive packets from other sta-
tions?
2. How does a station send to another station in power save mode?
Within the standard, the general idea is for all stations in PS mode to be syn-
chronized to wake up at the same time. At this time there starts a window in
which the sender announces buffered frames for the receiver. A station that re-
ceived such an announcement frame stays awake until the frame was delivered.
This is easy to be done in infrastructure networks, where there is a central
access point, which is able to store the packets for stations in doze state and to
synchronize all mobile stations. It is more difficult for ad-hoc networks, where
the packet store and forward and the timing synchronization has to be done in
a distributed manner.
Power Saving in IEEE 802.11 therefore consists of a Timing Synchronization
Function (TSF) and the actual power saving mechanism. The TSF for an in-
frastructure network (the Point Coordination Function - PCF) can be seen in
figure 1. The access point (AP) is responsible for generating beacons, which
contain a valid time stamp beside other information. Stations within the BSS
(Basic Service Set - a wireless cell) adjust their local timers to that time stamp.
If the channel is in use after the beacon interval the AP has to defer its trans-
mission until the channel is free again.
The situation is more complicated for an ad-hoc network (the Distributed
Coordination Function - DCF, see figure 2). Due to the absence of a trusted au-
thority the timers adjust in a distributed way: Every station is responsible for
generating a beacon. After the beacon interval all stations compete for trans-
mission of the beacon using the standard backoff algorithm. The first station
”wins” the competition and all others have to cancel their beacon transmission
and to adjust their local timers to the time stamp of the winning beacon.
The power management in the PCF is simple due to the existence of the AP
as central buffer for all packets to stations in doze mode. The AP transmits
together with the beacon a so-called Traffic Indication Map (TIM). All unicast

221

TSF for ad-hoc networks in 802.11
packets for stations in doze mode are announced in the TIM. The mobiles af-
terwards poll the AP for the packets. If broadcast/multicast frames are to be
transmitted, they are announced by a Delivery TIM (DTIM) and sent imme-
diately afterwards. Of course the stations in power save mode have to wake up
short before the end of the beacon interval and to stay awake until the beacon
transmission is over.
The power management for the DCF is based on the same distributed fashion
as it is used for the TSF. Packets for a station in doze state have to be buffered
by the sender until the end of the beacon interval. They have to be announced
using Ad-hoc TIMs (ATIMs), which are transmitted in a special interval (the
ATIM window) directly after the beacon. ATIMs are unicast frames which
have to be acknowledged by the receiver. After sending the acknowledgment,
the receiver does not fall back into doze state but stays awake and waits for
 for infrastructure networks in 802.11

the announced packet (see figure 3). Both ATIMs and the data packets have
to be transmitted using the standard backoff algorithm.
Figure 3:
Power Management in the DCF of IEEE 802.11
Our aim was to tune the algorithm to get best values for the throughput of
stations in power save mode and on the other hand for a maximum possible
time in doze state. We chose the ratio of time in doze state vs. the time in
active state as a measure for the quality of the power saving mechanism itself.
3 SIMULATION APPROACH
Our simulations were performed using a PTOLEMY model[2], which is de-
scribed in greater detail in [3]. We used the appropriate values for the Direct
Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) physical layer. The simulation environment
consists of 8 stations, which belong to an independent basic service set (IBSS).
We did not consider any hidden terminals. Simulations with 1, 2, 4 and all 8
stations in power save mode were performed.
To model realistic traffic on a wireless LAN, we used trace files of an Ethernet
[4], which were multiplexed using different start points in the file to lead to
different, but predictable load scenarios². We simulated overall offered loads of
around 15, 30 and 60% of the raw physical throughput.
We made the assumption that power consumption is proportional to the time
in active mode. Any additional effects which are depending on the PHY layer
like equalization and on-off switching costs were not taken into account.

223
4 SIMULATION RESULTS
First we wanted to observe dependencies of the throughput compared to dif-
ferent window sizes for the beacon interval and ATIM window. As it may be
expected, higher numbers of stations in power save mode lead to lower through-
put. This is because of the overhead for each data packet, which consists of
an ATIM and an ACK and two backoff sequences, regardless of the size of the
packet to be transmitted³. It showed that there is a decrease in throughput for
very small and very large ATIM window sizes (see figure 4). An ATIM window
which is too small results in less ATIMs and therefore in less packets, which can
be announced and transmitted. On the other hand, when the ATIM window
is too large, more ATIMs are sent than there is actually time for the packets.
Figure 4:
Throughput vs. ATIM window size for different beacon intervals, load=60.76%,
8 stations in power save mode
When we used a lower offered load for the simulations the results were basi-
cally the same, though throughput was constant for a broader range of ATIM
window sizes. This was due to the fact that the channel could not be saturated
any more.
In result it was obvious that the ATIM window size should be proportional to
the beacon interval and that it should take 1/4 to 1/3 of the beacon interval.
The next question was to determine the time in doze state in relation to the
total time. In figure 5 one can see that the time in doze state increases when
using shorter beacon intervals.
The simulation shown here was performed at an offered load of about 30%,
because at a higher offered load a station would probably not fall into doze
state very often. In figure 6 we simulated the same scenario as before, but with

224
Figure 5:
Percentage of time in doze state vs. ATIM window size for different beacon
intervals, load=30.72%, 8 stations in PS mode
an offered load of about 15%. It shows that a station can stay in doze mode
up to 70% of the time for beacon intervals small enough to allow for a fast
transmission of the packet.
Figure 6:
Percentage of time in doze state vs. ATIM window size for different beacon
intervals, load=15%
The results can be explained as follows: The bigger the beacon interval the
bigger the possibility that a station wishes to send during that time. This means
that it has to transmit ATIMs in almost every beacon interval and to stay awake
until the transmission is completed. The same applies for a receiving station.

225
In addition to that, more ATIMs per beacon interval have to be transmitted in
bigger beacon intervals, which leads to higher collision rates and longer medium
access times.
5 CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we presented simulations of the power saving mechanism in ad-hoc
networks using the IEEE 802.11 standard. Work on this simulations started at
a time when there was no recommendation for certain values of the parameters
in the current version of the draft standard. In the meantime the values of
interest in this scope are set to be 100 ms for the beacon interval and only 4
ms for the ATIM window.
Based on this work we can recommend figures for the ATIM window and beacon
interval. Generally the mechanism gets less sensitive against the ATIM window
size with higher values for the beacon interval. The simulations showed an
optimum for the throughput at about 95 ms beacon interval. The ratio between
ATIM window and beacon interval should be 1/4 to 1/3. While the first result
corresponds to the value in the draft quite well, there is a “slight” difference
in our recommended size for the ATIM window. This should be explained as
follows: The recommended ATIM window size of only 4 ms (or Kµ s, according
to the standard) will be too small if there are many stations in power save
mode or if the overall load is above 10%. We would definitely recommend for a
higher value of the ATIM window parameter. On the other hand, there should
be a means to adapt the value of this parameter to the offered load or, to be
more exact, to the sum of the offered loads of the stations in PS mode.
The beacon interval should be smaller to lead to longer times in doze state.
There has to be a trade-off between power saving and the overhead needed for
it. If we would sacrifice about 10% in throughput we can save up to 30% more
energy.

Abstract
In this paper, our goal is to study the “bits per joule” efficiency rating of a protocol in the
wireless environment. We explore and compare three approaches to evaluating the energy
efficiency and assess their accuracy and complexity. Although our technique allows us
to accommodate other profiles, for concreteness we model the battery as a device that
has the means to support the transmission of a fixed number of packets. We model the
fading as a Markov channel, and we present some particular results for link error control
protocols. For the particular examples considered, the exact recursive approach and an
asymptotic approach were found to predict results that were very close. In addition, a
lower bound and an approximation lead to analytical expressions. The quality of the
bound and the accuracy of the approximation improves quite quickly as the amount of
available energy increases.

1 INTRODUCTION
In the mobile wireless environment, portable communicators can be seen as devices
that use a finite energy supply to transfer useful information. Thus there is an interest
in understanding the useful “bits per joule” rating of a protocol in a particular environ-
ment. Direct measurements are an effective and accurate way of tracking the energy
efficiency, but such approaches largely fail to provide insight on how to design more
energy efficient protocols. Therefore, we turn to analytical approaches. In this re-
gard, one of the key modeling issues is characterizing the energy consumed per packet
transmitted. This quantity will depend on the nature of the circuits used to process
and transmit the data. Furthermore, saturation effects in the power amplifier imply
that the energy consumed per packet transmitted might depend non-linearly on the
transmitted power level as well. Similarly, the particular type of battery used might
dynamically impact the energy availability characteristic. These and other similar as-
pects of the modeling span a variety of disciplines including RF circuit design for
low power circuits, battery technology, modulation signaling, resource allocation and
protocol design.
The problem of error control over a wireless channel has been studied before. In
[1], a simple link probing scheme, which slows down the transmission rate when the
channel is impaired, was shown to be more energy efficient, in the sense of delivering
a greater amount of data per energy unit with a slight loss in instantaneous throughput.
Bambos and Rulnick have recently studied a related problem [2, 3]. Their work is
concerned with optimizing the power control strategy to maximize the battery life (or,
equivalently, to minimize the transmit power) under QoS constraints. Although the
optimization problem introduced in [4] and the one considered in [2, 3] are not equiv-
alent (having originated from the perspectives of error control and power control), they
lead to similar conclusions about the way in which energy is to be managed.
The thrust of this paper is twofold. First, we extend from an analytical perspective
the scope of the metrics that can be tracked in assessing the energy efficiency of the
protocols. Second, we explore and compare three approaches to evaluating the energy
efficiency, in order to assess their accuracy and complexity.
Although our technique allows us to accommodate other profiles, for concreteness
we model the battery as a device that has the means to support the transmission of
a fixed number of packets. Specifically, we assume the battery maintains a constant
output power until it discharges and ceases to operate. We define the energy efficiency
of a protocol, λ, as
λ = total amount of data delivered
total energy consumed
.
(1)
We explicitly model the fading as a Markov channel. While we take into account
random fluctuations of the channel attenuations, in this paper, we assume that the noise
is of constant power.

229
We derive some particular results by focusing on link error control protocols. Our
technique allows us to accommodate other metrics but for presentation purposes the
operative metric for measuring consumed energy will be the total number of trans-
mitted packets (successful and unsuccessful). We present results that track the total
amount of useful data transferred as a function of the number of transmissions on the
error prone wireless channel.
We describe our model for jointly tracking the evolution of a protocol and the avail-
able charge in Section 2 and introduce throughput and energy consumption metrics in
Section 3. We describe a recursive technique in Section 4. This technique is most
broadly applicable but it is also computationally intensive. Therefore, in Section 5
we present a new bounding technique and compare it with the asymptotic results pre-
viously described in [4] and the recursive technique of Section 4. In the concluding
section we comment on the accuracy and complexity of the various bounding and
approximation techniques.
2 THE GENERAL STOCHASTIC MODEL
Consider a discrete-time process which tracks the protocol evolution by means of a
state machine. Let I(n) ∈ Ω denote the protocol state after the n-th transition, with
Ω the (finite) space of all possible states. We will refer to n as “time,” since the actual
time scale (in slots) will not be explicitly considered in the protocol evolution (its
effect is implicitly taken into account in the definition of the transition metrics).
In order to track the energy status, we consider another random process, C(n),
which tracks the energy drained from the battery in the time interval [0, n]. This
variable is useful in tracking energy-dependent transitions as a function of the available
charge. For analytical convenience, we assume that C( n) is an integer without loss in
generality.
The random process X(n) = (I(n), C(n)) jointly tracks the protocol state and the
charge evolution and is useful in modeling the interaction between protocol evolution
and available charge. We know that the protocol model is Markov. We shall also
assume that the battery charge evolution is Markov, thereby allowing the battery to
have memory [5, 6]. The assumption of a Markovian behavior for the battery energy
process, C(n), results in a Markov behavior for the whole process, X( n).
Let ε be the total energy available, so that after ε  energy units are consumed the
process X(n) = (I(n), C(n)) stops. This might correspond to the complete battery
discharge which causes the device to cease operation. Thus the process X(n) is tran-
sient, with states (i, e), i ∈ Ω,
≥ ε, being absorbing states. The need to allow
≥ ε ,
stems from the possibility of overshoot. By excluding such transitions we would un-
derestimate the rate of transitions into the absorbing state. It may be covenient to think
of states (i, ε), i ∈ Ω as aggregate states entered by all transitions leading to energy

230
levels
≥ ε. Note that, since    must be finite in any real system, the state space of
X (n), given by Ω × {0, 1, . . . , }, is finite.
3 THROUGHPUT AND ENERGY CONSUMPTION METRICS
It is possible to define a set of metrics associated with the state transitions. In general,
a transition metric is a (possibly random) variable ξab (n), such that, given that the
n-th transition occurs from state a to state b, ξab (n) is conditionally independent of
the past and future evolution of the process. Also, we consider the cumulative metric
(also called reward [7]) over transitions 1 to n.
By appropriately defining metrics and by studying the corresponding reward earned
throughout the transient evolution of the process (e.g., the “connection lifetime”), we
study the throughput performance and the energy efficiency.
Let a = (i,
) and b = (j, v) be two states with Pab  = P[X(n) = b |X(n – 1) =
a] > 0. We define the following metrics on transition ab:

Rab : the number of successful transmissions

Cab : the number of consumed energy units.
Note that, according to the definition of the protocol model, Rab only depends on
the protocol states so that Rab  = R ij . (The only care to be taken is that if b is an
absorbing state, then the reward on transition ab may not be earned, as the evolution
is terminated before the transition itself is completed, and Rab = 0. This fact will
be neglected in the following for ease of notation.) On the other hand, the consumed
energy in general depends on the battery status, as this may affect the output power. As
an example, if Tij is the number of packet transmissions associated with the transition
from i to j, and if the energy is consumed only due to radiated power, then we have
Cab  = T ij ω( )∆T, where ω( ) is the transmit power (which in general depends on
the battery state,
), and ∆T is the slot duration.
Note that the following relationship must be true if Pab  > 0.
(2)
For simplicity, we assume here that Cab  is a constant, so that given i, j and
 there is a
unique b for which Pab  > 0. The case in which Cab  is a random variable can be incor-
porated in the model by slightly complicating the transition structure of the process.
This extension appears conceptually straightforward, and will not be considered here
in detail for ease of notation.
Since v is deterministically related to i, j and
Cab and Pab can be alternatively
expressed as
(3)
which are sometimes easier to deal with, as they explicitly contain the information
about the protocol state and the energy level.

231
Note that, although a and j uniquely  determine b, it is not true in general that b and
i will uniquely determine a. In fact, if
(4)
both states a1 = (i,
) and a 2 = (i,
) can lead to state b = (j, ) with a single
transition. For later use, we define for state b = (j, v) the set of states from which it
can be reached with a single transition:
(5)
We remark that, in the case where the battery output power can be made indepen-
dent of the energy status, all the above quantities are independent of
and
4 DYNAMIC EVOLUTION OF X
In order to study the process behavior during the transient evolution, we track jointly
the reward process and the energy consumption process. Define the process R(n) as
the total reward earned in transitions 1 through n. Define
(6)
Then, the following recursive relationship can be established by conditioning on
X(n – 1) and applying the theorem of total probability:
(7)
where δi j is the Kronecker symbol, δ(x) = δx 0 , and where it is understood that
φij (ρ, v ,n) = 0 if v  < 0 or ρ < 0 (this will also apply to all functions through-
out the paper, unless otherwise indicated).
The recursion (7) can be used to find the probability distribution of the reward
earned throughout the whole evolution, i.e., from time 0 to when an absorbing state
(i.e., a state with C(n) = ε ) is entered. In fact, if we let R be this total reward, we
have
(8)
where
, is the probability distribution according to which the initial protocol
state is chosen at time zero, i.e.,
(9)
v

232
Closed-form solution of the recursion (7), e.g., by transform techniques, appears
to be a rather difficult task in general, due to the multiple variables involved. On the
other hand, if we are only interested in the statistics of R, a simplified recursion can
be found by summing (7) over n. Further, if we are interested in the moments of R,
we can also eliminate ρ by multiplying both sides of (7) by the appropriate power of
ρ and summing it from 0 to ∞. As an example, consider the mean E[R]. Define
(10)
Then, we obtain from (7) and (10):
(11)
where
(12)
is the probability that state (m, v) will be visited given that the initial state of the
protocol is chosen according to the probability distribution π(0).
Finally, the average reward can be found from (8), (10) as
(13)
where all “overshoot” states (j, v), v ≥ ε are collapsed into (j, ε ) .
Similar relationships can be established for the variance of R and in principle for
any moment. This approach via recursive technique is therefore very powerful in that
it allows to easily find the statistics of R, while taking into account a possible detailed
dependence of the parameters on the energy status, and is proposed here as a general

233
tool for the exact evaluation of the energy performance. However, even running the
simplified recursion (11) requires a number of operations which increases linearly
with ε (as opposed to ε² for (7)). In the following, we will study some asymptotic
properties of the process X(n), which will help us find simple approximations for
the quantities of interest in the situations where direct solution of the recursion is
impractical, i.e., for large ε.
5 SPECIAL CASE: FLAT PROFILE
As a first step, we will restrict our analysis to the case of flat power profile, in which
the transition probabilities and metrics do not depend on the energy state,
. This case
is an idealization of a regulation mechanism which tries to keep the battery output
power constant while the battery discharges, and can be taken as a fair approximation
of real devices. Also, it can be considered as a good model if the focus is on a single
connection which is allocated a small portion of the total battery energy, so that the
battery behavior can be considered ideal throughout its duration. Furthermore, the
results obtained in this case will provide a useful tool for approximate analysis of the
general case.
The first obvious simplification which is obtained in this case is that the recursion
coefficients are constant numbers, i.e., Pi j  (
) = Pij and Cij ( ) = Cij for all values
of
, except for those transitions leading to the absorbing states, where some bound-
ary conditions must be satisfied. This simplifies the description of the evolution, but
does not decrease the compexity of the recursion. More significant simplifications are
discussed next.
5.1
Asymptotic result
Due to the independence of the metrics of the energy dimension, we can simplify the
analysis by collapsing all states (i,
) into a single state i. The process I(n) is now
a homogeneous Markov chain (it is non homogeneous in the general case), and can
be studied more easily. In particular, let us arbitrarily choose one state, l ∈ Ω. Then,
the visits of the process I(n) to state l are renewal instants, and the system evolution
repeats itself (in a statistical sense).
More specifically, consider the renewal instants, i.e., of the sequence of integers
{nk, k = 0,1, . . .}, such that n k < n k +l, I(nk) = l and I (n) ≠ l for n k , < n <
nk + 1 ,  with I(n0) = I (0) = l by definition (extension to random I(0) is also pos-
sible). Let Rk and Ck be the reward earned and the energy consumed between the
(k – 1)-st and the k-th visit, i.e., in (nk – 1 , nk ] (also called the k-th interrenewal time),
and consider the vector process
(14)

234
In an attempt to avoid confusion, we will use the index k for renewals, as opposed to n
which was used for transitions. Also, calligraphic letters will be used for variables in
this renewal process setting (e.g., R(k) = R(nk), and Rk and Ri j denote the reward
earned during the k-th interrenewal interval and during transition ij, respectively).
The problem of finding the total reward is equivalent to finding the value of R( k )
given that C(k – 1) < ε ≤ C(k). In this context, X(k) is a stopped random walk
[8]. If ε is the total amount of energy available, it is possible to show, using renewal
theory, that
where πj, j ∈ Ω, is the steady-state distribution of the chain I(n). Therefore, from
simple Markov analysis, it is possible to find the asymptotic energy efficiency of the
scheme, λ ∞. The total reward is in this case given by
(15)
(16)
and is of course infinite for ε → ∞. However, the result (16), which is rigorously
true only in the limit, holds asymptotically as ε is large. In particular, it is expected to
hold in practice, where the batteries are supposed to be able to transmit a large number
of data units. Some experiments we made comparing (16) with the results obtained
by running the recursion show that even for moderate values of ε the difference is
negligible.
5.2
Finite values of ε
To study the behavior of the process in further detail, we consider here the rate of
convergence to the above asymptotic result. Note that the value of λ∞obtained in
(15) is not a random variable. On the other hand, for every finite value of ε, the total
reward R and the energy efficiency λ are random variables. In this subsection, we are
interested in the statistics of R for finite ε.
Let L denote the random variable that represents the renewal cycle in which the
total consumed energy reaches the limit of ε. From the renewal property, the random
vectors (Ri , Ci ) and (Rj , Cj ) are independent and identically distributed for i ≠ j
and, in particular, E[Ri] = r, E[Ci] = c for all i. However, R i and Ci are allowed to
be (and often are) statistically dependent. Since
(17)
L is a stopping time [7] relative to the family {(Ri, Ci), i ≥ 1}. Note that the exact
value of C(L) is difficult to determine, due to the fact that the L-th renewal interval is

235
(25)
not “typical.” Therefore, from (17) we can only conclude that E[C(L)]  ≥ ε, so that
(18)
(19)
Now we are interested in finding the total number of rewards, R, earned during the
time the energy ε was consumed. To this aim, let us again consider the vector process
(Ri, Ci), i ≥ 1. Since L is a stopping time, we have from Wald’s equation that [7]
(20)
Consider the Markov chain which tracks the protocol evolution, I(n) (n denotes
here the number of actual transitions, not renewals). This chain visits state l at renewal
instants. Define vil as the first passage time from state i to state l, i.e.,
(21)
(23)
Let γ i be the probability that the chain is in state i when the total energy consumed
reaches ε. Then, the additional reward earned until the next renewal is given by Fil,
so that
(24)
Note that, if we interpret the reward as time, Fil can itself be seen as a “first passage
time” from state i to l. The statistics of Fil, and in particular
 il , can be readily
computed from [9, Ch. 10].
and
Also, let Fil and
 il  be the reward earned during vil and its expected value, respec-
tively, i.e.,
(22)

236
(26)
Since the renewal state l is chosen arbitrarily, (25) holds for any l, and the tightest
bound is given by
Another approach to the computation of the rewards earned can be developed by
considering an auxiliary renewal process whose interrenewals are the random vari-
ables Ri. Inspecting this process at the time that the battery is discharged, one finds
the atypical interrenewal interval RL  whose length can be deduced from the age and
residual life results of renewal theory [7]. Assuming steady state operation allows us
to use the asympototically true analytical representation of the mean residual life as
an approximation. This approach results in the estimate
(27)
Figure 1 shows the results obtained for the energy efficiency using the various com-
putational techniques illistrated so far, i.e., the recursive technique of Section 4, the
asymptotic result (15), the lower bound (26) and the approximation (27). The protocol
considered is ARQ GBN, whose description in terms of Markov structure and re-
ward/energy parameters is given in [1] (the round-trip delay is 3 slots in this example).
Different sets of curves correspond to different noise levels, with F the corresponding
fading margin. It can be seen that the asymptotic result is an excellent approxima-
tion of the exact value obtained via the recursive technique. The bound (26) and the
approximation (27) also converge very quickly to the exact value.
6 GENERAL PROFILE
The results of the previous section were derived assuming a flat profile, where all the
transition metrics and probabilities were independent of the energy state. This as-
sumption, although useful for analytical purposes, may not always be true in practice.
In fact it is known that in general the constant power discharge regime is less efficient
than constant load or constant current, and degrades cell capacity [5, 6]. In this situa-
tion, it is not unreasonable to give up on the perfect power regulation (flat profile), in
favor of an increased battery efficiency.
Therefore the flat power profile, besides being an idealization of what a power reg-
ulator can actually do, may not correspond to the way in which the battery is operated
anyway, and consideration of more general profiles is of great practical relevance.
Nevertheless, the asymptotic results of the previous section can be used to obtain an
accurate approximation when the power profile varies slowly as the battery energy
decreases.

of the graph and that stage ε (all available energy consumed) is at the right end. Let
us divide the flow graph into a number of consecutive segments in such a way that
the transition parameters within each one of them exhibit negligible variations. Let
the sequence {
, k = 0, 1, . . . , T} be chosen so that
<
+1, with
= 0 and
= ε. Also, let the transition metrics in [
) exhibit negligible variation, so
that
A profile will be said smooth if the number of stages contained in each segment is
sufficiently large as to allow application of the asymptotic result, e.g., if
Cmax,  with Cmax  the maximum amount of energy consumed during a transition. The
bound given in (26) holds for any finite value of ε, and therefore can be used to bound
the total reward in this case as well.
Note that the process will largely visit the segments in order, from left to right when
the profile is smooth. Assuming that this is always the case makes it possible to deduce

238
the total reward earned in a simple way. Let ik be the protocol state when the process
X(n) enters the k-th. segment for the first time. Then, the total reward can be written
as
(29)
where ∆Rk  is the reward earned while the process was flowing through the k-th seg-
ment of the graph, and depends in general on both ik and
. Under the assumption
of smooth profile, we can assume that in each segment the steady-state is reached, so
that
(30)
and the dependence on the initial protocol state ik vanishes. We can then rewrite (29)
as
(31)
which makes it possible to compute the total reward by integrating the energy effi-
ciency curve with respect to the energy state of the battery. This curve can be either
computed via Markov analysis (as was done in [4]) or directly measured in an experi-
ment.
6.1
Non-smooth power profiles
There are situations where the smooth profile model is not applicable. As an example,
consider the results in [5], where pulsed discharge of a battery is considered. It is
shown that as soon as current is drained from the battery, the voltage exhibits a sudden
drop and then decreases more gracefully. Similarly, during the times in which cur-
rent is not drained, the voltage recovers up to some level, due to chemical relaxation
processes.
Therefore, a more accurate model at a finer time scale could take into account this
“charge recovery” mechanism. In this latter case, it is clear that the evolution of the
battery state C(n) is not graceful and smooth, but can exhibit rather large fluctuations
(up to about 33% of the maximum voltage in the example reported in [5, Fig. 15]).
Therefore, the evolution of X(n) through the flow graph, although showing a slow
general trend from left to right, will fluctuate back and forth throughout the graph
itself.
Such a behavior clearly violates the assumption of smooth profile but the recur-
sive approach, which does not rely on any major assumption, will provide the correct
solution in this case as well.

7 CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we studied and compared a collection of results pertaining to the energy
efficiency of link error control protocols. The most comprehensive of them is the re-
cursive approach of Section 4. This approach can track arbitrary power profiles but
can be computationally burdensome. At the other extreme is the asymptotic techique
which predicts the efficiency accurately in the limit as ε → ∞. For the particular ex-
amples considered the two approaches were found to agree very closely. Furthermore,
the recursive technique is computational and does not result in analytical expressions.
In contrast, the lower bound and approximations of Sections 4 and 5 lead to analytical
expressions. The quality of the bound and the accuracy of the approximation improves
as ε → ∞. In other examples perhaps the accuracy and quality of the bounds will be
different but our choice of the renewal instant appears to recur frequently enough to
render the asymptotic results first presented in [4] quite accurate.
As a final remark, we note that the unavailability of data regarding the battery
behavior under dynamic discharge conditions, especially at the time scales involved
in packet data transmission (miliseconds), makes it difficult to accurately assess the
effect of the battery behavior on the energy efficiency. It seems that such studies
would be of great help to the protocol designer, and should be performed and made
available. The techniques presented here do not depend on such data, and can be
applied using results computed by analysis or generated by simulation, as well as
experimental measurements.

Abstract:
In this work, we study a simple admission control scheme for high speed
packet data service over the reverse link of an IS-95 based CDMA air interface.
A preliminary version of this scheme was originally proposed in [3] and admits
data users on a burst level. In this work, we study the performance and design
tradeoffs through simulations. The basic tradeoff is the coverage of high speed
packet data service and its impact on outage experienced by the voice users.
The results indicate that through limiting the region where high speed data
service is available, the performance impact on voice users can be made small.
It is possible to extend the region of coverage of high speed data by using more
complex schemes proposed in [3]. These schemes are subject of future work.

Introduction
IS-95 based systems operate in circuit mode, assume a homogeneous user popu-
lation, and limit each user to a rate which is a very small fraction of the system
capacity. Users at higher data rates in a system with mixed traffic cause adja-
cent cell interference variations which can degrade system capacity. High speed
data needs strict admission controls as compared to the voice calls because of
the interference generated by these users at adjacent cells. The idea behind this
scheme is to control the tails of the out-of-cell interference caused by the data
user through burst admission. In this scheme, a data user burst is admitted if
the interference caused at the adjacent cells is below a predetermined threshold.
This can be estimated indirectly through the pilot strength measurements at
the mobile.
Consider the reverse link of a system in which distributed high data rate
users in a cellular environment share the cellular CDMA band with conventional

242
mobile cellular voice and circuit-mode data users. Burst admission schemes can
be designed using:
1. The load information in the cell and its neighbors,
2. The pilot strength measurements provided by the mobile, and
3. Coordination of the burst rate, burst length and burst starting time be-
tween neighbor cells.
In this work, we study the utilization of the radio resources assuming that
network resources are always available at the sectors with which the mobile
is in soft-handoff. Our strategy is to assume that the interference caused by
the mobile at adjacent sectors is acceptable if the corresponding pilot is below
a threshold parameterized by T burst . We study the interference and outage
probability for this strategy, as a function of T burst. The rest of the document
is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the burst access algorithm.
This algorithm is studied through detailed simulations in the sequel. Section
3 describes the simulation environment used, followed by a discussion of the
bandwidth and coverage tradeoffs in Sections 4 and 5. Finally, we conclude in
Section 6.

Burst Access Mechanism
2.1
Quiescent Mode
As shown in Figure 1, an active high rate mobile is assigned a basic “full” rate
channel on origination. Parameters of the high data rate service are negotiated
at that point. The mobile then goes into a quiescent mode if it has no data to
transmit. When a user is quiescent, a very low rate (say) eighth rate (sub-rate)
signaling channel is maintained using its primary code. This sub-rate channel
helps in maintaining synchronization and coarse power control. It is maintained
whether the user is “connected” to one base station or is in soft handoff with
multiple cells. This basic channel may be considered a signaling channel for
high data rate service.
2.2
Burst Access Request
Since the transmission during eighth rate frames is intermittent, both the syn-
chronization and the power control are inadequate if the quiescent period is
long. Hence, any transmission from the mobile after a long quiescent period
may be lost. This can be easily fixed by requiring the mobile to transmit one
(or more) idle basic rate frame at the end of a “long” quiescent period. Fol-
lowing the idle frame(s) that give the receiver time to synchronize and provide
power control feedback, the mobile signals a request for data transmission us-
ing signaling messages over the basic (full) rate channel. Alternately, instead of
the idle frames, the mobile could be required to transmit the request multiple
times.
The access request from the mobile contains the data rate requested and the
burst length requested. The maximum burst length that may be requested is

specified by the system (and is chosen to best coordinate shared access between
users). In addition, to provide interference information to the base station, the
mobile includes pilot strength information for cells in its neighbor list within
the access request ¹. This indicates the interference levels that will be seen at
the neighboring basestations due to transmissions from the mobile.
2.3  Access Control Mechanisms
Once the burst request is received at the base station, the network must coordi-
nate access with other requests as well as with the voice load already offered to
the system. Based on all information available, the network makes a decision to
either accept, delay or deny the request. It then creates the assignment message
and transmits it to the mobile.
The following section describes the simulation environment used to study
one such access control mechanism.
3
Simulation Description
The access schemes use load information about neighbor cells to determine what
data rate is to be permitted. Simple thresholds on load can be compared with
reported pilot measurements to determine the permitted data rate for a burst.
Alternatively, the voice load can be reduced to design an access control that
shares bandwidth in a more static manner.
Here we study the effectiveness of such a scheme through simulations. In
particular, we study the performance of this scheme as a function of thresholds
used for admission control and the length of the burst admitted.
The simulation environment consists of a hexagonal grid with base stations
located at the center of every hexagon. A single mobile’s operation is simulated
in detail, accounting for the following system features:
1. realistic antenna patterns for three-sector cells,
2. IS-95 handoff algorithm details,
3. handoff processing and messaging delays.
Details of the simulation environment follow.
Propagation Loss The propagation model has two components: distance
loss and shadow fading. The distance loss is taken as d– α , where α is the
propagation constant. Hence the attenuation in dB is given as
a(d) = K 1 + 10 αlog(d) + u (d)
(1)
where the first two components denote the distance loss, K1 being the path loss
at unit distance and u(d) is the loss due to shadowing.
¹ The inclusion of the pilot strength measurements within the access request is independent
of (and in addition to) any such reports used for handling soft handoffs. We assume that the
soft handoff procedures defined in IS95 are left unchanged.

245
Fading Model We assume suffficient averaging of the signal strength mea-
surements to smooth out Fast fading. For slow or shadow fading, two models
are simulated: the first of them is lognormal with exponential correlation func-
tion as suggested in [4]. That is, u(d) is zero mean stationary Gaussian process
with correlation
(2)
where σs is the standard deviation of shadow fading and d 0  determines how
fast the correlation decays with distance. For a vehicle moving at speed v
meters/second, the spatial correlation translates into time correlation so that
(3)
The second model used for Shadow fading is the Mawira model [5], which
simulates urban environment. It is the sum of two independent lognormal
components v and w, each with correlation function given in (3), but with
different correlation distance and variance. The first component, v has large
variance and short correlation distance, and second component a small variance
with large correlation length. Thus, according to this model, the shadow fading
in dB domain is given by
u(d) = v(d) + w (d)
(4)
where v(d) and w(d) are zero mean Gaussian processes.
Mobility Model The mobile chooses a random starting location and direc-
tion of motion at the beginning of the call. It traverses in a straight line until
the call is completed. Starting location is uniformly distributed over the entire
area of the cell; direction of motion is uniformly distributed in [0, 2π]. Call
holding time and the speed of the mobile are taken to be constant.
Power Control Since our interest is in studying the coverage aspects, we
focus on the pilot which is transmitted at a fixed power level. We assume that
the reverse link power control completely compensates for the distance loss and
shadow fading. The interference generated at the adjacent cells is determined
by the best active pilot. The mobile is assumed to transmit at a power level
that is needed so that an adequate signal level is received at this cell. The other
cells see interference corresponding to this transmit power level.
Handoff Algorithm The mobile and the network follow the IS-95 handoff
algorithms. During the length of the call, the mobile keeps monitoring the pilot
signal to interference ratio or Ec /I0, where E c is the chip energy and I0 is the
total received power spectral density. Handoff decisions are made at {k Tm }
where k is an integer and Tm  is the pilot strength measurement interval.
If, after going through the handoff evaluation sequence, the mobile finds all
its active pilots dropped, the call is assumed dropped due to pilot loss.

246
Burst Access In the burst access mode, the data mobile makes a request
to send a burst every Rburst seconds. The mobile request is admitted after a
delay of Dburst seconds if the Ec /No of the largest non-active pilot is below a
threshold Tburst and the mobile is not in the handoff processing mode, that is,
in the process of adding or dropping a leg. Otherwise, the burst admission is
denied. A burst transmission is interrupted when a soft handoff add trigger
comes in.
The algorithm is studied as a function of Tburst. The metrics that are of
importance in studying the performance of the algorithm are: fraction of the
burst requests that are admitted, average burst length that determines the
througput and the distribution of interference caused at the adjacent sectors.
4 Bandwidth Tradeoffs
The access schemes provide a simple mechanism to tradeoff bandwidth between
circuit-mode voice users and packet mode access by high rate data users. Thus
a single access scheme permits dynamic sharing of bandwidth between voice
and data users. The bandwidth that a data user can be permitted to transmit
depends on (i) the number of voice users already admitted in the cell and its
neighbors, and (ii) the position of the high rate data user requesting burst
access.
This simulation can be used to study the effectiveness of the burst admis-
sion strategies in terms of the fraction of burst requests admitted, the burst
throughput achieved and the interference caused at the adjacent sectors. The
probability density function (pdf) of the interference generated at each cells by
this single mobile is collected from the simulation. These pdfs are computed
for each of the following scenarios:
1. a full rate circuit-mode mobile, pc,j , where j denotes the cell index,
2. a voice mobile, pv , j ,
3. a mobile following the burst admission strategy described here, p d,j.
We now use symmetry to obtain the distribution of total signal power generated
at base station 0 when there is one mobile per cell. For example, the distribution
of received power due to one voice mobile in each of the cells is given
(5)
where ⊗ denotes convolution and M is the number of adjacent cells which
contribute reverse link interference.
These pdfs are then further convolved to obtain the distribution of interfer-
ence due to a given mix of voice and data users. That is, if there are Nv  voice
users and N d packet-mode data users, then the resulting interference distribu-
tion on the uplink is obtained as
(6)

247
The expression for outage, defined as the probability of the Signal to Interfer-
ence Ratio falling below a threshold IT  can be computed from (6) as
(7)
I T is assumed to be the same for both data and voice users and is computed
using the methodology described in [1].
The parameter values used in obtaining Po u t are: T A d d = –12dB, TD r o p =
– 16dB, TTdrop =3 sec. and path loss exponent is 4. Shadow fading is simu-
lated using the Mawira model with standard deviations: 5.4dB and 4.2dB and
correlation lengths 100m and 1000m respectively. In Figs. 2 and 3, the mobile
speed is assumed to be 35 miles per hour.
Fig. 2 shows the outage of the system as a function of the number of Rate
Set 1 voice users. The voice activity factor is taken to be 3/8. In idle mode, we
assume that they are transmitting eighth rate frames. It can be seen from this
plot that the capacity of the system is 22 voice users per cell at 5% outage and
18.5 voice users at 1% outage. The outage is computed assuming an Eb/No
requirement of 7 dB. Within the approximations of the simulation, these results
are reasonable.
Figure 2: Outage of the system with only voice users
In Figs. 3 and 4, we plot the outage experienced when there is one data
user per sector operating in either circuit or packet mode at 57.6 kbps (4-codes
aggregated, each at 14.4 kbps). The circuit mode data user is active with
activity factor 1. We also assume that there is one packet-mode data user
active at any given time. The access mechanism could be designed to ensure
this. The packet mode data user follows the burst access scheme described in
Section 3, with D burst = 1sec. Fig. 3 is parameterized with the burst threshold
Tburst.
Some salients points from simulation:

248

factor=1: Impact of threshold on voice capacity
Figure 4: Outage with one high speed data channel at 57.6 kbps, and activity
factor=1: Impact of mobile speed on voice capacity

249
• From Fig. 3, we observe that when the data user is operating in circuit
mode, the system can support 7 voice users at 5% outage. Since the 6
codes corresponding to the data user are active all the time, the data
throughput on each of those codes is approximately 1/voice_activity or
2.2 times higher than that of a voice user. This gives an equivalent total
throughput of 7 + 2.2 × 6 = 20.2 voice users when there is one high-rate
circuit mode data user active. It translates to a loss of 8% in capacity.
• In packet mode data, the burst admission control strategy ensures that
the data users that cause excessive interference at the neighbors are not
admitted. This results in higher capacities than is the case with circuit
mode data. For the range of parameters considered in Fig. 3, we see that
the capacity penalty can be completely eliminated. The penalty paid
for this improved capacity is the lower coverage for the high speed data
service described in Section 5.
• Fig. 4 shows the capacity plots as a function of the mobile speed. Assum-
ing an Eb/No requirement of 5 dB for mobiles at 5 mph results in 45%
higher capacity for the voice users.
5 
Coverage for High Speed Data
We use static simulations to obtain the coverage plots for the high speed data.
These are obtained using the following steps:
1. At each point, generate shadow fading to all the adjacent sectors and also
compute the corresponding path loss. Use this to estimate the Ec/Io cor-
responding to all the pilots. The mobile is assumed to be in soft-handoff
with all the base stations whose pilot strengths exceed the threshold TAdd.
2. If the best non-active pilot strength falls below Tburst , burst is admitted.
3. Repeat steps 1–2 above Niter times keeping track of the fraction of itera-
tions over which the burst is admitted.
Fig. 5 shows the the burst admission probability obtained in step 3 above for
Tburst = –14dB as a function of normanized distance from the cell site. These
simulations assume that the mobile does not send a burst admission request
when the mobile is in the handoff processing mode. We make the following
observations for the coverage of the high speed data users:
• Burst admission probability gets smaller as we approach the cell boundary.
• if Tb u r s t = TAdd , the burst request is never denied. The penalty paid here
is the outage experienced by the voice users. This can be traded off by
taking a capacity hit on the voice users. The tradeoffs are quantified in
Table 1.
• For a given burst length, lowering Tburst reduces the outage experienced
by the voice users. But this also limits the region over which high speed
data service is availablie. For instance, with Rburst  – Dburst  = 3 sec.,

250
Figure 5: Admission Probabilities (Reverse Link)
the area over which the service is available changes from 68% to 35% on
reducing Tburst from –14dB to –18dB (Table 1).

Conclusions
A simple burst admission control scheme that limits access based on the pilot
strength measurements from the mobile is studied. The burst allocation is done
for a fixed maximum duration. The mobile terminates the burst transmission
when a handoff add trigger is generated.
The simulation results indicate that high speed data service can be provided
over 65% of the area through a simple scheme that only looks at the local mea-
surements made by the mobile. Larger burst lengths lead to higher probability
of being interrupted, which may mean that the mobile will retry for the high
speed service once the handoff processing is completed. Even better coverage
over area can be achieved through using higher values for Tburst and taking a
hit on the voice capacity.
Note that all the discussion in this paper corresponds to the coverage for
high-speed data. Better coverage can be provided by trading off data rates for

251
outage.

ABSTRACT
1. INTRODUCTION
We report on theoretical studies of higher bit-rates for burst mode communication in
wireless LANs and wireless interbuilding links. We present an information theoretic
investigation of the benefits of multi-element arrays (MEAs) for communicating in a
narrowband Rayleigh fading environment. While the channel is assumed unknown
We report on theoretical studies for higher bit-rates for burst mode communication in
wireless LANs and wireless interbuilding links. We discuss an information theoretic
investigation of the benefits of multi-element arrays (MEAs) when communicating in
a narrowband Rayleigh fading environment. While the channel is unknown at the
transmitter, it is assumed known (tracked) at the receiver. Say that the same number
of antennas, n, is used at both sites and that beside bandwidth, total radiated power is
fixed. We show that for large n capacity increases linearly with n. The signal
components launched from distinct transmit elements interfere at the receiver but in
the large n, large ρ, realm, capacity is the same as if there were no interference but
SNR was reduced by 10·log 10e ≈ 4.343 dB (e ≈ 2.7183...). The derivations hint
at the existence of an architecture with extraordinary capacity that can be approached
using one dimensional codecs as building blocks. We exhibit this means of
communication, which is termed the layered space-time architecture because of the
way signals are stratified along diagonals in space-time.

254
at the transmitter, it is known (tracked) at the receiver. We also discuss an
architecture aimed at delivering a significant fraction of the great capacities
uncovered
Assume that the volumes to be occupied by the transmitter and receiver are very far
apart on the scale of a wavelength. Also assume that each of the volumes is ample
on the scale of a wavelength (at least several wavelengths in the largest dimension).
Fix the following:
• Carrier (.8 to 60 GHZ)
• Total radiated power
• (n T,  nR) = (no. transmit antennas, no. receive antennas)
We address the questions: How many error free bits/sec/Hz can be delivered from the
space the transmitter occupies to the distant space that the receiver occupies — no
limit on processing complexity? Then, accounting for complexity: For a specified
low BER, how can the ultimate bit rate be approached? We will discuss some recent
progress toward answering these questions.
The scope here is limited to a single point-to-point channel. We take the perspective
of discrete time complex baseband involving a fixed linear matrix channel with
additive white gaussian noise (AWGN). Although fixed, the channel can vary
randomly from burst to burst. We assume that the burst is long enough that the
standard information theoretic infinite time horizon view provides a meaningful
idealization. First we need to specify the framework of our analysis.
2. MATHEMATICAL MODEL FOR THE WIRELESS CHANNEL
Following [1-2] we list some basic assumptions. We use m–D in describing a vector
as m dimensional, meaning that it has m complex components (2m components
totaling real plus imaginary).
• TRANSMITTED SIGNAL s(t): The total power is constrained to
regardless
of the value of nT (the dimension of s(t)). The bandwidth is narrow enough
that we can treat the channel frequency characteristic as flat over frequency.
• NOISE AT RECEIVER v(t): complex nR – D AWGN with statistically
independent components of identical power N at each of the nR receiver
branches.
• RECEIVED SIGNAL r(t): nR –D received signal so that at each point in time
there is one complex vector component per receive antenna. When there is only
one transmit antenna, it radiates power
and we denote the average power at
the output of each of the receiver branches by P.
• AVERAGE SNR AT EACH RECEIVER BRANCH: ρ = P/N independent of
nT.
• MATRIX CHANNEL IMPULSE RESPONSE: g(t) has nT columns and nR
rows. We use G(f) for the Fourier transform of g(t). Consistent with the
narrowband assumption, we treat this (matrix) transform as constant over the
band of interest, writing G, suppressing the frequency dependence. So, except
for g(O), g(t) is the zero matrix. As we will see in the following sections, it will

255
be convenient to represent the matrix channel response in normalized form,
h(t). Specifically, related to G, we have the matrix H, where the equation
H defines the relationship so, g(t)
The following standard notation will be needed: ' for vector transpose, † for
transpose conjugate, In for the n×n identity matrix, E{.} for expectation and * for
convolution.
The equation for communicating over the channel is
(1)
The added vectors are complex n R –D vectors. Using the narrowband assumption,
we simplify, replacing convolution by product and write
(2)
3. GENERALIZED CAPACITY FORMULA AND SOME EXAMPLES
It is essential to have the nT transmit elements convey different signal constituents.
Starting from fundamentals in [3], the following generalized formula for capacity, C,
can be derived [1]:
(3)
Here H is an n T× nRmatrix, ρ is the spatial average SNR at each of the received
array elements and det means determinant.
We will often deal with H as a random matrix. Our idealized representation of
Rayleigh fading has it that the entries of H are complex iid Gaussians of zero mean
and unit variance. The real and imaginary part of each entry are independent of each
other and of variance ½. As mentioned in Section 1, the view in many of our
applications is that the channel, though random, is fixed during a communication
burst. Then we take a "quasi-static" perspective treating capacity as a random
variable.
Since the available surface areas of the transmit and receive regions can be paved
with a lattice (spacing of the order of λ) of approximately independent omni-antenna
elements there is an opportunity for an enormous number of useful elements [4-5].
Eg, at 7.5 GHz λ is only ≈ 4 cm.
Modifying the array location causes the channel to change. Later we will give some
plots of the complementary cumulative distribution functions (CCDFs) of capacity.
Typically we are interested the the small outage tail and will hold the
Probability [outage] to under 1 to 2% or so.

256
It is important to note that, remarkably, it is possible to code over an ensemble of
channels even though the channel is unknown to the transmitter [6-7].
Next, for reference, we use (3) to list some capacity formulas for the simplest cases,
namely when n T = 1 and nR = n. These simple architectures are well known
architectures. First we give the capacity of what is referred to as the maximum ratio
combining structure. Since the n received signals are optimally combined we will
abbreviate this case as OC(n) This optimum receive diversity formula is:
(4)
For the Rayleigh environment this formula becomes

For expressiveness in the presentation of this formula (and in several other formulas
in this paper) we take a notational liberty writing
 to directly convey a chi-
squared variate with 2n degrees of freedom (DOF). Since we have assumed that the
underlying real and imaginary Gaussian variates have variance ½ it is also
nonstandard that 
 = n instead of the standard expectation of 2n for 
Selection diversity is a form of diversity that is often contrasted with OC(n).
Selection diversity capacity is the capacity offered by the best of the nR channels. In
the Rayleigh case we have:

We also include the (n, 1) case assuming Rayleigh fading. This transmit diversity
capacity formula is

Figures 1, 2 and 3 show some complementary cumulative distribution functions
(ccdfs) of capacity.

257
Figure 1 below shows the case of (3, 3) for various SNRs. in increments of 3 dB.
These are shown in bold. For contrast the corresponding (1, 1) cases are shown in
regular line curves. Note that for 21 dB Po u t = 1% the (3, 3) capacity exceeds
about 13 bits/cycle while for n = 1 there is only about one bit/cycle. While
13 bits/cycle may seem very large it amounts to about 4.33 bits/cycle/dimension.
FIGURE 1: CAPACITY CCDFs TAILS FOR (1,1) AND (3.3) CASES

258
Figure 2 shows some comparisons with a (4, 4) system for an SNR of 21 dB. We
see the (4, 4) capacity is significantly greater than the OC(4) capacity: at Po u t  = 1%
we get 19 bits/cycle versus 6.7 bits/cycle. OC(n) has the implementation advantage
of being based on 1–D codec technology. However, while as n increases, OC(n) is
significantly better than a (1,1) system, capacity only scales logarithmically with n.
In Figure 2 selection diversity is seen to perform somewhat worse than OC(4) as it
must, and transmit diversity (4, 1) diversity is still worse.
FIGURE 2: CAPACITY CCDFs: CONTRASTS WITH (4, 4) CASE

259
Figure 3 shows some comparisons for a (32, 32) system for an SNR of 21 dB. Now
the departure in performance between OC(n) and (n, n) at say the 99%–tile is seen
to be enormous. Eg, for (32, 32), at 1% outage and 21 dB average SNR at each of
the receiving antenna elements, we get 182 bps/Hz which is over 16 times the
capacity for OC(32). From a signal constellation standpoint it may seem
unreasonable to strive for a significant fraction of such a huge capacity. Moreover,
182 bps/Hz is merely for n = 32, in some applications n could easily be larger.
However, later we point out that (n, n) systems can be designed for which it is n
lower component capacities, one for each of the n signaling dimensions, that is
relevant from the standpoint of signal constellations.

5. LOWER BOUND ON CAPACITY
Toward the goal of understanding how the great bit rates that are possible at low
outages might be approached, an especially expressive lower bound on the capacity
of combined transmit-receive diversity is very useful. In the case nR = n T = n, this
bound, which holds with probability one is

Above the
represent a finite sequence of independent chi-squared variates with
2k DOF and mean k.
5.1 Derivation of the Lower Bound on Capacity
A detailed derivation of the lower bound is now given. Use m for nT and n for n R.
We say two that two m×n matrices A and B are unitarily equivalent [8] if there
exists two matrices U and V such that A = UBV† We derive a lower bound on
capacity using the following result on random matrices from [9-10]:
The matrix H is unitarily equivalent to the m by n matrix given below:

where
and
are distributed as χ² variables with j DOF (i.e.
). The x and y
elements here are all non-negative and independent. All matrix entries below the y
stripe and to the right of the x stripe are understood to be zero.
We use the representation (8) to rewrite
. First define
and
. Then
is the
(9)
We have displayed all nonzero entries in the first three and last rows.
In what follows let DET = det
. Expanding the product of the n
main diagonal entries we see that we get L + Q where
(10)

261
(12)
and Q is a positive random variable obtained by summing over only positive terms.
The special symmetric tridiagonal structure exhibited in (9) will now enable us to
establish L as the lower bond.
The standard definition of determinant involves a signed sum over n! n–fold
products. Each n–fold product is the product of the n terms indicated by a
permutation matrix. Let σ k k = 1, 2, · · · n! denote these signed summands
comprising DET each one of which is an n–fold product. We remind the reader that
every permutation is a product of transpositions and the negatively signed
contributions to a determinant are those that involve an odd number of transpositions
[8]. We will look at the structure of each of the nondiagonal n–fold products.
Note that an above diagonal term, say the i (i + 1) entry, has the possibility of
appearing as a multiplier in a nonzero σk only if its counterpart in the (i + 1)i
position below the diagonal also appears as a multiplier. (Since these two entries are
equal the i(i + 1) multiplier appears squared in σk.) Suppose the (i + 1)i entry was
not also included. We need to include exactly one entry from each row and column.
So the only other option among the (n–1)! terms that involve the i(i+1) entry that
have at least n – 1 nonzero multiplicands is easily seen to be that σk forced to include
the entire superdiagonal in the n–fold product. However, even that σkmust be zero.
The reason such a σk = 0 is that including the entire superdiagonal forces the
inclusion of the lower left corner entry among the n multipliers. The reason that the
lower left corner entry, the n1 entry zero, is forced to be a multiplicand is again that
exactly one entry from each row and column is required to qualify a permutation
matrix.
Now that we have detailed the form of the negative σk we can see why it is that their
sum does not undermine the bound. Indeed, we shall see that each such negative σk
is cancelled. To see the cancellation, look at the structure of the terms in the product
of the ii and (i + 1)( i + 1) entries, specifically, look at the perfect square terms apart
from those that give rise to L. It is immediate that each of the negative σk is
cancelled by a distinct positive contribution to Q. Since Q contains more terms than
those needed to cancel all the negative σk , we get that C > L with probability one.
See [2] for a discussion of the large n, large ρ, asymptotic equivalence of C and L.
5.2
Capacity Lower Bound Analysis For A Large Number of Antennas
Using L to denote this lower bound, it easily follows that, in the limit of large n, L/n
becomes
(11)
To get this result simply notice that the left hand side of (11) is a discretization of the
integral of log 2 (1 + ρx) with respect to x over [0,1]. In the limit of large ρ

262
6. THE LAYERED SPACE-TIME ARCHITECTURE
We see that for this (n, n) case, despite the fact that the n received waves interfere
randomly, capacity grows linearly with n. What is the cost of the interference
between the waves from different transmitters? That is an easy question to answer.
Just compare (12) with what one gets with n distinct OC(n) systems each transmitter
transmitting power
/n, but each having its own separate set of n receivers. In other
words compare with the capacity, C(n), that would be if there were no interference.
We need to sum over n instances of (4a), except that, because of the reduced transmit
power, we need to replace ρ by ρ/n in (4a). In such a case the C(n)/n ratio goes to
log 2(1 + ρ). So the cost of the interference is that ρ gets replaced by ρ/ e in the
capacity formula, a cost of about 4.343 dB in average SNR.
In most 1-D information theory analyses one learns what ultimate rates are possible
but not how to obtain the rates. However, as regards the spatial aspect of
communication system design, our multidimensional MEA analysis hints how to
design an architecture approaching capacity. Specifically, interpreting the
aforementioned lower bound, L, in terms of OC(k) systems (k = 1, 2, ... n) is very
informative to the design process as we will now show.
It is encouraging to know that the (n, n) system has capacity linear in n. A goal is to
synthesize an (n, n) architecture of great capacity using 1–D codecs as building
blocks avoiding complexity that is exponential in n. The lower bound suggests that,
at least mathematically, asymptotically bound to the Shannon capacity of an (n, n)
system is a system comprised of n OC(k) systems with k = 1, 2, ...n. Recently a
layered space-time architecture associated with the asymptotic lower bound was
found. The construction uses only 1–D codecs as building blocks. The expressive
lower bound (7) played a key role in discovering this architecture yet the system is
realized in terms of n systems of equal capacity.
We give a concise explanation of this new structure which is illustrated in Figure 4
for n = 6. The general n case will be understandable from this special case. Within
a baseband equivalent context, we begin with a discussion of transmission. First the
primitive data stream is demultiplexed and then each of the six equal rate substreams
goes through an encoding/modulation stage. Each of the six encoders/demodulators
can proceed independently of the others. Instead of a fixed association of these
substreams with antennas, the association is periodically cycled. The dwell at each
association is τ seconds. One full cycle takes 6τ seconds (nτ in the general case).
As will eventually be clear, the architecture that we are describing attains the
capacity lower bound in the limit of large τ.
Next we describe the receiver. The lower part Figure of 4 shows space-time as one
large rectangle. The rectangle base is time where the basic tick is the time to send
one symbol. The duration τ comprises many ticks, in the limit, infinitely many.
Space is also discrete: a six point space one for each transmit antenna. Signals are
preprocessed iteratively along space-time diagonals, ie, we "peel off" one diagonal
after another. We will discuss the reception of the highlighted a diagonal. There are

263
two stages to reception: preprocessing and final processing. We start by describing
the preprocessing.
FIGURE 4:
The layered space-time communication architecture.
Transmit and receive methods for a (6,6) system.
The preprocessing has two parts: cancellation and nulling. Below the highlighted
diagonal all detection is assumed completed and interference subtracted off. It is
assumed that this interference cancellation is perfect - just as in decision feedback
systems. Above the highlighted diagonal no detection has taken place yet, so
interference is nulled. Resolve the received vector into two orthogonal components,
one in the space of the interfering vectors. By nulling, we mean the transformation
of the 6–D received vector to the other of the two component vectors, the one
disposed orthogonal to the space spanned by the uncancelled interferers. So we are
nulling out the component of what is received that suffers interference. Analysis of
the six successive nulling processes enables us to see how the lower bound is
approached. We discuss the nulling process counting complex DOF. (In other
words, half the DOF compared to totaling real plus imaginary DOF.) Look at the six
rectangles comprising the a layer from NW to SE. The NW rectangle involves no
nulling so it is received as OC(6). For the next rectangle the nulling projects the
signal into a 5-D space so it is processed as OC(5), the next rectangle as OC(4) and
so on until we get to the last rectangle. This last rectangle is received OC(2) since
all five of the overlying layers must be nulled. We see the six OC(6) systems
k = 1, 2, · · · 6 just as the bound hinted. From a mathematical standpoint the six
systems can be seen to involve statistically independent chi-squared variates [2].

264
7. CLOSING REMARKS
The final processing is the decoding process applied to the preprocessed signal. We
leave the coding/decoding details open. As technology progresses this will, of
course, evolve. However, it is important that the detection of the a layer be
completed and subtraction take place before the next layer is detected. Then we can
assume that the interference effect from this layer has been cancelled.
The reader may wonder: What about error propagation? The answer is to invest the
huge capacity available to take advantage of powerful error protection. What is
important is that failure of a burst due to error propagation be say one order of
magnitude below failure due to outage. Take the view that whether the outage is 1%
or 1.1% is inconsequential, so error propagation is inconsequential. So powerful
1 – D codes (whose existence is guaranteed by information theory) will be essential
to efficient use of bandwidth. We stress that Figures 1-3 show the relative closeness
of the lower bound to the (n, n) limit improving as n increases.
Using information theory we have shown how it is theoretically possible to achieve
great capacities through judicious use of MEAs at both transmitter and receiver. For
(n, n) systems we have seen how in the large ρ large n realm that capacity increases
linearly with n as if the waves transmitted from different antennas did not interfere
except to reduce ρ to ρ/e. The capacity lower bound we derived suggested that an
architecture of enormous capacity existed. We went on to explain this architecture
which utilized signals stratified along diagonals in space-time.
In assuming lattices at both transmit and receive sites with spacing of antenna
elements of the order of λ we have tacitly avoided the onset of supergain MEAs in
our analysis. In the appendix we discuss the theoretical possibility for even
significantly greater capacity than uncovered so far – by impinging on supergain.

265
APPENDIX
SUPERGAIN: SOME CURRENTLY IMPRACTICAL ANTENNA POSSIBILITIES
In considering the ultimate capacity limits achievable with antenna arrays, the notion
of supergain offers tremendous possibilities. Supergain is defined as the use of
amplitude and phase combinations along with antenna element positioning in an
antenna array causing the array to have an overall gain, G, higher than that associated
with its projected aperture area, A, in square wavelengths (i.e., G > 4·π·A).
Although we are mainly concerned here with local communications such as wireless
indoor systems, to clearly introduce the supergain concept, we first examine a free
space thought experiment. For example, consider a transmitting horn antenna, with
an aperture about 10 wavelengths on a side, located in outer space roughly aimed at
the earth. With a one wavelength diameter supergain receiving antenna on the earth it
is possible to receive virtually all of the power radiated by the horn antenna. The
surface of the supergain antenna is covered with microscopic elements connected
through a lossless matching network to a receiver. The phases and amplitudes of all
the elements are adjusted so that, when operating as a transmitter, the earth antenna
would produce at the horn antenna aperture an exact duplicate of its desired receiving
field and would produce zero field in all other directions. In other words, on the
sphere, centered on the earth antenna, we have specified the tangential electric field.
This tangential electric field can then be expanded in spherical harmonics (see [11]
Section 7.3) for outgoing waves and extrapolated back to the earth antenna to
determine the required amplitude and phase to be produced over the surface of the
earth antenna. The existence of such a solution depends only on the completeness of
the expansion [op. cit.]. The mode field produced at the aperture of the horn antenna
by the earth antenna is completely received by the horn without reflection; i.e., the
horn antenna receives all the power radiated by the earth antenna. By reciprocity, the
earth antenna must receive essentially all the power radiated by the horn antenna.
Thus, instead of hundreds of dB loss due to the great distances involved, there is
0 dB loss in transmission achieved by the supergain of the earth antenna. Thus, the
academic answer to the ultimate limit of achievable capacity is ridiculously large.
Now let us change the thought experiment to the case of indoor wireless
communications, where the transmitting horn now appears to the receiver as a
myriad of horns formed by the imaging property of the reflecting walls and objects in
the building. Instead of matching the supergain antenna far field to a single horn
aperture, we now match it to all of the horn apertures of the original horn and all of
its images. Although many of the images may be pointing away from the receiver,
and the reflecting walls affect the mutual coupling of the supergain antenna, we can
still receive a sizable fraction of the transmitted power, so that our transmission loss
to the supergain antenna would be on the order of 10 dB instead of about 100 dB
without supergain.

266
The only problem with supergain is that it is impractical beyond about a 3 dB
increase. Antenna current fluctuations with position on the supergain antenna are
extreme and require extreme precision. Any loss in the antenna material reduces the
antenna efficiency to virtually zero. The precision requirement typically reduces
achievable bandwidth to infinitesimal values. These properties are a result of the
very high order spherical harmonics required to match the desired far field.
Extrapolation of the high order harmonics towards the center of the far field sphere
quickly encounters exponential growth. Thus, although supergain is an academic
possibility, it is totally impractical for realizable systems.
A possible item for future consideration would be to refine the very preliminary ideas
in this appendix to bring in practical considerations like the effects of imperfections
and also impose design constraints that preclude inordinately high currents. Also the
possible impact of continuing advances in superconductivity would seem worthwhile
exploring. A prime objective would be to translate practical effects and constraints
into mathematical form so one could probe analytically antenna constructs offering
greater capacities while at the same time insuring practicality.

Abstract
In this paper, we propose a MAC protocol for an ad-hoc network architecture,
termed by us the Reconfigurable Wireless Networks, and investigate its
performance. We discuss the access synchronization and the construction of
network connections features of the MAC protocol. Using event-driven simulation,
we evaluate the throughput and the blocking probability of the scheme,
demonstrating its behavior for different parameters of the mobility, traffic, and
propagation models.
Introduction
A Reconfigurable Wireless Network (RWN), which was introduced in [1], is an ad-
hoc network architecture that can be rapidly deployed, without relying on a
preexisting fixed network infrastructure. The nodes in a RWN can dynamically join
and leave the network, frequently, often without warning, and without disruption to
other nodes’ communication. RWNs are a special case of the ad-hoc network
architecture and distinguish themselves in the following features: large network
span, large number of nodes, and highly mobile nodes. In particular, the node

constellation can change rapidly, and so is the presence or absence of links.
Examples of the use of the RWNs are:
• military (tactical communication) - for fast establishment of a communication
infrastructure during deployment of forces in a foreign and hostile terrain,
• rescue missions - for communication in areas without adequate wireless coverage,
• national security - for communication in times of national crisis, where the
existing communication infrastructure is non-operational due to a natural disaster
or a global war,
• law enforcement - similar to tactical communication,
• commercial use - for setting up communication in exhibitions, conferences, or
sale presentations,
• education - for operation of virtual classrooms, and
• sensor networks - for communication between intelligent sensors (e.g., MEMS1)
mounted on mobile platforms.
In contrast with the conventional cellular networks, in the RWNs, direct mobile-
to-mobile (peer-to-peer) communication is allowed. Mobiles that cannot be
reached directly, use other mobiles to relay their transmissions using multi-hop
routing.
There is a number of central issues that need to be addressed to make the RWN a
workable system: the mobility management, the routing protocol, and the Medium
Access Control (MAC) scheme. In this paper, we deal with the MAC scheme. A
routing protocol applicable to the RWN architecture – the Zone Routing Protocol -
was introduced in [2] and further evaluated in [3]. Finally, we will report on the
RWN mobility management scheme in a future publication.
In general, the MAC for wireless networks has been a subject of extensive
studies, mostly concentrating on random access mechanisms. The traditional MAC
schemes for radio networks, such as the Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA), do
not fully address the “hidden terminal problem.” Newer schemes, such as MACA
[4], MACAW [5], and FAMA [6] rely on low-level reservation mechanism. In these
protocols, the RTS/CTS (Request-To-Send/Clear-To-Send) dialog precedes any
communication between nodes. The MACAW protocol includes an additional
feature of acknowledging, on the link layer, the received transmissions and, thus,
provides fast recovery from collisions. In the FAMA protocol, the non-persistent
CSMA scheme is used, which avoids repetitious collisions.
It should be noted that all these protocols do not resolve the hidden terminal
problem and, therefore, do not prevent collisions. The notorious example is when a
node, which did not hear the RTS/CTS dialog, migrates to within reception range of
the already communicating nodes. A similar situation occurs when a node (due to
transmission errors, for example) did not hear the CTS reply. In such cases, any
transmission attempt of this node will most probably result in a collision.
Additionally, because of the random access nature of these schemes, reservations of
network capacity for real-time multimedia traffic cannot be easily accommodated.
1 Micro Electro Mechanical Systems

271
As opposed to random access schemes, controlled-access schemes do not suffer
from the above shortcomings. Controlled-access schemes have been considered
before for multi-hop network environment; for example, the Cluster TDMA scheme
[7]. The difficulty with these schemes, however, is that they require network-wide
synchronization. This appears to be a significant problem, especially in a fast
changing communication environment, such as the RWNs.
We propose here a hybrid of random- and controlled-access schemes, based on a
local polling mechanism. It exhibits controlled-access behavior among neighbor
nodes due to polling. Yet, the polls originating at different nodes are random and
unsynchronized, and, thus, may lead to collisions. However, as the length of the
polls is short compared with the actual data transmission and as the number of
competing nodes is restricted to a subset of the neighbors only, the loss of capacity
due to the random-access process is relatively small. The salient features of our
scheme are that it requires local synchronization only (i.e., among the neighbors)
and that it eliminates collisions of payload information. Additionally, it reduces the
access time variance and inherently allows capacity reservation. Thus, it is
applicable to multimedia traffic.
Medium Access Control (MAC) Protocol
The purpose of a MAC protocol is to synchronize access of mobiles to the shared
communication medium. In the RWN, the span of the network is considerably
larger than the transmission range of a single node transceiver. This necessitates
multi-hop routing.
A MAC can be based on a single shared-channel² or multiple channels. Use of a
single shared-channel MAC scheme requires each transceiver to operate at the
maximum channel bit-rate. In addition, single shared-channel can lead to inefficient
operation or to the need for network-wide access synchronization. Thus, a multi-
channel solution, in which nodes are assigned individual channels, is a more viable
option. Of course, in the multi-channel approach, channels can be reused in spatially
separated areas and can be based on different multiple access schemes, such as
TDMA or CDMA. Our work is independent of the actual multiple access scheme
used. The determination of the actual multiple access scheme, as well as the
channel/code allocation algorithm, are outside the scope of this work.
MAC-layer connections are established between neighbors.³ With time, mobiles
can become separated by large enough distance or by a radio propagation obstacle,
so that connections will be broken. Likewise, mobiles can migrate close enough to
each other to become neighbors and to establish new connections.
We assume the following elements of the MAC scheme:
• The transmission spectrum is divided into channels. For the sake of simplicity, we
assume here that channels are created in time and frequency (FDMA/TDMA),
rather than in code (i.e., CDMA). Nevertheless, the presented-here MAC scheme
can be easily modified for CDMA-based transmission.
2 In this work, we refer to a channel as a TDMA slot assignment on a particular
frequency channel, or, in CDMA, as an assignment of one of the orthogonal codes.
Note that this is not the traditional definition of a wireless channel.
3 A mobile that can be reached directly by a mobile in question is referred to as the
mobile’s neighbors.

272
• Each channel consists of two parts, which we call the payload and the poll
portions of the channel. The bandwidth of the payload portion is larger than the
bandwidth of the poll portion. The capacities of the payload and the poll depend
on several factors and performance requirements. We label the payload portion of
the k th channel as Θ
k , and the poll portion as ϕk .
• Nodes are dynamically assigned channels. The reuse of channels is such that it
corresponds to an acceptable Signal-to-Interference (SIR) ratio at the assigned
nodes. Channel assignment schemes will not be discussed here.
• Each node maintains an updated list of who are its neighbors and what are their
assigned channels (neighbor-table). This list is created and maintained as part of
the Neighbor Discovery process, which will be explained later.
• Every node is equipped with two half-duplex transceivers. Although, this is not an
essential assumption, as our MAC protocol will also operate with a single
transceiver per node, our study indicates that a considerable advantage in
reliability and network capacity can be achieved with two half-duplex
transceivers. We term the two transceivers: an in-transceiver and an out-
transceiver.
In reference to this last point: inclusion of two transceivers per station increases
the reliability of the network. In a peer-to-peer routed network, such as the RWN,
failures of a single-transceiver node can lead to network partitioning and to loss of
connectivity with some network nodes. On the other hand, our MAC protocol is
designed in such a way that a node can still continue to operate even when a failure
of one of the two transceivers occurs (although the node’s capacity is reduced).
Access Synchronization
Access synchronization is based on the operation of the two node’s transceivers.
Ordinarily, one node’s transceiver (referred to here as out-transceiver) is assigned to
traffic from the node in question to other nodes, while the other transceiver (the in-
transceiver) is used for communication in the other direction.
The operation of the access synchronization is based on every node continuously
polling its neighbors to determine whether they have any communication to send.
The polling is performed on the poll portions of the channels. For illustration,
assume that node-k is assigned the channel (Θ , ϕ 
k 
k) and its two neighbors, node-i
and node-j, are assigned frequencies (Θi ,ϕi) and (Θ
j ,ϕ ), respectively. Node-k tunes
j
its in-transceiver to ϕi, polling the node-i for any data and immediately retunes its
in-transceiver for reception on Θk. As the out-transceiver of node–i is ordinarily
tuned to ϕ , it receives the poll and, assuming it has nothing to send to node-k, it
i
responds with End-Of-Transmission (EOT) message on Θ . Node-k proceeds now
k

273
to poll node-j on ϕ j . Now assume that node-j has a number of packets to send to
node-k. Node-j, after receiving the poll on its out-transceiver (ordinarily tuned to
ϕ j ), tunes it to Θ
k
and transmits the packets, ending with the EOT message. Node-
k then starts a new poll cycle. The procedure is depicted in Figure 1, where the oval
indicates tuning of the particular transceiver to the specified frequency.
Note that all the nodes perform the same procedure. Thus, at the same time as
node-k polls its neighbors, the neighbor nodes (node-i and node-j) both poll node-k,
which has his out-transceivers ordinarily tuned to its polling frequency, ϕk . In
Figure 1: Access Synchronization Mechanism
summary, the process is as follows: In general, a node’s out-transceiver is tuned to
its own polling frequency. When a poll arrives, the node answers the poll (by either
sending packets and/or EOT message) on the polling node’s payload frequency. A

274
node’s in-transceiver is used for polling its neighbors by tuning to their polling
frequency, sending a poll message and retuning to its own payload frequency to
hear the polled node answer.
Of course, as the polling channels are unsynchronized, there is a possibility of
polls collisions and of some of the polls being lost. (See Figure 1 for an example.) If
a polling node gets no response to its poll within the specified time-out interval
(poll_time-out), it repeats the poll in the next cycles for up to maximum number of
attempts (max_poll_attempts). If all the attempts fail, then the neighbor is placed on
a watch-list. If no polls are received from the neighbor within max_poll_cycle, the
link to the neighbor is considered lost and the neighbor identity is removed from the
local neighbor-table.
A number of comments regarding the access synchronization scheme:
• As a node has full control over access to its payload portion of the channel, there
are no collisions on the payload portion of the channel and, consequently, no
packet transmission is lost due to collisions.
• While responding to a poll, a node can send only a limited number of packets.
This number determines the maximum time a node can spend away from its
frequency, max_transmission_time. The goal is to ensure that other nodes have a
chance to communicate as well and to allow bandwidth reservations for
multimedia traffic. However, when only few nodes want to communicate, the poll
will return to the ready station sooner, allowing the station to capture larger
portion of the channel.
• A possible modification is to allow a two-way traffic exchange, once a poll is
answered. Such a modification increases reliability by preserving connectivity
while loss of a single transceiver occurs.
Construction of network’s connections
As the network nodes migrate, existing connections between adjacent nodes are
broken and new connections are made possible. The Network Construction
procedure is responsible for updating the connections’ status. To accomplish this,
each node maintains a list (neighbor_table) of all the nodes with which it can
establish a direct link (referred to here as neighbors). Neighbor Discovery is the
process by which a node learns about its new neighbors. (Note that the reverse
process, removal of out-of-reach nodes from the neighbor_table, is triggered by
missing poll responses, as explained above.) The Neighbor Discovery process is
performed by the in-transceivers, scanning the available channels and discovering
polling messages from adjacent nodes.4 (Note that when a node has no neighbors, it
still periodically sends null polling messages.) In particular, when a message is
received with “good enough quality” (e.g., sufficient Signal to Interference Ratio),
the node starts the neighbor acquisition process by including the new neighbor in its
next polling cycle. After one successful polling response from the neighbor, the
4 This process is inspired by the search of control channels for handoff purpose in a
cellular network. For example, this process is implemented by the “idle slot” in
GSM.

275
neighbor is added to the neighbor_table. The principle of the process is shown in
Figure 2.
Fig 2: The Neighbor Discovery Mechanism
The Network, Traffic, and Radio Models
The coverage area of our network is a 1[km]×1[km] closed area (see [2] for the
definition of a closed area). Initially, the mobiles are randomly distributed
throughout this area. Each node is equipped with a transmitter/receiver pair,
operating in the half-duplex mode. We assumed a narrowband system, in which the
total spectrum is divided into channels through the FDM/TDMA technique. To
make sure that the blocking is not spectrum- but system-limited, the system has
large enough number of channels. The maximum transmission power of a mobile
limits its connectivity to within an area of the radius rmax.

276
Each node can be in one of the four possible states: idle, receive, transmit, and
transmit/receive. The transitions between the states are shown in Figure 3.
Fig 3: State transition diagram
Packets arrive to mobiles in a random manner with total inter-arrival time and
the packet transmission time modeled as negative exponential distributions with
parameters
[sec/packet] and
[sec/packet], respectively. There is no
distinction between the local and the to-be-forwarded traffic. Packets have to be
fully received before they are forwarded to a neighbor node. Packets that arrive to a
mobile while the mobile is already transmitting are considered blocked. Upon
arrival of a packet, a destination is randomly chosen from the set of neighbors. If the
node has no neighbors, the packet is considered blocked. If the destination neighbor
is already receiving from another node, the packet is again blocked. Note that due to
the dual-transceiver feature, the transmission and the receiving processes are
decoupled. In other words and for example, if a packet is destined to a transmitting,
but not receiving node, the packet is not blocked. A packet is considered dropped if
during its transmission the link between the communicating nodes is broken due to
mobility.
Blocked packets can be treated in several ways. The appropriate action depends
on the reason for blocking the packet. In general, one possibility is to queue blocked
packets. Another approach would be to discard blocked packets and alert the
sending node (i.e., the previous node) or the local application (if the packet is
locally generated) that the packet cannot be forwarded. The second choice might
make sense in the highly versatile RWN environment, since a route to the
destination might be broken while the packet is queued, effectively discarding the

277
packet without notification. In such a case, a timeout mechanism and end-to-end
retransmission would be necessary, at the expense of increased delay.5 Discarding a
packet with notification, on the other hand, might allow rerouting the packet
through a different, available route. Possibly, a limited queue would be a better
solution. In this paper, we assumed that a single buffer exists at each node and that
blocked packets are discarded with notification. The treatment of blocked packets is
still an open issue and we will not pursue it any further here.
The Mobility Model
Mobiles roam freely throughout the closed coverage area. At any point in time,
mobile movement is characterized by two parameters, its velocity, 
(value, v ,
and direction φ ) and its current position, (x, y). The velocity is updated every time
interval, ∆t, according to the following formula:
(1)
where ∆v is a uniformly distributed random variable in 
v max is
the maximal mobile 
velocity, and α is 
the 
maximal 
mobile node
acceleration/deceleration (assumed here to be of equal magnitude). The movement
direction, φ , is also updated every ∆t:
(2)
where ∆φ is a uniformly distributed random variable in
and ∆φ 
represents the maximal angular change per unit time. This mobility
max
model is an improvement on the previously used in the literature Brownian Motion
model. The initial velocity 
of the mobiles is assumed random, within the above-
mentioned constraints.
The Simulation
We have simulated our MAC protocol with the above models by an event-driven
simulation. The purpose of the simulation was to determine the effect of different
parameter setting on the performance of the network. In particular, we evaluated the
average system blocking and the total system throughput as a function of the
number of mobiles in the system (M), maximal transmission radius (r 
),
max
maximal velocity (v max ), the length of the Discovery Cycle (
disc ), and the
system loading ( λ
-1).
5 Of course, retransmission is not an option for real-time traffic and, thus, discarding
packets without a notification to a previous node would result in reduced
communications quality.

278
Numerical Results
Our simulation was tested for the range of parameters’ values, as shown in the
following Table. When the effect of a parameter was considered, all other
parameters were assigned their respective default values.
The Discovery Cycle and Poll Cycle deviations were introduced to eliminate
synchronized blocking phenomenon. Furthermore, in our simulations, we observed
that the value of the time increment (∆t), has very little effect on the results of the
simulation.
The results of the simulation are shown in Figures 4 - 11, The “Packet Arrival
Rate” is the per-node total arrival rate. The “Throughput” is the aggregated per-
node throughputs of all the network nodes6 . Of course, to learn the effect of the
various network’s parameters, the relative, rather than the actual values of the
throughput, are of most interest. The “Blocking probability” is the probability that
an arrival packet cannot be immediately forwarded to the next node on its path.
Note that this does not imply that these packets are necessarily lost, but it does
indicate on how efficient the MAC is in forwarding packets.
6 Note that this is not the traditional definition of network throughput. This
definition was adopted because we are interested in the performance of the MAC
scheme, rather than other network algorithms, such as the routing algorithm.

279
Figure 4 and 5 show the effect of changing the number of network nodes. With
some number of nodes, the increase in the packet arrival rate results in smaller than
linear increase in the throughput, due to the fact that the blocking probability
increases as well with the increase in the packet arrival rate. From these figures, the
throughput increases linearly with the number of mobiles and the blocking
probability is not significantly affected by the number of users. This is the result of
the fact that these figures were calculated under the assumption that the packet
arrival rate per node is independent of the number of nodes. In general, increasing
the number of nodes increases the per node arrival rate and this increase depends on
the routing algorithm and on the average path length. That is, given the routing
algorithm (and average path length), one could use these graphs to estimate the
actual nodal throughput and blocking probability.
Fig 4: The effect of the number of users on throughput
Fig 5: The effect of the number of users on blocking probability

280
Our conclusion from Figures 4 and 5 is that, with fixed per-node arrival rate, the
nodal throughput and the blocking probability are independent of the number of
network nodes.
Fig 6: The effect of the transmission radius on throughput
Figures 6 and 7 show the effect of sizing the mobiles’ transmission radius. The
larger is the radius, the more neighbors each node has. Thus, the chance that a node
has no neighbors (and, thus, blocks every packet) is minimized. Also, occupancy of
Fig 7: The effect of the transmission radius on blocking probability

281
the neighbor nodes tends to be more uniform. Consequently, the blocking
probability decreases and the throughout increases. However, note that increasing
the radius beyond the 100-200 [m] range has very little effect on the system
performance. This reinforces and further qualifies our conclusion from Figures 4
and 5 that the number of network nodes has little effect on nodal throughput and
blocking probability, as long as the number of nodes is larger than some minimum.
(Or in other words, as long as each mobile has at least one neighbors that can be
used to forward the received packets.)
Fig 8: The effect of the Discovery Cycle length on throughput
Fig 9: The effect of the Discovery Cycle length on blocking probability
Figures 8 and 9 depict the effect of the Discovery Cycle length. As anticipated,
the longer the Discovery Cycle is, the lower is the throughput and the higher is the

 282
probability of blocking. However, longer Discovery Cycle does not correspond to
proportionally smaller throughput. The blocking probability exhibits similar
behavior. The reason is that the Discovery Cycle is responsible for only part of the
blocked packets; other packets are blocked due to unavailability of the neighboring
node transmitting or receiving from other nodes. This accounts for larger blocking
probability, especially at higher loads, that could have been otherwise predicted
from the portion of the total time that a node spends in the Discovery Cycle. The
results in Figures 8 and 9 suggest that, if kept to a reasonable length, the Discovery
Cycle does not carry prohibitively large overhead.
Fig 10: The effect of mobile velocity on throughput
Varying the user mobility (Figures 10 and 11) has only a small effect on the
system performance. This can be explained by the fact that as the transmission time
of the packets is so short, loosing the link in the middle of a packet transmission is
rather a low-probability event. Connections do stay long enough not to affect
majority of transmitted packets. Comparing this result with a connection-oriented
transport ([1]) provides a strong indication that the preferred mode of operation of
the RWNs is in connectionless communication.
Concluding Remarks
We have introduced here a novel MAC scheme, which is based on polling
mechanism with local synchronization requirements only. Operation of the scheme
relies on partitioning the channels (TDMA or CDMA) into two parts: the poll and
the payload portions. The poll portions of the channel use random-access
mechanism to perform the polling operation and are, thus, subject to collisions.
However, because of the restricted number of neighbors and the short duration of

283
the poll messages, the frequency of collisions is quite small in a practical network
scenario. Transmission on the payload portion will not undergo collisions.
Fig 11: The effect of mobile velocity on blocking probability
Our evaluation of the proposed MAC scheme reveals that, for the set of
parameter values considered, its performance in terms of nodal throughout and
blocking probability is independent of the mobile population. This is correct as long
as some minimal number of nodes are present, so that the probability that a node has
no neighbors in small. This behavior translates to a minimum transmission radius,
given some mobile density. Note that this conclusion addresses the MAC
performance only and not the routing scheme. In fact, in another study, we have
shown that the density of user population has a crucial effect on the probability of
finding a route within a network [3]. However, from the MAC point of view, as
long as there is at least one neighbor to which the packet can be forwarded, the
performance of the MAC scheme is relatively invariant with the actual number of
such neighbors.
Another conclusion that can be drawn from our study is that the Neighbor
Discovery cycle is not a major source of blocking, as long as it is not excessively
long. Further study is required to determine the required duration of the Neighbor
Discovery cycle, which depends on the number of channels and mobile density.
Finally, we have demonstrated that the mobile’s speed has only minor effect on
the nodal throughput and blocking probability. This is an encouraging result as it
indicates that, under the range of parameters considered, the dropping probability is
not strongly affected by the mobility. It also suggests, as we have suspected, that
connectionless mode of communication is the proper scheme for the RWN
environment.

Abstract:
We study the interaction of source and channel coding, and of coding and
multiplexing techniques, given a multi-mode, Variable Bit Rate (VBR), and embedded
source coding scheme. We estimate the coded bit-stream resistance to channel impair-
ments and frame losses. Our aim is to increase network capacity while maintaining
a smooth quality degradation at high loads and heavy interference. We show that, by
exploiting the peculiar characteristics of the chosen coding technique, which allows scal-
ability of the signal bandwidth and of the delivered bit-rate, it is possible to achieve a
strong interaction between the system and the bit-stream. Both narrowband and wideband
speech services are evaluated.
1 INTRODUCTION
Nowadays there is an evolution towards the creation of a single network infrastructure
where different kinds of information can coexist. A key element is represented by
the wireless network, that may make it possible to transfer any kind of information
between any desired locations, but whose capacity and reliability are strictly limited.
Our attention is addressed towards speech/audio coding and networking techniques
for wireless networks, which are suitable to increase network capacity while main-
taining a smooth degradation of quality at high loads and heavy interference. In the
paper we show that embedded and variable bit-rate (VBR) multimode source encoding
should be used to fully exploit the capacity of the system. Indeed, such coding schemes

286
solve the problem of having the output bit-rate vary in an optimal sense, in response
to source entropy, channel quality, and network congestion.
In the paper, the interaction of source and channel coding, and of coding and mul-
tiplexing techniques is investigated. Both narrow band and wide band audio services
are examined, considering different switching techniques. First, circuit switching
applications are taken into consideration, to study the interaction between quality of
service and transmission reliability. A possible trade-off between audio information
bandwidth and channel quality is investigated [1]. Then, packet switching is consid-
ered, to assess the potential benefits we can obtain by using the coding scheme under
investigation.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the used audio encoder.
Section 3 presents the bandwidth requirements and the tolerable discarding rates, for
speech transmission. Section 4 deals with circuit switching applications, while Section
5 covers packet switching applications. Section 6 summarizes the main conclusions.
2 AUDIO CODER
The Mobile Audio Visual Terminal (MAVT) audio encoder-decoder we use, adopts
a flexible, object oriented coding scheme. It consists of a low band core algorithm
which can contain any speech or music compression scheme, and of an arbitrary
number of low band and high band enhancement stages. The number of enhancement
stages allocated to a certain band depends on the result of energy and Signal to Noise
Ratio (SNR) evaluations and on the available bit-rate. Core bits identify the minimum
amount of information needed to provide an output signal. Enhancement bits are those
relevant to the additional information which, if delivered to the destination, will provide
the maximum quality, but which can be discarded with no need to change the core
information. This coding scheme allows complexity scalability and interoperability
with other standards, since a plurality of core low-rate algorithms/tools can be used by
the algorithm.
The speech core algorithm we use is a Fast Variable Rate - Code Excited Linear
Prediction (FVR-CELP) encoder, developed by CSELT S.p.A. [2]. The algorithm
is designed for speech sampled with a sampling frequency of 8 kHz. The signal
is segmented in frames of 10 ms, that is 80 samples. Comfort noise insertion is
used to replace silence. There are several different coding rates, corresponding to
different operating modes, as shown in Table 1. The bit-rate varies between 400 bit/s
and 16 kbit/s: the lower two rates are used to represent noise, while the higher five
ones are meant for speech. The average rate depends on speaker characteristics and on
background noise. The typical average rate is 6 kbit/s. Current MAVT implementation
adopts a slightly modified FVR-CELP algorithm, in which the signal is segmented in
frames of 32 ms, that is 256 samples. The 32 ms frame is split into two 16 ms
sub-frames. The core algorithm is applied twice per frame.

Coding modes and bit rates
The quality achieved in the core stages can be improved by adding a certain number
of enhancement stages. The signal can be split in subbands of 1 kHz each (a narrow
band input signal, with a 4 kHz bandwidth, can be split in 4 subbands). An arbitrary
number of enhancement stages can be added for each sub-band: from 1 to 7 in the low
band (i.e. 0-4 kHz) for a music signal, from 1 to 3 in the low band for a speech signal,
from 1 to 3 in the high band (i.e. 4-20 kHz) for all types of signals. The number of
enhancement stages allocated to a certain band depends on its energy, on the Signal
to Noise Ratio (SNR) of the reproduced signal, and on the available bit-rate. Bit-rate
scalability with a graceful quality reduction is one of the main features of the algorithm.
Scalability is achieved by using the bit-manipulation unit. Scalability can be done at
frame level, so that the bit-rate can be lowered only for a short time (i.e. 32 ms),
and then raised again. The rate reduction is achieved by a specific algorithm which
determines the number of enhancement stages to be discarded and then identifies those
among them which can be discarded with the minimum impact on the output quality.

BANDWIDTH REQUIREMENTS AND DISCARDING THRESHOLDS
Bandwidth Requirements
In this section we present some preliminary results on relationship between bit-rate
and output quality for wide band signals, whose sampling frequency is 16 kHz.
A large set of wide band speech signals has been processed and evaluated, by select-
ing a range of bit-rates that is upper bounded by the maximum bit-rate, corresponding
to the best achievable quality. To quantify the objective speech degradation, an ob-
jective distance measure is employed, namely, the log-spectral distance measure (SD)
[3], which quantifies the spectral degradation due to processing. The evaluation of the
objective speech quality degradation, due to a bit-rate reduction, is performed, first,
considering a bit-rate reduction applied to the whole voice signal (all modes curve in
Fig. 1), then, lowering the bit-rate only in the frames corresponding to a given mode.
Only modes representing activity are considered, as modes representing inactivity can
be suppressed during transmission. The degradation is evaluated with respect to the
signal coded with the maximum bit-rate, that is about 50 kbit/s, which is selected
automatically by the encoder on the basis of a SNR saturation.

288
Figure 1
Wideband speech: Spectral distance degradation vs. selected bit rate
From Fig. 1 we observe that mode 4, which represents unvoiced speech segments
with the highest energy, suffers a more evident quality degradation, when the required
output bit-rate is decreased. By a comparison between objective measurements and
informal subjective measurements, done by using the Absolute Category Rating (ACR)
method [4], we can infer that the acceptable spectral distance degradation threshold is
about 1 dB: with such a threshold, the different bit-rates needed by the different modes
are, approximately, 32 kbit/s for mode 4, 24 kbit/s for modes 6 and 7, <8 kbit/s for
modes 3 and 5.
Frame Discarding Sensitivity
For narrow-band signals, the basic information is represented by core bits, because they
assure toll quality achievement by themselves. In such a case, quality reduction can
be originated by frame discarding due to poor channel quality or network congestion.
The FVR-CELP algorithm’s bits are classifiable in groups of different importance.
Selective discarding of less important bits permits a smooth quality degradation, in
case of congestion or severe channel conditions. Moreover, each group of the coded
bit-stream can have a particular allocation of bits between source and channel coding
stages, leading to an unequal Forward Error Correction (FEC) coding scheme, which

289
can match its protection power with the source sensitivity. In this way a higher
robustness of the coded bit-stream to channel impairments can be obtained.
In [5], four bit-groups of different importance have been identified and their sen-
sitivity to a range of selective group discarding percentages has been evaluated. The
subdivision of the coded bit-stream in four groups is summarized in Table 2.

Error Correction Capabilities
The chosen group sizes permit to adopt, for error detection and correction, the set of
Bose-Chaudhury-Hocquenghem(BCH) block codecs with parameters (63, k, t), where
N = 63 represents the length of the block, k is the number of actual user bits in a
block, and t is the number of errors that can be corrected in one block. The parameters
of the adopted BCH codes are summarized in Table 3.

290
From the results presented in [5] for partial concealment, the different frame loss
percentages tolerated by the different bit-groups with an acceptable quality degradation
are 1% for groups 1 and 2, and 5% for groups 3 and 4.

CIRCUIT SWITCHING OPERATION
Two existing low-tier radio air interface protocols, namely the Digital European Cord-
less Telephone (DECT) and the Personal Access Communication System (PACS),
provide a raw bit rate of 32 kbit/s for supporting circuit switched speech communica-
tion [6]. Both systems employ a Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) scheme. DECT
operates in Time Division Duplexing (TDD) mode, while PACS has a TDD mode and
a Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) mode. A DECT frame is 10 ms in duration.
Each frame includes 12 slots for the up-link communication and 12 slots for the down-
link communication. A slot, which carries 320 bits for user information transmission,
can be sub-divided into two half-slots, each of which can carry 160 user bits. A PACS
frame is 2.5 ms long. Each frame includes 8 slots, 7 of which can be employed for
information transmission. A slot carries 80 bits of user data. PACS supports sub-rate
channels of 16 kbit/s and 8 kbit/s, by using one slot every two or every four frames
respectively.
In Section 3 we have shown that the different modes of the used MAVT encoder
require at most 32 kbit/s for a qualitatively acceptable wide-band speech encoding,
while narrow-band speech encoding requires at most 16 kbit/s. Thus, DECT half-slot
channels and PACS 16 kbit/s sub-rate channels are adequate for transmitting uncoded
narrow-band speech, while DECT full-slot and PACS 32 kbit/s channels can be used
for transmitting uncoded wide-band speech. Moreover, the channel encoding scheme
proposed in Section 3 can be easily accommodated both in DECT and in PACS frame
structure, using the full rate channels, permitting a trade-off between transmission
quality and transmission reliability.
Error Probability
To assess the range of applicability of the proposed encoding scheme, it is necessary to
determine the error probability, ε , that is the probability that a block correct reception
fails due to excessive interference and noise power at the receiver input. Using a BCH
code with parameters (N, k, t), reception fails when the received block does not lie
within distance t from the transmitted codeword [7]. The methodology for evaluating
the error probability is outlined in [5]. The modulation scheme adopted for the analysis
is a BPSK coherent modulation scheme. Slow multipath fading is assumed, that is the
mobile terminal is assumed to move very slowly so that the signal-to-noise ratio and
the signal-to-interference ratio for all N bits within a block or codeword are the same.
We suppose that errors are due to interference. A microcellular mobile radio system,
with cluster sizes C = 3 and C = 7, is considered. The system is statistically modeled

Error Probability vs. Error Correction Capability, fading only

normally shadowed interfering signals, propagating according to a dual path loss law
with a turning point [8]. The received area mean power
is given by:
(1)
where 
  represents the transmitted area-mean power and r the normalized propa-
gation distance between transmitter and receiver (normalized with respect to the cell
radius). The exponent a is the propagation loss exponent for short distances, while the
exponent b accounts for the additional propagation loss exponent for distances beyond
the turning point g of the attenuation curve. In the paper, the following values are used:
a = 2, b = 2, g = 0.67. We suppose to have a symmetrical microcellular system, with
6 active interferers. The composite p.d.f. for the total interference sum is determined
according to the methodology proposed by Prasad and Kegel [9]. Examples with pure
Rayleigh faded and combined faded and shadowed interferers are evaluated. For the
useful signal, a Rice factor K = 4 (6 dB) is used. Performances with L diversity
branches are evaluated, that is assuming L independent, identically distributed useful
signals, all having a Rician p.d.f. The results are presented in Figs. 2 and 3. In circuit
switching applications, errors cause frame erasures. The allowed erasure thresholds
are shown in the figures.

292
Figure 3 Error Probability vs. Error Correction Capability, fading and shadowing,
σs = 6 dB
From Tables 2 and 3 we observe that, with the selected codes, groups 1 and 2 can
use a correction capability 3 ≤ t ≤ 7, while groups 3 and 4 can use a correction
capability 1 ≤ t ≤ 4. From these values and from Figs. 2 and 3 we derive that the
erasure thresholds can be met, assuming C = 7, in almost all channel conditions, but
σs  = 6  dB and L = 1 (i.e. with shadowing and no diversity), while, for C = 3 the
same limiting conditions can be satisfied only with no shadowing and using diversity
(L = 2). From Figs. 2 and 3 we also can infer that, for the transmission of not channel
encoded wide-band speech, the erasure requirements can be satisfied only assuming
C = 7, L = 2 and no shadowing.

PACKET SWITCHING OPERATION
Packet switching algorithms, performing statistical multiplexing, may lead to greater
efficiency than basic TDM, by exploiting the bursty character of speech traffic. More-
over, centralized access techniques take advantage of the small propagation delay of
the micro cellular environment [ 10], [11]. These techniques assign a central role to the
base station that schedules the transmissions of the speech packets. The base station
reacts to transmission errors by rescheduling the transmission of failed packets.

293
The maximum number of users, Umax , that can be accommodated in the system,
fulfilling the tolerable discarding thresholds, depend on the speaker statistic, on the
error probability, ε, and on the multiplexing technique. A Markov model has been
proposed in [12], for representing a typical VBR-CELP encoded speech signal. The
state probabilities, pi , are summarized in Table 4.
First, to determine the achievable multiplexing gain, that is the number of users
per slot which can be accommodated in the system, we do not take into account the
multiple access protocol. The adopted methodology is outlined in Appendix.

State probabilities of coding modes
We hypothesize that bits of different priority are grouped into different packets.
At the beginning of a frame the transmission of high priority packets is requested.
Errors are recovered by re-transmissions. Then, the process is repeated for the other
priorities. We suppose that at the end of the frame all the non transmitted packets have
to be dropped. Three different situations are taken into consideration.
1. Single packet per frame. Silences are suppressed (modes 1 and 2), but the VBR
character of the code is not exploited.
2. Up to two minipackets per frame (the slots are subdivided in half slots, as
in DECT system). The VBR character is partly exploited, as modes 3 and 5
generate only one half packet per frame.
3. Up to four minipackets per frame (a full packet requires 4 minislots, as in PACS
system). The VBR character is fully exploited, and the number of minipackets
can be derived from Table 2 (the higher priority packets are those corresponding
to groups 1 and 2, whereas the lower priority packets are those corresponding to
groups 3 and 4).
The number of users which can be accommodated in the system is shown in Fig. 4.
Although the actual numbers are integers, continuous fitting lines are added, for clarity
purposes. From the figure we derive that a system with 12 slots per frame (DECT
equivalent) could accept up to 16 users in single packet mode (1 packet requires 1
full slot), and up to 19 users in the two-minipacket mode (1 minipacket uses 1 half
slot), while a system with 7 slots per frame (PACS equivalent, excluding the broadcast
channel) could accept up to 12 users in the four-minipacket mode (1 minipacket uses
1 burst).

Effects of channel errors
The results shown in Fig. 4 represent an upper bound on system performances. Actual
performances depend on channel errors which reduce the number of useful transmis-
sions. For our analysis we use a discrete memoryless error model. The methodology
for determining the packet error probability, ε, is shown in [13]. Error probability
depends on traffic in co-channel cells, so it is assumed that all the surrounding cells
are equally loaded. Rayleigh fading is assumed for all the interferers, and the joint
interference power is approximated by a gamma distribution. Up to 18 interfering
users are considered, belonging to three first groups of surrounding cells. Rice fad-
ing is assumed for the useful signal. The average error probability is determined by
assuming uniform placement of both the useful and the interfering signals. A trans-
mission is considered successful if the Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR) exceeds a
given threshold, Z0, namely the capture ratio. The chosen value is Z 0 = 10 dB. This
value represents a reasonable compromise between the capture ratio of high priority
packets, with strong error protection, and low priority packets. However, the chosen
value could be considered optimistic when channel encoding is not used (wide-band
services). The channel model used in Section 4 is assumed, that is a = 2, b = 2,
g = 0.67, K = 4. Both cluster sizes C = 3 and C = 7 are considered. For this

295

speech only (so) and with access protocol (ap)
analysis, the two-minipacket mode is considered. The results are presented in Figs. 5
and 6.
In the figures, the speech only curves do not take into account the access protocol,
while the access protocol curves are evaluated assuming to reserve one slot per frame
to the access protocol. The performances of the system with C = 7 are close to
ideal performances. However, the normalized number of users, Umax /C , is higher
for the system with C = 3. To assess the correctness of the analysis, a simulation
has been carried out, assuming that the access protocol is used to inform the base
station that a user enters an active mode (silence to talkspurt transition). Then, the
base station is informed about all the state transitions between active modes by using
some spare capacity of the information channel. Thus, the signaling traffic due to the
multiple access is rather low, so that all access protocols perform reasonably well. The
simulation has been performed by using a Centralized Collision Resolution Algorithm
(C-CRA) [11]. The simulation results are in good agreement with the analysis results.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
We have investigated the interaction of source and channel coding, and of coding and
networking techniques. An object oriented (multimode), VBR, and embedded source

296

coding scheme has been utilized. Both, narrow band and wide band audio services
have been considered. First, circuit switching operation has been analyzed. Two
existing low-tier radio air interface protocols, namely DECT and PACS have been
considered. It has been shown that DECT half-slot channels and PACS 16 kbit/s
sub-rate channels are adequate for transmitting uncoded narrow-band speech, while
DECT full-slot and PACS 32 kbit/s channels can be used for transmitting uncoded
wide-band speech. We have proposed a channel encoding scheme that can be easily
accommodated both in DECT and in PACS frame structure, using the full rate channels.
The choice between the use of uncoded wide-band transmission and encoded narrow-
band transmission permits a trade-off between transmission quality and transmission
reliability. By evaluating the error probability for a micro-cellular system, we have
shown that uncoded wide-band could be feasible only under some special conditions
(e.g. no shadowing and adoption of diversity techniques), while, also for encoded
narrow-band services a sufficiently high reuse factor is required.
Then, centralized packet switching techniques have been investigated. We have
shown that system capacity can be increased, by exploiting the variable rate character
of the coding technique. The presented results apply to encoded transmission of
narrow-band services, because the chosen capture threshold is slightly optimistic for
uncoded wide-band services.

297
We recall that our results rely on to the memoryless channel model assumption.
The study of systems with channel memory is for further work.

us introduce the following quantities.

Abstract
A channel allocation technique to respect different Carrier to
Interference (C/I) ratio constraints in wireless networks supporting
multiple services is proposed and analyzed through a system
supporting two services, voice and data. Since these services require
different Bit Error Rate (BER) performance, different C/I values
should be used to meet these requirements. To achieve this goal a cell
is divided into concentric zones with the objective of trading off C/I
performance of users according to their service class and
geographical location. The underlying principle is to offer the
minimum required C/I performance for voice users in the inner zone
having more than adequate transmission quality in order to improve
C/I performance for data users which require very low BER. A
Markov chain model of the proposed scheme is identified and results
obtained through a comprehensive computer simulation for voice call
blocking probability and data access delay are provided.
1. Introduction
The next generation Personal Communications Systems (PCS) promise to
provide a wide range of services to users, including high quality voice, variable rate
data, full motion video, high resolution image, etc. These services requiring different
Bit Error Rate (BER) and hence different Carrier-to-Interference (C/I) ratio will
share a common group of channels (frequencies, slots or spreading codes). In order
to guarantee each service its quality of service, we must identify resource allocation
and sharing schemes capable of statistically multiplexing services with considerably
different characteristics. The problem of multiplexing services with different
transmission speeds dealt with in [1] is somehow re-addressed to take into account
the fact that different services have different C/I (or BER) requirements. In this

302
paper, the problem of multiplexing these services while guaranteeing each service its
required BER is addressed.
In the proposed Multilevel Channel Assignment (MCA) for two service classes, a
cell is divided into two concentric zones: an inner zone and an outer ring. A similar
cell structure is also used in reuse partitioning [2] (or overlay-underlay) [3] and in
Channel Borrowing Without Locking (CBWL) [4]. In reuse partitioning, the
available channels are split among several reuse patterns with different reuse factors.
Mobile units with the best received signal quality are preferentially assigned to the
group of channels having the smallest reuse factor value, while those with the
poorest received signal quality will be only assigned to the group of channels having
the largest reuse factor value. By using two reuse factors of 3 and 9, an increase in
channel capacity of 30\% can be achieved compared to that obtained by a single
reuse factor of 7 for a system with objective C/I of 17dB. CBWL, which uses only
one reuse pattern, allows real-time borrowing of channels from adjacent cells
without the need for channel locking in co-channel cells. Like reuse partition this
scheme also provides enhanced traffic performance. These schemes are proposed for
a voice only system with a single minimum C/I constraint.
The scheme proposed in this paper allows different services to operate at
different C/I levels. In MCA, voice users maintain the same C/I ratio as in the other
schemes. The data traffic which is more sensitive to Bit Error Rate (BER) is allowed
to use channels at a higher C/I level than voice traffic. The underlying principle is to
operate at the minimum required C/I level for voice users (in the inner zone) where
voice users experience more than adequate transmission quality in favor of better
C/I performance for data users (in the outer zone) which require very low BER. This
may be achieved by allowing data users in the outer ring to use channels at a higher
power than other users. However, this increased radiated power on the outer data
channels may cause a significantly higher interference in the co-channel cells.
Hence, these channels should be reused carefully in the co-channel cells. A thorough
analysis of the C/I performance of the proposed scheme shows that the outer data
channels can still be used by a certain population of voice users in the inner zone of
the co-channel cells. Thus, in MCA the outer data channels are locked in the co-
channel cells for all users except for the inner zone voice users
In MCA, mobile units located further away from the cell site will in general have
fewer channels at their disposal. The area around the base station has some
preferential treatment compared to the outer cell area. This will give to mobiles in
different parts of the system different grade of service in terms of the blocking
probability or experienced access delay. A cut-off priority scheme can be used in
favor of voice users at the periphery of the cell where voice calls originating in the
cell inner zone are denied access to the resource even if some channels are free.
Data requests from the inner and outer zone wait in a buffer and are served
according to FCFS discipline. Using this queuing discipline, if an outer zone data
request is waiting in the buffer an arriving inner zone data call will not be allocated

303
a channel even if a channel is accessible to this call. This helps distribute access
delay uniformly among the inner and outer zone data users.
2. System Model
2.1 Analysis of Co-Channel Interference
•
The cellular mobile system studied in this paper consists of a finite number of
cells. Base stations use omni-directional antennas and are located at the center of the
cells. Mobile Stations (MS) are assumed to be uniformly distributed over the cell
area. The interference caused by adjacent channels is assumed to be much smaller
than co-channel interference and is neglected. To simplify analysis, the effects of
fading are not included either.
Since a cell in MCA is divided into two concentric zones: an inner cell and an
outer ring, we identify 4 different types of new call originations for the two service
system:
•
Iv - type calls: voice calls arising in the inner cell
•
Id  - type calls: data calls arising in the inner cell
Ov  - type calls: voice calls arising in the outer ring
•
Od  - type calls: data calls arising in the outer ring
Let R be the radius of a cell and D the distance between two co-channel cells.
Then the C/I of a cellular system can be approximated by [3]:
Where M is the number of co-channel interfering cells and n is a path loss
exponent that ranges between 2 and 4 in urban cellular systems. M is equal to 6 for
the case of hexagonal cell layout if the interference is considered from only first tier
cells as shown in Figure 1. We take n = 4 in our study. Note that we are using
completely inadequate propagation models to conduct the study. A thorough effort
requires the use of a true reference scenario with geographical data bases and
appropriate propagation models (Okumura-Hata, Walfish-Ikegami, Cost 231, Wiart,
etc.) and the support of a coverage prediction tool to obtain true C/I maps. However,
we are only interested in making an initial assessment to determine whether or not
the MCA approach is feasible.
As described in the previous section, the underlying principle of the MCA
scheme is to degrade the C/I performance for the Iv -type calls in favor of Od  -type
calls. This may be achieved by allowing the Od -type calls to use channels at a
higher power. For example 6dB higher than other types of calls and locking these
channels in all co-channel cells for all types of calls except for I v -type calls. The
(1)

304
worst case may be that a channel is used by an Iv -type call in cell i and by Od -type
calls in the co-channel cells of cell i. We see that this worst case situation degrades
the C/I performance for the Iv -type calls by 6dB when R=
(see Figure l),
where R1  is the radius of the inner cell. Even with this degradation Iv -type calls C/ I
still experiences a C/I level equal to the O v -type calls. The interested reader is
referred to [5] for a detailed analysis of C/I in the MCA system.
The fraction of area in which the data users will use higher transmission  power is
denoted as p. For the homogeneous case p is given by 1 – ( R  1 / R) ² .

2.2 Traffic Performance of the Proposed Scheme
2.2.1 Assumptions
This section is devoted to MCA performance analysis.
1.
For simplicity we limit our analysis to the homogeneous case but the analysis
can easily be extended to non-homogeneous cases. In the homogeneous case,
calls originate uniformly throughout the service area.
2.
The speech call origination rate in the inner and outer ring is a Poisson process
with parameters λ vi  and λ vo respectively.
3. 
The speech call duration is an exponentially distributed random variable with
parameter 1/µv.
4.
The data message arrival process is also a Poisson process with parameters λdi
and λ do.

305
5.
The data message length is an exponentially distributed random variable with
parameter 1/µd .

To obtain a simplified solution we suppose that 1 / µ v = 1 / µ
 = 1 /

 µ  and let
and
where λv = λ vi + λ vo and λd = λ di + λ do . Then the
behavior of a single cell in MCA can be modeled by a mixed loss and delay queuing
system [6] as shown in Figure 2.

The blocking probability for voice users in such a system can be written as:

2.2.3 Multi-cell Performance
For simplicity of analysis, the multi-cell performance analysis is conducted under
a pure loss system assumption. New voice and data calls that do not find any free

306
channels on arrival are blocked and cleared from the system. Using this assumption,
a cell in MCA can be in one of a finite number of states. A state is identified by a
vector
(5)
Where nij (i = 1,2, . . . , K and j= 1,2, . . . , L) denotes the j th channel in the i th
cell. We identify the status of the channels in the i th cell as:
•
nij = 0, channel j is free
•
nij = 1, channel j is occupied by an Iv-type call
•
•
•
nij = 2, channel j is occupied by an Id-type call
nij = 3, channel j is occupied by an Ov-type call
nij = 4, channel j is occupied by an Od-type call
Then the total number of channels occupied in cell i is given by:
where
(6)
(7)
and (i=1, 2, 3, ... , K).
In MCA, the states of the cells using the same channel set are coupled and this
renders the problem difficult if not impossible to solve analytically. The results in
this paper are given by forming a comprehensive simulation model of the system
under study which is described in the next section.
Let n k,j denote the status of the j th channel in the co-channel cells of cell i and
let
 Then the principle of the proposed channel allocation technique
for the case of blocked calls cleared can be described as follows:
1.
A new Iv -type call originating in cell i will be accommodated in the system if
L-Li > 0 otherwise the call is rejected.
2.
A new O v -type call originating in cell i will be allocated a free channel j if
ni, j = 0 and C i j  ≠ 4 otherwise the call is denied access to the resource.
4.
n i, j = 0 and Cij  ≠ 4  otherwise the call is denied access to the resource.
3. 
A new Id-type call originating in cell i will be allocated a free channel j if
A new Od -type call originating in cell i will be allocated a free channel j if
ni,j  = 0 and C ij = 0 or 1 otherwise the call is denied access to the resource.

307
Figure 3. A snapshot of channel status in MCA
A snapshot of channel status in MCA for a one dimensional cell array (Figure 3)
with a reuse factor of 2 is shown in Figure 4. For example channel 1 in cell 4 can not
be allocated to an Od -type call since it is being used by Ov -type calls in cell 2 and
cell 6 (co-channel cells of cell 4).
Figure 4. One-dimensional cellular system model
In MCA, channel rearrangements can be used in favor of users that have no
access to all free channels. With channel rearrangements, a call for which there is no
accessible channel but there are free channels may still be accepted. This is achieved
by rearranging the currently occupied channels in the given cell and thus making a
channel accessible to the arriving call. We shall call this type of rearrangement as
local rearrangement and the corresponding MCA as MCA/LR. In MCA, if a channel
cannot be made available to an arriving call by local rearrangement, it is possible to
do this by rearranging the occupied channels in the co-channel cells. This type of
channel rearrangement will be called Global Rearrangement (GR) and the MCA
using this rearrangement in addition to LR as MCA/GR. This idea is similar to
Maximum Packing (MP). MP accepts a new call if there is any possible
reassignment of channels to calls in progress which results in freeing a channel

308
within the interference region of the new call’s cell. This policy requires complete
knowledge of all existing channel assignments in the entire system, and may
potentially reassign all existing calls.
3. Simulation Model
In this section we consider a one dimensional cell array as used in major roads
and highways. In the 1-D cellular system the main source of interference is from the
two co-channel cells comprising the first tier around a target cell as shown in Figure
4. Hence, interference from outside the first tier is neglected. Moreover, since
simulations are carried out for a TDMA system we suppose that the base stations
and users share global synchronization i.e. cell-to-cell time slot synchronization.

4. Results and Discussion
Figure 5 shows the behavior of call blocking as the normalized offered load is
varied from 0.6 to 0.9. The curve marked MP gives the single cell performance and
serves as the reference case for multi-cell performance. Since in the MP case there is
no constraint on the outer voice users, the blocking for these users is the same as for
inner voice users. The two curves marked MCA/LR give the results for the multi-
cell case when local rearrangement of channels is permitted. The blocking
probability for Iv-type calls is lower than Ov -type calls because the first type of
calls have more channels available than second type calls. It can be observed that
the difference between the inner and outer call blocking probability is more
pronounced when no channel rearrangement is used. This unfairness can be
eliminated by using cutoff priority in favor of outer voice users.
Figure 6 presents the mean access delay for data users as a function of the
normalized offered load. As expected, the data users mean access delay is minimum
for the MP case. It can also be noted that mean access delay for data users

with local rearrangement is much lower than the case with no rearrangement. This
improvement for MCA/LR is achieved at the expense of some additional signaling
load for rearranging channels.
The comparison of carried traffic for MP, MCA/LR and MCA/NR is depicted in
Figure 7. We note that up to 0.75 of normalized offered load, the carried traffic for
the three schemes is approximately the same. As offered load is increased beyond
0.75 there is a small difference in the carried traffic for the three schemes. This
small difference in the carried traffic for MCA/LR and MCA/NR with respect to MP
is explained by higher data access delays for these two schemes.

5. Concluding Remarks
We proposed a channel allocation scheme for wireless networks supporting
multiple services. The proposed MCA scheme can be used to guarantee different
BER for different services. We observed that the constraints induced on channel
allocation results in higher data delays without significant reduction in the system
capacity. We expect that the data delays in MCA can be reduced by using efficient
queuing disciplines for data users.

ABSTRACT : A robust method for determining the boundaries of cells and the
associated reliability of the RF coverage within these boundaries is presented. The
procedure accurately determines the effective cell radius using a linear regression of
RF signal strength samples. The accuracy of this estimate is quantified both as a
radius uncertainty (e.g., ± 100 meters) and as a cell coverage reliability (i.e.,
area/edge) through 1) simulation, 2) analysis of real data, and 3) theoretical
analysis. It is shown that if the estimate of the cell radius meets the desired accuracy,
then the corresponding estimates of coverage reliability (both area and edge) are
more than sufficiently accurate. It is discovered that estimating the cell radius is a
much more critical step in determining the quality of RF coverage than the more
common practice of simply estimating the area reliability. In addition, a formula for
estimating area reliabiliy is given and shown to be more accurate than the estimate
of the cell radius. The validation method presented here is particularly useful in
wireless planning since it accurately determines the effective geographic extent of
reliable RF coverage. It is recommended that radio survey analyses incorporate this
cell radius estimate as part of the coverage validation process.
I
INTRODUCTION
The two most commonly used measures of the reliability of RF coverage are 1) cell
edge reliability and 2) cell area reliability. Cell edge reliability refers to the
probability that the RF signal strength measured on a circular contour at the cell edge
will meet or exceed a desired quality threshold (e.g., -90 dBm). Whereas, cell area
reliability is the probability that RF signal will meet or exceed the quality threshold
after integrating the contour probability over the entire area of the cell (i.e., across all
of the contours of the cell, including the cell edge). D.O. Reudink showed that, for a
given propagation environment, cell edge reliability and cell area reliability are
deterministically related [2] (see also section IV of this paper). Because of this
relationship, estimating the distance to the cell edge can be shown to be theoretically
equivalent to determining the reliability of the signal strength within the cell (e.g.,
see equation  (5) and equation (6)).  In this study we describe a new measure of RF
reliability that has previously not been reported in other wireless investigations. We
call this coverage criterion "cell radius inaccuracy," ∆R. We have found this
criterion to be very useful in answering the following two (related) questions:

314
Figure 1. The measurement approach computes the best circular approximation to the equal
power contour. The effective radius,  R, of the cell is measured and the accuracy quantified in
terms of a radius inaccuracy ring, ±∆ R. The average signal strength on the circular contour is
equal to the signal strength of the equal power contour.
1) How many signal strength measurements are needed to accurately estimate the
spatial extent of reliable coverage?
2) How do we best estimate the coverage reliability of single cells with a finite
number of signal strength measurements?
In answering the first question, the equivalent circular contour (i.e., the effective
radius, R) of the cell is estimated as shown in Figure 1. The relationship between the
inaccuracy (∆R) of this radius estimate and the amount of lognormal fading, σ, in
each cell is empirically derived as a function of the number of signal strength
measurements, N (see equation (11)).
Regarding the second question, perhaps the most important finding of this study is
that it is the accuracy of the cell radius estimate (i.e., ∆R), not the accuracy of the
area reliability estimate that is the limiting factor in determining the quality of RF
coverage. The relationship between cell radius inaccuracy and area reliability is also
discussed.
Typically, cell radius estimation and area reliability analyses are not considered
together in propagation optimization. It is found that these two problems cannot be
considered independently, and the consequence of doing so can lead to inaccurate
estimates of RF coverage.
Many vendors of RF tools already use regression to determine the best linear
approximation to the median path loss for the purpose of tuning RF prediction
models. In this paper we investigate the advantages of also measuring the lognormal
fading within each cell to more precisely determine the radius of reliable cellular
coverage. These measurements are used to compute a fade margin for each cell
which is then incorporated in the estimation of the cell’s radius. Thus, the cell radius
is defined explicitly in terms of the desired quality of coverage.
It is recommended that, in addition to area reliability, future wireless validations also
consider cell radius inaccuracy.

II   OVERALL APPROACH
The proposed method estimates the best circular boundary that matches the cell edge
at the desired area reliability, as illustrated in Figure 1. It should be emphasized that
this approach does not in any way require that the true cell edge be circular. Rather,
even the most irregular cell edge can be fitted with a circle such that the average
power along the circumference is equal to the power of the true cell edge. This circle
encloses the area over which the RF signal meets or exceeds the desired area
reliability (e.g., over 90% of the area, the signal power is above -90 dBm). It is the
radius of this fitted circle that is estimated. Thus, this radius can be considered the
“effective radius” of the cell and is well defined for any cell, circular or otherwise.
The accuracy of the cell radius estimate is quantified in terms of a radius inaccuracy
ring, ±∆R, also shown in Figure 1, where ∆R is measured in the same units of
distance as the cell radius, R (e.g., km). The width of this ring depends mostly on
the number of signal strength samples in the regression, and also upon the amount of
lognormal fading in the cell.
The method for estimating area reliability involves determining the propagation
parameters of individual cells and using this information in conjunction with
Reudink’s analysis (see equation (6)) to estimate the area reliability. The propagation
path is approximated by a two-parameter model similar to Hata [1]. A fade margin
based on the actual signal variation within each cell is calculated to ensure the
desired cell edge reliability. It is shown that this area reliability estimation technique
requires much fewer signal strength measurements than the cell radius estimation
approach.
The proposed method can be used to quickly determine the validity of drive test
data. Given enough measurements, simulations show that this technique can be made
almost arbitrarily exact. It is recommended that this method be included as part of
the pre-build validation procedure for any wireless technology (TDMA, AMPS,
CDMA, etc.).
III
APPROACH FOR ESTIMATING THE CELL RADIUS
The proposed approach for estimating the cell radius is graphically summarized in
Figure 2. The measurement method is based on a two parameter propagation model
similar to the prediction formulas of Hata
(1)
where P
is the received power (dBm), Pt is the transmitted power (EIRP) of the
r
base station plus the receiver gain (e.g., Pt = 50 dBm EIRP+Gr), PL is the path loss
(dB), r is the range (km) from the base station, and A and B are the unknown
constants to be estimated from the RF data via linear regression [1]. A fade margin
based on the actual signal variation within each cell is calculated to ensure the
desired cell edge reliability.
Because of the similarity to Hata’s model, it is important to clarify that the method
does not incorporate Hata’s coefficients. Instead, the salient propagation parameters
are estimated from the data since the major goal in this study is RF validation, not
RF prediction.

316
Figure 2. The graphical approach to estimating the cell radius to within ±∆
±∆R . The
received signal strength level (RSL) is plotted versus the range from the base station to each
measurement The mean path loss is computed via linear regression and offset by the fade
margin. The cell radius is defined in terms of the desired coverage reliability as the point
where the faded line crosses the reliability threshold, PTHRESH.
The interior of each cell is divided into approximately 5000 bins which are
uniformly sampled both in range and azimuth. The signal strength measurements in
each bin are averaged to produce a single (average power) value per bin [10]. The
range is then computed from the base station to the center of all  of the bins that
contain measurements. Each bin represents an average power measurement at a
certain range from the base station. The range axis is then mapped to a logarithmic
(common log) scale, the transmit power is combined with the parameter, A, and the
two parameters of the following equivalent model are estimated via linear regression
(2)
where
Once the constants A’ and B have been estimated, the mean trend of the propagation
data is subtracted from the signal strength measurements and the standard deviation,
σ, of the remaining zero-mean process is estimated. The value of σ represents the
composite variation due to two primary factors: lognormal fading and measurement
error. Both of these factors tend to introduce uncorrelated errors since the regression
is computed for range measurements across all azimuth angles which greatly reduces
most spatial correlation effects.
A fade margin, FMσ, that ensures the desired service reliability, F(z), can then be
approximated
F Mσ = Z σ  
(3)

317
where
(4)
For example, cell edge reliabilities of 75% and 90% correspond to fade margins of
about 0.675σ and 1.282σ, respectively. Slightly more precise expressions can be
obtained by limiting the range of the fading to -4σ<z<2σ [3,4]. However, this
provides only a minor improvement in the fade margin estimate since the area under
the tails of the Normal density function is quite small.
It is now straightforward to derive the distance to the cell edge, R, at any desired
signal strength threshold, P THRESH , and service reliability, F(z). From equations (1),
(2),  (3),  and (4)
Any additional static (nonfading) margin, such as building penetration losses, can
also be easily incorporated into the PTHRESH term. Thus, A’, B and, σ are all that is
needed to determine the range from the base station to the cell edge.
Example:
Compute the range to the cell edge assuming the Hata (Cost-231) urban model
constants for 1900 MHz and a base station antenna height of 30 meters:
A= 140
B= 35.2
Also assume
σ = 8 d B
P T H R E S H=-95 dBm
Pt= 50 dBm (EIRP)
F(z) = 75% (i.e., FMσ = 0.675 σ )
From equation (5), for 75% cell edge reliability the estimated radius is
R = 10 – (–95+5.4 – 50+140)/35.2  =  0. 974 km
Similarly, the radius for 90% cell edge reliability is given by
R = 10 –(–95+10.3–50+140)/35.2  =  0.707km 
With no measurement error, exact knowledge of the propagation parameters A’, B,
and σ is equivalent to the exact knowledge of R. The remainder of this paper deals
with the details of how to estimate the parameters A’, B, and σ from actual drive test
data and the precision that results from doing so.

reliability directly determines the area reliability. (The figure is redrawn from Chapter 2 of

coverage.
IV
AREA RELIABILITY ESTIMATION APPROACH
The relationship between the reliability of coverage over a circular area and the
reliability of coverage on the perimeter of the circle was first established by D.O.
Reudink (circa 1974) [2]. The main finding of this study was that cell area reliability
and cell edge reliability obey the simple relationship illustrated in Figure 3. As long
as the propagation path follows a power law, this relationship is completely
determined by the ratio 10σ/B, where σ is the standard deviation of the lognormal
fading within the cell and B/10 is the path loss exponent (e.g., typical values are σ=8
dB and B/10=3.52). As shown in Table 1, given exact knowledge of σ and B, the cell
area reliability (and cell edge reliability) can be exactly computed (see also equation
(6)). Note that although 75% cell edge reliability approximately corresponds to 90%
cell area reliability, and 90% cell edge reliability approximately corresponds to 97%
cell area reliability, their exact values depend on the propagation parameters of each
cell (i.e., σ and B).

Table 2. The relationship between cell area reliability, cell edge reliability and cell radius for
different propagation parameters σ and B and the same transmit power.
The relationship in Figure 3 is apparently independent of the absolute cell radius, as
well as being independent of the transmit and receive power which only serve to
scale the radius. This seems to uncouple the problem of determining the coverage
reliability from the problem estimating the size of a cell. However, the relationship
in Figure 3 does not mean that the cell radius has no effect on coverage reliability.
On the contrary, for the same two-way gain and transmit power, making the cell
radius larger reduces the coverage reliability and decreasing the cell radius increases
the coverage reliability. The dependency on cell radius is implicit through the
desired edge reliability and equation (5). Table 2 demonstrates some of the
relationships between cell radius, cell area reliability, and cell edge reliability for
two cells designed with the same transmit power. In this table, the cell radius is
computed from equation (5) and the area reliability is computed from equation (6).
For example 1, the cell radius at 75% edge reliability (90.72% area) is 1 km, the
radius at 73.5% edge reliability (90%, area) is 1 .021 km. The results are similar for
example 2. Observe that changing the cell radius can have a pronounced effect on
the reliability of RF coverage.
In Reudink’s original derivation of area reliability, the explicit dependence of
coverage on the size of the cell radius was purposely eliminated. Since the cell radius
is one of the estimated quantities of interest in this paper, it is reintroduced into
Reudink’s expression in equation (6). The edge reliability on a contour of range, r, is
where
and
The fraction of usable area, F u, (i.e., area reliability) within the cell can be found by
integrating the contour reliability across range [5,7]:

Figure 4. Block diagram of RF propagation simulation. The inputs to the simulation are
A’, B, and σ. The corresponding outputs are estimated as shown above. The mean-square-
error per sample between the best fitting line and the true mean path loss is used to measure
the performance of the estimation process. The correlation coefficient, ρ, of the best fitting
line with the data is also computed.
This is the formula (i.e.,
) that is used throughout this paper to estimate the
reliability of RF coverage over a circular area. Thus, the approach for measuring
area reliability in this study is as follows:
1) measure the propagation parameters
,
, and
for each cell via linear
regression
2) use these parameters to estimate the cell radius
from equation (5)
3) use the radius and the propagation parameters to estimate the reliability of
coverage,
, over the cell area using equation (6).
In the following section, a simulation is developed to compare the radius estimation
and the area reliability estimation approaches for determining coverage reliability.
V
RF PROPAGATION SIMULATION RESULTS
To test the validity of the radius estimation and area reliability estimation
approaches, an RF propagation simulation was written, as shown in Figure 4. To
reduce the computation, we use a single radial component that is uniformly sampled
along its length. It is also assumed that the simulated measurements result from a
uniform azimuthal sampling of the cell. Hence, the samples along this single radial
represent the composite path loss fluctuations of radials in all azimuth directions.
The single radial of this model is thus considered to be a linear superposition of

321
multiple radials that are uniformly spaced in azimuth. The simulation could
explicitly calculate this superposition, but this is computationally inefficient and
would have no effect on the results.
For a fixed azimuth angle, the fading is correlated along the radial from the base
station. However, the fading between radial components at equally spaced azimuth
angles is nearly uncorrelated. Since the regression is actually evaluated across all
azimuth angles simultaneously, an uncorrelated Gaussian fading model is chosen.
The standard deviation, σ, (typically 5-10 dB) is input into a Gaussian random
number generator which produces uncorrelated normal random variables with zero
mean and variance σ².
The mean path loss is computed for each range value as the product of the logarithm
of range and the path loss coefficient, B, to which is added the intercept value A’.
The variation due to fading is then added to the mean path loss (MPL) also shown in
Figure 4. This concludes the RF signal generation portion of the simulation. The
remainder of the simulation is concerned with estimating A’, B, and σ. Both
and
are computed via linear regression. The estimated mean path loss is then
subtracted from the simulated signal strength values and an estimate of the standard
deviation,
, is made from the resulting zero-mean process. Two major criteria are
used to evaluate the performance of the estimation procedure in the simulation:
1) the correlation coefficient, ρ, between the simulated data and the best fit line
(EMPL). The closer ρ is to unity, the more linear the data. This measure is also used
to characterize the reliability of the field data.
2) the mean square error (MSE) per sample between the best fit line (EMPL) and the
true path loss in the simulation (MPL). This measure cannot be used in the field,
since the true path loss is unknown.
Typical results from the simulation are shown in Figure 5. The following parameters
were the inputs used to generate the 515 data points in this figure:
A= 140
P t= 50 dBm (EIRP)
hence
A' = Pt – A =-90dBm
B= 35.2
σ = 10 dB
The corresponding outputs were
= -88.35
= 36.35
=10.63 dB
ρ = 0.826 (correlation coefficient, where ρ =1 for a line)
MSE per sample = 0.239 dB
The value of ρ=0.826 is typical of that found in actual drive test data. The simulation
estimated the input parameters very well since

The above four values can be made as close to zero as desired by increasing the
number of simulated data points, N. Since these errors depend on the number of data
samples used to compute the regression, a natural question is “How many data
samples are necessary to achieve a given precision?” The accuracy of the
measurement approach is examined in more detail in the next section.
VI
MEASUREMENT ACCURACY VERSUS THE NUMBER OF SAMPLES
This section deals with determining the measurement error of the overall estimation
process. The simulation is used to determine the probability densities of the
following two random variables:
and
(7)
where
e Fu is the relative error of the area availability estimate computed from equation (7)
e R
is the relative error of the cell radius estimate computed from equation (7)

samples in the regression is 1000 and the standard deviation of the lognormal fading is σ = 8
dB.
Fu and
are the true and the estimated area reliability computed from equation (6)
R and
are the true and the estimated cell radius computed from equation (5)
The transformations specified by equation (7) allow a direct comparison of the cell
radius estimate with the area reliability estimate, which would otherwise be difficult
due to the differences in the dimensions of these two estimators (i.e., R is in
kilometers and Fu is a percentage).
Typical probability densities for e Fu and e R are shown in Figure 6. Observe that the
error of the cell radius estimate, eR , is comparable in Figure 6A and 6l3 (Please note
the change of scale on the ordinate). However, e Fu is almost a factor of two smaller
for the 90% cell edge reliability design. The evidence in Figure 6 and all of the
histograms processed in this study demonstrate that both e R and e Fu are well
modeled as zero-mean Normal random variables, and thus, only their respective
variances are needed to characterize the precision of the estimates
and
. These
are determined empirically via Monte Carlo simulation.
We are interested in determining the inaccuracy, ∆R, of the estimate of the cell
radius at a 95% confidence level. The inaccuracy is measured from empirical
histograms by simulating eR
and determining ∆R such that

324
The inaccuracy of the radius estimate, ∆R, is determined by the following two-sided
test
where the zc variable in equation (8) is chosen to yield the desired confidence level,
c. For example, if c=95%, then zc = 1.96. Since eR
has a mean of zero, the
corresponding two-sided normalized radius inaccuracy is
(9)
where δ R is a dimensionless percentage of the cell radius, R.
Likewise, the inaccuracy of the area reliability estimate,
, is estimated from
histograms of e Fu and determining ∆Fu such that
(8)
Since e Fu also has a mean of zero, the inaccuracy of the area reliability estimate,
∆Fu ,  (one sided 95% confidence interval) is
(10)
Each point in the plots in Figure 7 represents the precision (at 95% confidence) that
is obtained after simulating and processing five million signal strength values.
Close inspection of Figure 7 reveals that for a given number of signal strength
samples, N,  the area reliability is much more precise (by one to two orders of
magnitude) than the estimate of the cell radius. For example, 1000 samples in the
regression are needed for about a ± 3% inaccuracy in the cell radius estimate.
However, even with 500 samples in the regression, the area availability estimate is
very precise. The inaccuracy of the area availability estimate is less than 0.5% for
cells designed with 75% cell edge reliability and within 0.2% for cells designed with
90% cell edge reliability.
The inaccuracies of both of the estimates 
  and  
can be approximated by the
following expressions which were determined empirically from the data in Figure 7

where

Observe that the area reliability inaccuracy in equation (12), ∆ Fu , is inversely
proportional to      . It is interesting to compare the magnitudes of the inaccuracies
of the above area reliability measurements with the cell radius inaccuracies. Note
that the area availability estimate, 
 , shown in Figure 7C is always more than ten
(12)

326
times the precision of the cell radius estimate. Figures 7-B and 7-C also show that
Reudink’s area reliability estimate is insensitive to small (±2 dB) changes in σ.
The normalized radius inaccuracy in equation (11 ), δ R ,  is inversely proportional to
the number of samples in the regression, N, and directly proportional to the amount
of lognormal fading, σ, in the cell. Interestingly, radio survey engineers have long
recognized the negative effects that widely varying terrain and clutter environments
have on RF coverage tests. They usually compensate for these effects by taking
many more measurements in these areas. Equation (11) is simply the mathematical
expression of this practice, specifying the relationship between the desired coverage
inaccuracy, δ R, the number of independent signal strength measurements, N, and
the terrain fading factor within the cell, σ.
The most important finding of this analysis is that it is the precision of the estimate
of the cell radius (i.e., equation (11)) that is the limiting factor in determining the
quality of RF coverage, not the precision of the area reliability estimate.
VII DISCUSSION
An accurate method of determining the radius (
) of individual cells was presented.
This led to an even more precise technique for estimating the reliability of coverage
over the area of the cell ( 
).
It was shown that it is possible to obtain an excellent estimate of the area reliability
even if the number of samples is insufficient for estimating the cell radius. This
raises an interesting question concerning the determination of service reliability:
“What is the best metric to use in classifying the quality of RF coverage? ” This
study indicates that area reliability alone is insufficient.
The results of this paper indicate that estimating the effective radius of a cell is the
limiting factor in determining the RF coverage reliability. For a given propagation
environment, computing the distance to the cell edge is deterministic (i.e., apply
equation (5)). For real drive test data, the true cell radius is unknown and must be
statistically estimated. It was shown that as long as the radius estimate is sufficiently
precise, so is the area reliability estimate (    ).
If cell edge reliability is the desired coverage criterion, an accurate estimate of the
cell radius is all that is needed since the cell edge reliability is ensured by the fade
margin used to measure the radius.
However, if area reliability is the desired coverage criterion, then a minor adjustment
to the cell edge reliability (and cell radius) must be made in each cell to compensate
for the variation in the specific values of the propagation constants A’, B, and σ. This
is easily done by first computing the propagation constants via linear regression and
then computing the area reliability from equation (6) at fine range increments (e.g.,
steps of ∆R/2). The desired radius can then be found by inverse interpolation.
The proposed technique is best suited for macrocells. However, it can be modified to
work equally well in microcells by eliminating measurements that have line-of-sight
to the base station. In many cells, the path loss is better described by a composite of
two line segments that intersect at some breakpoint distance near the base station.
For these cases, this distance is approximated and measurements before this point are
eliminated since virtually no outages occur over this region. The best linear fit to

327
the path loss in the outer regions of the cell is extrapolated all the way to the base
station. For most propagation scenarios, the error in the area reliability estimate due
to this approximation is less than 0.5% and less than 1.5% for the radius estimate.
Thus, the proposed method needs no additional parameters or modifications to
accommodate dual-power law propagation environments. However, if these errors
are not tolerable, they can easily be eliminated by incorporating breakpoint distance
into Reudink’s expression (equation (6)).
Although the precision in this study was determined via simulation, we have
processed signal strength measurements from hundreds of cell sites and have found
that the results are completely consistent with those of our simulation.
We have also found cell radius inaccuracy to be very useful in determining the
sampling requirements of cellular drive tests [8,9].
This validation approach is particularly useful to anyone involved with cell planning
since this equates the problem of determining the reliability of RF coverage with that
of determining the effective size of the cell. The latter concept is clearly more useful
to the cellular network planner.
VIII CONCLUSIONS
Cell radius inaccuracy has been proposed as a new method for measuring RF cellular
coverage. The technique measures the distance from the base station to the cell edge
(equation (5)) and quantifies the precision by also specifying the uncertainty of the
radius estimate. In addition, the approach provides an estimate of the area reliability
(equation (6)) which was shown to be much more accurate than the cell radius
estimate. Empirical formulas are given that approximate the precision of both of
these estimates (equations (11) and (12)).
The recommended technique uses linear regression to estimate the minimum mean
square path loss within each cell, and is thus very tolerant to estimation errors due to
terrain fluctuations (e.g., lognormal fading). The approach provides the best circular
approximation to any equal power contour, at any desired reliability. Thus, this
method is ideal for cell site planning with omni antennas for any wireless
technology. For example, using standard CW drive test measurements, this technique
can help verify that the RF design meets the proper amount of overlap in coverage
needed to support the soft handoff regions of CDMA. The method can easily be
modified to provide equally valid coverage measurements for sectored cells [9].
The conclusion of this study is that cell radius estimation and area reliability
estimation should not be treated separately, and that cell radius inaccuracy is the
more critical validation measure.

We discuss a statistical model to generate correlated shadow-fading pat-
terns for wireless systems in the absence of detailed propagation and
landscape information. The current model of shadow-fading postulates a
log-normal marginal distribution for the fading values, and does not ad-
dress correlations. Subsequent introduction of correlations via autocor-
relation models for individual mobiles results in anomalous effects that
depend on traffic density and mobility. Our approach involves generating
a pre-computed set of fading values with the right marginal distributions
and spatial correlations. Motivated from statistical physics, the correla-
tions are introduced in terms of “interaction” parameters, which can be
computed from local measurements. The model is efficiently implemented
using standard linear-algebra methods and is amenable to a statistical-
mechanics treatment. Numerical results show that the patterns produced
are sufficiently clustered and appear reasonable to visual inspection.
Propagation is a crucial factor in the design and performance of wireless
systems. There are several statistical methods to estimate propagation under
different conditions, and most of these methods are computationally intensive.
2D and 3D ray tracing methods, for example, are popular techniques with much
effort devoted to enhance their computational viability (see [l], [7] and refer-
ences therein). Inaccuracies in modeling specific aspects of propagation, such
as shadow-fading, could lead to distorted capacity and performance estimates
in simulations and approximate analytical calculations. Shadow-fading is the
slowly varying component of propagation that arises, as the name suggests,

330
primarily from obstacles. Raleigh fading, which is a propagation variation on
a smaller scale, is also an important factor for stationary or slow moving users
of the wireless system, but we do not deal with it here.
For some applications, it is useful to have a statistical model of propaga-
tion with an empirical validity for the conditions of interest. It is in this spirit
that the log-normal distribution, which is most widely used at the present, was
proposed. In this model, the received power at each location is assumed to be
independent of other locations and log-normally distributed about a determin-
istic large-scale decay, i.e.,
P(r ) = P0(r) e s
(1)
where s is normally distributed with mean 0 and log P0(r) is the average value
of log P (r ) received at distance r from the transmitter after large-scale fading.
Usual forms for this function are P0(r) = A +  B log(r ) (the Hata Model [5])
or simply the power law decay P0(r) =  
where A, B, K and d are specific
constants depending on the environment. While these models are simple and
account for the observed marginal distributions, they fail to capture the spatial
correlations inherent in shadow-fading, which cause its slowly-varying behavior.
As a result, capacity estimates from simulations of wireless systems, especially
sensitive ones such as CDMA, could be highly distorted.
Our interest in generating realistic shadow-fading patterns arose in the con-
text of a simulation study of a novel Interference-Based Dynamic Channel As-
signment algorithm. The proposed algorithm relies on periodic interference
measurements on the inactive frequencies so as to identify appropriate candi-
date channels To obtain accurate estimates of the impact on system capacity
and voice quality, we were confronted with the problem of generating shadow-
fading values consistent with specified marginal distributions and correlation
parameters.
The issue of capturing correlations in shadow-fading has been addressed
previously by Gudmundson [3, 4] by means of an auto-regressive model that is
formulated differently from ours. The correlations considered there are between
the shadow-fading values seen by a mobile as it moves in the environment. How-
ever, our approach is to precompute a static, spatially correlated shadow-fading
pattern with the desired statistics. Thus, we do not encounter anomalies such
as the assignment of completely different shadow-fading values for different mo-
biles at nearby locations or at different times at the same location. In general,
the approach is best suited for simulations that are aimed at obtaining perfor-

331
mance characteristics not directly related to specific propagation aspects, but
would benefit from using realistic fading models for generic environments.

Description of the Model
Assume that we are given a 2D lattice representation of the region in which
we are interested, with the positions of the lattice points being represented by
the pair of indices (i, j) which take integer values in the range [0, N – 1]. While
we are using a rectangular lattice in this description, it would be equally valid to
use a polar grid with the appropriate local transformation of the coefficients*.
We define the random field φ i j, which describes the shadow-fading at position
(i, j), from which the received power is calculated as before.
(2)
We then propose the following joint normal distribution for the {φi j}
(3)
where the “energy” functional E({φ i j}) is given by
(4)
The parameters
are related to the inverse of the conditional variances
of φij, while the parameters
and
introduce correlation between values
at neighboring locations, and thereby potentially a global correlation. We re-
strict our treatment to the case where all the coefficients are positive. We
will postpone to a later section the discussion of the relationship between
these parameters and the measured variance and correlation parameters.  
is a normalization constant known as the “partition function” , and is given by
This terminology is owed to statistical physics, where the µi j  and λ i j  are con-
sidered “interaction parameters” of the φi j , which are termed “order parame-
ters”. The “inverse-temperature” β, which determines the “fluctuations” from
the mean configuration, is not essential to our purpose and is set to unity in
the rest of this analysis.
* Polar coordinates would, in fact, be better suited to capture the radial nature of the
propagation from a point source, by setting different correlation strengths along radial and
tangential directions. The following analysis is however applicable to any coordinate system.

332
We now proceed to examine the properties of equation (4). We can rewrite
the energy functional in matrix notation as
(5)
where φ is a column vector containing all the φ ji , i.e., 
 or
and A is a symmetric, block-tridiagonal matrix of the
form
The matrices D i and A i are given by
where
We have imposed the boundary
conditions
Several interesting mathematical
properties of the specific distribution (3) are discussed in [6]. In particular, A
is diagonally dominant and hence positive-definite, and its inverse consists of
all positive entries.
3
Algorithm
We now discuss an algorithm to generate numbers obeying the joint normal
distribution (3). The matrix A, being symmetric and positive-definite, can be
decomposed as
A = LLT
(6)
which is also referred to as taking the “square root” of the matrix A or as the
Cholesky decomposition of A. In our case, the block tridiagonal structure of A
offers considerable computational advantages by breaking down equation (6) as
(7)

333
and the smaller individual sub-matrices are obtained using standard Cholesky
decomposition as
(8)
 This decomposition allows the change of variables ψ = L
†
T φ and it is readily
verified that the variables ψ ij are uncorrelated univariate Gaussians with mean
0. Thus the φ ij can be obtained by inversion as φ = L – T ψ. Again, the in-
version can be performed more efficiently than in the general case using the
special structure of the matrix as
. Given the matrix A ,
the algorithm to generate the distribution is hence summarized as follows.
• Perform the decomposition (8) and store the matrix LT .
•  Generate the independent Gaussian variables ψi j with mean 0 and vari-
ance 1. This may be performed by several methods using the standard
uniform random-number generators in the range [0, 1]. A simple and
efficient option is the cosine method which involves generating pairs of
uncorrelated Gaussian variables ψ1  and ψ 2 using the uniform variables u1
and u 2  as
• Apply L – T to the vector ψ to obtain φ.
Note that successive samples φ can be generated by simply applying the in-
verse of the stored upper triangular matrix LT  to a different  ψ , which can be
performed with much greater computational efficiency than the first sample.
4 Measurements and Parameter Estimation
For shadow-fading, measurements available pertain to marginal distribu-
tions and correlation lengths. In our case, it is difficult to obtain the marginal
distributions exactly in terms of our parameters, since this requires prior knowl-
edge of the inverse of the matrix A. Suitable approximations may be made using
perturbation expansions and the properties of the matrix A. For identically dis-
tributed φ ij , one can derive approximate relationships between the parameters
of the model and the variance and correlation of the generated distribution.
†The superscript –T stands for the inverse of the transpose.

334
For large grid sizes, one may use the infinite lattice approximation to obtain
the following estimates of the decay rates and variances. The
 are obtained
by solving
(9)
from which the µ’s are obtained as
(10)
These results are also applicable when the parameters change with location,
either due to changing variances/decay lengths or due to changing grid reso-
lutions. However, we require these changes to be slow, i.e. they occur over
spatial scales larger than the correlation lengths. With appropriate local rota-
tion and rescaling of coordinates, the results can hence be applied to polar grid
representations provided the region of interest is not too close to the origin.
In the limit, as the grid representation becomes increasingly fine, the expo-
nential decay of correlations can be rigorously proved [2]. Proofs and further
discussion of the above results follow in a more detailed version.
5 Conclusion
Numerical results, as seen in figures 1 and 2, show that “realistic” looking
patterns can be produced by this method. The computational efficiency and
the off-line nature of this computation help speed up simulations. The values
generated have consistent statistical properties, and are not affected by mobility,
as autocorrelation models are. However, additional memory is required to store
the patterns generated, which limits the admissible grid size/resolution.

A MODEL FOR WWW AND RPC
TRAFFIC IN A
WIRELESS ACCESS NETWORK
Erik Anderlind and Jens Zander

We propose a simple model for future data traffic in wireless access net-
works. It is based on an analysis of the TCP/IP protocols for data communication. Model
parameters are selected so as to resemble traffic from WWW access and from distributed
file systems. By changing a single parameter, the model can be switched between resem-
bling up- or down-link traffic. It is intended for design and performance analysis of radio
resource allocation algorithms in future wireless systems.
1.1 INTRODUCTION
Performance analysis of wireless access networks has mainly been done with very
simple models consisting of either Poisson packet arrival processes or continuous rate
streams with (long) exponentially distributed durations. Traffic from popular multime-
dia applications does not seem to fit well with these analytically convenient models.
Measurements of computer LAN traffic [2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10] also manifest a large dis-
crepancy from the widespread Poisson traffic assumption.
Abstract:

338
In this work we develop a network layer data traffic model that can be used for
design and performance analysis of algorithms for dynamic channel allocation, power
control and access control in wireless cellular networks. We focus on two important
data traffic types that we believe future networks must be capable of efficiently ser-
vicing: WWW traffic, and Remote Procedure Call (RPC) traffic due to distributed file
systems or data base enquiries. This type of traffic could be common to nomadic com-
puting terminals, capable of autonomous operation, but benefiting from transparent
access to data when this is possible.
A fundamental difference between a cellular radio network and e.g. a wired LAN,
such as the ethernet, is that a significantly lower proportion of the system bandwidth
can be allotted to a specific user. Target rates for wide area coverage are in the order
of 32 to 144 kbps, compared to the 10 Mbps of a standard ethernet. Therefor packet
transmission times are significantly longer while the efficiency loss of a 1-10 ms inter-
packet time (e.g. due to protocol processing), can more easily be tolerated. Another
difference is that cellular networks usually separate up- (from terminal to network)
and down-link traffic, either in frequency (FDD) or time (TDD).
In the short term, data traffic can be highly asymmetric. In one direction data is
transferred, while in the other there is mainly acknowledgment traffic. The average
amount of data transferred during a session is not the same for each direction either.
Studies of the distributed file systems AFS [11] and NFS [5] indicate a ratio of α = 3.2
and 2.7 data read operations for every write. The cited ratios are for client stations with
large disks, allowing caching of previously read data, and utilizing a write-back cache
coherency policy. In a study of WWW traffic by Nieminen [8], 90% of the transmitted
bytes were in the down-link direction.
A typical session for a packet data user could be the one shown in Fig. 1.. The
session consists of several bursts of packets, inter-spaced by idle periods. It normally
starts with registration and authentication towards the radio network. Thereafter there
may be an additional registration and authentication with a terminal’s home agent
(e.g. using mobileIP [6,9]). Following these are data traffic bursts due to e.g. WWW
browsing or use of the home network’s distributed file system. Finally there may be a
deregistration sequence.

Example of a packet data user session.
The objective of the model presented below is to catch the non-continuous nature
of packet transmissions. We believe that as long as the access protocol doesn’t utilize
specific knowledge about the model’s parameters, their exact values are of less impor-
tance. In addition to the traffic profile described in the model, there may be numerous

radio resource management control messages e.g. for power control, that might need
to be sent over the physical channel. These are outside the scope of this network layer
traffic description.
1.2
THE TCP AND RPC PROTOCOLS
As a basis for our model we have studied the TCP [12] and Remote Procedure Call
(RPC) protocols. Both protocols use the IP [4, 13] network layer protocol. As IPv6 is
set to replace IPv4, we calculate protocol overhead using the later version. RPC imple-
mentations use either TCP or the simpler, non-acknowledged UDP transport protocol.
We also assume that mobility is handled using care-of addresses (COAs) inserted as
IPv6 extension headers. First we study the TCP protocol.
Assume a WWW user requests a WWW . html document using the HTTP proto-
col [15]. A TCP connection (Fig. 2.) must then be established for the duration of the
transfer. First the sender and receiver must synchronize their flow control windows
(the SYN ( ) and ACK ( ) packets). The time T1 corresponds to one round trip delay.
Thereafter the file is requested (data packet R0) and down-loaded (data packets Dx).
Provided the flow control window is sufficiently large, the time T2 between data pack-
ets depends mostly on the processing speed of the sending terminal and therefore it
is short. However, when starting up a TCP connection, the flow control window is
normally reduced. On the receiving side, each received IP packet is acknowledged
(packets ACKx), where the interpacket time T3 also includes transmission time for the
data packets.
Once the last packet has been acknowledged, the link is closed using a similar
double acknowledgment scheme as for the link establishment. The length of SYN and
ACK packets is primarily determined by the protocol overhead: The minimum length
of a TCP header encapsulated in an IPv6 packet with a single IP extension header for
the COA is 20 + 20 + 40 = 80 bytes. To this must be added any additional IP or TCP
protocol options.
In HTML v1.0 each embedded image is retrieved using a separate TCP connection.
Modern browsers typically open up to four simultaneous TCP sessions when there are

340
several embedded objects. For future systems we can assume the use of HTML v1.1
improvements allowing concatenation of all requests into one TCP session.
The packet sequence (not shown) for an RPC over UDP is somewhat similar. The
requesting client sends an initial packet specifying the targeted file or operation. The
request is acknowledged and thereafter the file (or a part of it) is transferred in a set
of data packets. Prior to retrieving a file, the client may additionally perform one
or several file path-name or directory lookups which generates short or medium size
packets. The minimum length of an encapsulated UDP packet header is 68 bytes.
Measurements by Guesela [5] report a bimodal distribution for NFS [14] packet
lengths. The short packets, around 144 bytes, are for requests and responses containing
NFS and RPC headers, while the long data packets, mostly 1500 bytes, are due to
IPv4 packet fragmentation of the transmitted data. From the same study, the protocol
processing for a SUN-3 workstation resulted in a fragment interpacket time of T2 = 1.9
ms.
1.3 PACKET DATA MODEL
As we saw in the previous section, data exchange typically consists of a number of
short packets with round-trip interpacket delays, needed to set up the request, and then
a set of longer data packets with short interpacket delays, transporting the requested
data. In order to keep the model simple, we need to find a compromise between
WWW and RPC traffic. We first define the model in “pseudo-code” and then discuss
the setting of parameter values (See also Fig. 3.). The sequences of bursts alternate
between data and acknowledgment traffic according to the previously defined read-
write probability α.

7. Output two packet of length L1
8. For i=1 to N
Wait random time T3. Output packet L1.
end
9. Wait exp. distrib. time with avg T4. Goto 2.
For simplicity the model has only three packet types. The short packet, L1 = 80
bytes, corresponds to SYN, ACK, path-name lookup or specification packets of ap-
proximately minimum packet length. The packet L2 = 1.5 kbytes symbolizes the TCP

341
slow start. Assuming a residual link layer BER of 10–6, the standard ethernet packet
length results in an approximate TCP retransmission probability of 1.2%. Finally the
variable length packet L3 contains the rest of the transmitted data.
The time T1 corresponds to one round trip delay, which we assume is to a remote
host connected over a WAN, and therefore set it to T1 = 300 ms. It is measured from
the time the previous packet has been successfully transmitted until the next packet is
generated. Based on the previously cited studies, but adjusting for WWW traffic, we
set the read-write ratio to α = 4.
Figure 3. 
Proposed traffic model: The upper branch is for a request and acknowledg-
ment sequence, while the lower branch represents the transfered data.
Beginning with the data transfer, we observed in the previous section that for con-
gestion control reasons, TCP utilizes a slow start mechanism, which introduces a
round-trip delay after the first packet. Once the flow control window is open, the
interpacket delays tend to be short and therefore we have set the time T2  from Fig. 2.
to zero and collected all additional data into one large packet of length L3. This sim-
plification would however not be suitable if the link data rate is very high.
Continuing with the request and acknowledgment sequence, the data request is
modeled as two back-to-back packet of length L1 . The acknowledgment interpacket
time T3  in a steady state depends primarily on the time it takes to send one IP packet.
Based on a 1.5 kbyte packet transmitted at 128 kbps and adding some variability, we
model T3 as uniformly distributed within [50, 150] ms. The time T3 between the request
and the first acknowledgment approximates the effect of initial file server latencies.
The time to the next burst arrival (Fig. 1.) is dependent on user interactions and is
modeled as an exponentially distributed variable with average T4 = 10 s. Although
actual arrival times surely don’t correspond to this simplification and often are signif-
icantly longer (see e.g. [7, 8]), the chosen value is sufficiently long to necessitate a
release of unused resources and short enough to be practical for simulation studies.
Nevertheless, one will probably need to increase this parameter if the traffic model is
combined with a mobility model where data users move over more than a small pro-
portion of a typical cell’s area. Due to lack of empirical data we have not modeled the
effect of a finite session length. In addition, the time will most certainly depend on
how the service usage is priced.

342
What remains to be specified is the amount of transmitted data in each burst, which
will determine L3 and the number of acknowledgment packets N. Measurements of
a very large number of WWW traces [3], report that the average . html file was 6.4
kbytes, and the average image file size 13.9 kbytes. As .html files often contain
embedded links to image files, the study’s observed data type ratio of 7 times more
image files than .html files could help determine the average received document
size. However all images are not referenced from within documents and it is probable
that the separately retrieved images are significantly larger, which inflates the average
size. The WWW traffic measurements in [8] report a median burst size of 6 kbytes
and a 90-percentile of 50 kbytes.
For distributed file systems, the transferred amount depends on the file length and
the file system data chunk size. In NFS [14] the default data chunk size is 8 kbytes,
while in the more modern distributed file system AFS-3 it is increased to 64 kbytes.
Measurements by Spasojevic and Satyanarayanan [11] on AFS file transfers (exclud-
ing RPC overhead) show a trimodal data chunk distribution with 20% of data chunks
0 – 128 bytes, 34% with 1 – 8 kbytes, and 29% with 32 – 128 kbytes. (The daily per
client average amounts of fetched and stored data were 33 and 7 Mbytes.)
Using these observations as base figures, we choose a bimodal data chunk length
distribution for L3, with equal probabilities for a 6.5 kbytes and a 62.5 kbytes data
chunk. With the above IP packet size of 1.5 kbytes, this would result in N ∈ {7,44}
acknowledgments (includes one additional TCP tear-down packet). We observe that
at a link speed of 128 kbps, transferring the larger amount of data takes 4.3s, which
seems within an acceptable time span for interactive sessions.
1.4 DISCUSSION
Although the model is based on the TCP/IP protocol suite, we believe that the mecha-
nisms in other data protocols are fairly similar. It can be used for efficiency studies of
algorithms for power control, admission and dynamic channel allocation. It can also
be a basis for evaluation of algorithms for link speed renegotiation.
The proposed model is fairly simple and surely does not capture all aspects of future
packet data services. It is important to remember the rather narrow service description
we imposed in the beginning. In an electronic publishing trial reported in [1], the
file length of a single scientific article in the PDF format was in the range 150 to
500 kbytes. These figures were obtained after extensive processing and compression
of the original (much larger) postscript files. It is clear that the greater data content
is not consistent with our model. Due to access control requiring manual entry of
passwords, the traffic profile could also be markedly different. Further work could
perhaps extend the modeling methodology in order to devise models for electronic
payments, electronic publishing and remote terminal or graphical interface emulation.
An obvious model simplification is the modeling of the constant round trip delay.
Network congestion, file server load and differences in physical distances to servers,
all contribute to large variability in this parameter. The most difficult parameter to

343
set was the amount of transmitted data. As the model is for wireless services that do
not yet exist, verification against measurement data is unfortunately not possible. A
reason for not setting the read-write ratio α too high is that new WWW based services
could potentially require content transmission also in the uplink.
The suggested model is suitable for modeling light to moderately loaded systems
where performance quality can be maintained. If transfer delays increase, it is proba-
ble that the user will alter his or her behavior, either by aborting the session, or tending
to choose shorter files (less images). If high loads persist, the retrieved content may
also be adapted to the poor network performance by increased compression and/or
shorter data and image files. This interaction between provided service and observed
traffic is a great difficulty when specifying traffic models. However, the objective of
system design/optimization must be to provide adequate quality for popular services.
Otherwise the customer may choose an alternative service provider.

Abstract:
The objective of using radio resources efficiently has motivated numerous stud-

346
is on the paging traffic when the wireless link is imperfect and the quality of
these links is different in different cells.
The majority of the work on optimal paging has assumed the wireless link to
be perfect so that no errors occur in the paging procedure; that is, the mobile
units always receive the paging messages correctly and their responses in turn
are received correctly by the system. In practice, this assumption does not
hold. For example, mobile units may fail to receive the paging message if they
happen to experience excessive interference or are momentarily out of coverage.
Yet some of these calls could be carried if paging succeeded. Events where the
mobile unit does not respond to paging will be called paging failures in this
paper. In live networks as many as 10–20 per cent of first paging attempts may
fail (this figure includes, however, also call attempts to mobile stations that are
unreachable).
Existing systems that use the location area approach for location manage-
ment, such as GSM [7], tackle paging failures simply by repeating the paging
message in the whole location area. Repaging can be done automatically or
only if the mobile unit does not respond within a given time period. The choice
between these two modes is not obvious and affects for example which network
element should be responsible for repaging. The number of repaging attempts
is typically limited to two or three.
The problem addressed in this paper is how to page a mobile unit optimally
within a given location area and take into account the possibility of paging
failures. The approach taken is to weigh the risk of not finding the mobile unit
against the cost of paging. This is done via an optimization model, which is
solved using techniques from search theory. The optimal strategy turns out
to be sequential and of the same form as in [2], [8] and [l0] but it includes
additionally a stopping time, which indicates when to stop paging and deem
the mobile unit to be unreachable. In addition to the optimal strategy the
paper proposes how to use the results in connection with the traditional paging
of location areas. This boils down to a scheme where the whole location area
is not repaged automatically but only the cells where repaging is deemed to
be most useful. Such a scheme could be used with both fixed and dynamic
location areas [11].
This study makes use of probability information concerning the location
of the mobile unit. In [2],  [5], [6], [8] and [l0] a similar approach has been
taken. In [6] the benefits of repaging were acknowledged, but the likelihood of
a mobile unit not responding to a paging message was the same in all cells. In
[2] and [10] this likelihood was allowed to vary between different cells. However,
[10] did not consider delay constraints on locating the mobile unit, while [2]
proposed to stop the search procedure after a prefixed amount of time has
elapsed. The latter approach can increase the risk of not finding the mobile

347
unit to an unacceptable level, especially if the location information needed in
the optimization is inaccurate. In [5] and [8] paging failures were not considered.
The contribution of this paper is thus to take into account the tradeoff between
paging costs and the risk of losing a call while recognizing that the quality of
the wireless link to vary within the location area. Another contribution are the
proposed repaging scheme and ways of estimating the search model parameters.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section discusses
reasons for paging failure and how to model them. The optimization model
is presented then, as well as ways of determining the model parameters and
using the results in existing mobile systems. A numerical example is provided
in section 4 to illustrate the methods. Finally, the implications of the work to
radio resource management are discussed in section 5.
2 PAGING FAILURES
When the network needs to establish a connection to a mobile unit, the identity
of the mobile unit is broadcast on the paging channels of relevant cells. Typi-
cally these cells are the ones that form the location area where the mobile unit
is registered. When the mobile unit receives the paging message, it contacts
the network via the random access channel of the cell where the mobile unit
camps on.
Let us assume that the mobile unit is within the theoretical geographic
coverage area of some cell when the network starts paging. Paging may fail,
i.e., no connection is established between the mobile unit and the relevant base
station because of at least the following reasons:

The mobile unit does not receive the paging message correctly because of
interference or noise

The mobile unit is momentarily out of the coverage area, e.g., in a tunnel

The mobile unit is switched off without the network knowing it

The mobile unit does not have enough transmit power to contact the base
station

The base station does not receive the random access attempt correctly
because of temporary interference

Channel assignment fails
The last two cases are not interesting because the mobile unit can simply re-
peat the access attempt and establish a connection. The first and the second
situations are the most important ones because the problem may be solved

348
by repeating the paging message. In the remaining two situations, where the
mobile unit has no possibility to establish a connection, repeating the paging
message does not help. Upon a paging failure, the network should ideally make
the repaging decision based on the reason for the failure. The trouble is, of
course, that the network has no way of knowing why paging failed.
We shall use the following simple model to describe paging failures. Given
that a connection can be established with the mobile unit in a cell, paging
failures in that cell are independent random events and have a constant prob-
ability of occurring. The conditional part implies that only the failures where
the mobile unit experiences interference or is momentarily out of coverage are
modeled by this probability. Situations where it is really impossible to estab-
lish a connection, such as when the mobile unit is switched off or does not have
enough transmit power, are excluded.
It seems reasonable to assume that the results of successive paging attempts
are independent as long as interference or noise are the reasons for possible
failure. The likelihood of a failure is not necessarily constant but could depend
for example on network traffic. Failures due to the coverage reason, on the
other hand, are more problematic. Suppose that the mobile unit is in a vehicle
driving in a tunnel when it is paged for the first time. If repaging is attempted
immediately, the mobile unit is still likely to be in the tunnel. Thus the result
of the second paging attempt would not be independent of the first one. As
more time elapses between two paging attempts, they are likely to become
independent . In practice one wants to keep the time between the successive
attempts as short as possible while still allowing sufficient time for the mobile
unit to make a successful random access and the response to be relayed to the
network element in charge of paging control. It is possible that the model does
not capture all reasons of paging failures correctly. Nevertheless, we shall be
satisfied with the simple model and recognize that a more thorough analysis
and validation with real measurements could be in order.
3 OPTIMAL REPAGING
3.1
The Problem of Optimal Stopping
The situation we consider is the following. There are N cells denoted i =
1,. . . , N where the mobile unit may be located. With each cell i there is
associated a probability of paging failure αi, conditional on that the mobile
unit can in fact respond from that cell. The problem is to try to find the
mobile unit while simultaneously minimizing the number of paging messages
sent (i.e., saving radio resources) and maintaining a good quality of service (i.e.,
carrying calls whenever possible).

349
The quality of service and radio resource usage objectives are contradictory.
If the network operator does not want to lose any calls, the mobile unit should
be paged until it is found, no matter how long this takes. If, on the other hand,
one is minimizing the use of radio resources only, one should not page at all.
Clearly both extremes are unacceptable and one has to find a compromise. One
can view this as an optimal stopping problem: For how long should one page
to make the risk of losing a call, which could actually be carried, small enough?
We shall approach this question by modeling it as an optimal search and
stop problem [3], [4]. First, we assume that the mobile unit is located in cell i
with probability p i, i = 1, . . . , N. Furthermore, we assume that when paging
commences there is an a priori probability p 0 > 0 that the mobile unit can not
be reached. Hence
As the objective is to minimize the number of
paging messages sent, we define that sending a paging message in any cell costs
one unit. The tradeoff between the quality of service and the usage of radio
resources is modeled with a penalty cost C that is charged if the mobile unit
is not found. Hence C is a way of measuring the cost of a lost call in terms of
radio resources used in the paging.
A search strategy is denoted by δ = (δ1 , . . . , δs) where δi is the ith cell
to be paged given that the mobile unit has not responded by then and s ∈
{0, 1, …, ∞} is the stopping time. The stopping time means that if the mobile
unit is not found with s messages, one stops and deems the mobile unit to
be unreachable and the penalty cost is charged. The problem is to find the
optimal search strategy δ∗ and the optimal stopping time s* that minimize the
expected cost of locating the mobile unit.
It turns out that the optimal strategy δ∗ is simply the myopic strategy that
always pages the cell with the maximum probability of finding the mobile unit,
and the whole problem reduces to that of choosing the optimal stopping time
[3]. In other words, the optimal strategy δ∗ sends the nth paging message in
cell i where i yields the maximum of p'j (1 – α j ), j = 1, . . . , N. Here p' =
(p'0 , p'1, . . . , p'N ) is the location distribution prior to sending the nth paging
message and conditioned on the previous paging messages.
The optimal stopping time can be determined by considering the equivalent
problem of determining the set of posterior location probabilities for which the
optimal expected cost of the search equals the penalty cost [3]. Let ƒ(p, δ )
denote the expected paging cost when p is the vector of prior location proba-
bilities and δ is used as the search strategy, and let ƒ(p) = infδ ƒ(p , δ). The
optimal stopping region is then defined by S = {p : ƒ(p) = C}.
The exact optimal cost function is difficult to solve but a computationally
feasible approximation has been presented in [4], [9]. It is possible to approxi-

350
mate ƒ(p) through a sequence of functions ƒn (p) defined as
(1)
where Ti p = [(Ti p)0, (Ti p)1 , . . . , (Ti p)N ] is the vector of posterior location prob-
abilities after an unsuccessful paging attempt in cell i, given by
(2)
The interpretation is that ƒn (p) gives the minimum expected cost when at most
n steps are allowed. One can use this to approximate the optimal stopping time
by letting
(3)
where p(δ∗, k) is the vector of posterior location probabilities after k unsuccess-
ful searches with the strategy δ∗.
The numerical example in section 4 demonstrates how to apply this technique
in practice. For practical purposes it seems sufficient to use the approximation
with n = 1 or n = 2.
3.2 Estimation of the Parameters
To be able to use the model one must of course determine the location proba-
bilities and failure probabilities. Let us consider how to determine them when
measurements can be made from one fixed location area.
The overall a priori failure probability can be estimated simply as the ratio
of the number of failed mobile-terminated call attempts to the number of all
mobile-terminated call attempts in a given location area, i.e.,
(4)
Here failed call attempts refer to situations where a mobile unit, which is sup-
posed to be reachable in the location area, does not respond to paging. Data
should be gathered from each location area individually.
Once
is estimated the other location probabilities could simply be taken
as
(5)
This distribution reflects complete uncertainty as to the whereabouts of the
mobile unit within the location area. This level of accuracy is sufficient for the

351
repaging scheme that will be presented in section 3.3. More accurate location
information would be useful especially if separate paging groups and sequential
paging were used [5], [6], [8]. An alternative to (5) would then be to use the
location accuracy matrix method proposed in [6]. A third alternative is to
determine how often mobile-terminated calls have been answered from each
cell and use the respective frequencies as location probabilities. These figures
would have to be scaled to accommodate the a priori failure probability
.
The more refined location probability estimates are likely to depend on the
time of day, and therefore one would ultimately have different paging strategies
for different times of day.
Let us then consider the cell-dependent paging failure probabilities αi. Sup-
pose that M mobile-terminated call attempts arrive to mobile units in the
location area over a given period of time. Of these, theoretically Mi are to mo-
bile units that camp on cell i and can be paged successfully. Given the model
of paging failures used, on the average in (1 – α
i
) M
i
cases the first paging
message will be answered, and in αi(1 – α i)Mi cases the mobile unit answers
after the second paging message. Let us denote the actual numbers, which can
be collected from switch statistics, with mi1 and m i2; that is, the first paging
message has been answered m i1 times from cell i and the second one mi2 times.
Asymptotically these will approach their respective expected values, and hence
one can estimate
(6)
If the failure probabilities are not constant but depend on the traffic in the
network, say, the estimation would have to be made over periods of similar
traffic and one would obtain different estimates for, say, busy hours and quiet
hours. Note that if m 2i = 0, so that there are no recorded events of the second
paging attempt having resulted in success in cell i, then
. Hence, to
enable the estimation of the failure probabilities one must initially operate the
network so that at least one repaging attempt is made in every cell after the
first attempt has failed. The measurement period has to be sufficiently long to
collect enough data from all cells.
3.3
Implementation Issues and a Repaging Scheme
Suppose that the a priori location probabilities p0, p1, . . . , pN and the failure
probabilities α1, . . . , αN have been estimated for the location area, and one
chooses some penalty cost C. One can then compute the optimal search strat-
egy and an approximation of the optimal stopping time, sn , for sòme n. If the
penalty cost is small, e.g., if C = 0, then it is clearly optimal to stop imme-
diately and not to page at all. When the penalty cost increases, it becomes
worthwhile to search for a longer and longer period of time. Thus, one can

352
tune the paging behavior by changing C. Once the value of C has been fixed
for some location area, the same value can be used in the whole network to
guarantee a consistent overall quality of service.
The real optimal paging strategy is sequential. It may thus lead to an
unacceptably large delay in finding the mobile unit even if the penalty cost
bounds the delay of the whole strategy implicitly. Therefore, we propose an
alternative strategy based on modifying the traditional blanket paging of the
whole location area. This strategy has two different implementations depending
on the capabilities of the network element in charge of repaging.
Let δ∗ =
be the optimal strategy. From this one can calculate
the quantities r(1), …, r(N) where r(i) is the number of occurences of cell i
in δ∗. The interpretation is that r(i) gives the maximum number of paging
attempts in cell i. In practice δ∗ will be such that r(i) ≥ 1 for all cells and
in particular, r(i) = 1 for cells with αi = 0. In other words, all cells will be
paged at least once, and those cells where repaging is not useful will not be
paged more than once. If the network element that handles repaging is capable
of relating paging reposponses to paging requests, the modified blanket paging
proceeds as follows. First the whole location area is paged. If the mobile unit
does not answer within a predefined time period, one pages next in cells where
r(i) ≥ 2. If even this fails, one continues paging in all cells with r(i) ≥ 3 and
so on. A more simple scheme must be used if binding of paging responses to
requests is not possible in the entity that handles repaging. An example is the
base station in the GSM system. Then repaging takes place “blindly” but the
number of messages sent in each cell varies according to the quantities r (i),
which would be stored in respective network elements. On base station level
the blind repetitions could be omitted if the paging channel is congested.
The benefit of this scheme is that it can be easily implemented in exist-
ing systems that use location areas. Other alternatives still compatible with
location areas exist too. For example, [6], [8], and [5] have studied schemes
where location areas are partitioned into smaller paging groups that are paged
sequentially. Such schemes can result in considerable reduction of paging traf-
fic. One option would be to use these schemes as such as the first step. If the
mobile unit fails to respond, the schemes would be repeated but with the cells
with r(i) = 1 removed and so on. Alternatively blanket paging over the cells
with r(i) ≥ 2 could be used.
In practical implementations one can calculate the quantities r (i) in advance
for each location area if the a priori location distribution is static, but also on-
line calculation is possible. The values can be stored in the network entity
responsible for paging control. For example, in GSM this would be the mobile
switching center (MSC) if the more intelligent repaging scheme were used.

353
To implement the simple repaging scheme proposed here, MSC can run the
following algorithm for every mobile-terminated call attempt:
Counter := 1
init:
PageList := nil
for all cells in the location area
if cell.MaxPageCount ≥ Counter then
add cell to PageList
if PageList ≠ nil then
Page all cells in PageList
Wait for response
if the mobile unit responded then
Continue call setup; abort paging
else
Counter := Counter+1
goto init
endif
else
The mobile unit is not reachable; abort paging
endif
In GSM, MSC would initiate paging in the relevant cells by sending a message
to their respective base station controllers using the BSSMAP protocol [7]. The
cell identities in the PageList would be given as parameters of the BSSMAP
PAGING message.
To estimate paging failure probabilities using equation (6) MSC would have
to store for each successful mobile-terminated call the identity of the cell from
which the mobile unit responds and the current value of the counter from the
above algorithm. As noted earlier, MaxPageCount should be large enough for
all cells during the estimation. In GSM the cell identity is carried to MSC in
the BSSMAP COMPLETE LAYER 3 INFORMATION message so no changes
in the GSM system specifications would be needed for the implementation.
4 EXAMPLE
Let us consider a fictitious numerical example to illustrate the method. The lo-
cation area in question comprises five cells. Suppose that the a priori probabil-
ity of the mobile unit being unreachable is 5 percent and let us use the uniform
location probability distribution. Thus p0 = .05 and p i = (1 – .05)/5 = .19 for
i = 1,...,5. Furthermore, we shall assume that α1 = α2 = α 5 = 0, α 3 = .01,
and α 4 = .05. In other words, repaging has not been successful in cells 1, 2, and
5 during the period when the paging failure probabilities have been estimated.

Stop
From these figures it is possible to calculate the optimal search order. Note
that the order is independent of the penalty cost, which only affects the stopping
time. For the first step the quantities (1 – αi)pi are calculated and compared.
The maximum is given by i = 1, 2, and 5, and the optimal strategy can thus
begin by paging in any one of them. We choose cell 1 first. If the mobile unit
does not respond to the paging message, the location probabilities are updated
using equation (2). The result is shown in Table 1, which shows the course of the
optimal paging strategy δ*. Note that since the conditional failure probability
is zero in cell 1, the posterior probability p'1 = 0 after an unsuccessful paging
attempt. The same holds for cells 2 and 5 too. Figure 1 illustrates the behavior
of the location probabilities graphically during a sequential search.
The stopping time is obtained simultaneously when the optimal search strat-
egy is calculated. Let us use the approximation f2(p) and take C = 1000. At
each stage of the search one can calculate f2(p) from equation (1) for the cur-
rent vector of location probabilities. If f 2(p) < C the cell indicated by the
optimal strategy is paged; otherwise, one stops and concludes that the mobile
unit is unreachable. The values of f2(p) and the consequent actions are shown
in Table 1 as well. The stopping time is s2 = 8. For comparison, if the penalty
cost were C = 100 the stopping time would be s 2 = 7; the paging order and
the location probabilities would be the same as in Table 1.
To implement the scheme proposed in section 3.3 one needs to calculate the
quantities r(i). For the penalty cost C = 1000 we get r(1) = r(2) = r(5) = 1,
r(3)= 2, and r (4) = 3 from Table 1. Hence one would first page the whole
location area. Upon failure paging would be repeated in cells 3 and 4, and if
necessary, final repaging would take place in cell 4.

5 RADIO RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
This section discusses the benefits of the presented results from the point of
view of saving radio resources. The key of the paging scheme proposed in
section 3.3 is to take into account the differing quality of the wireless control
links. This quality is reflected in the failure probabilities αi .
The application of the results is expected to yield concrete benefits in situ-
ations where cells are different with respect to the paging failure probability.
Then a varying number of messages may be sent in different cells, see Figure
2. This means that for every mobile-terminated call attempt, the expected
number of paging messages varies between the cells. Given the anticipated
mobile-terminated traffic, the expected messages turn into requirements con-
cerning the paging channels, which must have enough capacity to carry the
paging traffic. In other words, the results can be used as input when planning
the capacities of the paging channels. In FDMA or TDMA systems this would
typically mean dedicating a different portion of the available radio resources
for paging in each cell. In CDMA systems, where such explicit allocations are
not necessarily made, the benefits would be in reducing the interference level
slightly in the network.

356
Figure 2
The maximum number of paging attempts depends on the cell.
Sometimes another dimensioning approach can be feasible in FDMA or
TDMA systems. By identifying the cells with the smallest failure probabili-
ties and by dimensioning all paging channels according to the requirements of
these cells, one can isolate paging delays due to channel congestion to the cells
with worse link quality. For example, in the situation of Figure 2 one could
dimension all paging channels as if only one message per call attempt were
needed. Then congestion and delays would be limited to cells where actually
more than one message may be needed.
The concrete benefits and their extent depend of course on the parameters
of the network. If all cells in a location area are equal in terms of paging failure
probability and if the location probability distribution is uniform, the paging
scheme proposed here is no different from the traditional one. Then the benefit
of the analysis is only to give some degree of understanding of the tradeoff
between the paging cost and the risk of losing calls unnecessarily.
6 CONCLUSION
This paper has dealt with the mobile phone location problem when the mobile
phone may fail to respond to paging because of interference or other reasons.
Optimal paging strategies have been derived using search theory. The optimal
strategy is sequential and pages cells in decreasing order of probability of find-
ing the mobile unit. Moreover, the optimal strategy includes a stopping time
when to stop paging and conclude that the mobile unit is unreachable. This
is the main difference to previous work on sequential strategies [2], [8], [10].

357
Methods to estimate the model parameters have been presented as well. The
work concerns of course not only paging due to mobile-terminated speech call
attempts, but paging due to any mobile-terminated connection establishment
needs, such as delivery of mobile-terminated short messages.
The paper has also proposed a simple paging scheme where the optimal num-
ber of repaging attempts is taken into account in the traditional blanket paging
of the whole location area. Implementation issues concerning this strategy have
been discussed. The concrete benefits of optimizing the number of repaging at-
tempts would have to be evaluated on the basis of real network data and would
probably vary from network to network. Such an evaluation has been out of
the scope of the present paper.

LOCATING MOBILE STATIONS WITH
NON-LINE-OF-SIGHT
MEASUREMENTS

1 Problem Introduction
Abstract
We consider the problem of locating mobile stations using range measurements
from several base stations when the direct path from transmitter to receiver may
be intermittently or, quite possibly, continuously blocked. This non-line-of-sight
phenomenon is known to be a major source of error in position location because
it systematically causes the mobile to appear farther away from the base station
than it actually is. In this paper, we present a first order model for the non-line-
of-sight error and show that, under certain conditions, it is possible to (1) detect
the non-line-of-sight error using a hypothesis testing procedure and to (2)
reconstruct the line-of-sight by exploiting a priori knowledge of the statistics of
the standard measurement noise. Simulation examples are presented in order to
demonstrate performance of this algorithm.
There are a number of possible commercial applications for mobile position
estimation, including fleet management and vehicle navigation [1]. A critical
application of position location in cellular systems is in its use with Enhanced-
911 (E-911), which is designed to locate the caller during an emergency.
Although this service is widely available to wireline subscribers, it is not
currently an integral part of the 911 services offered to wireless callers. For this

Center, and a Visiting Scholar at WINLAB.

reason, the FCC has required that by the end of 2001, that wireless service
providers have the capability to locate the caller in 2-D with a horizontal
precision of 125 meters 67% of the time [2]. This mandate, coupled with the
demand for location-dependent services in wireless networks, has motivated
industry-wide interest into the problem of mobile location.
One method for locating a mobile terminal requires measuring the times of
arrival of the radio signal sent by the mobile at a minimum of three base
stations. The travel time of the signal at any particular base station can be
modeled as:
R = c T
(1)
where R is the range, c is the speed of light and T is the one-way travel time of
the radio signal. Each distance measurement generates a circle which is
centered at the measuring base station and which has a radius equal to the range.
The location of the mobile can be estimated by using, for example, the least
squares estimate of the intersection of three or more of these circles. However,
in a dense urban environment, due to reflection and diffraction, the first
detectable wave may actually travel excess path lengths on the order of hundreds
of meters [3]. This non-line-of-sight (NLOS) problem has been recognized by
others as a critical issue, possibly a “killer issue” for mobile location [4]. Thus,
accurate location will require algorithms that are robust to the NLOS error.
Silventoinen and Rantalainen [4] conducted simulations and found that the
mean absolute location error increased linearly with the increase in the mean of
the NLOS errors. Caffery and Stuber [5] developed a constrained location
algorithm to mitigate the effects of NLOS range measurements. Mizusawa and
Woerner [6] demonstrated the adverse effect of using uncorrected NLOS
measurements for mobile location. A survey of positioning techniques for
wireless networks can be found in [7].
This paper examines three aspects of location estimation in a NLOS
environment. In the first part of our work, we discuss modeling the NLOS error
as an AR(1) process. Second, we consider the problem of mode estimation.
Each base station measures its own mobile-to-base distance. By operating on
segments of the range data to calculate a sample test statistic and exploiting our
knowledge of the standard deviation of the standard measurement noise, we can
often estimate whether a group of measurements are predominantly LOS or
NLOS. The third part of this paper concentrates on LOS reconstruction. If there
is strong evidence that the sequence of measurements are NLOS, then they must
be corrected prior to location estimation. We show that it is possible to correct
the NLOS error when there is some a priori knowledge of the (approximate)
support of the standard measurement noise over the real axis.

361
2 The NLOS Error Model
When a mobile loses LOS with the base station, the travel time of the first
detected ray at the base station will be greater than the travel time of a LOS
path. This phenomenon is a randomly occurring event whose spatial correlation
varies as a function of the mobile’s speed and the clutter in the surrounding
environment. The NLOS error is defined as:
where
(2)
(3)
µv is a positive bias, characteristic of range measurements in an outdoor
environment. Typically, µ v  ~ 500m [4].
 denotes the spatial
correlation between adjacent samples; where v is the mobile’s speed, Ts is the
sampling period, D is the decorrelation distance and ε < 1 . One can easily
imagine that as the mobile moves through the environment at a “slow” speed, its
path length error will be highly correlated over small sampling intervals.
Conversely, if the mobile station moves at “faster” speeds through the same
environment with the same sampling rate, one would expect for the path error
to decorrelate sooner. The autoregressive model captures this behavior.
In an urban environment, the mobile may only have LOS with the base
station intermittently. The state of either receiving a LOS or a NLOS
measurement is modeled as a two state Markov switching model. Switching
between states (LOS versus NLOS) is a process that occurs at random intervals
and is governed by a set of state transition probabilities which quantify the
probability of having LOS or NLOS with the base station during the current
sample given its state at the last measurement time. (In [8], the NLOS problem
is considered for the situation in which the measurements are either continually
LOS or continually NLOS). We represent the NLOS error at time tk  as
w(k) = z(k)u(k).
(4)
z(k) is a two state Markov random variable that equals zero/one when the
measurement is LOS/NLOS. The state transition probabilities are given as:
(5)

362
All of the modeling is, of course, subject to verification with real data.
3 Range Measurements
The range measurements at the mth base station (m=1,...,M) at time tk can be
represented as the superposition of three terms:
(6)
Lm (k) is the mobile-to-base range for the mt h base station in 2-D:

where (x(k),y(k)) and (bmx ,b my  ) are the Cartesian coordinates of the
mobile and the m t h  base station (respectively) at tk .  n m  (k) ~ N(0, σ ²m) is the
standard measurement inaccuracy. wm (k) in Equation (4) models the NLOS
error at tk.
4 Mobile Location
Locating a mobile in two coordinates requires the use of range measurements
from three or more base stations. One method of solving for the mobile’s
coordinates is to find the values of
that minimize:
(8)
It is not known a priori which range measurements (if any) contain NLOS
errors. One of the major effects of the NLOS error is to positively bias the range
measurements, so that it appears that the mobile station is farther away from the
base station than it actually is. In the sections following, we discuss the
proposed technique for detecting the Markov process state (NLOS versus LOS),
then correcting these measurements deemed to be from the NLOS state before
location estimation.
4.1 Mode Estimation
Accurate mobile location requires the ability to correctly identify the type of
measurements (LOS versus NLOS) that have been received so that (if

363
where
necessary), we can correct the error before doing least squares estimation.
Naturally, estimating the mode cannot be effectively performed unless we have
some a priori knowledge of the behavior of the measurements under LOS
conditions so that we can detect statistically significant deviations.
When the  mobile is moving, a sequence of LOS measurements is a
nonstationary Gaussian random process that can be expressed as
(9)
(m=1,...,M). Its mean value is the unknown LOS distance, Lm (k), and its
standard deviation, σm , is the standard deviation of the noise, nm (k).
However, when the NLOS error is also present,
(10)
and the measurements are temporally correlated as well as nonstationary.
Assuming that n m (k) and w m (k) are uncorrelated with each other, it follows
that the mean and variance of ym (k) will be
(11)
(12)
Hence, the two major effects of the NLOS error are to increase the mean
and the variance of range measurements. Abrupt changes in the measurements
that can be easily detected by inspection really reduce to detecting when
µ y m (k ) either increases/decreases significantly. However, we are also
interested in those cases in which the change is not readily apparent or when all
of the measurements are either NLOS or LOS and, therefore, no change has
occurred. Our strategy in estimating the Markov process is to find a test statistic
that behaves statistically similarly to the additive white Gaussian noise, nm (k),
when conditions are LOS so that we can detect deviations from the LOS
condition.
to the fact that the range measurements are generally nonstationary. When the

data are stationary, and the means and or variances before and after the jump are
known, then the problem of jump detection reduces to a hypothesis testing
problem using likelihood ratios [10]. However, in this case, since the LOS
distance is the unknown mean value and it is changing with time, we cannot
directly apply the standard likelihood ratio test.
The proposed technique for detecting a jump in the data is based on using a
sliding window to fit a second order polynomial locally to the data. Each
window contains P samples, and the set of measurements associated with the ith
sliding window can be modeled as:
(13)
The window size is P = 2
+ 1. Equation (13) can also be expressed as:

The least squares estimate of am  (i) is given by the pseudo-inverse
(16)
The residual estimation error, which we denote rm (i), is then

365
By substituting Equation (16) into Equation (17), we can also express rm(i) as
(18)
where Ã = I – A(AT A)–1 AT projects onto the space that is orthogonal to the
column space of A.
The more accurately one can estimate am (i), the closer rm (i) will
“resemble” the input noise process and this implies that under ideal
circumstances the average squared deviation of the elements in rm (i) should be
on the order of   σ ²m . A second interpretation of r m (i) is that since it is
orthogonal to the data, that it is in some sense an “estimate” of the input noise
vector and one would expect for it to behave statistically similar to the noise.
Following this logic, the property of rm (i) that we will exploit for mode
estimation is:
(19)
which is a reasonable assumption, given that the second order polynomial is a
good approximation to the behavior of the range over short intervals.
The two possible modes follow:

To estimate the state of the mode, we define
(25)
for i = 
,...,N –
 + 1. Following state estimation, it may be necessary to
perform LOS reconstruction. In the next section, we define the conditions under
which we can correct the NLOS error.
4.2 LOS Reconstruction
When M1 is rejected at a base station, we have evidence that the NLOS error is
(at least) intermittently present within the P sample window of observation.
Under that condition, we employ a technique that exploits our a priori
knowledge of the statistics of the standard measurement noise, nm , in order to
reduce the positive bias and to increase the accuracy of our position estimate.
The LOS reconstruction technique is best understood by fast examining the
statistical properties of the composite error,
(26)
Because n
N(0,σ ²
m (k ) ∼
m ), there is a 95% probability that it will assume
values between (–1.96σ m,1.96σm). The NLOS error, w m (k), is modeled as a
nonnegative random variable which (approximately) ranges over some interval
(0, β), where β > 0. By considering these truncated regions of support, one
can gain a great deal of insight into the proposed solution for this problem.

367
The NLOS error is, by definition, nonnegative since it models excess path
length and in Equation (2) we modeled it as a first order process. Since
and µ v is constant, it follows that the mean and standard
variation of u(k) are given, respectively, by
(27)
Since u(k) is Gaussian, we can show that 95% of the values that it can assume
range over the region 
. Further, given that the
NLOS error is present, em (k) is also Gaussian, with an approximate region of
support over
Suppose the measurements over a P sample window were fit to a second
order polynomial to generate the smoothed curve, sm (k), and that the major
effect of the NLOS
error was
to positively bias this curve. Let
δm (k) = sm (k) – ym (k). Then, the LOS reconstruction technique is to
• Find the time, k = K0 at which δm (k) is maximum. ym (K0 ) will be the
point of maximum deviation of the measured range from the smoothed curve

then the bias will have been removed. However, if the
degree of spatial correlation between adjacent samples approaches unity i.e.,
α → 1, then the NLOS error will approach a constant bias which will be
unresolvable unless one has access to a series of LOS measurements and can
detect a jump when conditions change from LOS to NLOS (or vice versa).
For simulation purposes, we have assigned numerical values to
σ m , σ v , and β based on the real measurements reported in [4]. In [4], the
support of the composite errors is (-400, 1700) meters. From this one could

argue that if the standard measurement noise is symmetrically distributed about
the origin, then its support ranges from (-400,400) meters. This implies that the
NLOS error ranges in value from (0, 1300) meters and that
β = 1300 meters,  σv = 330 meters and µ v = 647 meters. Based on the relation
400  = 1.96σm, we have that σm = 204 meters.
In the following examples, we illustrate the LOS reconstruction algorithm for
different decorrelation distances, D, for the case in which the NLOS error is
continuously present. The numerical values chosen are given in Table 1.
Table 1: The simulation parameters used in Figures (1-6).
All distances are expressed in meters, time in seconds. The value of D
changes in each example from D = 30, 60, 120, respectively, in order to
demonstrate the effect of the increased correlation on the performance of the
LOS reconstruction algorithm. Results from the first simulation (D = 30),
shown in Figures (1-2), indicate that if the correlation is small that it is possible
to reconstruct the LOS. Results from the second example (D=60) are reported in
Figures (3-4) and show how the increased correlation has begun to adversely
affect the reconstruction algorithm. This effect is even more pronounced in the
third example (D = 120) (see Figures (5) and (6)).
4.3 2-D Mobile Location
In this section, we discuss 2-D location of the mobile. Following mode
estimation at each base station, there are two possible cases. For case (1), the
majority of the measurements have been declared LOS, while in case (2), the
majority of the measurements have been declared NLOS. For case (1), location
of the mobile is straightforward. The measurements can be first smoothed using
a polynomial fit in order to reduce the effect of any undetected NLOS
measurements and then the smoothed fit can be used along with the (smoothed)
range measurements from other base stations to find the least squares position
estimate. In case (2), when a clear majority of the measurements have been
declared NLOS, then we can use the LOS reconstruction technique in order to
reduce the effect of the bias. After error correction, we will then use these
measurements, along with the measurements from other base stations, to
estimate position.
In each of the following simulations, all of the measurements were treated as
LOS/NLOS if over 60% of them were declared to be LOS/NLOS, respectively.

369
5 Simulations
In all of the following simulations, the mobile -base station geometry is the same
as is shown in Figure (7). The mobile’s coordinates were given by
for k=0,...,200 and the base stations were located at
(29)
(30)
The mean NLOS error was µ v = 500, σ m  = 150 and σ v  = 200 (m=1,...,3).
The spatial correlation was α = 0.34.
5.1 Simulation I
In this simulation, we demonstrate the performance of the mode estimation
algorithm for the case in which the transition probabilities are given by:
(31)
The true mode is shown in Figure (8a), while the estimated mode is shown in
Figure (8b). The window length, P=10.
5.2 Simulation II
In this simulation,
(32)
The simulated, true, and corrected ranges are shown in Figure (9), and indicate
that the NLOS correction technique was able to reduce the bias in the range.
The estimated trajectory of the mobile station is compared to the true trajectory
in Figure (10). The window length, P=25.

370
5.3 Simulation III
We repeated the simulation in Example II over 200 independent trials in order to
assess the performance of the location algorithm in the presence of the NLOS
error with P=25. In Figure (1l), the mean location estimate is compared to the
true location and the average error is well below the mean of the NLOS error,
µ v
= 500 meters. As was mentioned in the introduction, the FCC has
mandated that 67% or the time, the location estimate should be within 125
meters of the true value. In Figure (12), the ordinate is the mark. The NLOS
error, if detected, was corrected and then the corrected measurements were used
for estimating location. In most cases, the error appears to be less than twice the
upper bound specified by the FCC.
6 Conclusion
We have presented a new tracking algorithm that is capable of discriminating
between LOS versus NLOS range measurements and correcting the NLOS error
by using a priori knowledge of the approximate support of the noise over the
real axis. Simulation results indicate that the positive ranging bias, which is
caused by the NLOS error, was reduced by several orders of magnitude after
performing the LOS reconstruction technique. The results encourage further
investigation into variations of the algorithms and such issues as correlated
measurements, other scenarios, sensitivities to parameters, etc., and, of course,
investigation with real measurements.
