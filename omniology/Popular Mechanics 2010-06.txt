suicidal, but that‚Äôs 
what makes Corliss

Jeb Corliss is secretive about the wingsuit that will enable him to leap from a helicopter and land without a para-
chute. So PM asked designers and other experts for some informed speculation about what the next-gen version 
might look like. Here‚Äôs the result, as conceptualized by Pixar Animation Studios‚Äô technical direor Nathan Fariss.

P M  E D I T O R ‚Äô S  N O T E
It was 2:46 am on March 23, 2008, when a mayday call 
came into the U.S. Coast Guard station in Kodiak, Alaska. 
The Alaska Ranger, a 184-foot Ô¨Åshing trawler, was taking 
on water in the frigid Bering Sea, with 47 souls on board. 
So began the biggest and most daring open-water rescue 
operation in the Coast Guard‚Äôs history. 
By the time the Ô¨Årst Coast Guard helicopter arrived, the 
Ranger was gone. Fewer than half of the crew had made it 
into life rafts; the rest were Ô¨Çoating in 35-degree water, pro-
tected only by neoprene survival suits, each one marked by 
a strobe. From the cockpit, all the pilots could see was a 
long string of Ô¨Çashing lights, as if marking some ragged, 
undulating runway stretching across the dark waves. 
When we heard the news about the Ranger sinking, we 
asked Popular Mechanics contributing editor Kalee 
Thompson, a veteran outdoor journalist who began her 
career at the National Geographic Society, to tackle this 
breaking story. Over the next few weeks, she interviewed 
survivors and rescuers, attended investigative hearings 
and produced the Ô¨Årst deÔ¨Ånitive account of the sinking, 
‚ÄúRanger Down,‚Äù the cover story of our July 2008 issue. 
This month, Thompson‚Äôs Deadliest Sea hits bookstores. 
Thompson‚Äôs research took her to the remote Alaskan Ô¨Åsh-
ing port of Dutch Harbor, across the Bering Sea aboard 
the Coast Guard Cutter Munro and into the air with Coast 
Guard helicopter pilots. And what a tale she brought 
home. Like Into Thin Air and The Perfect Storm, Deadliest 
Research for her book DeadlieÔ¨Ü 
Sea took PM contributing editor 
Kalee ompson (right) to CoaÔ¨Ü 
Guard Ô¨Üations in Alaska and the 
PaciÔ¨Åc NorthweÔ¨Ü.
Story of an Epic Rescue
e massive 
rescue operation 
to save the crew 
of the Alaska 
Ranger was 
the subje of a 
2008 PM cover 
Ô¨Üory. Now, 
author ompson 
chronicles the 
event in more 
detail in her 
new book,  
DeadlieÔ¨Ü Sea.
Sea is a gripping story of death and survival in one of the 
world‚Äôs most dangerous places. It is also a portrait of hero-
ism. Thompson reaches deep into the culture of the Coast 
Guard, helping us to understand the bravery of rescue swim-
mers eager to drop into frigid waters protected by little more 
than a drysuit, the skills of pilots and Ô¨Çight mechanics hoist-
ing survivors up from surging waves and the dedication of 
sailors who spend years at sea training for the moment when 
they will be called upon to save a life. We need more stories 
like this. I can‚Äôt think 
of a better writer than 
Kalee Thompson to tell 
this one.

‚Äúbelow‚Äù to the drinking fountain. Some 
said they had been to the ice cream 
Ô¨Üand on the ship. 
During the fourth day, a plane spot-
ted us and waggled its wings. We 
waited well paÔ¨Ü midnight for a ship to 
pick us up. No one missed us, although 
Navy ships used to run on tight sched-
ules and we were expected for gun-
nery praice almoÔ¨Ü three days earlier. 
is was the worÔ¨Ü screw-up the Navy 
ever had. Out of the original crew of 
1199, only 316 survived. 
How is it I did and so many did not? 
I Ô¨Årmly believe it was because I didn‚Äôt 
think I had anywhere to go‚Äîothers 
believed heaven was waiting for them. 
To survive, I kept thinking I should 
keep on treading water and waiting. I 
hope this brings to your attention the 
will to live as the most important 
ingredient in a rescue.

life jacket, in the pitch-black darkness. 
I thought I would wake up in my bunk, 
dry, having had a bad dream.
I swam about an hour and finally 
found two sailors with a preserver. 
I hung on to it until morning when I 
spotted a loose life jacket. Some time 
that aernoon, we saw a small group 
of sailors with four big life floaters 
built for about 10 people each. I could 
not get aboard because there was 
no room but I tied myself to the group. 
I know how delirious the others got. 
I decided I would use as little energy 
as I could and only worry seriously 
when I could see no others‚Äô faces. 
e group had a keg of water but it 
was impossible to drink out of it. It 
was heavy and, when lied, one would 
go underwater. Some sailors were 
attacked by sharks. Some, in their 
delirious states, would swim away, 
and others said they were going 
How I Survived
There is one thing missing from the 
survival stories that you published in 
the April 2010 issue‚Äîthe desire to 
live. You may think that is in all peo-
ples‚Äô thoughts, but it is not. 
I am a survivor of the sinking of 
the USS Indianapolis.  I was on 
watch just after midnight when the 
ship was hit [by torpedoes fired from 
the Japanese submarine I-58 ]. At Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü 
I thought it was a boiler exploding 
because I saw flames shooting up 
through the Ô¨Üack. We loÔ¨Ü communi-
cations, and in a few minutes we 
began to list starboard. I slipped and 
fell, and when I got up the ship was 
leaning. My watch station was about 
60 feet up and I saw water a few feet 
from me. I prepared to jump. 
Training taught me to swim away 
so I would not get caught in any 
suction. I swam as far as I could on 
one breath, and when I looked again, 
I saw a propeller coming down on me, 
still turning. I became a motivated 
swimmer, and the next time I looked 
the ship was gone. Here I was, alone, 
in the middle of the ocean without a

Hushed Helicopters
+ 
European aerospace company Eurocopter is ready to 
sell redesigned helicopter blades that nearly silence 
the noise of the main rotors and dampen vibrations that 
wear out mechanical parts. e double-swept shape of 
Blue Edge rotors diminishes the interference created when 
the tip of a whirling blade hits the vortex created by the 
blade preceding it. A trio of piezoeleric Ô¨Çaps on the 
trailing edge of each rotor blade move 15 to 40 times per 
second, automatically compensating for blade-vortex 
interaion. Civilian and military operators could use 
helicopters and unmanned aircra more broadly if the cra

A FedEx McDonnell Douglas 
freighter, landing through guÔ¨Üy 
winds at Tokyo‚Äôs Narita International 
Airport on March 23, 2009, bounces 
during touchdown. As the airplane 
impas the runway a second time, it 
banks sharply, snapping the port wing on 
the ground and rupturing a fuel tank. In 
Ô¨Çames, the MD-11 rolls over onto its 
back, then slides out of view of the airport 
surveillance camera Ô¨Ålming the tragedy. 
Both pilots are killed. e accident, Ô¨Üill 
under inveÔ¨Üigation, appears to be a 
carbon copy of two previous MD-11 
crashes‚Äîa FedEx freighter at Newark 
International Airport, N.J., in 1997 and a 
China Airlines passenger jet at Hong Kong 
International Airport in 1999. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never 
heard of a landing Ô¨Çip-over with any other 
type of airliner,‚Äù says John DeLisi, deputy 
direor of aviation safety at the National 
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). ‚Äúe 
MD-11 has done it three times.‚Äù Only 11 
of 200 built Ô¨Üill carry commercial 
passengers, for KLM and World Airways.
 T E C H W A T C H
L?q4YVsjYRkq e NTSB determined that the MD-11‚Äôs controls are more sensitive than 
other airplanes‚Äô, especially at low speeds and altitudes. Also, pilots have reported that the air-
plane‚Äôs autopilot was not disconneing when they input manual controls, as happens in other 
airplanes. e safety board asked that the soware be changed, and Boeing (which bought 
McDonnell Douglas in 1997) did so in 2000. But the poor reviews continued. ‚Äúe 11 is more 
than a handful to Ô¨Çy,‚Äù says a FedEx pilot who Ô¨Çies MD-10s and 11s. ‚ÄúAnd the landing speed is 
20 or 30 mph higher [than the MD-10‚Äôs], so things happen faÔ¨Üer.‚Äù
L?q\NRYskq InveÔ¨Üigative reports about the MD-11 crashes in Hong Kong and Newark cite 
the cause as pilot error. While Ô¨Üudying the Newark crash, the NTSB found that the energy 
transmitted to the right main landing gear during the second touchdown was 3.2 times greater 
than the MD-11‚Äôs maximum certiÔ¨Åed tolerance. Boeing Ô¨Çight operations Ô¨ÜaÔ¨Ä say that it would 
take a similar, atypically hard impa to cause the damage that occurred at Narita, and that the 
MD-11‚Äôs landing-gear design is not at fault. e NTSB has urged airlines to train pilots to better 
handle the airplane if it moves erratically.  
L?q,Rw?\jNVskq In the late 1980s, engineers at McDonnell Douglas updated the 1960s 
DC-10 and reduced the size of the plane‚Äôs horizontal Ô¨Üabilizer by about 12 feet, which cut 
weight and drag. Depending on an airplane‚Äôs center of gravity, the smaller the horizontal 
Ô¨Üabilizer, the less longitudinal Ô¨Üability the plane has. e MD-11 entered service with a syÔ¨Üem 
that automatically moves elevators on the Ô¨Üabilizers to compensate for unwanted pitching. 
However, the plane Ô¨Üill has a reputation for unexpeed motion. ‚ÄúIn windy conditions, the MD-
11 can be a bear to land,‚Äù says Ken Adams, an air-safety inveÔ¨Üigator and former Delta MD-11 
  q 7
?j:N4sq Sensitive controls make the MD-11 tough to handle, which contributes to pilot 
error that can deÔ¨Üroy airplanes during hard landings.

Engineers at MIT have devised 
what they call a new way of 
producing elericity. By coating a 
microscopic carbon nanotube with a 
layer of fuel and igniting one end 
with a spark or laser, they‚Äôre able to 
send a wave of heat shooting 
through the nanotube‚Äôs interior. is 
thermal wave pushes elerons in its 
path, generating a signiÔ¨Åcant eleric 
current. Prototypes already have 
energy density 100 times greater 
than lithium-ion batteries, and they 
can be Ô¨Üored indeÔ¨Ånitely without 
leaking charge. e researchers are 
now inveÔ¨Üigating optimal fuels and, 
to make the syÔ¨Üem reusable, will 
have to invent a way to automati-
cally apply a fresh layer of fuel aer 
the Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü burns away.
 Why wait for elusive cosmic 
particles to arrive from space 
when you can order them on 
demand? A multinational team 
of researchers in Japan became 
the Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü to dete a man-made 
neutrino particle, aer shooting 
it underground from a particle 
accelerator to the massive 
Super-Kamiokande deteor  
185 miles away. e deteor is 
housed in a 12 million gallon tank 
of water surrounded by 11,000 
light sensors, at the bottom of an 
abandoned mine 3300 feet 
underground. e neutrinos 
impa water molecules and the sensors record the pattern of light 
radiated by the collisions. TeÔ¨Üs with the controlled beam of neutrinos 
could prove that the particles change as they travel, and Ô¨Ürengthen 
the growing consensus among particle physiciÔ¨Üs that neutrinos have 
mass‚Äîa conclusion that would inÔ¨Çuence the ongoing debate over the 
balance between matter and antimatter in the universe.  ‚Äî A.H.

Every four years, the German company Adidas unveils 
what they hope is the perfe soccer ball, to be used in 
the FIFA World Cup. For the 2010 tournament, which 
begins in June in South Africa, designers used a wind 
tunnel to create a highly calibrated soccer ball of optimal 
roundness and Ô¨Üable Ô¨Çight. But how much is the game 
inÔ¨Çuenced by player skill versus ball design? ‚ÄúIf you have 
good technique, then I think you can hit any ball well,‚Äù 
says former U.S. national team member Alexi Lalas. ‚ÄúBut 
the advances in technology have made it easier to use

 A new type of energy-saving drywall promises to keep houses cooler in the day and 
warmer at night. National Gypsum‚Äôs ermalCORE drywall is embedded with micro-
scopic spheres of paraÔ¨Én wax that melt when the indoor temperature exceeds 73 F and 
solidify when it cools below that. is phase change  allows the walls of homes and other 
Ô¨Üruures to absorb excess heat during the day and release it during the evening.  
Moderating the interior temperature subtly lowers energy use, especially helpful during 
peak hours. Engineers from the German company BASF are conduing teÔ¨Üs in Califor-
nia to determine the potential savings of using the drywall in U.S. homes. ‚Äî A.H.

as many scorpion Ô¨Üings per year as coral 
snake bites), it could take decades for 
Bioclon to make its money back. 
Envenomation experts express 
exasperation and disbelief at the 
situation. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ridiculous that we‚Äôre 
losing a technology that we already 
have,‚Äù says Joe Pittman, a snakebite 
treatment specialiÔ¨Ü at the Florida 
Poison Information Center in Tampa. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs even more ludicrous that we have a 
produ that‚Äòs available, and we have to 
jump through so many hoops to get it 
approved.‚Äù In July 2009, an FDA 
advisory board determined that 
Coralmyn qualiÔ¨Åed for an accelerated 
approval process, but there is Ô¨Üill no one 
with the eÔ¨Üimated $3 million to $5 
million to pay for the required Ô¨Üudies. 
‚ÄúNobody in this situation is being a 
bad aor,‚Äù says Eric Lavonas of the 
Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center. 
‚ÄúWe juÔ¨Ü don‚Äôt have a syÔ¨Üem set up to 
deal with it.‚Äù With no adequate replace-
ment for coral snake antivenom, 
hospitals are likely to appeal to local 
zoos, many of which maintain small 
Ô¨Üocks for their Ô¨ÜaÔ¨Ä. But zoos are under 
no obligation to provide the medicine. 
If and when shortages do occur, many 
hospitals will have no other option but to 
intubate coral snake bite viims on 
ventilators for weeks until the eÔ¨Äes of 
the toxin wear oÔ¨Ä‚Äîpotentially coÔ¨Üing  
hundreds of thousands of dollars per bite. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably going to end up coÔ¨Üing us 
far more not to deal with this than to deal 
with it,‚Äù Lavonas says, ‚Äúboth in human 
suÔ¨Äering, and in dollars and cents.‚Äù
only about 100 or so bites each year.
What the coral lacks in belliger-
ence, it makes up for in neurotoxicity. 
Unlike bites from pit vipers, which cause 
immense pain and swelling at the wound 
site, coral snake viims usually report 
little pain aer being bitten. But the 
eÔ¨Äes begin to show within hours, with 
symptoms such as tingling sensations in 
the extremities, dysarthria (slurred 
speech) and ptosis (droopy eyelids). en 
a viim‚Äôs lungs shut down. ‚Äúe venom 
as as a neuromuscular blockade to the 
lungs,‚Äù University of Florida professor of 
medicine Craig Kitchens says. ‚ÄúWithout 
antivenom, you need artiÔ¨Åcial respiration 
or you die.‚Äù 
Unfortunately, aer O. 31 of this 
year, there may be no commercially 
available antivenom (antivenin) le. at‚Äôs 
the expiration date on exiÔ¨Üing vials of 
Micrurus fulvius, the only antivenom 
approved by the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration for coral snake bites. Produced by 
Wyeth, now owned by PÔ¨Åzer, the 
antivenom was approved for sale in 1967, 
in a time of less Ô¨Üringent regulation.
Wyeth kept up produion of coral 
snake antivenom for almoÔ¨Ü 40 years. 
But given the rarity of coral snake bites, 
it was hardly a proÔ¨Åt center, and the 
company shut down 
the faory that made 
the antivenom in 2003. 
Wyeth worked with the 
FDA to produce a 
Ô¨Åve-year supply of the 
medicine to provide a 
Ô¨Üopgap while other 
options were pursued. 
Aer that period, the FDA extended the 
expiration date on exiÔ¨Üing Ô¨Üock from 
2008 to 2009, and then again from 
2009 to 2010. But as of press time, no 
new manufaurer has Ô¨Üepped forward.
Antivenom shortages are a surprisingly 
common occurrence. e entire Ô¨Üate of 
Arizona ran out of antivenom for 
scorpion Ô¨Üings aer Marilyn Bloom, an 
envenomation specialiÔ¨Ü at Arizona 
State University, retired in 1999. Bloom 
had been single-handedly making all the 
scorpion antivenom for Ô¨Üate hospitals. 
Recently, Merck & Co, the only FDA-
licensed producer of black widow 
antivenom, has cut back diÔ¨Üribution 
because of a produion shortage of the 
drug. In a 2007 report, the World 
Health Organization liÔ¨Üed worldwide

we‚Äôve been covering American ingenuity for 108 years. 
at‚Äôs why the HiÔ¨Üory Channel asked PM editor-in-chief 
Jim Meigs to provide expert commentary. In addition to 
onscreen contributions, PM is also poÔ¨Üing online deep

TELEGRAPH
Episode 5, Civil War 
Abe Lincoln was the Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü 
wired president. At the 
outbreak of the Civil War, 
there was no telegraph 
line to the White House. 
Within a year, Lincoln was 
sending telegrams direly 
to his Ô¨Åeld commanders.
SAFETY ELEVATOR
Episode 7, City
e concept of the 
elevator goes back to 
Archimedes, but it wasn‚Äôt 
until 1852 that Elisha 
Otis introduced the 
safety elevator, which 
used locking rollers to 
Ô¨Üop the cab if it 
descended too quickly. 
Otis‚Äôs invention made 
high-rise cities possible. 
HOOVER DAM
Episode 9, BuÔ¨Ü
During the Great 
Depression, the Hoover 
Dam employed 21,000

 Creating the perfe folding bike 
has proved a persiÔ¨Üent engineering 
challenge (patents date back to the 
1800s). e problems: MoÔ¨Ü folding 
mechanisms add a lot of weight, are 
diÔ¨Écult to use and take a long time to 
fold and unfold. e eight-speed Giant 
 Clip ($1025)  doesn‚Äôt quite perfe the 
concept (at 25 pounds, the rig is a bit 
on the heavy side), but it‚Äôs pretty close. 
e folding process takes about 20 
seconds and, once folded, the whole 
thing sits upright on the kickÔ¨Üand, 
making it easy to park or Ô¨Üash. Yes, it‚Äôs 
pricey, but for commuters who place a 
premium on portability, it rocks.

Dogfight
e 78th running of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, which Ô¨Üarts on 
June 12, will be the Corvette racing squad‚Äôs tougheÔ¨Ü challenge to 
date. Aer years of dominating the lightly conteÔ¨Üed GT1 class, the 
Vette team moves into the Ô¨Åercely fought GT2 category, where it 
will battle faory teams from Ferrari, Porsche and BMW. To 
prepare, there‚Äôs an all-new racer based on the Z06 produion car. 
Although moÔ¨Ü parts have been modiÔ¨Åed or changed‚Äîfor inÔ¨Üance, 
cuÔ¨Üom-made single-lug wheel nuts will speed pit Ô¨Üops‚Äîthe 
aluminum frame remains, and 85 percent of the body geometry 
carries over. e racer‚Äôs 5.5-liter V8 uses the produion block and 
16 pushrod-aivated valves. ere‚Äôs even air conditioning, although 
the race car uses the Volt‚Äôs eleric compressor to save fuel. e 
team is tight-lipped on details‚Äîno sense tipping oÔ¨Ä the other 
teams‚Äîbut it did reveal that the engine makes 485 hp.  
Plus it returns 4.1 mpg burning E85, an aÔ¨Üonishing  
Ô¨Ågure considering the car nears 200 mph around the

Hard-Charging Sport Ute
‚ÄúSporty SUV‚Äù is a bit of an oxymoron, 
but Mitsubishi‚Äôs Outlander GT deÔ¨Åes 
expeations. is model employs 
Mitsu‚Äôs S-AWC syÔ¨Üem, which diÔ¨Ürib-
utes torque between the front tires and 
the rear axle. e syÔ¨Üem aÔ¨Äes not 
juÔ¨Ü traion but also handling. A rotary 
knob switches between tarmac and

roads the GT cuts a precise line, feeling 
surprisingly frisky for a seven-passenger 
wagon. Squeeze the gas while exiting a 
corner and it overdrives the outside 
wheel, increasing the turn rate like a 
kayaker paddling harder on one side. 
Other sporty bits include shier paddles 
that manually operate the six-speed 
automatic gearbox, and a new, 
eye-catching schnoz. With a 230-hp 
3.0-liter V6, acceleration is brisk. Even

elerically assiÔ¨Üed power Ô¨Üeering. 
Interior goodies include a navigation 
syÔ¨Üem and backup camera. 
Both cars are 
impressively 
well-rounded 
daily drivers with 
swanky, attrac-
tive interiors  
and gobs of 
performance at 
a decent price. 
The V6 model  
is no longer a 
secretary‚Äôs 
special, although 
it‚Äôs hard to take 
it seriously after 
driving the 
thumping V8. If 
you want decent 
mileage, buy a 
Focus. Life 
begins at 5.0. 
Equipped with the 
wonderfully precise 
short-throw manual shier, the V8 
scoots from 0 to 60 mph in 4.9 
seconds, and the V6 does it in 5.5. Both 
easily run the quarter-mile in the 
13-second range. at‚Äôs respeably 
quick, but the V8 feels considerably 
faÔ¨Üer thanks to a plaÔ¨Üic tube that 
routes the V8‚Äôs husky wail direly to 
the cabin. It‚Äôs a gratifying sensation 
when the V8 reaches its peak of 390 
lb- of torque at 4250 rpm. 
Drop into sixth gear at 60 mph, 
however, and the GT lopes along quietly 
at 1800 rpm, as wind noise and whispers 
easily drown out the exhauÔ¨Ü. Happily, 
engine noise is juÔ¨Ü a downshi away.
Standard V6 models are on the so 
side, but the optional Performance 
Package Ô¨ÜiÔ¨Äens the suspension. So 
equipped, the V6 matches the GT‚Äôs 
precise handling and Ô¨Årmly damped ride.

e MV AguÔ¨Üa 
Brutale 1090RR is 
every bit a Ô¨Üylish, 
charismatic 
charmer.  But 
unlike other 
exclusive bikes, 
this one operates 
without annoying 
idiosyncrasies. 
Crack open the 
throttle and the 
fuel-injeed, 
144-hp four- 
cylinder pulls like a 
Saturn rocket‚Äî
even at 20 mph in 
sixth gear. e

notches gear 
changes, and a 
slipper mechanism 
in the clutch 
reduces wheel 
chatter. is bike 
turns a 90-minute 
NYC commute into 
a blow-out-the-

adventure. 
LiÔ¨Üening to the 
wailing engine 
note bouncing oÔ¨Ä 
the Lincoln Tunnel 
borders on a 
religious 
experience. e 
attention to detail 
further sets this 
bike apart, with 
Ô¨Çawless welds and 
excellent 
ergonomics. e 
former alone make 
the eÔ¨Üimated 
$18,000 price 
seem reasonable.

Elerifying SUV
VW‚Äôs Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü produion hybrid powertrain 
debuts in the new Touareg with an 
eleric motor sandwiched between the 
engine and the transmission. A clutch 
decouples the supercharged 3.0-liter 
333-hp V6 and the 46-hp eleric motor. 
So with the 1.7-kilowatt-hour NiMH 
battery pack, this SUV can motor 
elerically for about a mile at up to 30 
mph. VW says fuel economy increases 
by 25 percent and might touch 30 on the 
EPA highway cycle. e two power 
sources coordinate seamlessly‚Äîthere‚Äôs 
barely a shudder when the engine kicks 
in. It performs too‚Äîsprints to 60 mph 
take about 6.5 seconds‚Äîand tows 7700 
pounds, juÔ¨Ü like a pickup truck. e only 
downside: a base price that‚Äôs likely to be 
in the 50s.  ‚Äî MIKE ALLEN

Even Ferrari muÔ¨Ü lower fuel

620-hp, 206-mph prototype 
sports car with a hybrid 
syÔ¨Üem that booÔ¨Üs in-town 
fuel mileage by nearly 50 
percent. Ferrari‚Äôs solution is 
clever: e 100-hp eleric 
motor bolts to the rear of the 
dual-clutch seven-speed 
transmission, and the li-ion 
battery pack hides under the 
Ô¨Çoor. e syÔ¨Üem adds 176

Diesel Does It
Fuel economy was Ford‚Äôs top concern when 
designing the 2011 Ford F-Series Super Duty‚Äôs new 
Power Stroke diesel, which gets 390 hp, 735 lb- 
of torque‚Äîand 24.5 mpg, according to the onboard 
computer. (Ford engineers claim between 23.5 and 
26 mpg in teÔ¨Üing.) Despite its bigger size, a new 
6.2-liter V8 (385 hp and 405 lb- of torque) 
combines with a new six-speed automatic to get 
15 percent better fuel economy than the old 
5.4-liter engine. e diesel Super Duty can tow up 
to 24,400 pounds with a Ô¨Åh-wheel trailer that 
connes to the bed above the rear axle‚Äîthe Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü 
faory-inÔ¨Üalled Ô¨Åh-wheel and gooseneck 
subÔ¨Üruure attached direly to a frame. More-
over, the truck now has Hill Descent control, which 
allows you to set a speed and let the computer 
handle Ô¨Üeep grades with minimal Ô¨Üress. Rolling 
downhill with a 10,000-pound trailer and letting the 
syÔ¨Üem do its work feels like a truÔ¨Ü fall, but on a 
3-mile descent, I become a believer. e base XL is 
$28,020, while the King Ranch version coÔ¨Üs more 
than 60 grand.  ‚Äî DAVID KILEY

Honda Insight EX Navi
If the goal of a hybrid car is economical driving, shouldn‚Äôt a hybrid be, you know, 
cheap? at‚Äôs the logic behind Honda‚Äôs Insight, which clearly targets the Toyota Prius 
buyer, but at a price about $2000 lower. Now we can say that the Insight largely 
delivers on its promise, easily hitting‚Äîand oen beating‚Äîits EPA Ô¨Ågures over almoÔ¨Ü 
7000 reliable miles. But there are compromises needed to build a hybrid at this price: 
e Insight lacks the Prius‚Äôs high-tech Ô¨Çash; it looks and feels more like a low-coÔ¨Ü 
compa. Even with the 13-hp eleric booÔ¨Ü, the little 1.3-liter Ô¨Ürains to generate 
much oomph. And we miss the geeky fun of nursing top mileage out of a more 
sophiÔ¨Üicated hybrid syÔ¨Üem. Unlike the Prius, the Insight‚Äôs pure-eleric mode rarely 
engages, so you don‚Äôt get the thrill of silently gliding paÔ¨Ü gas Ô¨Üations. Still, the 
Insight shows juÔ¨Ü how praical an everyday hybrid can be.  ‚Äî JIM MEIGS

feet, 6675 tons of air-conditioning 
hardware labor to dissipate Dawn‚Äôs 
body heat, blowing 2.7 million cubic 
feet of chilled air through the room 
every minute.
For a few days in 2009 Dawn 
brought its number-crunching mus-
cle to bear on the largest brain simu-
lation to date‚Äîa cell-by-cell model of 
the human visual cortex: 1.6 billion 
virtual neurons connected by 9 tril-
lion synapses. This mathematical 
simulation of a cerebral cortex as 
large as a cat‚Äôs blew away the previ-
ous record‚Äî55 million neurons, the 
size of a rat‚Äôs‚Äîachieved by the same 
team two years before.
‚ÄúThis is a Hubble Telescope of 
the mind, a linear accelerator of the 
brain,‚Äù says Dharmendra Modha, 
the project‚Äôs lead researcher and a 
computer scientist from IBM‚Äôs 
Almaden Research 
Center in San Jose, 
Calif. The simulation, 
assembled 
using 
neuroscience data 
from rats, cats, mon-
keys and humans, will 
provide a tool for test-
ing theories about how the brain 
works, and the insights gained could 
pave the way to designing robots and 
computers that are truly intelligent.
In his ofÔ¨Åce at Almaden, Modha 
Ô¨Çashes an image on his computer. 
‚ÄúThis is an MRI of my brain,‚Äù he says. 
Red and blue threads show the twist-
ing routes of thousands of nerve-
axon bundles that connect different 
parts of his cerebral cortex.
The cortex, the wrinkly outer layer 
of the brain, performs most of the 
higher functions that make humans 
human, from recognizing faces and 
speech to choreographing the doz-
ens of muscle contractions involved

in a perfect tennis serve. It does this 
using a universal neural circuit called 
a microcolumn, repeated over and 
over. Modha hopes the simulation 
will help scientists understand how 
the cortical microcolumn performs 
such a wide range of tasks. 
But deciphering the 
microcolumn can also help 
build better computers. By 
reverse engineering the 
cortical structure, Modha 
says, researchers could give 
machines the ability to 
interpret biological senses 
such as sight, hearing and 
touch. And artificial 
machine brains could pro-
cess, intelligently, senses 
that don‚Äôt currently exist in 
the natural world, such as 
radar and laser rangeÔ¨Ånding. Modha 
envisions some day peppering the 
planet with sensors‚Äîtransforming it 
into a virtual organism with the capac-
ity to understand its own patterns of 
weather, climate and ocean currents.
The simulation currently lacks the 
neural patterning that develops as 
real brains mature‚Äîcomplexity that 
comes from stumbling around in a 
body, in which every action has conse-
quences. As Anil Seth, a neuroscien-
tist at the University of Sussex in Eng-
land, puts it: ‚ÄúThe brain wires itself.‚Äù 
Seth and his colleagues demon-
strated this principle, called embod-
ied learning, while at the Neurosci-
ences Institute in San Diego, using a 
brain simulation called Darwin X. 
They embodied Darwin‚Äôs 90,000 vir-
tual neurons (roughly the brain of a 
pond snail) in a wheeled robot. As 
Darwin wandered around, its virtual 
neurons rewired their connections to 
produce the equivalent of hippocam-
pal place cells, which help mammals 
navigate. Scientists don‚Äôt know how 
to program such cells; with embodied 
learning they emerge on their own.
Paul Maglio, a cognitive scientist at 
Almaden, has similar plans for Mod-
ha‚Äôs cortical simulation. He‚Äôs building 
a virtual world for it to inhabit using 
software from the video shootout 
game Unreal Tournament and topo-
graphic maps, aerial photos and rover-
level imagery from Mars. As the simu-
lation moves around this virtual 
landscape in a rudimentary rover, pro-
grammed to avoid hazards that lead to 
injury, it will gradually learn the basics 
of eye‚Äìwheel coordination‚Äîjust like a 
baby learning to walk.
Super-Supercomputer
The National Nuclear Secu-
rity Administration (NNSA), 
within the Department of 
Energy, installed Dawn at 
Lawrence Livermore‚Äôs 
Terascale Simulation Facil-
ity in 2009. After Modha‚Äôs 
team ran its brain simulation, the 
supercomputer was transitioned to 
NNSA work, conducting massive sim-
ulations to ensure the readiness of 
the nation‚Äôs nuclear weapons arsenal. 
Modha‚Äôs neurons are far simpler than 
real ones, and yet for all its comput-
ing power, Dawn ran the 1.6 billion 
neurons at only one six-hundred-
forty-third the speed of a living brain. 
A second simulation, with 900 million 
neurons, ran a little faster‚Äîbut still 
at one eighty-third the speed.
These massive simulations are 
merely steps toward Modha‚Äôs ultimate 
goal: simulating the entire human 
cortex, about 25 billion neurons, at 
full speed. To do that, he‚Äôll need 1000 
times more computing power. At the 
rate that supercomputers have 
expanded over the past 20 years, that 
super-supercomputer could exist by 
2019. ‚ÄúThis is not just possible,‚Äù 
Modha says, ‚Äúit‚Äôs inevitable.‚Äù
But it won‚Äôt be easy. ‚ÄúBusiness as 
usual won‚Äôt get us there,‚Äù says Michael 
McCoy, head of advanced simulation 
and computing at LLNL. Develop-
ment of supercomputers in recent 
decades has ridden the wave of 
Moore‚Äôs law: Transistors have shrunk 
and the computing power of proces-
sor chips has doubled every 18 
months. But that ride is coming to an 
end. Transistors are now packed so 
densely on chips that the 
heat they generate can no 
longer be dissipated. To 
reduce heat, Dawn uses 
larger 180-nanometer tran-
sistors that were developed 
10 years ago‚Äîrather than 
the 45-nanometer transis-
tors used in desktop com-
puters today. And for the 
same reason, Dawn runs 
these transistors at a slug-
gish 850 megahertz‚Äîone-
third the speed of today‚Äôs 
desktop computers. 
The supercomputer 
that Modha needs to simu-
late a whole cortex would 
also consume prohibitive 
amounts of power. ‚ÄúIf you 
scale up current technol-
ogy, this system might 
require between 100 mega-
watts and a gigawatt of power,‚Äù says 
Horst Simon, a project collaborator at 
nearby Lawrence Berkeley National 
Laboratory. One gigawatt (1 billion 
watts) is the amount of power that the 
mad scientist Emmett ‚ÄúDoc‚Äù Brown 
needed to operate his DeLorean time 
machine in the 1985 movie Back to the 
Future. Simon puts it more bluntly: ‚ÄúIt 
would be a nuclear power plant,‚Äù he 
says. The electricity alone would cost 
$1 billion per year.
The human brain, by comparison, 
functions on just 20 watts. Although 
supercomputer simulations are 
power hungry, Modha hopes the 
insights they provide will eventually 
pave the way to more elegant technol-
ogy. With DARPA funding, he‚Äôs work-
ing with a far-Ô¨Çung team at Ô¨Åve uni-
versities and four IBM labs to create a 
new computer chip that can mimic 
the cortex using far less power than a 
computer. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have it ready for you 
within the next decade,‚Äù he says.

What‚Äôs the point in driving a high-powered machine when a 
Prius can easily surpass the highest speed limit in the land? 
The annoying thing is, the maudlin pragmatists who look 
at a Porsche 911 GT2 and say, ‚ÄúWell, that guy‚Äôs just going to 
get a lot of speeding tickets‚Äù are mostly right. In terms of 
performance, our cars have outgrown our roads.
You can go to a dragstrip and get a good run through the 
lower gears; you can go to a road course to exploit the limits of 
 Two overpowered muscle cars face an arrow-straight course that

a car‚Äôs chassis and brakes. But top speed is a different matter. 
Even a four-cylinder Mazdaspeed3 breaks 150 mph. Cue the 
chorus of downer realists: So where are you gonna do that?
Bonneville, that‚Äôs where. 
 home of every land-
speed record worth having, is a destination that all gearheads 
need to visit at least once. I‚Äôve never been there. But as luck 
would have it, PM auto editor Larry Webster has wrangled a 
permit for the salt on a rare day when nobody else has it 
booked. All I need is a car.
Or better yet, two cars. I arrive in Ann Arbor, Mich., to 
meet the screaming-red weapons with which I‚Äôll assault the 
salt. For this mission, we selected two of America‚Äôs feistier 
machines, the Chevrolet Camaro SS and the Ford Mustang 
Shelby GT500. With 426 hp under the hood of the Camaro 
and a full 540 horses propelling the Stang, these are deÔ¨Å-
nitely two cars that should put on a good show on the salt. 
There‚Äôs only one problem: The Mustang and the Camaro 
have 155-mph electronic speed limit-
ers. And running into a 155-mph speed 
limiter on the Bonneville Salt Flats 
would be like going to an all-you-can-
eat buffet and leaving only pleasantly 
full. If we‚Äôre going to drive 1700 miles 
to go Ô¨Çat-out in Utah, we want to fully 
answer the question, what‚Äôll she do?
Hence, a few days earlier, Webster 
brought the cars to Lingenfelter Per-
formance Engineering in Decatur, Ind. 
Lingenfelter, in addition to its more 
involved performance packages, sells 
portable engine-computer reprogram-
mers. Plug them into the Mustang and 
Camaro OBD (onboard diagnostics) 
ports, and a few seconds later the cars 
forget they ever had a speed limiter. 
Suitably modiÔ¨Åed, we depart Ann 
Arbor. I‚Äôve recruited my friend Murph, 
who is happy to drive muscle cars to 
the Salt Flats. I‚Äôm behind the wheel of 
the Mustang, Murph‚Äôs in the Camaro. 
We‚Äôve got multiple bags of beef jerky, 
walkie-talkies and three days to get to 
Bonneville. 
It‚Äôs quickly evident that getting to 
Bonneville while resisting Bonneville-
esque velocities will test our restraint. 
Our path takes us through Iowa, 
Nebraska and Wyoming, states that 
offer a lot of room to run. We‚Äôre barely 
out of Michigan when a Subaru STI 
comes charging up on the GT500‚Äôs 
bumper. While there are scenarios where an STI will trump a 
GT500‚Äîa wet autocross track, a winter rally stage‚ÄîI can say 
that straight-line third-gear acceleration is not one of them. 
Subaru dispatched, I slow to the speed limit and hope that 
nobody with a badge witnessed my little moment of weak-
ness. Save it for the Salt Flats. 
Early in the trip, we trade cars, and I soon bond with the 
Camaro, while Murph is happy to stick with the Mustang. 
You don‚Äôt learn much about cars like this on the highway, 
but we do agree that the Camaro is more comfortable, thanks 
to its softer suspension. On one choppy section of highway, 
Murph radios, ‚ÄúThese expansion joints are giving me a nice 
kidney massage.‚Äù In the Camaro, I‚Äôm comfortably numb.
As we make our way west, we meet curious bystanders 
wherever we stop. Everyone wants to know where we‚Äôre going 
with these two red muscle cars. A guy named Andrew, on tour 
with a band called the Fall of Troy, gives us CDs. An entrepre-
neurial trucker hands us bottles of American Shine car-wash 
concentrate. And a gentleman in Wyoming gives me a little

miles I have spent behind the wheel of a Camaro without one 
speeding ticket. I was overdue. Also, I could say that my ticket 
amounts to one dollar for each mile per hour I was traveling 
shortly before he bagged me. (In Wyoming? Possibly.) So it‚Äôs 
kind of a bargain when you look at it that way. And hey‚Äî
a speeding ticket en route to a place with no speed limit? 
Thank you for the delicious irony, Wyoming Highway Patrol.
As we make our way into Utah, a new problem is brewing. 
We‚Äôre not planning to hit the salt until tomorrow, but 
Mother Nature has other ideas. When 
we pull over for a break, Murph is 
frowning at his iPhone. ‚ÄúThe forecast 
is calling for rain tomorrow,‚Äù he says. 
‚ÄúMaybe even snow.‚Äù 
This is unacceptable news. I‚Äôm not 
driving 1700 miles to Ô¨Ånd out that Wal-
ley World is closed. So we have two 
options: Gamble that the forecast is 
wrong, or try to get there before dark 
and hope that nobody else is using the 
salt. I‚Äôm a pretty terrible gambler, so 
we decide to make a push for the Ô¨Çats.
Or, more 
accurately, swallows up the highway. 
While the land-speed area is north of 
the interstate, the sprawling bright 
emptiness of the salt is everywhere. 
Just before the Nevada state line, we 
exit I-80 and take a desiccated two-
lane toward the edge of the salt. Some-
where out there are the faded pair of 
parallel stripes that demarcate the race course. 
It seems unbelievable that this place exists in modern 
America. I expected a gatehouse, a fence, someone to come 
out and frown at the cars and tell us that our tires‚Äô valve 
stems are out of compliance and that we‚Äôd need to come 
keepsake‚Äîa $140 speeding ticket.
This happens on the third day, when I pull off an exit for a 
rest stop soon after leaving our hotel in Laramie. As I wait for 
Murph at the bottom of the exit, a state trooper drives down 
the ramp and turns on his lights. He approaches the window, 
tells me I was doing 90 mph in a 75-mph zone and asks for 
my license. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù he says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get you out of here in 
a minute.‚Äù I sit in the car and ponder how I was speeding and 
stopping at the same time.
The trooper doesn‚Äôt ask why a Mus-
tang GT500 and a Camaro SS from 
Michigan are convoying through his 
fair state. All he cares about is writing 
the ticket as fast as possible and get-
ting back up to his position, where 
5 minutes later he pulls over a fresh 
victim. On one hand, I‚Äôm angry that I 
didn‚Äôt see him. On the other, maybe 
this is cosmic penance for the 30,000 
 Left: The Mustang 
and Camaro sport 
blocky-looking body-
work, but going full-
throttle on the Salt 
Flats proves they‚Äôre 
aerodynamically 
stable, even at 170 
mph and beyond.

back with proper paperwork. 
But there is no gate, no fence, no 
tech inspection. We have the permit, 
Ô¨Åled through the Bureau of Land Man-
agement, but there‚Äôs nobody here to 
see it. In fact, the only other humans 
in this alien landscape are a distant 
fashion model and a photographer. 
The model is wearing a wedding gown. 
I pick up the walkie-talkie and caution 
Murph, ‚ÄúOnce we get past 170, we‚Äôre 
gonna have to keep our distance from 
the bride.‚Äù Personally, I like to main-
tain at least a mile of separation from 
matrimonial fashion shoots during 
instrumented top-speed testing. 
We‚Äôre in a race against the encroach-
ing rain clouds and the fading daylight, 
so we head directly to the course. The 
race groove reaches out over the hori-
zon, smoother than the surrounding 
salt, as if the countless passes by land-
bound rockets have ironed its creases. I 
still feel like we‚Äôre about to do some-
thing wrong, so we set up our base 
camp deep out on the salt. Nobody driv-
ing past on the highway will happen to 
see us, because we‚Äôre hiding‚Äîbehind 
the curvature of the Earth.
With the Mustang parked, I plug in 
our GPS-based VBOX data logger, put 
on my helmet and race suit and head 
out in the Camaro to get a feel for the 
course. The salt offers more traction 
than I had expected. I stop and drop 
the clutch, and the Camaro lays black 
stripes before hooking up and getting 
on its way. Bend the car into a wide 
turn, and the tires squeal. I‚Äôve heard 
the salt be compared to a wet road, 
but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more like worn asphalt 
when the oil is weathered away‚Äîgran-
ular but grippy, the world‚Äôs loneliest 
parking lot.
Heading down toward the far end 
of the course, I push the Camaro to 
about 140 mph and Ô¨Ånd it completely 
stable. I make a U-turn and decide to 
give it the business. If it‚Äôs okay at 140, I 
reason, it‚Äôll be okay at 170, or whatever 
velocity I attain once I push into the

Gene and Alan

Bonneville-speak, it‚Äôs 
known as a roadster, 
which is anything that 
resembles a classic 
hot rod. 
If salt conditions 
permit, the Southern 
California Timing 
Association sets 
up three separate 
courses. The long 
course is for cars 
and motorcycles 
that can go faster 
than 175 mph. It 
shares a starting 
area with the 5-mile 
short course, so 
that‚Äôs a good place 
to hang around and 
spectate. Plus an 
announcer calls 
out the speeds as 
the cars Ô¨Çy down 
the track. The third 
course, another 
5-miler, is usually 
reserved for prac-
tice runs and slower, 
small-displacement 
motorcycles and 
interesting vintage 
iron. Don‚Äôt miss the 
tech area near the 
pits. That‚Äôs where 
inspectors pore over 
the cars, allowing 
unfettered views 
beneath a car‚Äôs 
bodywork. 
Long before the Ô¨Årst Speed Week 
competition‚Äîheld in 1949‚Äîhot 
rodders used the Bonneville Salt 
Flats to put it all on the line and 
see just how fast they could go. 
Now the annual event is a 
speed-merchant pilgrimage with 
over 500 competitors ranging 
from backyard tinkerers to 
sponsored professional efforts. 
Car and motorcycle racers vie 
for record top speeds in 
hundreds of classes based on 
engine size, type of fuel and 
vehicle layout. This year, the 
pedal-to-the-metal-fest kicks off 
on Aug. 14. Get there early 
since many drivers simply leave 
after they‚Äôve broken a record‚Äî
or their car. Don‚Äôt forget the 
sunblock. Here‚Äôs a small sample 
of the machinery.

All land-speed racers Ô¨Åght one main adversary: aerodynamic drag. 
The devil thing about drag is that the power necessary to overcome it 
increases exponentially based on vehicle speed. So a car that requires 
only 10 hp to go 50 mph needs 80 hp to reach 100. Bonneville  
competitors‚Äîeither by design or intuition‚Äîwork both sides of the for-
mula that calculates the power required to overcome aerodynamic drag.
Given a car‚Äôs power and aerodynamic data, this equation can be 
manipulated to spit out a pretty good approximation of top speed. 
More horsepower equals greater terminal velocity, of course, but 
reducing the car‚Äôs frontal area and drag coefÔ¨Åcient (Cd) are just as 
critical. Since frontal area is simply the product of the car‚Äôs width and 
height (minus about 15 percent for the area under the car), it‚Äôs fairly 
straightforward to reduce that Ô¨Ågure. But accurately measuring Cd 
requires a tool most racers lack‚Äîa wind tunnel. So competitors rely 
on the eye method‚Äîif it looks aerodynamic, it probably is‚Äîwith vary-
ing degrees of success and hope that their body modiÔ¨Åcations don‚Äôt 
induce high-speed instability. Land-speed racing is an engineering 
challenge, which is, naturally, half the fun.      
 This speed- versus-distance graph of the Mustang 
and the Camaro on the salt illustrates why a place like 
Bonneville is needed to reach terminal velocity. The cars 
require roughly 3 miles to attain the last 30 mph.

 Before the cars 
left for Bonneville‚Äôs 
salt, we tested 
them under typical 
conditions at 
Chrysler‚Äôs Chelsea 
Proving Grounds 
in Michigan. This 
acceleration graph 
shows how they 
performed. The 
Mustang GT500 
outsprinted the 
Camaro, of course, 
since the pricier 
ponycar has over 
100 more horse-
power and weighs 
about the same.

small bumps in the salt trigger subtle traction-control 
interventions up to about 100 mph. Fortunately, once you 
break into the really high speeds, the Mustang is just as 
glued down as the Camaro. 
The GT500 is unique in that its speedometer is actually 
calibrated to a number commensurate with the car‚Äôs abili-
ties. A stock GT500 is limited to 155 mph, so it makes sense 
that the car‚Äôs speedometer reads only to 160. Given that 
every hot-rod hatchback now has a speedometer that reads 
to Mach 10, the delimited Mustang offers a rare opportun-
ity: the chance to pin the needle. Which it does, with 
extreme prejudice. At 160 mph, this thing still has a long 
way to go. In fact, at the 15,000-foot mark, where the 
 Camaro was touching 170 mph, the Mustang is already at 
180. And still pulling.
While the Camaro ran into a wall of aero drag at 174.4 
mph, the GT500 bumps up against its redline, super-
charger screaming, at 184.7 mph. The late Ford GT, with 
sleeker bodywork but only 10 more horsepower, is good 
for 200 mph, so it seems logical that the Mustang has a few 
more miles per hour to unlock. Given longer gearing, I‚Äôll 
bet this thing could hit 190. Still, I‚Äôm impressed: If you had 
this car on the autobahn, you could pull up behind a 
Porsche 911 (top speed: 180 mph) and Ô¨Çash your head-
lights in the international signal for ‚Äúget out of my way, 
slower car.‚Äù That‚Äôs a rapid Ford.
 over the mountains, I sneak in a few more 
runs. It‚Äôs not every day that you‚Äôre alone on the Bonneville 
Salt Flats with nearly 1000 hp at your disposal, and I intend 
to make the most of it. 
I don‚Äôt better my initial speeds, but my continued Salt 
Flats research does produce additional valuable informa-
tion. For example, did you know that the Camaro SS lets 
you set the cruise control at 159 mph? It‚Äôs true. Although, 
when I set the cruise at 159 mph, the VBOX says I‚Äôm  actually 
doing 165 mph. Besides that discrepancy, I Ô¨Ånd that the car 
lurches in an unsettling manner when you cancel the cruise 
control. Typical rough-around-the-edges Camaro, I sup-
pose, stepping on its own feet every time you want to cancel 
the cruise control at 165 mph.
The fact that a Camaro is even capable of such a thing 
is properly amazing. And the Mus-
tang, while expensive relative to the 
Chevy, is a bargain compared to the 
six-Ô¨Ågure purebreds it can outrun. It 
seems unfeasible, on the face of it: 
You can take two attainable Ameri-
can muscle cars, drive them 1700 
miles, run more than 170 mph on the 
Bonneville Salt Flats, then get back 
on the highway and drive to Los 
Angeles in reasonable comfort and 
without any mechanical complaint. 
The Camaro even managed 22 mpg 
on the highway. The Mustang? Well, 
you can lead a horse to a gas pump, 
but you can‚Äôt make it drink less than 
a gallon every 19 miles.
Our modern automotive lives are 
deÔ¨Åned by their restrictions, the lure 
of speed always tempered by the real-
ity of trafÔ¨Åc jams and insurance pre-
miums and points on our licenses. 
Even our muscle cars have speed lim-
iters. That‚Äôs why the Bonneville Salt 
Flats are so glorious. Because no mat-
ter how beat-down you get by the 
entrenched web of radar guns and 
speed bumps, you can still get a fast 
car and go to Bonneville. You can put 
on a helmet. And you can crack a V8 
throttle wide open and hold it there, 
reveling in the continued existence of 
a place where the only limits are 
horsepower and the horizon.

THE MAN IN THE BLACK
BY 
JAMES 
VLAHOS

JUNE 2010  
PAGE 81
Up in the sky: a black dot, like a speck of pep-
per on a white tablecloth, hurtling through the 
air. I was plummeting at more than 100 mph 
myself, the jet roar of wind blasting by, but the 
speck was closing in on me like a missile. I 
yanked the ripcord of my parachute and then 
watched as the object became a human body 
with wings. The body had a man‚Äôs face, and as 
he streaked by, not even 10 yards away, I could 
practically see the tonsils inside his screaming 
mouth: Yeeeeaaaaaahhh! The tawny grass-
lands of southern California rushed upward to 
pancake him. Then, and only seconds before 
impact, did his canopy blossom above him. 
On the ground, dozens of parachutists 
were milling about the hangars of the Perris

Valley Skydiving Center. The birdman, renowned BASE jumper Jeb Corliss, was easy 
to spot: Tall, with a shaved head, he was dressed like a Ô¨Çying squirrel. A heartfelt 
‚ÄúDude!‚Äù was all I could initially manage. My tandem jump partner, Jim Wallace‚Äîa 
world-record-holding sky diver himself‚Äîwas only slightly more composed. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt 
believe how much control you had,‚Äù he said. Corliss just shrugged. ‚ÄúI told you I was 
going to Ô¨Çy close,‚Äù he said.
Among BASE jumpers‚Äîpeople who leap from buildings, antennas, spans and 
earth‚ÄîCorliss is both the reigning superhero and the leading villain. Superhero 
because he has logged more than 1000 jumps on Ô¨Åve continents, launching from the 
Matterhorn and the Golden Gate Bridge and dropping 2000 feet into a sinkhole cave 
in  China. And villain because Corliss, the former host of the television show Stunt 
Junkies, unfailingly attracts attention‚Äîmost notoriously in 2006 when he was 
arrested for trying to leap from the Empire State Building. In a sport whose practitio-
ners prefer to keep a low proÔ¨Åle because the safety of what they do is always under 
Ô¨Åre, attracting the media spotlight is an unpardonable sin.
Corliss says attention is unavoidable for someone whose ‚Äúwhole purpose in this 
world is to do what people think can‚Äôt be done.‚Äù More accurately: things that people 
think shouldn‚Äôt be done because they are absurd and dangerous. ‚ÄúThe average person 
looks at sky divers like they‚Äôre crazy,‚Äù Corliss says. ‚ÄúThe average sky diver looks at BASE 
jumpers like they‚Äôre crazy. And the average BASE jumper looks at me like I‚Äôm crazy.‚Äù
Which brings us to the morning Ô¨Çyby, and Corliss‚Äôs vision for his most audacious 
feat ever. The Ô¨Çying squirrel get-up was a wingsuit, a wearable plane whose wings are 
nylon panels fanning out below the arms and between the legs. The pilot, rather than 
simply plummeting, can steer and achieve a glide ratio of up to 3 feet forward for every 
1 foot down. Wingsuits are used by a tiny 
but growing cadre of pilots worldwide; 
to land, they always deploy a parachute.
Corliss‚Äôs immodest proposal: Skip 
the parachute. Cut the umbilical and 
achieve one of mankind‚Äôs most ancient 
and enticing dreams‚Äîunpowered 
human Ô¨Çight, no external contraption 
required.
He calls it the Wingsuit Landing Proj-
ect. Fly, land and live to tell the tale. 
Doing so will require a vertically inclined 
landing strip‚Äîpicture how Olympic ski 
jumpers touch down on mountain-
sides‚Äîand to build it, he has consulted 
with an engineering Ô¨Årm that does work 
for NASA. The budget is $3 million, which 
Corliss hopes to raise from corporations 
willing to sponsor the feat. Or the Ô¨Åasco. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be landing at 100 mph on 
my face,‚Äù Corliss says. It‚Äôs truly terrifying, 
but that‚Äôs just how he likes it. ‚ÄúSome peo-
ple are gifted singers, dancers, whatever. 
My gift is fear.‚Äù
Jeb Corliss (piured here Ô¨Çying near Mount Fuji in Japan) is planning to land, sans para-
chute, on a specially designed ramp‚Äîat 100 mph. ‚Äúe average person looks at sky divers 
like they‚Äôre crazy,‚Äù Corliss says. ‚Äúe average sky diver looks at BASE jumpers like they‚Äôre 
crazy. And the average BASE jumper looks at me like I‚Äôm crazy.‚Äù

People have 
traversed the 
channel by boat, 
plane, Chunnel and 
backstroke, but 
Yves Rossy chose a 
less obvious 
method: jet pack. 
Rossy jumped from 
a plane over the 
coast of France and

8-foot-long 
carbon-Ô¨Åber wing 
strapped to his

Sept. 5, 2009
Dangling from a 
parachute with a 
202-cc engine and a 
carbon-Ô¨Åber 
propeller on his 
back, Ben Jordan 
glided more than 
6000 miles across 
Canada at 25 to 30 
mph, stopping every 
few hours to refuel. 
On his 114-day 
journey from the 
PaciÔ¨Åc Coast to 
Newfoundland, he 
traveled over vast 
expanses of uninhab-
ited land that most 
paragliders wouldn‚Äôt 
attempt to cross. 
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason no 
one has ever done 
this,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúYou

2  Highest Building 
BASE Jump  
Jan. 6, 2010      
Though Omar 
Alhegelan has 
sky-dived more than 
16,000 times and 
BASE-jumped from 
places like 
Malaysia‚Äôs Petronas 
Towers, fear still 
courses through him 
before every 
jump‚Äîand Burj 
Khalifa, the world‚Äôs 
tallest building, was 
no exception. As he 
stood on the 
precipice, 2200 feet 
above the ground, ‚ÄúI 
felt a little shake in 
my knees,‚Äù he says. 
‚ÄúBut I welcome that 
fear.‚Äù To those 
watching, 
Alhegelan‚Äôs fear was 
unapparent: He 
gracefully 
backÔ¨Çipped off the 
tower, plummeted 
for 10 seconds  
and deployed his 
chute, gently Ô¨Çoating 
to the ground.
little prayer,‚Äù he 
says. ‚ÄúThen I 
jumped.‚Äù He 
plummeted at 614 
mph, Ô¨Åve times the 
speed of a sky diver. 
He set records for 
the highest sky dive 
(102,800 feet) and 
the longest free fall 
(4 minutes  
36 seconds).
5  Longest  
Hang Glide  
June 19, 2002     
To Ô¨Çy his hang glider 
438 miles over 
Texas, Mike Barber 
needed skill, 
endurance‚Äîand 
good weather. 
‚ÄúThermal paragliders 
are solar-powered,‚Äù 
he says. ‚ÄúThe sun 
heats the ground, 
which creates 
thermals.‚Äù Barber 
used the warm 
pockets of air so 
effectively that once 
he was able to stay 
aloft for 11 hours 
without stopping.

month before our near midair collision, 
the door to a two-story townhouse just 
a few blocks from the ocean in Venice 
Beach, Calif., opened to reveal a Ô¨Ågure 
clad in head-to-toe black. Corliss led 
me into a darkened living room and 
seated me on one of two black couches. 
Plates decorated with skulls sat on a 
nearby counter. In the corner stood a 
tall crystal  statue of Icarus, the Ô¨Çying 
legend who fatally plummeted. Inspira-
tion? Warning?
Corliss has been a fear junkie virtu-
ally since birth. Gigi Corliss, Jeb‚Äôs 
mother, says that when her son was ‚Äústill 
wearing a diaper and sucking his 
thumb‚Äù he used to point up at the high 
dive at a local pool. She let a swim 
instructor take Jeb up to the top on the 
theory that the toddler would become 
scared, want to come down and stop 
begging to go up. Instead, Gigi says, Jeb 
‚Äúwiggled out of his arms, squealed, 
‚ÄòWee, wee, wee!‚Äô all the way down, doggy-
 paddled back to the side of the pool and 
said, ‚ÄòAgain.‚Äô‚Äù
Aquatic frolics notwithstanding, Cor-
liss was a miserable child. His parents 
were art dealers, and the family spent 
much of each year scouring countries 
such as India and Afghanistan for works 
to buy. When they weren‚Äôt overseas, they 
lived in New Mexico, where Corliss 
attended six different elementary 
schools. Always the new kid, ostracized 
and bullied, he discovered that to har-
ness fear‚Äîyour own, that of others‚Äîwas 
to gain power. He brought taran tulas, 
scorpions and rattlesnakes home as 
pets. He started battling the bullies so 
savagely that some of them wound up in 
the hospital. His depression worsened.
BASE jumping would seem an 
unlikely savior, but it gave Corliss pur-
pose and happiness. He discovered the

$100 in front of the pilot, whose eyes 
grew large. Corliss opened the plane 
door, shouted ‚ÄúSee ya!‚Äù and he and Fran-
√ßois jumped out.
They had sneaked their BASE rigs 
aboard. After landing near the falls, they 
repacked their chutes and successfully 
took the plunge off the top of the 3200-
foot cataract. Then they spent the next 
two days blundering through the rain 
forest. They had no food. It rained tor-
rentially, and the pair took shelter in 
caves with gooey, multicolored insects 
until they reached civilization. 
You would think that kind of misad-
venture would cause Corliss to rethink 
his career choice. But he never has. 
‚ÄúBASE jumping for me was kind of like 
an exorcism,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt was horrifying, 
but I had to go through it to come out on 
the other side a happy person.‚Äù
This begins to make sense if you dis-
Not to scale
sport in his early 20s, and when he had logged 
only six relatively easy leaps, Corliss got the idea 
to try an advanced one from a 300-foot antenna. 
BASE jumping is perilous because the margin of error is slim. Open the chute a half-
second too late‚Äîsplat, you‚Äôre dead. Open it with your body off-angle, and you might 
careen into the object you‚Äôve just jumped from‚Äîsplat. When Corliss told his BASE 
mentors about the antenna, they told him he wasn‚Äôt ready. His mom begged him not 
to try. His friends said they didn‚Äôt want to watch him commit suicide. So Corliss 
climbed to the top of the antenna by himself. At night. Standing there in the moon-
light he even told himself, ‚ÄúI am not going to do this.‚Äù And then he jumped.
The chute opened horrifyingly late. He smacked the ground, hard. But he realized 
he was still alive. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm lying on the ground, my entire body is shaking, every hair is 
standing on end,‚Äù Corliss recalls. ‚ÄúI can feel the air touching my skin, hear insects 
crawling in the grass.‚Äù Bruised but otherwise unhurt, Corliss felt born again and had 
the template for his career: Confront fear, ignore all doubters, and do exactly what you 
want to do. 
As you might expect, this uncompromising approach has resulted in both triumph 
and disaster. Typical Corliss tale: Not long after the antenna escapade, Corliss and a 
French BASE jumper named Fran√ßois were eating dinner in Italy and got the idea to 
jump off Angel Falls. They paid the check, drove to Paris and boarded a plane to Ven-
ezuela. Less than 36 hours later they were squeezed into a Cessna on a Ô¨Çight-seeing 
trip over the famous cascade. Corliss reached forward into the cockpit and waved

Anyone can Ô¨Çy like a bird and land without a para-
chute‚Äîonce. But Jeb Corliss has no desire to become 
a human pancake. ‚ÄúA wingsuit landing is only success-
ful if you can do it 10 times out of 10 without being 
injured,‚Äù Corliss says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm talking no broken toes, no 
broken anything.‚Äù Corliss is guarded about his plan‚Äî
he doesn‚Äôt want rivals to steal his ideas‚Äîbut he has let 
some details slip. Here‚Äôs an educated guess at how he 
might pull off the stunt.

chology, it is a coping mechanism from his chaotic childhood. Say what you want 
about the sanity of Corliss‚Äôs pursuits, they do offer the ultimate form of control‚Äîthat 
over one‚Äôs own life or death. Or at least the illusion.
recision flying is the key to the Wingsuit Landing 
Project. Mont Hubbard, a professor of mechanical and 
aeronautical engineering at the University of Califor-
nia‚ÄìDavis, confirms that if Corliss‚Äôs flight angle 
matches that of the landing slope, and friction is kept 
to a minimum, the impact force on touchdown will be 
almost nil. If he is 6 degrees off‚Äîhitting the 45-degree 
ramp at 51 degrees‚Äîthe force on his body would be the 
same as if he were dropped from 3 feet in the air onto 
Ô¨Çat ground. So far so good. But the math quickly starts 
to work against Corliss, and misalignments of 11, 16 
and 23 degrees result in equivalent fall heights of 
roughly 13, 30 and 50 feet. 
People have survived far worse, plummeting chute-
less from planes in emergencies and living to tell the 
tale. In 2007 window washer Alcides Moreno plunged 
card the conventional wisdom that all 
practitioners of extreme sports must 
have sensation-seeking personality dis-
orders‚Äîthat they‚Äôre addicted to the Ô¨Çood 
of pleasure-inducing hormones and neu-
rochemicals released by death-cheating 
stunts. Corliss claims that the terror 
before a jump and the elation afterward 
were appealing only early in his career 
and are now his least favorite part. He 
doesn‚Äôt like intoxication, abhors drugs 
and alcohol. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very control-based,‚Äù 
Corliss says. ‚ÄúAnd with those things you 
lose control and become a slave.‚Äù
Corliss, it seems, is less of an adrena-
line junkie than he is a control freak. 
Precision is the essence of his work. To 
succeed he must be obsessive about 
every minute detail‚Äîchute packing, 
weather conditions, body position‚Äîand 
Corliss relishes meticulous planning. 
Perhaps, and this is just armchair psy-

A construction team 
builds Corliss‚Äôs $3 
million, 2000-foot-
long landing ramp, 
which is temporarily 
attached to the side 
of a still-to-be-
 determined Las 
Vegas structure. The 
ramp may be made 
of tensile fabric like 
the roof of the 
Denver International 
Airport; cables 
anchor the ramp  
and keep its  
surface taut.  
 
Corliss jumps from a 
helicopter several 
thousand feet over 
the Las Vegas Strip. 
His customized 
wingsuit has 
lightweight, ripstop 
nylon panels from the 
undersides of his 
arms to his torso and 
between his legs. Air 
inlets on the wing‚Äôs 
leading edge allow it 
to inÔ¨Çate and stay 
rigidly pressurized for 
Ô¨Çight. Glide ratios of 3
feet forward for every 
1 foot down are 
possible, but Corliss 
Ô¨Çies 1 to 1, which 
enables him to pull up 
and change his angle 
of approach.  
 
Hitting the ramp 
wrong would be like 
crashing a car into a 
barrier without a 
seatbelt or airbags. 
Corliss aims for a 
tiny approach 
window that‚Äôs about 
20 feet by 20 feet at 
the top of the 
landing strip, so 
Ô¨Çight path accuracy 
is critical. His ‚Äútrajec-
tory control system‚Äù 
could include using 
tethered weather bal-
loons at progres-
sively lower altitudes 
as visual aids, 
allowing him to 
precisely tweak 
direction and angle. 
 
If Corliss‚Äôs approach 
is at all off, he veers 
away from the line 
of balloons and 
deploys his chute. 
Six hundred feet 
above the ground is 
scarily low for the 
average sky diver to 
pull the ripcord, but 
no problem for an 
experienced BASE 
jumper like Corliss, 
who has deployed 
his chute at a third 
of that height.
 
Corliss aims to land 
like an Olympic ski 
jumper, matching the 
angle of the slope as 
closely as possible. 
But while ski jumpers 
Ô¨Çy at about 60 mph, 
Corliss is doing 100 
mph, and he‚Äôll land on 
his rib cage, not his 
legs. The ramp‚Äôs 
fabric can absorb 
some of the impact 
and friction, but it 
can‚Äôt be too forgiving 
or Corliss will bounce

A construction team 
builds Corliss‚Äôs $3 
million, 2000-foot-
long landing ramp, 
which is temporarily 
attached to the side 
of a still-to-be-
determined Las
Vegas structure. The
ramp may be made
of tensile fabric like
the roof of the 
Denver International 
Airport; cables 
anchor the ramp
and keep its 
surface taut.  
Corliss jumps from a 
helicopter several 
thousand feet over 
the Las Vegas Strip. 
His customized 
wingsuit has
lightweight, ripstop 
nylon panels from the 
undersides of his
arms to his torso and 
between his legs. Air 
inlets on the wing‚Äôs
leading edge allow it
to inÔ¨Çate and stay 
rigidly pressurized for 
Ô¨Çight. Glide ratios of 3 
feet forward for every 
1 foot down are
possible, but Corliss 
Ô¨Çies 1 to 1, which 
enables him to pull up
and change his angle 
of approach. 
Hitting the ramp 
wrong would be like 
crashing a car into a
barrier without a
seatbelt or airbags. 
Corliss aims for a
tiny approach 
window that‚Äôs about 
20 feet by 20 feet at 
the top of the
landing strip, so 
Ô¨Çight path accuracy 
is critical. His ‚Äútrajec-
tory control system‚Äù
could include using
tethered weather bal-
loons at progres-
sively lower altitudes 
as visual aids,
allowing him to
precisely tweak 
direction and angle. 
If Corliss‚Äôs approach
is at all off, he veers
away from the line
of balloons and 
deploys his chute.
Six hundred feet
above the ground is 
scarily low for the
average sky diver to 
pull the ripcord, but
no problem for an
experienced BASE
jumper like Corliss, 
who has deployed 
his chute at a third 
of that height.
Corliss aims to land 
like an Olympic ski 
angle of the slope as 
closely as possible. 
But while ski jumpers 
Ô¨Çy at about 60 mph,
Corliss is doing 100
mph, and he‚Äôll land on 
his rib cage, not his 
legs. The ramp‚Äôs
fabric can absorb
some of the impact 
and friction, but it
can‚Äôt be too forgiving
or Corliss will bounce
off. To survive
unharmed, Corliss

At midnight, your car wakes up. The hefty, 15-pound charg-
ing cable tethering the front of the vehicle to a 220-volt out-
let in your garage goes live, pulling 5 kilowatts of power 
from the grid. In just 5 hours, it will nearly double your 
home‚Äôs average daily electrical consumption. Across 
California, hundreds of thousands of plug-in hybrids 
and pure electric vehicles are doing the same, sipping 
electricity from a power network at rest. Some of those 
vehicles have different charging regimens, communi-
cating more with the local utility, or even allowing that 
utility to actively control when and how to recharge 
their batteries. But yours follows a simple pricing 
scheme, automatically charging during what is typically 
the cheapest time of the day, between midnight and 5 am. 
That‚Äôs when the utilities have power to spare, when the 
ofÔ¨Åce buildings in downtown Los Angeles have gone dark 
and sweltering. In the daily rhythm of the grid, this is off-peak. 
Tonight, though, the off-peak grid is unusually busy. Air condi-
tioners across Southern California are battling a week-long heat wave, 
with temperatures exceeding 100 F during the day and barely easing up at 
night. So far, it‚Äôs the worst heat wave to hit the region since 2006. The forecast 
By 2020, ele ric vehicles 
(EVs) will pra ically refuel 
themselves‚Äîprovided you 
have a garage, a smart 
power meter and a home 
charger. With utilities oÔ¨Äer-
ing discounts for oÔ¨Ä-peak 
charging, when power is 
cheap and plentiful, moÔ¨Ü 
EVs will be set to auto-
matically recharge at night. 
Some models will even kick 
on the a/c or heat at a desig-
nated time, preconditioning 
the car for your commute.

for today shows no signs of a break: Angelenos can expect after-
noon highs of 103 F. Aug. 4 is shaping up to be one of the Ô¨Årst 
real tests of the so-called smart grid, an effort to create a nim-
bler, more efÔ¨Åcient, less vulnerable electrical grid. It will also 
test the  nearly 500,000 electriÔ¨Åed vehicles in the state. 
The push to make plug-in vehicles a key part of  America's 
automotive mix began in earnest back in 2010, when the Chevy 
Volt and Nissan Leaf were poised to hum into dealerships. That 
same year, strict new mileage standards forced carmakers to 
begin developing petroleum-free methods to power portions of 
their Ô¨Çeets. But vehicles were only one part of the equation‚Äî
what would happen, exactly, when people plugged them in? 
What would it cost to recharge on the road? And would an 
aging, weather-vulnerable electrical grid be able to safely 
charge thousands, even millions, of the most power-hungry 
consumer products in history?
In the summer of 2020, the answers to many of these ques-
tions are becoming clear (PM interviewed over two dozen engi-
neers, analysts and other experts to create this hypothetical 
scenario): By this time the U.S. electrified vehicle fleet has 
reached 2 million. It‚Äôs a number that‚Äôs seen as either a minor 
triumph or a total disaster‚Äîhigher than some analysts had 
estimated, but short of the 14 million that companies like Nis-
san had predicted, accounting for less than 1 percent of the 
national Ô¨Çeet (a smaller market share than even diesel). 
Half are plug-in hybrid electric vehicles 
(PHEVs), with lithium- ion battery packs that 
provide 40 or 50 miles of electric range, 
and liquid-fuel engines that kick in for 
longer trips. These are most popular in 
suburbs, rural communities and 
colder states. The other million or so 
vehicles are called simply EVs, or 
electric vehicles. With larger bat-
tery packs that can run for 100 
miles or more between charges and 
no backup gas engine, they tend to 
be used by residents of cities and 
warmer climates. Collectively, these 
various types of electriÔ¨Åed vehicles are 
called grid-enabled vehicles, or GEVs, 
because unlike early gas‚Äìelectric hybrids, 
the grid‚Äînot  just the brakes or the motor‚Äî
provides their batteries with a full charge. Thanks 
in part to zero-emissions vehicle mandates dating back 
decades, California has attracted the bulk of this new market, 
meeting analysts‚Äô predictions of a 25 percent share.

have Ô¨Çourished or failed, populating neighborhoods, shop-
ping malls and the occasional highway rest stop with charging 
stations. These come in three varieties. Level 1, or 110-volt 
chargers, can take 12 hours or longer to reÔ¨Åll a vehicle‚Äôs bat-
tery and are mainly found in the  garages of PHEV owners and 
in some public parking lots. Level 2, or 220-volt chargers, are 
the most common. They can replenish a drained battery in 4 
to 5 hours or top off a partially depleted EV parked at a Target, 
Best Buy, or a growing number of workplace lots. And then 
there are Level 3 chargers, known as fast chargers, 440-volt 
stations that can get some batteries back to 80 percent in 15 
to 20 minutes, but they generally are in remote locations and 
their surcharge rivals gas prices.
Not that you pay much attention to gas prices anymore. 
There‚Äôs a 2014-model-year internal-combustion sedan parked 
next to your EV, but that‚Äôs for driving up to San Francisco, out to 
Vegas, or for the occasional camping trip. Instead, you keep 
your eye on electricity rates, which have climbed as utilities 
scramble to meet demand that‚Äôs growing by 1 percent every 
year, despite more energy-efÔ¨Åcient appliances and unpopular 
restrictions on the size of Ô¨Çat-screen TVs. Still, by triggering 
your Level 2 charger to run at night and grabbing one of the free 
charging spots at work, running your EV costs about a dollar per 
day. The cost of installing that charger‚Äîabout $1000, with the 
utility covering half‚Äîwas recovered in the Ô¨Årst year. The switch 
from hydrocarbons to electrons has been, for you, a bargain.

Instead of drawing power from the battery during driving, 
which would reduce your effective range, the EV sips electricity 
from the grid to precondition the cabin. An hour later, when 
you plug your phone into the center console, a touchscreen dis-
play lists your favorite radio stations and your estimated 
time of arrival‚Äîadjusting for trafÔ¨Åc and weather 
conditions‚Äîat the office. In an EV, where 
built-in devices like satellite radios and 
CD changers only add cost and range-
reducing weight, ofÔ¨Çoading as 
many amenities as possible onto  
the driver‚Äôs handheld device is a 
smarter, more efÔ¨Åcient design deci-
sion. ‚ÄúInstead of a bunch of old gee-
zers like me wondering what the kids 
like, we‚Äôll just leave the architecture open, 
and let them run everything through their 
iPhone,‚Äù says Bill Reinert,  national manager of 
Toyota‚Äôs Advanced Technology Group. 
There are some gadgets still hard-wired into the car, such 
as a GPS system that displays public chargers and maps out 
routes that maximize your battery range. Today, you opt for the 
quickest path to work, and instead of sweating out the last 
miles as the sun starts to bake your preconditioned cabin, you 
crank the a/c. There are Ô¨Åve Level 2 charging spots at work, and 
only seven employees with GEVs. You‚Äôre bound to beat them 
there. Sure enough, when your car glides into the parking lot 
emitting a high-pitched whine‚Äîone of countless download-
able car tones, required by law to reduce the risk of collisions 
with pedestrians‚Äîall of the chargers are free. You pull the 
spare  Level 2 charging cable out of the trunk, plug in and check 
the station‚Äôs LCD display. Battery: Sixty-two percent. Time to 
While Level 1 and 2 
chargers‚Äîthe kind found at 
home or in workplace and 
mall parking lots‚Äîcan take 
hours to fully charge an EV, 
Level 3 chargers promise 
to be exponentially quicker. 
at said, they Ô¨Üill require 
you to cool your heels for 
15 to 20 minutes. And aside 
from being slower than 
gas pumps, faÔ¨Ü chargers 
will likely be expensive and 
located in remote spots, 
where commercial-scale 
power is already in place.

grid barely registers a couple 
of million electric vehicles. 
The Department of Energy 
predicts a 0.1 percent increase in overall electricity demand per 
million plug-ins. Other experts see no more than a 1 percent 
bump by 2020. Even if 2 million EVs were all plugged into
Level 2 chargers, that might constitute roughly the same
demand as 2 million new homes suddenly appearing on the
grid. Spread out across the country, that‚Äôs a negligible increase.
Unfortunately, the grid lives and dies on a local level‚Äîthere
is no central operator that juggles the peaks and valleys of sup-
ply and demand around the United States. That‚Äôs why the heat 
storm (a longer, more severe version of a heat wave) that hit 
California in 2006 led to major power failures. By 2020, national
electrical demand will be even higher, rising by around 14 per-
cent. For years, utilities have struck deals with customers to
help shave peak loads. Southern California Edison, for example, 
gives customers a credit in exchange for allowing the utility to
wirelessly shut down their air conditioner‚Äôs compressor.
w
Whether it‚Äôs referred to as load control or stop-charging, the 
W
ability of utilities to pull the plug on GEVs is seen as a natural
extension of this practice. The digital, two-way communication 
associated with the smart grid would make it easier, but it isn‚Äôt 
necessary‚Äîresearchers at the Electric Power Research Institute
are currently testing load control with Ford and GM vehicles
using wireless signals, as well as GM‚Äôs OnStar system.

into giving utilities final charging approval. PHEV owners
might be more willing‚Äîthey can always run on gas, if neces-
sary. Commercial customers might also be game, since the
charging spots they‚Äôve paid for are essentially perks. 
Which leaves you in a bind. Today, along with being the
hottest day of the year, is your annual scheduled dealer mainte-
nance visit. The dealership is 20 miles away. It‚Äôs just past noon
now. Unless your company‚Äôs chargers are online when you get 
back, making it home could be a white-knuckle ride. There are 
no fumes to run on in an EV, and no fuel light to ignore.
EV dealer maintenance is both less of a hassle than if you 
drove an internal-combustion vehicle and more of a necessity. 
ElectriÔ¨Åcation eliminates many wear-and-tear issues, or at least 
mitigates them. According to Nancy Gioia, director of global 
electriÔ¨Åcation at Ford, a San Francisco cab company using Ford 
Escape Hybrids went from changing brake pads every 10,000
miles to every 50,000 miles (regenerative braking absorbs most 
 
 
charge: N/A. That‚Äôs not normal. Neither is the alert window, 
apologizing for the inconvenience, explaining that your com-
pany‚Äôs chargers have been temporarily disabled to assist the 
local utility‚Äôs load management. 
This, it hits you, is how the smart grid begins to fail‚Äînot 
with a bang or a brownout, but a million polite refusals.


of the car‚Äôs kinetic energy before the pads engage). Oil changes 
disappear in EVs, and even in plug-in hybrids oil-Ô¨Ålter changes 
could be reduced by a factor of Ô¨Åve or 10.
But as mechanical failures become less of an issue, baby-
sitting the expensive, complex and potentially explosive battery 
pack requires a new approach to maintenance. GEVs will regu-
larly assess and wirelessly transmit battery-health updates to 
dealers or mechanics, in the same way that modern jet aircraft 
can send maintenance alerts to ground crews while in midair. 
Nissan is currently setting up its own global data center to 
manage this information, and GM expects to use its OnStar 
telematics system to do the same.
That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre on your way to the dealer‚Äî
to check on the battery‚Äôs health and, 
more importantly, to take advan-
tage of an invitation to try a 
firmware update, which 
should optimize the EV‚Äôs 
battery pack, expanding 
your range by 5 percent. 
Missing this visit could 
mean waiting months 
for the software‚Äôs full 
release. There are thou-
sands of apps for GEVs, 
most of them changing 
the way vehicles handle 
data. But tweaking the 
algorithms and code at the 
heart of the car‚Äôs performance 
takes an authorized mechanic.
In fact, the EV revolution eventu-
ally could deal the Ô¨Ånal blow for automo-
tive DIY. ‚ÄúFor the do-it-yourself mechanics, without having a tie-
in to the infrastructure or the systems that allow you to talk to 
the car, it‚Äôs going to get more difÔ¨Åcult to diagnose and address 
the electriÔ¨Åed vehicle‚Äôs needs,‚Äù Ford‚Äôs Gioia says. Those dead 
set on modding their GEVs will have to contend with the usual 
voided warranties, plus new risks associated with high-voltage 
equipment and battery cells that can detonate when overheated. 
But the true gearheads aren‚Äôt exactly dinosaurs‚Äîwith more 
than 280 million nonelectric cars in the country in 2020, there‚Äôs 
still plenty of axle grease and hydraulic Ô¨Çuid to go around.
You barely have time to pick out a magazine in the dealer-
ship‚Äôs waiting room before the tests are Ô¨Ånished. Back on the 
road, you notice the battery gauge has taken a sudden nose-dive 
to 40 percent. The tests they ran at the dealership sucked out 
what little safety margin you might have had. If the work char-
gers are still cut off, there are only a couple of options for getting 
home: Either stop at the mall and kill a few hours while the car 
sits in a complimentary charging spot, or get to a fast charger.

have installed 50 Level 3 fast chargers, each running at 50 kilo-
watts, in the San Diego area. Theoretically, the presence of fast 
chargers can reduce the so-called range anxiety that keeps EV 
drivers from pushing the limits of their battery range. In an 
ongoing study that began in 
2007, the installation of a 
handful of Level 3 chargers 
in Japan encouraged partici-
pants to drive their EVs as much as 80 percent more often, and 
30 percent farther from their homes. In fact, almost none of 
the subjects actually used the fast chargers‚Äîthe high-voltage, 
high-priced equipment is as much a psychological tool as it is a 
piece of electric transportation infrastructure.
But as Mark Duvall, the Electric Power Research Institute‚Äôs 
director of electric transportation, points out, it‚Äôs hard to come 
up with a worse investment than a $50,000 charger that no  
one uses. (Public Level 2 chargers run $5000 to $10,000.) One 
key reason drivers might be avoiding fast chargers: Twenty 
minutes is still way too long to wait. To get charging times 
down to 5 minutes‚Äîmore than the average gas station Ô¨Åll-up, 
but not by much‚Äîmeans installing chargers capable of 250- to 
600-kw output. On paper, the numbers add up just Ô¨Åne: More 
kilowatts mean faster recharge rates. Even sticking with the 
math, though, ultrafast charging becomes an unwieldy and 
even frightening prospect. ‚ÄúFor 5-minute charging, you‚Äôve got 
to go to 600 kw,‚Äù says Don Hillebrand, director of the Center 
for Transportation Research at Argonne National Laboratory. 
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how much power you put in a city block.‚Äù With that sort 
of industrial-strength output, capacitors could take 20 minutes 
to recover between charges, provided the utilities would even 
allow such stations access to the grid.

as the key to making the technology feasible. ‚ÄúYou can populate 
L.A. with 250-kw chargers and have 250-kwh storage units right 
there with them,‚Äù says Kristen Helsel, vice president of EV solu-
tions at AeroVironment. ‚ÄúAs you take power from the grid, you 
can put it back in.‚Äù These stationary batteries could be charged 
by solar power or off-peak grid electricity, or by something more 
innovative, such as hydrogen fuel cell generators. 
Whether or not anyone would commit to that level of capital 
investment, the physics still gets in the way. ‚ÄúBatteries don‚Äôt like 
getting hot,‚Äù Hillebrand says. Even if a new generation of batter-
ies could survive years of fast charging, a hardware failure during 
a Level 3 charge could be fatal for nearby humans. ‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt 
think about the phenomenal amount of heat generated when 
you move that much energy that fast,‚Äù Hillebrand says. ‚ÄúWhen 
you look at dealing with potential arcs and thermal events, I 
don‚Äôt see it as even remotely possible by 2020. And our guys are 
the ones who write the standards for these chargers.‚Äù
The fast charger you pull 
up to is the more common 
50-kw variety. It‚Äôs located in 
a desolate spot in Sun Val-
ley, a drive-through kiosk in 
the parking lot of an indus-
trial metal supplier. Even at

‚ÄúTo maÔ¨Üer a grandly exciting, 
arcane and perhaps even diabolical  
technology,‚Äù the machine‚Äôs builder, 
William GurÔ¨Üelle, says.
a crowd gathers in the parking lot of the 
Susan B. Anthony Middle School in Min-
neapolis, Minn., to watch a man in a navy 
blue jumpsuit as he prepares to Ô¨Åre his 
catapult. He pivots the 800-pound 
machine by its Ô¨År and oak beams, aim-
ing it at a grassy slope about 80 yards 
away. Passing dog walkers pause, kids 
lean bikes on kickstands, and a security 
guard strolls over from the school to get 
a closer look. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be doing some Ô¨Çinging before 
long,‚Äù says the man in the jumpsuit, 
William Gurstelle, the catapult‚Äôs  builder. 
On one side of the machine‚Äôs central 
fulcrum hangs a counterweight 
Ô¨Ålled with 400 pounds of rocks 
and lead shot. On the other 
side of the pivot is an ele-
gantly tapered 5-foot-long 
throwing arm pointing 
skyward. Gurstelle grabs 
the tip of the arm and 
pulls it down nearly 180 
degrees until it‚Äôs almost 
perpendicular to the 
            
 
  
 
 
 
      
 


 
 
 
asphalt, then latches it to the catapult‚Äôs 
base. The 400-pound weight rises in 
opposition, poised like a boot ready to 
kick. Gurstelle gathers the ammuni-
tion: baseballs impaled by eyebolts, a 
box of gym socks and a bottle of lighter 
Ô¨Çuid. He drops a ball into a sock, hooks 
it to a sling at the throwing arm‚Äôs tip, 
soaks the stuffed sock in accelerant and 
sets it all on Ô¨Åre.
Gurstelle steps back as the flames 
Ô¨Çicker and tightens his grip on a 6-foot 
rope tied to the latch pinning the throw-
ing arm. He counts to three and yanks 
the line. The latch springs, the weight 
drops, the catapult creaks, and 
the throwing arm rises like a 
basketball player making a 
hook shot. The ball slings upward so fast 
that the Ô¨Çames seem to disengage. But 
the stocking stays ablaze, a low-level 
comet in a sizzling line drive. It hits the 
grassy hill with a thunk, ricocheting 
embers of sock elastic, and rolls down to 
the parking lot. ‚ÄúIs that a tray-boo-chit?‚Äù 
a bystander asks. ‚ÄúCorrect,‚Äù Gurstelle 
says, ‚Äúexcept that it‚Äôs treb-yoo-SHAY.‚Äù
Gurstelle seizes any opportunity to 
educate his audience. He explains how 
to build a model of this particular trebu-
chet in his third book, The Art of the  
Catapult, with copious details on its role 
in the siege of Scotland‚Äôs Stirling Castle 
in 1304, where it was known as Ludgar 
the War Wolf. Gurstelle‚Äôs sixth book, 
2009‚Äôs Absinthe and Flamethrowers, bal-
ances smoke-bomb recipes with studies 
suggesting that a reasonable amount of 
risk-taking can make you a happier per-
son. ‚ÄúI Ô¨Ånd a certain nobility in living a 
little more dangerously than the average 
guy,‚Äù Gurstelle says.
Gurstelle got his Ô¨Årst taste of danger 
during downhill slaloms on soapbox 
derby racers that he and his grandfather 
built using broken chairs and scrap 
lumber from the family‚Äôs house in  
St. Paul. Gurstelle says his grandfather 
was a ‚Äúbigger hammer‚Äù type of guy‚Äî
construction snafus can all be solved, 
the thinking goes, by pounding the proj-
ect with a bigger hammer. Lessons in 
precision came from Gurstelle‚Äôs phar-
macist father, who stocked Gurstelle‚Äôs 
basement chemistry sets with vats of 
hydrochloric acid and metallic zinc. 
Gurstelle soon began modifying equip-
ment, bending glassware into alembics 
and pot stills. Before long, he was cook-

niche, even after earning a degree in 
mechanical engineering from the Uni-

facturing engineer, he was bored  weld-

electrodes. He left for a job designing 
industrial ovens and furnaces. ‚ÄúGrind-
ing, punching, shearing, making ovens 
big enough to dip a Toyota into. It‚Äôs what 
all American industry should be like,‚Äù he 
says. But he lost interest in continuously 
redesigning the same oven. So after a 
misguided detour into an MBA pro-
gram‚Äî‚ÄúI thought I‚Äôd be this captain of 
industry,‚Äù he says‚ÄîGurstelle wound up 
with a gig as a billing analyst for North-
western Bell. ‚ÄúWho could be happy doing 
that?‚Äù he asks. 
Tinkering after hours during those 
dreary years, Gurstelle compiled test 
notes and performance data on the 
 devices he built in his spare time‚Äîpotato 
cannons fueled by hair spray, bratwurst 
missiles launched on bursts of com-
pressed air or ghostly Ô¨Çoating orbs made 
of plastic dry-cleaner bags and Sterno 
cans. The plans for 13 projects eventually 
became the manuscript for Backyard Bal-
listics, his Ô¨Årst book. After its publication 
in 2001, Gurstelle quit the telecommuni-
cations industry. ‚ÄúAnd I never looked 
back,‚Äù he says.
He found satisfaction as a full-time

senior who used Backyard Ballistics to 
co-teach an elective course. ‚ÄúI want you 
to know that the students in the class 
are both having fun and effectively 
learning science,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúThanks for 
making such great experiments avail-
able to all the amateur scientists of  
the world!‚Äù
Out in the alley, Gurstelle sets up his 
latest cannon‚Äî82 inches of PVC pipe 
emblazoned with stickers that read, 
‚ÄúNoisy Plumber.‚Äù The gun is mounted 
vertically on a plywood stand, steadied 
on the concrete by 10-pound barbell 
plates. At the coupling where the gun‚Äôs 
barrel meets its combustion chamber, 
purple stains of PVC primer show 
beneath the hardened ooze of excess 
cement. A threaded end cap, skewered 
by a Ô¨Çint-and-steel lantern sparker, seals 
the chamber. This allows Gurstelle to 
ignite the cannon without touching a 
Ô¨Çame to the fuel‚Äîunscented Aqua Net. 
Gurstelle approaches the gun with a 
potato and a broomstick. He twists the 
spud, forcing it into the barrel, and then 
uses the broomstick to tamp it down. 
With deft motions, Gurstelle unscrews 
the end cap, spritzes a cloud of hair 
spray into the combustion chamber, 
pops the lid on and spins the igniter. 
Listening to the potato launch, it 
becomes clear how Gurstelle settled on 
the title of his Ô¨Åfth book, Whoosh Boom 
Splat. He watches the russet shrink to a 
pinprick against the blue sky while a 
stopwatch measures seconds aloft. A 
seeming eternity after the whoosh and 
boom, a neighbor‚Äôs concrete patio gets 
the splat. Vibrations from the impact 
cause Gurstelle‚Äôs deaf dog to bark wildly 
nearby. The engineer rushes to his note-
book, plugging in variables to document 
the results of this 8.8-second Ô¨Çight: muz-
zle velocity, 96 mph; apogee, 315 feet. ‚ÄúI 
said 4.4 seconds, right?‚Äù Gurstelle asks. 
He double-checks the numbers. Problem 
solved. The Noisy Plumber is 
ready to debut in pub-
lic education. All 
Gurstelle needs now 
is an audience. 
FC
scraps, tees, purple primer and a Stanley 
SharpTooth crosscut handsaw. Labeled 
bins along each wall hold grinding 
wheels, copper tubing, rope, clothes-
pins, casters, measuring cups and muf-
Ô¨Ån pans.  ‚ÄúA clean workbench is a happy 
workbench,‚Äù Gurstelle says, sweeping 
the plastic plumbing pieces into their 
respective containers. Gurstelle leaves a 
dog-eared copy of the Mechanical Engi-
neering Reference Manual lying open on 
the table, turned to a page of uniform 
acceleration formulas. Next to it, a stack 
of graph paper covered with scrawled 
equations and computations contains 
the lab notes on a supersize spud gun. 
Gurstelle wants to see those notes in 
a science-class lesson plan on particle 
kinetics. ‚ÄúThe potato only goes in two 
directions‚Äîup and down‚Äî
but you can tell a lot of stuff 
from that,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAccelera-
tion, muzzle velocity, altitude of apo-
gee‚ÄîI like to know these things.‚Äù He 
has received one letter in support of his 
vision, from a California high school 
1. A diagram for a four-barrel pneumatic gun, which GurÔ¨Üelle will likely use to Ô¨Åre rolled-up T-shirts into 
crowds at college football games, shares workbench space with potato-cannon fodder.
2. With socks and lighter Ô¨Çuid ready nearby, GurÔ¨Üelle prepares his trebuchet 
for a Ô¨Çing in the parking lot of a Minneapolis middle school.
writer publishing plans for his projects. 
‚ÄúHaving control over the physical envi-
ronment lets me parse it out and see 
what‚Äôs inside it,‚Äù Gurstelle says. After 
demonstrating his creations, he encour-
ages his fans to go forth and tinker. ‚ÄúNot 
to be too highfalutin about it, but I think 
there‚Äôs something good and noble in 
getting people interested in Ô¨Ånding out 
what they can do,‚Äù he says.
Sometimes Gurstelle hears about the 
results. A Backyard Ballistics reader 
once wrote to tell him that she still has 
the Ô¨Årst spud gun she built, a family col-
laboration executed per Gurstelle‚Äôs 
instructions. ‚ÄúIt is one of the strongest 
memories I have of my dad and me 
together before he passed away. Thank 
you,‚Äù she wrote. 
the scent of peeled potatoes permeates 
Gurstelle‚Äôs shop. Inside the concrete-
walled room on an alley behind his 
home, a mesh sack of russets shares 
space on the workbench with PVC

WITH THE CAR YOU‚ÄôRE WORKING 
ON NOW, BUT WHAT ABOUT IN THE 
FUTURE? IF YOU ONLY WANT TO BUY THE 
TOOL ONCE, YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE IT CAN 
BE UPGRADED WITH NEW CODES FOR NEW  
VEHICLES. MANY SCAN TOOL MANUFACTURERS  
WILL CHARGE YOU $500 OR MORE PER 
UPGRADE, BUT THE ACTRON AUTOSCANNER 
PLUS CAN BE UPGRADED THROUGH 
ACTRON‚ÄôS WEBSITE FOR FREE.

A full complement of 
Mothers products will be 
kept in the car as it tours 
around the country. Mothers 
All Wheel & Tire Cleaner 
easily cuts through grime, 
grease and brake dust. Next 
is Mothers Chrome Polish 
which provides advanced 
protection and a brilliant 
shine. We‚Äôll be able to do 
instant cleaning touch-ups 
with Showtime Instant 
Detailer, and we‚Äôll apply 
Mothers California Gold wax 
with a PowerBall 4 Paint to 
give our paint total protection 
from showgoers‚Äô Ô¨Ångers  
and noses.

BILSTEIN SHOCKS
Where most other shock 
absorbers are made with 
bodies cut from a piece 
of steel tube then Ô¨Åtted 
with imprecisely stamped 
internals, Bilstein shocks 
use extruded bodies, 
induction hardened shafts 
and machined valves. 
That means Bilsteins are 
incredibly strong, yet 
equipped with the kind of 
precise tolerances you‚Äôll 
Ô¨Ånd on surgical instruments. 
What‚Äôs that mean for you? A 
lifetime of improved control, 
handling, performance and 
comfort. Every shock comes 
with a warranty good for your 
vehicle‚Äôs lifetime, meaning 
Bilsteins could even save  
you money.

IF YOU SPILL COFFEE ON 
INTERIOR FABRIC, DILUTE THE STAIN 
IMMEDIATELY WITH COLD WATER, THEN BLOT  
WITH A TOWEL TO ABSORB THE LIQUID. IF  
THERE‚ÄôS STILL DISCOLORATION, SOAK THE AREA  
IN GLASS CLEANER. THIS WILL DISSOLVE THE  
STAIN AND ANY COATING ON THE THREADS OF  
THE FABRIC, BUT WILL LEAVE THE MATERIAL MORE 
SUSCEPTIBLE TO FUTURE STAINS, SO RE-APPLY  
A CLEANER LIKE BLUE MAGIC HEAVY FOAM  
UPHOLSTERY CLEANER, WHICH WILL RE-SEAL  
THE FABRIC WHEN IT DRIES.

COOPER TIRE TEST TRACK
COOPER TIRE TEST TR
COOPER TIRES
The Cooper Zeon RS3 
is specially designed to 
accentuate the extreme 
horsepower levels and 
superior handling capabilities 
of tuned muscle cars, so the 
tires worked perfectly on our 
600 HP Camaro. Large blocks 
of tread on the shoulders 
maximize outright grip and 
provide split-second steering 
response, while deep central 
grooves aggressively clear 
standing water. The RS3s 
alone were single-handedly 
responsible for dropping two 
seconds from the otherwise 
stock Camaro‚Äôs lap of the wet 
handling course.

Perhaps more important is how

WIPING IT AWAY COULD RESULT IN SEVERE 
SCRATCHING. INSTEAD, SOAK A PAPER TOWEL  
IN UNDILUTED MOTHER‚ÄôS CAR WASH AND LET IT 
ABSORB FOR A FEW MINUTES. THEN, SIMPLY HOSE  
IT OFF. THE SPECIALLY-FORMULATED CLEANER

MOBIL 1
Mobil 1 5w-30 is specially 
tailored to work in GM‚Äôs 
LS-series of V8s. The fully 
synthetic oil provides 
superior wear protection 
to mineral oil counterparts 
while keeping all the parts 
it lubricates exceptionally 
clean. Not only can Mobil 
1 increase horsepower 
through reducing frictional 
losses inside an engine, but 
that results in increased fuel 
economy and engine life 
too. It works across a huge 
temperature range too, 
pouring smoothly all the way 
from -53¬∫F to 400¬∫F.

KICKER
We‚Äôre running four Kicker 10-
inch subwoofers in the trunk. 
They operate at a higher air 
pressure than most subs, 
meaning we can Ô¨Åt them into 
smaller boxes. We‚Äôre also 
running a set of three-layer 
composite Kicker mid-range 
speakers and the company‚Äôs 
30mm tweeters. The best 
thing about the system isn‚Äôt 
how good it sounds but how 
it Ô¨Åts in a conÔ¨Åned space. 
Flexibility and reliability  
|make Kicker power the only 
choice for high-performance 
mobile audio sound. Trust  
us, you‚Äôll hear us coming 
from blocks away.

ere‚Äôs no telling nowadays what 
people build. Decks, docks, tree-
houses, pressure-treated retaining 
walls, sheds, fences and firewood 
racks are projects our readers have 
asked about recently. is work calls 
for lots of fasteners, especially lag 
screws. Only one tool combines rota-
tional speed and blows per minute in 
a way that makes it excel at driving 
these big screws: the impact driver. 
It‚Äôs faÔ¨Üer and more consiÔ¨Üent than a 
drill driver and transfers less reaion 
torque to you. We gathered nine li-ion 
impa drivers, and a thousand screws 
later, here‚Äôs what we found.

BOSCH
26618-01
 PRICE:  $395
RPM/BPM:  2800/3200
 AMP-HOURS:  2.6
 LAG SCREWS:  128
Likes: e Bosch is a 
capable driver equipped 
with three speed/impa 
settings. It seems the 
moÔ¨Ü likely to survive a 
drop oÔ¨Ä a ladder owing 
to its thoroughly 
proteed rubber nose 
and handle. 
Dislikes: e driver is 
larger and heavier than 
comparable produs. Its 
speed/impa seleor 
switch is hard to budge.
CRAFTSMAN
79568
 PRICE:  $220
RPM/BPM :  2500/3200
 AMP-HOURS:  2.6
 LAG SCREWS:  108
Likes: is is a 
Ô¨Üraightforward tool  
with a helpful charge-
indicator light on the  
face of the battery.
Dislikes: e 20-volt 
battery is too large 
relative to the driving 
power it provides. 
DEWALT
DC827KL
 PRICE:  $330
RPM/BPM:  2400/2700
 AMP-HOURS:  2.2
 LAG SCREWS:  100
Likes: Compa and 
rugged, the DeWalt has a 
battery poÔ¨Ü that inserts 
into the handle, giving it a 
charaeriÔ¨Üic that some 
severe-use builders will 
value: It has the leaÔ¨Ü 
amount of wiggle. It also 
has few exposed body 
faÔ¨Üeners, making it sleek 
and easy-handling.
Dislikes: No complaints 
noted.
HITACHI
WH18DL
 PRICE:  $309
RPM/BPM:  2600/3200
 AMP-HOURS:  3.0
 LAG SCREWS:  76
Likes: A simple sliding 
switch on the handle 
increases or decreases 
torque. We also think its 
pivoting handle-mounted 
worklight is a great idea.
Dislikes: e tool needs 
to catch up with other 
18-volt competitors in 
lag-driving performance.
MAKITA
BTD144
 PRICE:  $350
RPM/BPM:  2600/3400
 AMP-HOURS:  3.0
 LAG SCREWS:  128
Likes: e Makita 
combines small size, light 
weight and powerful 
driving performance. Its 
three speed settings and 
responsive trigger permit 
better force adjuÔ¨Üment, 
so you can apply more 
power to lags and less to 
Phillips-head screws‚Äî
preventing Ô¨Ürip-out. 
Dislikes: Its charger is 
over-engineered and its 
graphics myÔ¨Üerious.

OTHER OPTIONS:
14.4-volt tools and 
impact wrenches
All the tools teÔ¨Üed are 
more than enough for 
homeowners. So much 
so, we think 14.4-volt 
models are worth 
exploring. One example 
is the Pana sonic 
EY7541, an impa 
wrench with a square 
nose like a socket 
wrench‚Äôs. It uses an 
adapter collet to accept 
1‚ÅÑ4-inch hex-shank bits. 
It may be expensive 
($345), but it‚Äôs a 
superb, induÔ¨Ürial-
 quality power tool.

Q 
e exterior 
wood trim on 
our 20-year-old house 
has hardened drips 
and blobs of paint 
everywhere. We‚Äôre 
wondering whether 
we should strip the 
paint or simply 
replace the trim. 
Since the trim is not 
historically valuable,  
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs  
worth saving.
A 
Both stripping and 
removal are pretty radi-
cal solutions. I‚Äôd wet-sand 
big blobs of paint using 
water-resistant sandpaper 
on a hand-sanding block and 
a plastic spray bottle. Keep 
misting the surfaces down 
as you work, and use a gar-
den hose to rinse pigment 
off nearby siding. You don‚Äôt 
want pigment- tinted runoff 
to dry in place and stain the siding. For 
large areas, use a random-orbit sander 
and stearate- coated (paint- stripping) 
sandpaper. Empty the  sander‚Äôs dust bag 
frequently and consider hooking the 
sander to a shop vacuum to keep air-
borne debris to a minimum.
For areas that are truly in bad shape, 
stripping might save you some time 
over sanding. Remember to protect 
adjacent siding using painter‚Äôs tape (the 
blue, green and purple types) sold at 
paint Ô¨Üores and home centers. Don‚Äôt 
use tan-colored masking tape; that Ô¨ÜuÔ¨Ä 
is only good for household (nonpainting) 
applications. Spread dropcloths on 
pavements or over shrubbery to prote 
them from falling gobs of goo. Stripper 
will take you juÔ¨Ü so far, though. You‚Äôll 
have to scrape so ened paint oÔ¨Ä curved 
surfaces and out of corners, so get

Many amateur painters overlook 
the following: A Ô¨Üripped surface usu-
ally needs to be neutralized and rinsed 
aer the Ô¨Üripping is done; otherwise, 
the residual chemicals can discolor the 
paint and interfere with its bond. e 
manufaurer of the Ô¨Üripping chemi-
cals will recommend a speciÔ¨Åc neutral-
izer, which could range from a mild 
acidic solution to a quick wipe with a 
clean cloth moiÔ¨Üened with paint thin-
ner. Finally, check with the town about 
how to dispose of the gunk that you 
Ô¨Ürip oÔ¨Ä the trim. With a house that 
age, it‚Äôs unlikely it contains lead, but 
you may need to dispose of Ô¨Üripped 
paint as hazardous waÔ¨Üe. 
Untangling
Old Glory
I Ô¨Çy my American Ô¨Çag a lot during the 
summer, using a pole mounted on my 
front porch. e wind whips it around, 
and I frequently return to Ô¨Ånd that it‚Äôs 
a tangled mess. I was thinking of 
inÔ¨Üalling a freeÔ¨Üanding Ô¨Çag pole to 
prevent this. Can a Ô¨Çag Ô¨Çying from a 
pole also get tangled? JuÔ¨Ü because 
I‚Äôve never seen it happen doesn‚Äôt 
mean it can‚Äôt.
It‚Äôs gratifying to hear about your 
respeful care of our nation‚Äôs symbol. 
Compared to the method you‚Äôre using 
now, a vertical Ô¨Çag pole is tangle-free, 
though putting down a footing for the 
pole and caring for the pole and its 
hardware can be a lot of work.
ere are other solutions, some of 
them quite simple, such as displaying 
the Ô¨Çag vertically. Suspended in this 
position, the canton (the blue reangle 
with Ô¨Üars; also called the union) is Ô¨Üa-
tioned to the observer‚Äôs left when 
viewed from the Ô¨Üreet. For more on 
Ô¨Çag etiquette, see U.S. Code, Title 4, 
Chapter 1, ‚Äúe Flag.‚Äù
If you‚Äôd rather continue displaying 
the Ô¨Çag as you are, there are retroÔ¨Åt 
sleeves that slip over the pole and 
allow the Ô¨Çag to wave back and forth 
or even spin around the pole given 
enough wind; there are also free- 
spinning and tangle-free poles that pro-
vide the same proteion. Here in New 
York City, some of the Ô¨Çags that Ô¨Çutter 
gracefully from oÔ¨Éce buildings have a 
diagonal Ô¨Üay that is secured to a grom-
met at the lower corner of the Ô¨Çag. e 
rope is tied oÔ¨Ä to a cleat mounted on 
the wall of the building. That also 
seems to help greatly.
Raising a Stink 
In the paÔ¨Ü couple of months, 
whenever I do a load of laundry, I get 
a Ô¨Ürong sewer smell in the back of 
the house. e smell arises when the 
washing machine drains aer the 
wash cycle. ere are toilets, sinks 
and showers in the area where the 
smell is coming from, but their traps 
are full of water. I‚Äôm Ô¨Üumped.
Sometimes the answer to this is sim-
ple and sometimes it‚Äôs not. FirÔ¨Ü, get 
up on the roof and check that the vent 
stacks are clear. Falling leaves and 
neÔ¨Ü- building birds can clog a house‚Äôs 
drain vents. If needed, clear them with 
a piece of wire or a shop vacuum. 
ese roof vents supply makeup air to 
the house‚Äôs plumbing syÔ¨Üem. Without 
that makeup air, draining water 
(whether it‚Äôs from the washing 
machine, a sink or a shower) will cre-
ate a vacuum that‚Äôs Ô¨Ürong enough to 
siphon water out of one or more 
I L L U S T R AT I O N  B Y  T Y P O Z O N


plumbing traps. A dry trap will let sewer 
gas into the house.
Next, check around the washing 
machine itself for signs of leakage in its 
drain. Finally, if everything appears in 
order, you‚Äôll have to call a plumber with 
a sewer camera and drain-clearing

Pressure-Washed  
Concrete 
Our home in the SouthweÔ¨Ü has nicely 
done concrete patios and walks that 
look like they‚Äôre 30 years old or more. 
We pressure-washed the surfaces 
and that did make them cleaner, but 
their color is uneven.
Pressure-washing concrete can be 
tricky for the reason that you describe. 
You can get it clean and evenly washed 
without the Ô¨Üriping sometimes associ-
ated with pressure washing, and even 
aer all that it Ô¨Üill may not be as evenly 
colored as you would like. I‚Äôd suggeÔ¨Ü 
that you clean it with an acidic 
concrete/ masonry cleaner, such as 
H&C Etching Solution. Aerward, apply 
a masonry Ô¨Üain to even out the color 
discrepancies.
Removing Metal Lath
and PlaÔ¨Üer
I‚Äôm doing some remodeling in  
my mother‚Äôs house and need to 
remove some metal lath and plaÔ¨Üer. 
I‚Äôve already removed some. Tearing 
down these walls is enough to  
make a grown man cry. How can it  
be done eÔ¨Éciently?
Having tangled with that material, I‚Äôve 
asked myself that question many 
times since. If I had to do it over again, 
I‚Äôd mark out the stud locations and 
saw between them using a heavy-duty 
circular saw and an induÔ¨Ürial-duty dia-
mond blade such as those made by 
Diteq Corp. New vacuum-brazed tech-
nology permits manufaurers to make 
extremely capable hybrid blades. In the 
paÔ¨Ü, there were blades that could cut 
plaÔ¨Üer or masonry materials but not 
metal. New blades will cut anything in 
one pass. ey‚Äôre not cheap, of course. 
Expe to pay at leaÔ¨Ü $90 a blade, and 
you could go through one per room. I‚Äôd 
saw the vertical leg of each reangle 
and then the bottom. Drop the piece

free by sawing out the short side of the 
reangle up top.
Obviously, this is brutally hard and 
dusty work. A house built using that 
plaÔ¨Üer syÔ¨Üem will certainly have lead 
paint on the walls. I wouldn‚Äôt even think 
of doing this without a duÔ¨Ü-colleion 
syÔ¨Üem that‚Äôs up to the job. Again, Diteq 
and others have hoses and saw shrouds 
to keep the duÔ¨Ü under control. You‚Äôll 
also need to wear a duÔ¨Ü mask.
If you don‚Äôt want to use a circular 
saw, I‚Äôd cut each rectangle with an 
angle grinder and an appropriate wheel 
using a duÔ¨Ü shroud and shop vacuum, 
as with a circular saw.
at leaves the lath and plaÔ¨Üer on 
Ô¨Üud faces, along the top and bottom 
plates, and on window headers. 
I‚Äôd smash the plaÔ¨Üer oÔ¨Ä these with 
a hammer and go at the lath with every-
thing from a ripping hammer to a crow-
bar or even a square-nose shovel. Show 
the Ô¨ÜuÔ¨Ä no mercy. Use end-nipper pli-
ers to clip oÔ¨Ä nail Ô¨Üubs. Keep a recipro-
cating saw and some diamond grit or 
metal-cutting blades handy to deal with 
Ô¨Üubborn pieces of lath.

cable. Start with the meter on the high-
est range, probably 10 or 20 amps. 
Warning! Doing something silly, like try-
ing to start the car or turn on the 
headlights ‚Äîanything that draws more 
than the meter‚Äôs rated capacity‚Äîcan 
blow the meter‚Äôs fuse. Once you have 
determined that the current drain you‚Äôre 
reading is safe, gradually reduce the 
meter‚Äôs scale to the appropriate low 
range, probably 2 amps or 200 mA. You 
are now reading the parasitic drain on 
the battery. Some vehicles will show as

 voltage teÔ¨Ü conÔ¨Årms that your alterna-
tor is charging. Further poking around 
doesn‚Äôt uncover an obvious elerical 
issue. Aer charging the battery over-
night, the car Ô¨Üarts Ô¨Åne. But when le 
overnight without the charger, the car 
refuses to start. Conclusion: Some-
thing‚Äôs draining the battery. You‚Äôve got 
para sitic battery drain.
Basics
 MoÔ¨Ü vehicles draw some battery 
current when the key is oÔ¨Ä, thanks to 
the clock and the internal memory of 
engine computers, body-control mod-
ules and radio presets. Altogether, they 
draw a very small amount of current. 
Fiy milliamps would be a safe upper 
limit for this, although many vehicles 
will draw less. If you‚Äôre not sure, look up 
the corre rating in the service manual. 
To measure the car-oÔ¨Ä current draw,  
you‚Äôll need a multimeter capable of 
reading current, preferably one with a 
10- or 20-amp capacity, but a 200 milli-
amp lower scale. You can Ô¨Ånd these for 
as little as 20 bucks. 
Start with a fully charged battery. 
Either make sure the doors are closed 
or wedge the door switch shut. Turning 
oÔ¨Ä the dome light isn‚Äôt good enough‚Äî
on many cars, an open door will aivate 
several circuits. (One example: Open the 
driver‚Äôs door on some vehicles and the 
fuel-pump relay briefly activates, to 
prime the fuel injeion for faÔ¨Üer Ô¨Üart-
ing. Aer the initial surge, that circuit will 
continue to draw over 100 milliamps.) 
Unplug any power-draining cables from 
the lighter socket, such as a cellphone 
charger or GPS. Even if the device itself 
is unplugged from the charger, the plug 
may Ô¨Üill consume a few milliamps of 
current. Got an ear-bleedin‚Äô Ô¨Üereo amp 
in the trunk? Pull the fuse, because it 
may be in standby mode rather than 
completely shut down.
One caution: If your radio or antithe 
system requires you to input a code 
aer the power is interrupted, better 
hunt it down now. It‚Äôs likely that you‚Äôll 
need it. Don‚Äôt let the dealer entice you 
to bring the car in and pay him to input 
it. e code should have been included 
with the owner‚Äôs manual when you pur-
chased the car.
Start hunting by putting your amme-
ter in series with the battery‚Äôs ground 
circuit. (It‚Äôs safer to meter the ground 
because if you use the positive side, it‚Äôs 
easy to short the jumpers to ground, 
which makes sparks and burns up wires. 
Short the ground to ground and nothing 
happens.) 
Disconnect the battery‚Äôs ground 
cable and wire the ammeter in series 
between the battery terminal and the 
1. Start with a fully 
charged battery. 
Be sure the radio 
and lights are shut 
oÔ¨Ä. Unplug your 
cellphone charger, 
GPS or laptop. 
Close the door or 
hold the dome-
light button down 
with a wedge. 
Remove the key 
from the ignition. 
Now use a jumper 
to bridge the 
battery‚Äôs negative 
poÔ¨Ü to the clamp 
to preserve any 
memory and to 
keep from 
aivating the 
antithe code  
if your radio  
uses one. 
2. Now you can 
put your ammeter 
in series with the 
poÔ¨Ü and clamp. 
When you remove 
your Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü jumper, 
the meter will read 
the current draw 
from the battery. 
Here, 61 milliamps 
is juÔ¨Ü a little too 
much for comfort.

Alarms
Aermarket alarms are notorious 
for sucking even healthy, fully charged 
batteries dry within a few days. If you 
have any non-faory alarms, it‚Äôs the Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü 
thing you should check. Be aware that 
there may be more than one conneion 
to the car‚Äôs elerical syÔ¨Üem, and some 
aermarket inÔ¨Üallers may use, ahem, 
non-industry standard splicing tech-
niques. So you may have to simply follow 
the alarm wires to see where they go. 
More expensive alarms tend to be less 
problematic, but maybe that‚Äôs because 
more expensive alarms are inÔ¨Üalled by 
better, higher-paid technicians. 
Stereos
OEM Ô¨Üereos are usually not prob-
lematic. Aermarket Ô¨Üereos, the kind 
with giant, Ô¨Ånned boxes and their own 
Ô¨Ånger-thick wires direly wired to the 
battery, can be. With a power lead 
bypassing the car‚Äôs elerical syÔ¨Üem, 
they go into Ô¨Üandby mode, waiting for 
the main radio head unit to tell them to 
wake up. In Ô¨Üandby, they‚Äôll draw only a 
milliamp or three. If they fail to go into 
Ô¨Üandby, or if the DIP switches on the 
amp are set incorrely, they can draw 
as much as several hundred milliamps, 
even though they‚Äôre not producing any 
aual noise. Or music.

little as 10 mA residual drain. Others, 
probably high-end cars with lots of high-
end gadgets, will draw more. An impor-
tant note: Some devices, like alarms 
and automatic-dimming lights, will draw 
subÔ¨Üantial amounts up to 20 minutes 
aer they‚Äôre deaivated. So if the read-
ing is high, wait a few minutes to see if 
it changes. 
You‚Äôve determined you have exces-
sive current draw from the battery. Now 
you have to Ô¨Ågure out where. If it‚Äôs not 
obvious, like the trunk light not going 
oÔ¨Ä, you have to get methodical. You can 
throw caution to the wind and Ô¨Üart pull-
ing fuses one at a time, until you see the 
excess drain drop oÔ¨Ä. JuÔ¨Ü be careful to 
get them back into the right socket.
Once you‚Äôve determined the high-
draw circuit, there Ô¨Üill may be a half-
dozen loads, each individually innocu-
ous but colleively sucking the lifeblood 
out of your battery. 
To zero in on that circuit or circuits, 
Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü reconne the battery ground, tak-
ing care to maintain continuity through 
the jumpers until the clamp is making 
good conta. en remove the oÔ¨Äend-
ing fuse and use the leads of the multi-
meter to jumper the fuse terminals. I‚Äôve 
got a set of dummy fuses‚Äîall three 
sizes of blade-style and the old-
fashioned glass ones‚Äîwith attached 
leads that make this part simple. Next, 
with the help of the schematic diagram, 
disconne each device on the circuit‚Äî
one at a time‚Äîand check the meter. 
When the milliamp reading drops pre-
cipitously, you‚Äôve found the problem. It 
could be anything, but in my experience, 
the following are the moÔ¨Ü common. 
3. Got a light in the 
glovebox? Maybe 
it‚Äôs not turning oÔ¨Ä. 
Pop open the door 
and see if the bulb 
is hot, but don‚Äôt 
burn your Ô¨Ångers. 
Perhaps the trunk 
light Ô¨Üays lit. You 
might need to get 
into the trunk and 
have someone you 
truÔ¨Ü close you in to 
see if it‚Äôs going out. 
Or juÔ¨Ü touch the 
bulb to see if it‚Äôs 
hot. (e Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü way  
is more fun.) 
4. Once we 
narrowed the 
parasitic drain 
down to a single 
circuit, we used this 
teÔ¨Ü cable, which 
plugs in to the fuse 
box (grahamtool 
.com) to patch our 
ammeter in to the 
circuit. Disconne, 
remove or turn oÔ¨Ä 
all the loads on the 
circuit one at a time 
until you identify 
the culprit. 
Lots of new cars are available 
with proximity keys. ey‚Äôre a 
great convenience‚Äîall you 
need to do is walk up to your 
locked car with the key in 
your pocket or purse. As you 
approach the door, the locks 
pop open automatically. 
Plunk yourself in the seat 
and, with the key Ô¨Üill in your 
pocket, thumb the Ô¨Üarter 
button and drive away.
Guess how these things 
work. ere‚Äôs a radio receiver 
that continuously liÔ¨Üens for 
the key‚Äôs frequency. When 
the receiver hears a signal at 
its assigned frequency, it 
wakes up to see if the key is 
the one that matches the 
car. at draws more current 
for a minute or two, until the 
receiver abandons the 
possibility that it‚Äôs about to 
unlock the door for maÔ¨Üer. 
is might be an issue if you 
leave the car parked for 
many weeks without Ô¨Üarting 
it. Imagine the confusion of a 
car parked near the elevator 
door in a busy parking 
Ô¨Üruure. Every proximity 
key that walks paÔ¨Ü makes it 
sit up and beg, draining your 
battery for a few minutes. 
Soon, dead battery. 
is issue is even more 
profound in the case of 
hybrids like the Toyota Prius. 
e key receiver operates on 
12 volts, as do moÔ¨Ü of the 
accessories. More 
importantly, the 12-volt 
battery operates the main 
computer that controls 
everything else, like the door 
locks. e Prius Ô¨Üarter, 
however, operates oÔ¨Ä the 
280-volt traion battery‚Äî
but the main computer has 
to be powered up for 
anything to happen. Since it 
doesn‚Äôt have to Ô¨Üart the 
engine, the 12-volt battery of 
the Prius is very small, 38 
ampere-hours. So while a 
64-ampere-hour battery in a 
normal car can laÔ¨Ü for 
weeks of a proximity receiver 
checking for the right key, 
the Prius battery can run too 
low within a few days. 
Bottom line: Turn oÔ¨Ä the 
proximity-key funion, from 
the Prius‚Äôs eleronic 
dashboard, whenever  
you‚Äôre parking it longer  
than overnight. It might be 
possible to do this on other 
vehicles as well. Check the 
owner‚Äôs manual.

Stubborn 
German
A
A lot of German cars use that 
same 17-mm Allen-hex drain plug, 
and they can require some persuading. 
This plug is steel. It‚Äôs screwed into an 
aluminum-magnesium-alloy transmis-
sion case with tapered pipe threads. 
After a few years of marinating in road 
salt and mud, electrolysis can weld the 
two dissimilar metals together. I‚Äôve actu-
ally broken ratchets Ô¨Åtted with 17-mm 
hex sockets, so the first tool I usually 
reach for is my 17-mm Allen key. Slip a 
2-foot piece of pipe over that, and you 
can get most stuck plugs to move. If a 
big cheater bar isn‚Äôt enough, try heating 
the plug with a propane torch until it 
smokes. is will make the plug expand, 
faster than the highly conductive trans 
case. The asymmetrical dimensional 
change will crush the corrosion in the 
threads, releasing some pressure. Allow 
to cool, then use a cheater or a big dead-
blow hammer to tighten the plug. 
Tighten until you can just perceive 
motion. en you can (usually) unscrew 
it readily. I suggest using a dollop of 
anaerobic Teflon-based pipe-thread

sealer (the same stuÔ¨Ä you‚Äôd use on steel 
water pipe) when you reinstall the plug 
to prevent this happening again. e Tef-
lon will lubricate the threads, and the 
anaerobic gel will preclude water, salt 
and oxygen from entering the interface 
between the steel and aluminum alloy.
Tire Dilemma
My car needs four new tires but my 
budget will allow me to buy only two 
at this moment. I‚Äôll need to use the 
two beÔ¨Ü tires le over. Where should 
I inÔ¨Üall the new tires?
Don‚Äôt forget about the spare; using it 
may mean that you have to buy only 
three. Save the beÔ¨Ü of the old tires for 
the spare. 
Regardless, the proper place to 
inÔ¨Üall two new tires only is on the rear 
of the car. at‚Äôs because the tires with 
the leaÔ¨Ü tread will tend to have less 
grip on rainy days, and you‚Äôd rather 
have more grip at the rear while going 
around a corner to prevent the car from 
spinning out. It‚Äôs usually better to 
underÔ¨Üeer oÔ¨Ä the outside of a corner

something sideways or backwards. In 
fa, moÔ¨Ü tire shops won‚Äôt inÔ¨Üall new 
tires anywhere else except at the rear 
for juÔ¨Ü this reason. 
More Tire StuÔ¨Ä
I have a quick queÔ¨Üion about the 
spare tire in my car. I want to remove 
it because of weight concerns and fuel 
mileage. It would also open up more 
room for Ô¨Üorage. I keep a pump in the 
car, along with a can of Fix-A-Flat in 
case I need it. Is this more common 
nowadays, or am I being silly by taking 
it out of the car?
No surprise, many new cars don‚Äôt come 
with a spare as Ô¨Üandard equipment, for 
exaly the reasons you‚Äôve mentioned. 
And I‚Äôve done the same thing when I 
needed to take a lot of luggage or 
camping gear in my two-seater Porsche 
914. A 12-volt pump will reinÔ¨Çate a Ô¨Çat 
tire, or at leaÔ¨Ü delay a slowly leaking 
one long enough to reach civilization. I

Danger!
Having been a privileged sub-
scriber for many years and a fan for 
many decades, I‚Äôve got to say I love 
the tidbits of wisdom from PM‚Äôs 
‚ÄúTeÔ¨Ü Your DIY IQ‚Äù (March 2010). 
Would you help me with No. 17? 
Why is attaching the booÔ¨Üer 
cable‚Äôs black negative conneor to 
the negative terminal on the dead 
battery not as good as (and simpler 
than) attaching it to the dead car‚Äôs 
engine block? And what would 
happen if you used the booÔ¨Üing 
car‚Äôs engine block to ground the 
good battery‚Äôs negative ground?
For those of you who didn‚Äôt read laÔ¨Ü 
month‚Äôs Letters column I will repeat 
this, because it‚Äôs important. Eleri-
cally, there‚Äôs no real diÔ¨Äerence as to 
where the conneion is made. It‚Äôs 
purely a safety issue. I once watched 
my crew chief working on my race 
car do just that; he attached the 
black jumper from the dead battery 
to the booÔ¨Üer battery‚Äôs ground ter-
minal. A small spark ensued, which 
is normal when the laÔ¨Ü conneion 
is made. e entire top of the bat-
tery blew up with a noise like a piÔ¨Üol 
shot, spraying him and everything 
nearby with razor-sharp shards of 
plaÔ¨Üic and sulfuric acid. Hydrogen 
venting from the battery had been 
ignited by the spark.
Fortunately, he was wearing 
 safety glasses. I dragged him into 
the driveway and hosed him down 

Hoarder
I keep a 5-gallon plaÔ¨Üic fuel can of 
diesel in my garage to take with me 
on trips in my diesel pickup truck. 
e fuel is modern-grade diesel from 
a gas Ô¨Üation (not a biodiesel ). To 
date I have not needed to use it. e 
fuel is now about 2 years old. It sits 
on my cement garage Ô¨Çoor and 
during the winter the temperature is 
normally between the high 20s and 
the low 30s. On occasion the temper-
ature gets down to 10 to 12 F. Is the 
fuel okay to use, and is there 
anything I should be adding to it? 
Does the freezing temperature aÔ¨Äe 
diesel fuel? How oen should it be 
replaced, if at all?
I wouldn‚Äôt truÔ¨Ü that 2-year-old diesel in 
my truck, and you shouldn‚Äôt either. Find 
out how to dispose of it safely by calling 
your local department of public works 
or Ô¨Åre department. 
Gasoline and diesel fuel slowly 
degrade in storage. Gasoline oxidizes 
and turns to varnish, while the more vol-
atile fractions disappear. They either 
evaporate oÔ¨Ä or aually migrate through 
the plaÔ¨Üic. e varnish plugs up the fuel 
syÔ¨Üem, and the remaining heavier frac-
tions make the engine hard to Ô¨Üart.
Diesel also oxidizes, but has other 
issues as well. Small amounts of mois-
ture, inevitable even in a well-sealed 
container, will allow mold or baeria to 
grow. is will turn your emergency sup-
ply of diesel into a foul-smelling, gelati-
nous glop guaranteed to plug your Ô¨Ålter 
and jam up your injeors. ere are die-
sel additives that will slow this down, 
but why take chances? A better prac-
tice would be to fill your diesel can 
before a trip and use it up on or soon 
aer your return. Store the container 
empty and Ô¨Åll it juÔ¨Ü before you leave.
Missed the Gate
I have a 2004 Ford underbird with 
coil-on-plug ignition. I‚Äôve had several 
coils go bad and I would like to know if 
there is a way for a DIYer to diagnose 
which cylinder is misÔ¨Åring.
I have three ways:
 Start with the engine cold. Idle it for  
1 minute. The misfiring plugs will be 
much cooler. Usually you can juÔ¨Ü feel 
the exhauÔ¨Ü manifold. Or use a spray 
bottle Ô¨Ålled with plain tap water‚Äîidle 
with the garden hose before he bliÔ¨Üered 
any skin. His coveralls were covered 
with holes, and I had to repaint the front 
half of the car, both eaten by sprayed 
battery acid. Oh yeah, the  nearly new 
battery was junk.
Lesson? Make that Ô¨Ånal conneion, 
with its attendant spark, nowhere near 
the hydrogen gas normally being vented 
whenever a battery is being charged. It 
doesn‚Äôt happen very oen, but it‚Äôs easy 
to prevent.
 
Slap Me Silly
What can be done about piÔ¨Üon-slap 
noise? I have a 2001 GMC Sierra with 
the well-known clicking. e noise, 
which is very apparent at Ô¨Üartup, 
Ô¨Üarted shortly aer purchase and 
got worse as the vehicle aged. (Mine 
now has 135 K miles). e noise is a 
result of an engineering tolerance 
error, but GM sent me a letter saying 
the noise was ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù I‚Äôm sure it 
was normal because half of the 
trucks made in 2001 with the 
5.2-liter engine have this issue. 
Anyway, what can be done to prote 
the engine for the next 100 K miles?
e noise is caused by the piÔ¨Üon skirts 
literally slapping the cylinder walls 
because the clearance between the 
skirts and the cylinders is excessive. 
e only sure cure is to dismantle the 
engine, rebore the cylinders accurately 
and reassemble with new piÔ¨Üons that 
properly Ô¨Åt the bores. 
Historically, piston slap has been 
common in a lot of GM engines. On the 
other hand, your engine has been trou-
ble-free for 135,000 miles, and appar-
ently is running well and not consuming 
oil, or that would have been part of your 
complaint. My suggeÔ¨Üion is to turn the 
Ô¨Üereo up and drive it, probably for a lot 
more miles. Economically, a complete 
engine rebuild doesn‚Äôt make sense 
when the truck is Ô¨Üill running well.

the engine a little longer, until a quick 
spray on the exhauÔ¨Ü manifold turns to 
Ô¨Üeam, except near the misÔ¨Åring cylin-
der, where it will Ô¨Üay wet. If the exhauÔ¨Ü 
manifold is not readily visible under all 
those parts, try one of the following.
 If the Check Engine light is on, you 
can scan a trouble code that will tell 
you which cylinder is misÔ¨Åring. e code 
will be P030x, where x equals the num-
ber of the misÔ¨Åring cylinder. Or if it‚Äôs 
P0300, it‚Äôs a random misÔ¨Åre that can‚Äôt 
be attributed to any particular cylinder. 
Needless to say, you‚Äôll need to buy or 
borrow a scan tool or at leaÔ¨Ü a code 
reader to do this. Of course, this won‚Äôt 
tell you if the coil is the problem or not, 
only that one or more cylinders are mis-
Ô¨Åring for some reason.
 If you swap the coils from one cylin-
der to another, the misÔ¨Åre should follow 
along if the coil is the problem. Do I 
need to mention to move only the coils, 
leaving the appropriate wires to each 
cylinder where they belong?
Flattie
I have a ‚Äò41 Ô¨Çat-head Ford V8 with the 
dual-point diÔ¨Üributor. I don‚Äôt really 
want to convert it to a 12-volt, but I 
think I would like to convert it to 
eleronic ignition. Do you have any 
idea who might make what I need, and 
do you recommend doing this? It‚Äôs 
even been suggeÔ¨Üed to me that I 
rebuild the original diÔ¨Üributor using 
one set of points.
Generally, dual-point diÔ¨Üributors were 
used because a single set of conta 
points wouldn‚Äôt carry enough current to 
feed an ignition coil without burning up 
regularly. Could be that if your ‚Äò41 sees 
service only when you‚Äôre trotting it out 
to show it, you might get away with it. A 
6-volt coil will draw twice as much cur-
rent as a 12-volt coil to supply the same 
energy to the spark plugs. Plan on set-
ting the dwell and timing frequently as 
the points erode away. 
A better solution would be to con-
vert to 12 volts or even to a hybrid 
12-volt/6-volt syÔ¨Üem, but if your intent 
is to keep the car as original as possible 
for car shows, maybe not.
Your idea of using some sort of elec-
tronic ignition is confounded by the fa 
that the car is wired for positive ground, 
not the negative ground universally 
used for automotive applications today. 
(Ford Ô¨Ånally changed over to negative 
ground in 1958.) I did some looking 
around and found an outÔ¨Åt called Per-
tronics that makes a 6-volt positive-
ground electronic- ignition module for 
Ô¨Çat-heads, but it‚Äôs not clear whether it 
would Ô¨Åt into your ‚Äò41-vintage diÔ¨Üribu-
tor. ere may be others. Furthermore, 
your diÔ¨Üributor may not be the corre 
one for your engine, as I Ô¨Ånd is oen the 
case with older, reÔ¨Üored cars. Consult 
with Pertronics or whomever you want 
to source your ignition module from to 
be sure it will work with the diÔ¨Üributor 
you aually have.

NEW SOFTWARE AND CHEAPER HARDWARE MAKE A COMPELLING CASE FOR THE
PC AS ENTERTAINMENT DEVICE. BUT SHOULD YOU BUY ONE OR BUILD YOUR OWN?  
BY GLENN DERENE AND ANTHONY VERDUCCI

plug direly into an HDTV, 
bringing oÔ¨Ñine and online  
content to the big screen.

Looking for an easier way?
cessors such as Intel‚Äôs Atom series that 
are good for everyday Web browsing 
and other common computing tasks. 
ose bargain CPUs aren‚Äôt so good at 
rendering video, however, which is why 
many low-coÔ¨Ü computers now add an 
Nvidia Ion graphics processor, which can 
output 1080p video. That Atom-Ion 
combo has begun to show up in ‚Äúnet-
top‚Äù computers as well, which are small, 
relatively cheap boxes that plug into a 
TV through an HDMI interface. ese are 
home theater PCs in a cute, new and far 
more aÔ¨Äordable package. 
How aÔ¨Äordable? Well, at press time, 
the entry-level Acer AspireRevo 1600 
was selling for as little as $200. But it‚Äôs 
not really a bargain‚Äîthe 1600 is a poor 
excuse for a computer, with only 1 GB of 
RAM, a single-core CPU and Windows 
XP as its operating syÔ¨Üem. We wanted 
cheap, but not that cheap, so we opted 
for the AspireRevo 3610, which sells for 
as little as $330. e 3610 doubles the 
RAM to 2 GB, has a dual-core Atom proc-
essor, integrated Wi-Fi, a wireless mouse 
and keyboard and runs Windows 7 
Home Premium. Additionally, its slim 
white frame is peppered with ports‚Äî
eSATA, a four-in-one card reader, six 
USBs, headphone and microphone jacks, 
an optical audio output and, of course, 
HDMI‚Äîfor maximum conneivity.
Could we do better by building our 
own machine? We Ô¨Üarted by matching 
the Acer‚Äôs main components. We found 
a $180 Zotac motherboard with the 
same Atom 330 chip and Ion GPU found 
in the oÔ¨Ä-the-shelf computer. Add in a 
Seagate 160 GB drive ($38), 2 GB of dis-
count Rendition RAM ($40), an Athena-
tech ITX form-faor case with  integrated 
power supply ($30) and a copy of Win-
dows Home Premium ($110), and we 
had essentially the same computer as 
the Acer AspireRevo 3610, only bigger, 
uglier and $68 more expensive.
Okay, that didn‚Äôt seem worth it at all, 
so we tried again with the intention of 
making a truly better home theater 
computer. is time, we kept the Zotac 
board, put it in a far nicer SilverStone 
Sugo SG05-B mini-ITX case, beefed up 
the hard drive to a 7200-rpm 500 GB 
WeÔ¨Üern Digital Caviar Blue, doubled 
the memory with 4 GB of G.Skill RAM, 
and then blew the budget all to hell with 
a Panasonic slot-load Blu-ray drive. 
followed in 2005 with Front Row, a Job-
sian take on the 10-foot UI that was also 
used in the Apple TV. e computer-as-
entertainment-device idea was compel-
ling to technophiles (after all, people 
were already migrating massive amounts 
of music to their PCs), but it was a hard 
idea for moÔ¨Ü people to swallow back 
then. Dedicating a powerful, $1000-plus 
computer solely to TV duty was Ô¨Åne for 
the super-enthusiaÔ¨Ü, but computers at 
the time had few options for video (don‚Äôt 
I already have a DVD player?), plus cable 
boxes and DVRs were becoming more 
computer-like anyway, so the computer 
as video recorder was an awkward Ô¨Åt. 
What a diÔ¨Äerence a few years can 
make. e price of a new computer has 
plunged so that a few hundred dollars is 
all that‚Äôs required to get up and running. 
Also, there has been an explosion of 
video content available online, and a 
full-Ô¨Çedged computer is the easieÔ¨Ü way 
to get it to your HDTV.
But what do you really get for the 
money if you go out and buy a media 
PC? Besides, even if you want such a 
machine, how hard could it be to juÔ¨Ü 
build one yourself‚Äîgetting more perfor-
mance for the same inveÔ¨Üment? We‚Äôve 
been wondering about this recently, so 
we tried it both ways, creating our own 
media-ready computer, and then slap-
ping down some plaÔ¨Üic to acquire one 
ready-made. 
Comparing CoÔ¨Üs
The innovation that has enabled 
dirt-cheap PCs is the dirt-cheap proces-
sor. With the ascendancy of the netbook 
in the paÔ¨Ü few years, chipmakers have 
rolled out hyper-eÔ¨Écient, low-coÔ¨Ü pro- 
1. For a home theater PC, Ô¨Üart with a  
small motherboard with an HDMI output. 
Many mini-ITX-format boards come with the 
processors pre-inÔ¨Üalled, which cuts down 
prep work. JuÔ¨Ü snap in memory modules 
and the board is ready for the case.
2. If your case comes with an internal 
power supply (as opposed to an external 
power brick), make sure it has a fan for 
extra cooling. Screw your motherboard 
into the case before locking down other 
components.
3. DIY cases allow you to be Ô¨Çexible  
about what components you use. We  
built in a slot-load Blu-ray player and a  
500 GB hard drive.

e 10-Minute PC Proje


ality of an entertainment PC, both com-
puters did an equally admirable job of 
playing stutter-free video, streaming 
NetÔ¨Çix movies and pumping out music 
through our home theater syÔ¨Üem.
Whatever route you take, we  Ô¨Ürongly 
suggeÔ¨Ü a few modiÔ¨Åcations: FirÔ¨Ü, don‚Äôt 
rely upon a mouse and keyboard (even if 
they‚Äôre wireless) to control your televi-
sion PC. Spring for a Media Center 
remote control. You can get a cheap one 
for under $25, or you can buy the Star 
Trek‚ÄìÔ¨Üyle Lenovo Multimedia Keyboard 
and Remote √ºbercontroller for $60. 
ese remotes are completely plug-and-
play and require no soware. And they 
make the Media Center‚Äôs 10-foot UI a far 
more browsable experience.
Which brings us to one Ô¨Ånal sugges-
tion. Don‚Äôt use Windows Media Center 
at all. Instead, install either XBMC or 
Boxee. Both soware suites, which are 
free to download, search your local drive 
and network for media, then display it in 
an easy-to-search way. Boxee, which is 
built on the XBMC framework, also 
reaches out to video and audio ‚Äúchan-
nels‚Äù on the Web. XBMC in its native 
format is more Ô¨Çexible and cuÔ¨Üomiz-
able, but Boxee gets major points for 
ease of use. Both are light-years better 
than the Windows-native media UI. FC
Total price: $742‚Äîmore than double 
the AspireRevo 3610‚Äôs. 
At leaÔ¨Ü it didn‚Äôt coÔ¨Ü much in terms 
of human eÔ¨Äort. Building these small 
mini-ITX rigs is a far simpler aÔ¨Äair than 
their larger ATX counterparts. Since the 
CPU, heat sink and GPU are all pre-
mounted to the motherboard, moÔ¨Ü of 
the hard work is done for you. Every-
thing can be assembled with a single 
screwdriver within 10 minutes. e lon-
geÔ¨Ü Ô¨Üretch of the proje was the half-
hour we spent staring at the screen 
watching Windows inÔ¨Üall.
Performance Showdown 
So did our extra horsepower make 
a diÔ¨Äerence? It certainly made the oper-
ating system work faster. The zippy 
drive and extra RAM in our home-built 
rig gave Windows speedier boot times 
and made basic performance snappier 
and more responsive, but none of our 
improvements could help with tasks 
that Ô¨Ürain the Atom processor. InÔ¨Üall-
ing soware, for example, was a slow 
and creaky proposition.
But, to Ô¨Üep back for a moment, who 
cares about computing performance? 
e point of these machines is to play 
and Ô¨Üream HD video on a big, glorious 
TV screen. And both computers did a 
marvelous job playing movie files, 
including challenging 15 GB, high-
bitrate .mkv Ô¨Åles, which essentially are 
Blu-ray-quality compressed video. How-
ever, both machines also choked and 
sputtered occasionally when Ô¨Üreaming 
HD video from hulu.com. Apparently the 
Flash-based online site presents 
 another insurmountable Ô¨Ürain to the 
Atom CPU, and the GPU can‚Äôt seem to 
pick up the slack.
Our rig certainly beats the Acer 
when it comes to playing Blu-ray discs, 
since the AspireRevo comes with no 
disc drive at all. But juÔ¨Ü as we Ô¨Üarted 
tapping our feet to a little viory dance, 
we found that newegg.com sells an 
Asus external Blu-ray drive for $150, 
which would bring that funionality to 
the AspireRevo and Ô¨Üill coÔ¨Ü $262 less 
than our creation. Nuts!
It‚Äôs worth noting, however, that Blu-
ray players aren‚Äôt juÔ¨Ü a plug-and-play 
proposition for any home theater rig. 
For the time being, Blu-ray discs don‚Äôt 
play natively in Windows (although it is 
rumored that this might change). So 
you‚Äôll need software such as Corel‚Äôs 
WinDVD or CyberLink PowerDVD 10. 
Expe to pay at leaÔ¨Ü $50. 
ere‚Äôs also another potential video 
hang-up to prepare for. The codecs 
(plug-in soware used by video playback 
programs such as Quicktime and Win-
dows Media Player to decode media 
Ô¨Åles) required to play many video for-
mats aren‚Äôt natively built into Windows. 
You can download them one by one, or 
you can save yourself a lot of searching 
by downloading the free K-Lite Codec 
Pack from download.com. 
Was It Worth It? 
We‚Äôre tinkerers, but we have to 
admit it‚Äôs pretty hard to make the case 
for building your own home theater PC. 
Our build has space for extra drives and 
a separate graphics card if we wanted 
to do gaming, but that would certainly 
Ô¨Ürain the low-powered CPU. Plus, any-
one looking for Ô¨Üorage capacity beyond 
the AspireRevo‚Äòs 160 GB drive can 
always plug in an external drive.
When it comes to the core funion-

Apple is promoting the idea that the 
iPad‚Äôs 3G data access is ‚Äúunlocked.‚Äù 
Does that mean I can just pop my cellphone‚Äôs 
SIM card into it and surf away without paying 
for another data plan?
by Seth Porges
Because the 
Apple iPad 
uses the 
smaller micro 
SIM format, 
moÔ¨Ü people 
can‚Äôt insert 
their phone‚Äôs 
SIM card.
Micro

When sending e-mails to Gmail accounts, don‚Äôt be afraid to drop the period.  
If somebody‚Äôs address is john.doe@gmail.com, an e-mail sent to  
johndoe@gmail.com (or any other address that‚Äôs identical, save for  
the placement of periods) will reach him just the same.
e Truth Behind 
the ‚ÄúUnlocked‚Äù iPad
A 
Probably not. Yes, the iPad is 
technically ‚Äúunlocked‚Äù‚Äîmeaning 
it can use any compatible SIM (or Sub-
scriber Identity Module) card to get 
online, instead of one tied to a particu-
lar carrier. But actually inserting your 
phone‚Äôs SIM card into the device? Well, 
that‚Äôs likely to be a bit like cramming a 
jigsaw piece into the wrong hole. 
e problem: Unlike virtually every 
phone sold in the United States, the 
iPad uses a new type of SIM card called 
a micro SIM. is card, which is about 
half the size of the ubiquitous mini SIM 
that powers most GSM phones, was 
engineered to allow phone manufaur-
ers to build smaller devices and has 
been used in a number of phones in 
other parts of the world. 
It‚Äôs a surprising choice for the iPad‚Äî
that device is so large that the few milli-
meters of space saved by the smaller 
slot probably doesn‚Äôt make a big diÔ¨Äer-
ence and, in the U.S., micro-SIM- 
compatible phones are virtually nonex-
istent. But the format was likely 
appealing to Apple and AT&T for one 
key reason: Its obscurity makes it 
impossible for moÔ¨Ü people to pop in 
their own SIM card. In effect, the 
‚Äúunlocked‚Äù iPad is more locked to 
AT&T‚Äôs network than any phone on the 
market‚Äîwhile a typical locked phone 
can be unlocked by a tech-savvy hacker, 
no amount of hacking is going to make 
a large card Ô¨Åt into a tiny slot. 
However, the fa that phone manu-
faurers currently choose not to use 
micro SIM cards doesn‚Äôt mean they 
won‚Äôt in the future. And the iPad could 
be juÔ¨Ü the kind of high-proÔ¨Åle device 
needed to spur other manufaurers to 
adopt the smaller format. Keep an eye 
out for companies to begin selling pre-

Considering the risk of injury upon

would happen if Corliss went into a 
100-mph tumble on the landing strip‚Äî
the experts assessing Corliss‚Äôs plans 
are skeptical. ‚ÄúTheoretically, if he got 
everything just right and his Ô¨Çight path 
was perfect and there was no wind, he 
could do it, but the probability is low,‚Äù 
says Albert I. King, chairman of the bio-
medical engineering department at 
Wayne State University, which studies 
human survivability in car crashes. ‚ÄúI 
say, don‚Äôt do it.‚Äù Former Hollywood 
stuntman turned aerospace technolo-
gist Roy Haggard has consulted with 
Corliss on the landing ramp‚Äôs design, 
and even he has concerns. Corliss 
plans to use a sequence of weather-type 
balloons to provide visual cues to the 
top of the landing ramp (see page 84), 
but Haggard questions whether the 
balloons would be stable enough to 
provide precision guidance. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs 
like trying to shoot a sniper riÔ¨Çe using 
balloons for sights,‚Äù he says.
To be fair, most of Corliss‚Äôs BASE 
jumping exploits‚Äîdouble backflip 
through the center of the Eiffel Tower, 
anyone?‚Äîwould never have been 
greenlit by the risk-assessment crowd. 
The real Achilles‚Äô heel of the Wingsuit 
Landing Project, arguably, is not safety 
but cost. Haggard says the landing 
ramp could be easily engineered and 
built; the problem is that it would cost 
at least $3 million, quite possibly a 
prohibitive amount to raise even from 
reality-television producers eager to 
broadcast the spectacle.
The most obvious alternative 
would be to simply build a landing 
strip on a suitably steep mountain-
side‚Äîor skip the strip altogether and

land on snow. Corliss, how-
ever, says it would be difÔ¨Å-
cult to ensure that the land-
ing surface would be 
uniformly smooth as 
needed for safety; worse, he 
would have no option to 
bail out and deploy the 
chute if his approach was 
off. Only a ramp would give 
him complete control.
But other would-be 
record breakers have 
cooked up different meth-
ods that might enable them 
to land without a chute. A 
wingsuit manufacturer in 
South Africa is developing a 
design that would allow a 
chuteless pilot to land on 
his feet, no landing strip 
required. Jii-Wings‚Äô Inte-
grated Glide And Landing 
System (IGALS) calls for a 
larger than normal wing-
suit, capable of a 4:1 glide 
ratio that the pilot can drop 
below just before landing, a 
position that allows him to 
execute an aeronautical 
maneuver known as a Ô¨Çare, 
lifting upward and shedding speed dra-
matically just before reaching the 
ground. ‚ÄúI think for one to say one has 
landed a wingsuit without a parachute, 
it should be the design of the suit, and 
not the environment in which one 
lands, that enables the landing,‚Äù 
designer Maria von Egidy says. 
The IGALS approach, though, has 
not yet been tested with people jump-
ing from planes. Even if it proves via-
ble, Corliss sees it as a variation on 
something that has already been done, 
namely, landing in a hang glider. Being 
original (or ‚Äúforcing evolution,‚Äù as he 
describes it) is vital to Corliss. ‚ÄúWhat 
makes human beings so special is that 
we don‚Äôt evolve through morphing our 
bodies, we evolve through our minds,‚Äù 
Corliss says. ‚ÄúWe create technologies 
that allow us to do things like breathe 
underwater, Ô¨Çy in the sky and land on 
the ground.‚Äù
A couple of days after my Ô¨Årst visit, I 
stopped by Corliss‚Äôs house again, just 
as he was returning from the first 
meeting with his parole 
officer. At the time of the 
attempted leap from the 
Empire State Building, 
BASE jumping wasn‚Äôt ille-
gal in New York City, so the 
only charge prosecutors 
could get to stick was a con-
viction for misdemeanor 
reckless endangerment‚Äî
for struggling with the 
security guards who tried to 
stop him. He was sentenced 
in January 2009 to three 
years‚Äô probation and 100 
hours of community service 
(which he has Ô¨Ånished).
Fear and physical agony 
never clipped the bird-
man‚Äôs wings, but the legal 
system just might. Since 
BASE jumping is strongly 
discouraged in the U.S., 
international travel is 
essential. But the proba-
tion ofÔ¨Åcer told Corliss he 
would need to get a letter 
from the judge okaying  
any travel. 
Corliss was upbeat, 
though. He was sure the 
judge would give him the green light 
to continue earning his livelihood 
through projects like the wingsuit 
landing or a television program about 
swimming with predators. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been 
diving with sharks for 16 years,‚Äù Corl-
iss says. ‚ÄúName a big, nasty species 
that everyone‚Äôs petrified of, and I‚Äôve 
played with them. I‚Äôve tickled them. 
I‚Äôve hugged them.‚Äù 
Corliss‚Äôs speech is as over-the-top 
as his stunts; taking his statements at 
face value can be difficult. He must 
have read the skepticism on my face 
because he Ô¨Åddled with his iPhone for 
a minute and then shoved it at me. 
‚ÄúHere, look, this is me petting a 12-foot 
great white shark.‚Äù
The picture on the screen showed 
exactly what he said it did. 
I sighed and said the only thing one 
could. ‚ÄúDude, you‚Äôre nuts.‚Äù
He smiled enigmatically. ‚ÄúAm I?‚Äù 
The day before had been his birthday; 
for him, more than almost anyone 
else, reaching it was a noteworthy 
achievement. He was 33.

stream of demand at this wattage 
requires industrial-capacity transform-
ers and is more proÔ¨Åtable for businesses 
already paying commercial electricity 
rates. As you wait for the two cars ahead 
of you to juice up, you see an attendant 
brave the 100-plus-degree heat to tape a 
paper sign over the kiosk‚Äôs price-per-
kwh display. Fast charging already runs 
10 times what you pay off-peak at home. 
As of right now, legal or not, the price of 
an emergency charge just tripled to $30.
A public-minded Samaritan might 
realize the grid is already reaching its 
breaking point, head back to work and 
ask for a ride home or to the nearest Zip-
car. Naturally, you drive to the fast char-
ger and, in 20 minutes, suck almost as 
much electricity into your car as the 
average house consumes in a day.

to bring down grids around the country 
simply because of increased demand. 
A more realistic threat lies in the 
uneven distribution of GEV ownership. 
Just as hybrids like the Toyota Prius 
tend to show up more commonly in 
certain types of neighborhoods, experts 
expect a clustering effect for plug- 
in vehicles. Tease apart these demo-
graphic pockets and you might Ô¨Ånd a 
concentration of liberal, environmen-
tally conscious types, or simply cost-
conscious drivers who live 30 to 40 
miles from the nearest city. In some 
areas, such as Austin,  Texas; Chicago; 
and along the West Coast, it‚Äôs likely 
that multiple GEVs will soon be pulling 
into garages on the same street.
Even if you assume that Level 3 fast 
chargers will be rare, and that the own-
ers of public chargers will allow utili-
ties to remotely disable or delay charg-
ing with load-control signals, the 
majority of Level 2 chargers will remain 
in the hands of individual GEV owners. 
Some will likely agree to load control, 
and most will charge during the cheap-
est, off-peak hours. But some home 
chargers will come on at exactly the 
wrong time, in all the wrong, highly 
clustered places.
At 6 pm, you make it home, and 
become part of the problem. There are 
reports of transformers going down in 
L.A. If the power goes out overnight, 
you could be on an even longer fast-
charger line tomorrow, assuming it 
hasn‚Äôt been actively shut down. So you 
disable the off-peak charging mode 
and start tanking up immediately. And 
since the default rate of charge is the 
maximum, your home charger is sud-
denly draining 19 kw of electricity, 
almost four times your normal draw.
Within 15 minutes, two other drivers 
on your street are doing the same. In  
the typical neighborhood, each trans-
former supplies power to five to 10 
houses. And typically, this circuit‚Äôs 
GEVs draw 3 to 6 kw apiece. Tonight,  
it‚Äôs not the capacity of the transformer 
that matters, anyway. ‚ÄúTransformers  
are designed to run up to 50 percent 
above capacity for short periods,‚Äù says 
Philip Gott, director for automotive 
consulting at IHS Global Insight, a 
Massachusetts- based forecasting Ô¨Årm. 
‚ÄúAs long as you allow a transformer to 
cool down at night, it can run like that 
for 20, 30 years.‚Äù But Gott notes that 
too many GEVs charging at night would

mean those transformers 
won‚Äôt get their off-peak cool-
down. Add a heat storm, with 
temperatures dropping only 
slightly overnight, and the 
stage is set for a scattered but signiÔ¨Å-
cant infrastructure meltdown.

goes dark. Your mobile phone Ô¨Çashes 
on‚Äîit‚Äôs an alert from the garage charger 
that the vehicle‚Äôs battery has stopped 
charging at 81 percent. Across South-
ern California, in neighborhoods 
where GEVs are popular, and in some 
urban areas where not a single vehicle 
is plugged into the grid, another hand-
ful of transformers has blown. There 
are plenty of GEV owners whose lights 
are still on, customers who agreed to 
load-control intervention by their util-
ity. And in Burbank, there‚Äôs a pilot pro-
gram of pure EVs that are actually serv-
ing as distributed backup batteries, 
pushing power back into the house 
and out into the local grid. This is 
called vehicle-to-grid charging, or V2G, 
and in 2020, it‚Äôs still a decade or more 
from widespread adoption. 
What‚Äôs far more common in 2020 is 
V2H charging, or vehicle-to-home. 
Instead of wheeling a carbon-
monoxide- belching generator out into 
the backyard for emergency power, GEV 
owners can simply draw electricity from 
the vehicle‚Äôs battery. Provided the home 
is wired for backup power, and depend-
ing on the size of the home and the 
capacity of the battery, V2H charging 
could be a seamless backup system for 
the entire house, or a direct power 
source, via plenty of extension cords, 
for speciÔ¨Åc air conditioners, refrigera-
tors and other appliances.
Your home is fully V2H-ready, and 
with your partially charged EV plugged 
into the house, the lights, the fridge and 
the a/c are all back on. The news is 
reporting blackouts across the state. In 
the days and weeks to come, some ana-
lysts will claim that electric cars played a 
part, however small. Residential char-
gers and fast-charging stations that 
didn‚Äôt sign up for load control will be 
singled out. The utilities will push even 
harder to get customers in line, adjust-
ing electricity rates to further penalize 
peak charging and reward off-peak.
 The smart grid will be seen as a suc-
cess and a failure, depending on whom 
you ask. On a national level, there‚Äôs no 
single solution to be gleaned, just as 
there‚Äôs no single problem that led to 
California‚Äôs blackouts‚ÄîGEV adoption 
will be different in every state, and each 
grid will handle electric vehicles differ-
ently. The only clear lesson is that the 
transition from liquid fuel to battery 
cells has not been as smooth or as pain-
less as promised.
For tonight, as midnight approaches, 
and the power rolls on and off across 
California, your home is running just 
Ô¨Åne. The car‚Äôs battery will be wiped out 
by morning, but no matter. That‚Äôs 
what the six-year-old gas guzzler sit-
ting next to it is for.
