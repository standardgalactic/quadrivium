Why Traffic Engineering?
Why Traffic Engineering?
• Requirements for Traffic Engineering Over 
MPLS - RFC 2702
– A major goal of Internet Traffic Engineering is to 
facilitate efficient and reliable network operations 
while simultaneously optimizing network resource 
utilization and traffic performance. Traffic Engineering 
has become an indispensable function in many large 
Autonomous Systems because of the high cost of 
network assets and the commercial and competitive 
nature of the Internet. These factors emphasize the 
need for maximal operational efficiency.

What problem does TE solve?
What problem does TE solve?
• Efficient use of all available bandwidth
• Help ensure the desired path through the 
network
• Eliminate or postpone the need for adding 
additional physical links

IGP Issues (OSPF and ISIS)
IGP Issues (OSPF and ISIS)
• IGPs use the least cost path which may 
not be the only path available
• Manipulating the IGP metrics will only 
move the problem to other links
• Manipulating the IGP metrics doesn’t scale
• IGP metrics lack the granularity needed to 
truly make use of all available bandwidth
• IGPs use destination based routing to 
determine the path through the network

Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)
Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)
• RSVP was originally designed as a means for a 
host to determine if there is enough bandwidth 
available for a particular traffic flow
• RSVP never took off due to the fact it was a 
host-to-host protocol
• Used for establishing LSPs in MPLS networks 
• RSVP-TE provides support for 
– Explicit path configuration
– Path numbering
– Route Recording

Traffic Engineering Path Calculation
Traffic Engineering Path Calculation
• Constrained-Based Shortest Path First 
(CSPF) 
– Bandwidth
– Affinity
– Administrative weight
– Explicitly defined path
• Path calculation can also be done offline

Traffic Engineering and IGP
Traffic Engineering and IGP
• TE uses existing link-state routing protocols, 
OSPF and ISIS, to disseminate the topology 
information
– OSPF uses Type 10 (area-local) Opaque LSAs
– ISIS uses new TLVs
• Normally IGP carries the information about itself, 
neighbors, and cost to the neighbors
• TE adds information regarding available 
bandwidth to the neighbors
– show mpls traffic-eng topology

Enabling Basic IGP Support for TE
Enabling Basic IGP Support for TE
• Support for TE needs to be enabled under 
the routing process for OSPF and IS-IS
• OSPF
– mpls traffic-eng area <area-id>
– mpls traffic-eng router-id <router-id>
• IS-IS
– metric-style wide
– mpls traffic-eng {level-1 | level-2}
– mpls traffic-eng router-id <router-id>

• Dynamic
– The router will calculate the best path for the tunnel
– Uses the configured constraints such and bandwidth 
and other attributes
• Explicit
– User defined path for the tunnel
– Uses the configured constraints such and bandwidth 
and other attributes
• More than one path option can be configured for 
a tunnel
• Dynamic and Explicit can be used for the same 
tunnel
• TE tunnels are unidirectional

General Configuration Steps for All Routers
General Configuration Steps for All Routers
•
Ensure CEF is enabled
•
Enable TE support for the IGP protocol being used
•
Enable MPLS TE Tunnels on each router in the path using the mpls
traffic-eng tunnels global configuration command
•
Enable MPLS TE Tunnels on each interface in the path using the 
mpls traffic-eng tunnels interface level command
•
Specify the amount of reservable bandwidth under the interfaces
– Use the ip rsvp bandwidth <total kbps> <per-flow kbps> command 
to specify the available bandwidth
– If the ip rsvp bandwidth command is entered without specifying an 
amount, the available bandwidth will be 75% of the interface's 
bandwidth
– Note that the bandwidth could be different in each direction of the TE 
tunnel
– If the ip rsvp bandwidth command is not used the reservable
bandwidth is set to 0 although TE signaling will still occur on the 
interface
